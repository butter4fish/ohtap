Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, could you gave us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Okay. My full name is Robert Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown]. As I mentioned earlier, when I came to Chicago [Illinois], it was Bobby Brown. The teacher changed it to Robert Brown. And this is fine for me, you know. It's just--one name is as good as another. My older brother [Irving Brown], his nickname was Tex Brown, so I think just naturally, everyone would start calling me Buck Brown. So, that's what it is now. You look in the high school yearbook, and you see Robert "Buck" Brown. That's only because somebody dared me to do it. But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, well, tell me now, back in those days, there were--cowboys were very popular.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I just imagine now--I mean, I don't know, but were you named for a particular cowboy 'cause I know there was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Buck Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess my brother was named for Tex Ritter--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or what have you. You know, everybody was named after a cowboy or something.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that's something that would escape today's generation 'cause they don't have cowboy heroes anymore.
Speaker 2: Oh, no. You, I'd had to be Medium Heavy D [ph.] or (laughter) somewhere along those lines. You know, I have trouble dealing with contemporary life, and the folks that, people that, that's why so much of my work--I'll, I'll go back in history to a time that--a little sane and slower, what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February the 3rd, 1936 at--in the suburbs of Morrison, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: The suburbs?
Speaker 2: That's what you call a dirt farm nowadays.
Speaker 1: Okay. And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a cartoonist, slash artist, slash illustrator, slash golf hustler.
Speaker 1: We have to talk about that at some point, golf hustler. And would you say a humorist as well, I suppose?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess, I'm a humorist. Well, I tend to think of a humorist as somebody that creates humor. I tried doing that in that initial point of my career. I would be at home with my wife [Mary Ellen Brown] and my little baby asleep. And I would be communing with Hugh Hefner. I said, let me see this kid what--how much he knows about this or that. And I'd do something real--I mean, from way out. And he's up, up north [in Chicago, Illinois] drinking Pepsi and eating fried chicken. And he would get it and buy it. And so, in one case, let me describe it to you. It was an interior of an airline and a guy sitting there eating. There's no caption. But if he looked at the level, his, his water glass is like this. So, you take a glass of water and, and incline it to, you know, where the level of water is like that, it means the sucker is going down. So, Hef- Hefner used to love that stuff until, I think, '79 [1979], a whole bunch of people from Playboy were killed out, out of O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois]. So, well, neither one of us finds too much to laugh about airplane crashes now.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm-up. And the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Food? Oh hey, just lay it out there. I love it. And favorite food? I guess it's something basic as fried chicken 'cause that's what I sneak and eat when I can. The reason that I say it, it's, it's really such a broad question because I was born during the Depression [Great Depression], spent my boyhood during World War II [WWII], you could never get enough to eat, you know. "We got to save this. We need this to fight them Germans and stuff." So, there was all--if, if they, ever an opportunity came along for me to eat something, I'll do it. I got another friend that, we'd go to parties and they'd ask us to eat last to make sure that everyone else got something to eat. And I, you know, I love shrimp, I love steak, what have you, but I guess chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gospel bird.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color? Well, for my paintings, you can see blue is one of my favorite, but that just happens like that. I'm working on a, but in, in terms of what? Material, clothing?
Speaker 1: Anything, your favorite color, period?
Speaker 2: Well, I always wanted a silver Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz], but the God to, not favored me with a--I have a silver Avalon out there so. Yeah, it, it's kind of open.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, blue is not your favorite color, but you do use a lot of blue. I see it. I'm looking around at different shades of blue.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Seems to be everywhere (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was my attempt to get away from using a lot of black, and then you know what? In recent years, I say, oh, wait a minute. You know, everything is so damn blue, darn blue, I will go back to using black, you know, for low values and stuff.
Story_ID: 365150
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring, summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like days like today when it's cold and freezing outside because I don't have to worry about somebody else playing golf, and I'm, you know, when I'm not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't stand bright sunshiny days in the winter. You know, if, if it's gonna be cold, let it be miserable and nasty and stuff. I'll stay in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My wife [Mary Ellen Brown], she can't understand that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: We've gone to Jamaica a few times. I used to illustrate for a recording company. And so, they would have me come along on the cruises for the Jazz Cruise. And we'd, we'd go to the Virgin Islands where it was beautiful, Jamaica. I remember one year they wouldn't, wouldn't dock at Jamaica. They said the seas were too rough, but I think that other, the, the boat didn't want to pay the docking fees or something. So, anyway, we, we just waved bye bye. My, my son [Robert Brown III] got married in Jamaica so, yeah, we've always liked that and--
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm trying to think because behind you, there's a book that my daughter [Tracy Brown Hill] gave me for Christmas about Buck Brown's [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown] favorite sayings ['Buck-isms']. And I can't really say that they're my favorite saying 'cause I'm just like an ole vacuum cleaner. You throw something out, I'll pick it up and just store it, and then play it back at an appropriate time. So, you know, I'm, I'm not worried about being original. It's just like the airplane joke with Hefner [Hugh Hefner]. People calling up saying, "What the hell is going down?" Said, "Well, you got to look at the, the level." "Oh, yeah, we, we know that," you know, they're looking. By the fact that I'm a new cartoonist, black cartoonist, they figure they had to be, you know, earth-shaking or something. So, let me see, now you, the guys I play poker with, we, we have so many off, off-beat expressions, you know, like must is, 'cause must ain't don't sound right. And you, another one, I'm, you know, but I, I don't have one that I could pinned down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not fit for a video at any rate.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: 'Cause, see, I used to work for CTA [Chicago Transit Authority], so I know most of the dirty words. (Laughter) I've been called them.
Story_ID: 365151
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history. I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family, and your father's side of the family, but we'll start with your mother's side. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, when I was born, it was Doris Brown, D-O-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: What's her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Lemmings, so she claims.
Speaker 1: L-E-M-M-I-N-G-S?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. Doris Lemmings Brown. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 16, 1919. And--
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Same suburb of Morrison [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay. Right now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was an area there that was populated totally by Browns, so it was called Browntown [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those who weren't named Brown, they were related to us anyhow.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, tell me, like what do you know about that side of the family? How far back, first of all, can you trace them? Can you trace them back to the pre-Civil War time, or they go back that far?
Speaker 2: No, no. When 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] came out, you know, and everybody hastened to go back and document their, you know, family trees and stuff, man, I never heard so much BS in my life. It was like, you know, you were in Russia asking for state secrets. Say, "What time is it?" "Well, do you want, a.m. or p.m.?" And I said, "No, I'm just trying to get this knowledge together 'cause one day, my kids are going to ask me--well, so and so, so and so, so and so." I could never, you know, they, they could never just take themselves out of it and just, you know, lay down, chronologically, when, when stuff happen. So, as far as I know, we originally came from Alabama somewhere, but I can't chisel that in stone anywhere.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, where does that information come from?
Speaker 2: Grandma [Susie Lemmings] P.S.'d [post scripted] that on a letter one time. She wrote me a letter talking about, you know, how the crops are doing and, you know, who's sick and blah, blah. And then, at the end, she puts P.S., your great-grandfather came from Alabama. I'm saying, what the hell is this? You know, and no other information than that. And I went to my uncle's funeral down there. And after the wake, everybody came back to the house, and I'm fixing something to eat and they got to talking. And they said, "Oh, yeah, that must have been a time that Fate [Brown's father, Michael Brown] and Doc [Brown's paternal uncle, Doc Brown (ph.)] killed that boy holding so and so." And I said, "What?" You know, so it, it's like a black soap opera down there.
Speaker 1: So, it could have been if someone killed, your great-grandfather came up because somebody was killed, or was accused of it or something or--
Speaker 2: No, this, this, this ca- happened when I was a little bambino.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it's a different story altogether?
Speaker 2: Diff- different stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, if you turn the camera off, and asked to be something, so and so, so and so, like where, where the john is. I'd tell you, you know, with, with no fear or anything like that, but down there, there were so many little cliques, superstitions, or what have you. After a while, I say, "Hey, you, you kids are going to have to go for yourself."
Story_ID: 365152
Speaker 1: I know you worked, you worked for Playboy and you were a cartoonist. But Alex Haley actually wrote for Playboy, too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you ever meet him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and did you know Alex Haley?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. He--just, just before 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] came out, they had a little doohickey for him up there. So, everybody hung around, and I got to meet him, a beautiful gentleman. One day, my wife [Mary Ellen Brown] were, and I were in the doctor's office. And I picked up a Reader's Digest, and it had a, you know, a condensation of 'Roots.' And so, I'm sitting there reading, and I said what, oh, man. So, I say, "Hey, man, you know, you really are going to do well with this, I believe." And, in fact, I was supposed to do a cartoon for him, never got around to it. Procra- procrastination will kill you boy, I tell you, but he was from Tennessee somewhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he sure was.
Speaker 2: They tell me that all creative people are from Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Well, all the ones from Tennessee are (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, yeah. Now, one thing I must caution you on, his--it might sound like I do a lot of whining and complaining and stuff. It's all part of being creative, I think. You know, if I do fifty cartoons or paintings, and what have you, and I go have a gallery open, I could sell forty-nine of them, and then want to sit around and kill somebody 'cause I didn't sell the fiftieth one. It's just the nature of things because there's a little article, another one of my friends signed, uh, wrote about me and I sound like Joe Williams singing the blues, you know. So, but I guess it, it comes with the territory.
Story_ID: 365153
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents [Susie Lemmings and Mitchell Lemmings]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess my grandmother--
Speaker 1: On your mother's [Doris Lemmings Brown] side, we're still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) mother's side raised me when, when mom split. As, as I say, she, she was married very young. She was seventeen when I was born. I have a sister [Willa Brown White] two years older than myself, and a brother [Irving Brown] four years older than myself, so I'd put her in a very--
Speaker 1: Yeah, about twelve or thirteen, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was back during the Depression [Great Depression]. I don't know, I can't explain it, or what have you. I, you know, and I've always wanted to ask her, why didn't the old man react when she came back, you know? Nowadays, that'd be 'cause for a drive-by, even though all they had was a mule.
Story_ID: 365154
Speaker 1: What was your father's full name? Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, Fate, F-A-T-E, Brown, B-R-O-W-N [Michael Brown].
Speaker 1: Now, that's an unusual middle name, Fate, F-A-T-E?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what everybody called him.
Speaker 1: Fate Brown.
Speaker 2: Hey, that was neat, man. When I was in high school, I'd always tell the young ladies, Fate brought us together, you know. They didn't go for it, but (laughter).
Speaker 1: It worked, oh, well. And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was June of 1895, I think. And I'm assuming that he's, he was from the suburbs of Morrison [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now he was considerably older than your mother [Doris Lemmings Brown]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about twenty-five years, huh, or so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He--
Speaker 1: Well, not twenty- well, let's see, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And all I have to do to spoil a beautiful day is call up mom and say something about dad. "Oh, he was this, he was that." You know, I can't dispute that, but he's still my dad, you know. He got gassed or something during World War I [WWI], and this affected his health and, periodically, he would get paralyzed and stuff like that. That's what they say he died from.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had mustard gas in those days or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, all the types of--
Speaker 1: Lethal nerve gas.
Speaker 2: They had everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was over there in the middle of it, but he never--
Speaker 1: So, did he, did he spend a lot of times in the Veterans Administration [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] hospitals, and that sort of thing, or did he go to--
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge. He worked on the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], and that's the only thing I can remember. I remember, I remember him, you know, very vaguely. I remember being out walking with him one night. And we, we got over by my maternal grandmother--my paternal grandmother's [Anna Brown] house, and he heard this noise, and we stopped and listen. And it was a, a goose that had been missing. She'd gone off the regular farm, and went over in the woods and built a nest and stuff. That's one of my strongest memory other than being paddled a few times.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is that the end of that story (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, hey, this is sixty-seven some years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, no, hey, I, I can't hold forth on it that much. But I, I remember him, and everybody was kind of, you know, not terrorized, but you had to look sharp around him and stuff.
Story_ID: 365155
Speaker 1: What do you know about his [Brown's father, Michael Brown] side of the family? Can you trace the Browns back to before slavery was over, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no. You--see, being a young person, you couldn't talk to the older people, like my grandmother's husband [Mitchell Brown]. You had to be very careful what you said to him for, for the simple reason that he was older than me. You know, it's like, my kids would come home, and they tell me about something that they learned in school. Man, I--that would just turn me on, you know, I'd say, "Hey, great." Consequently, I'd hear something that he was, you know, relating to, and I'd say, "But I read in school." "Don't tell me, I know, you know, so and so, so and so." All I could do is just swallow my lip, but one good thing about time, it makes you older. I graduated from high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] and went down there to spend the summer. And, man, there was nothing he could say to me, and especially, you know, the way he had treated me in terms of just us having a conversation. And he was talking about something, that he'd been to a city. I said--oh, he said, he had been to Harrisburg [Illinois]. I said, "Pennsylvania?" He said, "No, Illinois." I said, "Man, that ain't no city. You know, that's, that's just a little hick, uh, well, that's where the trains slowed down." And I was kind of ugly in my treatment for the simple fact that he, he didn't--I don't think treated me as if I knew anything. So, but that's the way that it was then.
Speaker 1: So, was it, is it correct to generalize that older people, in those days, did not have the same education as their children had--a little sensitive about it, yeah.
Speaker 2: I, well, they might be, you know, it's just like when I was in school. They didn't say, "Well, get that education, boy, because you can be president of the United States, or you can get this job," or they used to say, you know, get, get that education, or what have you, but you look into the future. You didn't see anything. Hell, I think I was in college before I ever found out the reason, a rationale behind the Civil War. Nobody talked about it in school or what have you. I think one of my first cartoons I sold to Esquire was a, a tent in the Civil War, and all these Confederate generals sitting around. And one of them was saying, "Civil, Civil War. I thought it was a silver war (laughter)," and that's drawing from my own experiences.
Story_ID: 365156
Speaker 1: What did they do for a living? What did both sides of the family do for the--what did your mother's [Doris Lemmings Brown] side do for a living first?
Speaker 2: They lived on a farm a little piece, and I think they had about twenty acres or so. And I remember I'd have to go out in the field during the summertime when the, when the lady came from the welfare place--I guess that she's giving them some kind of money to help pay, pay for the taxes. And it'd be hard to explain, you know, what this blond good (unclear) youth was doing there. So, I'd just split until she was gone. And my father [Michael Brown] had a farm, which my older brothers ran. I had two stepbrothers, and I think they were something like thirteen and fifteen, and something like that, but they took care while poppa was gone off to the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration].
Story_ID: 365157
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories from either side of the family? Did they tell stories about, you know, growing up, and about life in that part of Tennessee?
Speaker 2: They would, well, you know, like sometimes my grandfather would start telling ghost story. And I'd say, "Hold, hold up, wait, wait, wait." I'd get undressed, undressed, and hop in bed, and get under the cover. Okay, okay, you know, it's like Bill Cosby would say, "Scare me, scare me, scare me." And my older brother, I always wanted to query him in terms about this haint that got after him. He was driving a wagon out in the new, new ground. That's where they chop all the trees down. They call it new ground. And I, you know, later reasoned that he was covering up a fact that he was supposed to have done something that day, and didn't do it, or didn't do it right, or what have you. So, everybody always talked about the haint that Howard [ph.] saw.
Speaker 1: A haint is a, is a--
Speaker 2: A ghost (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A ghost, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, or, or a thing, you know.
Speaker 1: A thing, some supernatural thing, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it might have been a spaceman that looked, whose flying saucer crashed in the woods some. I don't know, but I think he was just jiving. But, so those beliefs are very, very strong, you know. Matter of fact, my con- conception of life down there, and life in the city was so far apart, you know. You leave there and you, you come up North and put your shoes back on and, you know, start living properly. Whereas down South, you get on down there, you take your shoes off, and you go out chasing the chickens, and what have you. And I was very shocked, I think it was like 1970. My grandmother was living next to my aunt in McMinnville, Tennessee. And I was telling them, my kids, "Come on, let's go, and let's let grandma get to bed." And as we're going out, I heard the TV say, "And now, here's Johnny [Johnny Carson]." And I said, grandma listening to 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson']?
Story_ID: 365380
Speaker 1: You said your [paternal] grandmother [Anna Mitchell] was very disciplined. Before you had a battery, and would only listen to the radio twice a day?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And went--
Speaker 2: And, you know, me and my, my little childhood wisdom had to be talking under my breath--I guess, sitting up here with a big greasy battery and stuff. "Why don't you get electricity?" And so, and I heard her say, she wouldn't have her house wired for electricity because the lightning would strike the wires, and it would come down, and set the house on fire. I said, "I never heard of a bigger bunch of BS in my life." Now, old, old brilliant Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown], that's all I hear about it is lighting striking the wires, and going down and setting the house on fire. Well, sorry, grandma.
Story_ID: 365381
Speaker 1: Oh, I was telling you earlier when, when the haint story that would always get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, your brother's [Howard (ph.)] haints, yeah, that one, yeah.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, this, this--I, I really don't, I can't identify who it was, but somebody was sick. And somebody went up to see about him. And they got there and everything was dark. It was dark outside, it was dark inside. And so, they struck a match to light this candle, and something blew it out. And, you know, I'm under the cover saying, "Oh Lord." And they struck another match, lit the candle, and something blew it out. Say, "I'm going to light one more match, and if he blew this out, I'm gone," and, sure enough, blew it out. And I said, "Oh, Lord," and, you know, being young and frightened, this scared me to death. It was always something like that.
Speaker 2: Look, it's real dark out in the woods, right, out in the country?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's where they invented dark. We went up to McMinnville [Tennessee] to a fair, you know, a little jive thing what, you'd hit the bottle, throw a ball at the bottles and stuff. And I, I went out with my uncle who had a truck. He had so many kids, that's what he needed to carry them in. But we was asking him, having a good time, said, "Well, we'd better go." So, we drive back with the wind blowing and stuff like that. And we get about a third of a mile from my grandma's house, and I'm waiting for him to turn to go up by grandma's house. And he's--my uncle hollers, hollers back, "See you later, Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown]." I said, "What?" I had to get down on that road. I could just barely see the difference between the dust and the, the weeds and stuff, and knowing that I, I was in a rattlesnake valley. And so, I'm tiptoeing, and that wasn't good enough, so I finally broke into a full run, and didn't stop until I got to grandma's house. That gave me a, a description of terror, very, very dark. And yet, you know, we'd be sitting on a front bench some nights, and you hear somebody coming out of the road whistling, you know, singing, and--
Speaker 2: Can you see much by moonlight in that kind of situation? When the moon is full, can you see anything?
Speaker 1: I imagine you can. And if you got things on your mind, other than, you know, snakes, I, you know, I know they get snakes down there 'cause I remember as a--well, before I came to Chicago [Illinois], we were going to a festival at Vervilla [Tennessee] I think the name of it is. And I was riding on the mule with my dad [Michael Brown], and Uncle Doc [Doc Brown (ph.)] had his mule and stuff like that. And everybody stopped, and here's the biggest rattlesnake you'd ever want to see in the middle of the road. So, my uncle got off his mule and got a big, big pole, and did him in. Now, this is early in the morning. And on the way back that night, the, the rattlesnake's tail was still switching, you know, I guess, the nerves and impulses and stuff. And that has always terrified me. That land down here is, is laying fallow, you know. Everybody got up and went north and stuff like that, and moved to town, or what have you. As a matter of fact, we went through there last year. And I counted five or six deer. And I'd never seen deer down there at any time. So, you know, it's, it's going back a while. So, I know, I know the rattlesnakes are going, "Come here, Bobby, come here, come here (laughter)."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 365382
Speaker 1: Your mother [Doris Lemmings Brown] now, she--I suppose she didn't get a chance to finish school, since she got married so young?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And did, did she get a chance to go to the eighth grade or something at least, or did they have--what kind of school did they have?
Speaker 2: They had a one-room school so, you know, all the classes were held there. And the fact that my, my dad [Michael Brown] worked on the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], in order for my brothers to go to school, they had to carry me with them to, to school. And, well, you know, I wasn't a wild, misbehaved child or anything. I was just sitting there watching what the others are doing. I turned around to the blackboard, and here's a guy drawing a truck. And, to me, you know, being out in the wilderness, I didn't know anything about drawing, or what have you. To me, he was making a truck 'cause I identified what he was doing. I said, oh oh, I couldn't wait to do it or learn how. And so, and so, I guess that's where my fascination with art and drawing came about.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: About (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were too young to start school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I, I didn't start school when I came to Chicago [Illinois] for a while, so I was very young--three or four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Story_ID: 365383
Speaker 1: Did your father [Michael Brown] have a chance to go to school himself?
Speaker 2: I couldn't tell you that.
Speaker 1: But he, he did, he did fight in the war--World War I [WWI]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he--he was overseas if he was gassed, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. What, it, what, in France or--
Speaker 2: I really couldn't tell you that, but he was fighting, got gassed. My Uncle Doc [Doc Brown (ph.)] was on permanent KP [kitchen police] in Georgia. He could tell you more about the war than my dad could.
Speaker 1: Really? Okay.
Speaker 2: You know how, how, how guys like that, they sit around the barbershop and know everything, and so, so. I just assume that he was over in Germany, 'cause I really don't know. And I used to see his helmet lying out in the yard, and he put grain in it and chickens would eat out of it. And one day I said, I'd like to get that helmet. But I went back and I couldn't, I didn't see it lying around the yard, and I, not, I knew not to go messing in the underbrush and stuff so.
Speaker 1: So, he didn't make a big deal out of the [U.S. military] service at all then, like I suppose?
Speaker 2: No. Well, I guess, after you've been through it, you don't feel like making a big deal out of it. I was, you know, I, I went to the service and all I know is it kind of saved my life really, as a young person, but I don't, you know.
Story_ID: 365384
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My father's [Michael Brown] farm was about a third of a mile away from where my mom [Doris Lemmings Brown] was raised. So, I guess they, you know, observed around in the area and stuff like that. And then, my mom says that her mother [Susie Lemmings] used to see her dancing around and everything and said, you know, dancing made you fast, so that's why she let, let the marriage take place. I guess my dad was supposed to have been a good catch 'cause he had about fifteen acres, so I, I really don't know. All I know is, you know, it's, it's a grease job for my mom.
Speaker 1: Meaning that--
Speaker 2: Well, she, hey, she was only twelve, if that. I, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Did she come from a large family herself?
Speaker 2: No, just her and her sister. And my grandma was a wonderful person, so, you know, I, I never dwelt on it in terms of what, what was the motivation or what have you.
Speaker 1: But at some point, your mother left, right, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she ran away after she had me.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about why she ran away? Did she--
Speaker 2: My dad. And, you know, no nonsense, mean, just mean person, I guess. Just think about it. If you growing up at that time, you didn't have anything going your way or what have you, or you couldn't apply yourself to a job and get to the top. And so, I, I really don't know. But I can imagine what I'd be like, you know, in a situation like that. So, and, you know, I, I can't talk to her about it, and stuff like that, 'cause she's, you know, she just doesn't want to hear it.
Speaker 1: So, she, she was gone for a--how long was she gone and did she stay?
Speaker 2: After I had to figure that out, maybe about a year or so, I, I guess. Like I say, if my old man was such a tough nut to crack, how come he didn't get ugly when she came down with her new husband? I don't know. He came home and she'd put, put us in our little sailor suits, and threw us in the back of the big Buick, and we took off. When he gets home, he gets the word. He jumps on the mule and rides him, trying to catch up. I don't, you know, the desperation, what have you. And all I could think about it was this big hambuggy [ph.] that they promised to buy me. I didn't--
Speaker 1: A hambuggy?
Speaker 2: Well, hey, I never had a hamburger or anything (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh, I see, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: So, and my brother [Irving Brown], he was old enough to know what was going down with him, his dish of tea, when he was crying and all I was thinking about was a hambuggy so, you know, two different perspective.
Speaker 1: So, they took you out in a buggy, you said, a, a--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --a car?
Speaker 2: A Buick.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a Buick, okay, all right, Buick, okay.
Speaker 2: My stepfather always had a big long car. He may had no food on the table, but he had that long car. And I, I don't know how far we drove before we stopped. But, you know, like I say, it's a, and why he didn't jump on my grandmother 'cause, you know, she was aiding and abetting. I don't know.
Story_ID: 365385
Speaker 1: Your mother [Doris Lemmings Brown] took you and your brother [Irving Brown] to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what neighborhood did you live in?
Speaker 2: Several. That was back in the day when you shared an apartment with people. He, he, you know, the shotgun-type apartments. Oh, we'd have one room, and we stayed there for a while, and I guess for one reason or the other, we'd have to move on. And, finally, we found a permanent residence on 60th [Street] and Langley [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay, 60th and Langley. Well, tell us about the neighborhood, and what it was like growing on over there. What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up there?
Speaker 2: On Langley? Actually, it was quite nice because we didn't have any gangs or anything like that. Nobody was on drugs. All we was interested in was having fun, you know, chasing each other, or we'd go to a cowboy movie, and we'd come back and get wood and carve our little gun and (unclear). On Sunday nights, we could have a little amateur hour on the front porch of one guy's building. There was, there was no need for us to act ugly or anything like that. We had a good school. In fact, I lived about one hundred yards from the school, Austin Oliver Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Joe Williams says Austin Otis Sexton, and we'd argue about that every year on the Jazz Cruise. And I went around there with my Polaroid to take a picture of it, but it just said, "A.O. Sexton." But, uh, and to the north of us was Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], and we'd go over there and play and stuff, and then 61st Street. It wasn't quite as busy as some of the other streets and stuff, so we, you know, really just had a--it was a nice, nice place to live.
Story_ID: 365386
Speaker 1: Only problem is, I used to think white folks were, you know, psychic because every time I crossed Cottage Grove [Avenue], "Get back across Cottage," say, "Now how the hell do you know I live on the other side of Cottage?" You know, there's a newspaper branch over there where, you know, you can get a job as a, delivering newspapers.
Speaker 2: It's a distribution center or sort, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. And when I failed, some student from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] said, "Why don't you get across Cottage?" See there's another guy who knows where I live, you know, not fully understanding the ramifications of my place and--
Speaker 2: That was the dividing line between black and white in--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The area--what is that, Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] or Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois], or what have you, was beautiful because the owners of the building lived there in the building. And every day, they'd come out and they'd polish the brass handles and the brass kick plates and stuff. And I'd, I'd just took my time to loading the papers 'cause you hated to go home. It was so beautiful, you know. I mean, people like, you know, get ugly with you sometime, but they, they never actually bothered you.
Speaker 2: So, you delivered in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] or in Woodlawn?
Speaker 1: Just, Woodlawn.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And one year, we discovered the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois], and, man, just blew me away. Of course, in order to get over there, we had to walk in the middle of the Midway, you know, by the, right there, come in front of the Fountain of Time [Lorado Taft], you know, we walked in the middle. That way, we could see the enemy if he wanted to chase us home. They only caught us one time and put the (unclear) makers on our backs and stuff, but we'd go to the museum, and it was like another world.
Speaker 2: And it was free in those days, I believe, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, free and just the, the fantastic exhibits that they had. I didn't care too much for the, when you got the fetusism [sic.] stuff like that. You know, I didn't, didn't want to get into that. Say, but the coal mine, and just, just hanging out there, the trains and all that, the planes that they have. It was a magic time. You had the livery stables right down the street from me, and the people that rent horses, and go through Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois]. Now, I hear that--well, the reason they stopped was because the kids were throwing rocks at the horses, and all kinds of peekaboo-type things.
Story_ID: 365387
Speaker 1: What was your personality like when you were growing up? It was just you and your brother [Irving Brown], right, you and your brother, your stepfather, and your mother [Doris Lemmings Brown]. Is that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I have a sister [Willa Brown White], but she wouldn't--when my mom and dad [Michael Brown] split, my aunt from Detroit [Michigan] came down and got her 'cause, you know, having a little girl out there in the rough environs wasn't too cool. But, yeah, so it was just me and my brother trying to make it. And me and my brother, we had our little odds and ends 'cause I, I didn't know too much about washing up and stuff like that. And so, he said, "Don't tell anybody I'm your brother (laughter)." I said, "I wasn't, I wasn't thinking about it anyway, you know." And I, I remember the radio stores, that no matter what we were doing, we'd quit around 3:15, so we could go home and hear our stories. And then, I guess about an hour or so later, after, oh, we'd come right back on out with, you know, the, the, just letting that stuff go through your mind, you know, once you hear on the radio, you could envision it more than, you know, with a camera, or a movie, or something like that.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite story?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess 'The Lone Ranger.' He came on last, close to six o'clock, I think. 'Sergeant Preston of the Yukon' ['Challenge of the Yukon'; 'Sergeant Preston of the Yukon'], 'Captain Midnight.' Well, you know, none of them were longer than fifteen minutes, except 'Lone Ranger' was half an hour, I think. But, you know, I, I could just see so vividly, the stuff that they were talking about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know. It was vivid to me, you know, it might have been less than what they had been shooting for in mind.
Story_ID: 365388
Speaker 1: By the time, time you got in Chicago [Illinois], had you been drawing pictures?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, after, I, I never got over seeing that guy doing the truck on the blackboard. He was, he was not drawing. He was making a truck. So then, when I got in grade school, they had these big sheets of paper with wood pulp and stuff in it, so you could, you know, have that to draw and stuff. And I, I don't know, whether, I had just more perception than other kids, or abilities, or what, but I started getting a little notoriety, you know, Robert Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown] can draw, you know. And, well, everybody went through it, but when the time came for people to move on and get into other things, you know--sports, hanging out, what have you--I was still drawing. And once I got that, you know, that label, man--well, I, I could see, I could see what it was doing for me as a person. You know, I was somebody. Hey, he can draw. And so, I continued to improve and everything. The only thing is when I got into the seventh grade, the teachers would come get me to do murals and posters, and what have you and, you know, couldn't tell me anything. I was king of the walk. And until the last day of class, "All right, children, grab your books. Everybody go to room so and so, so and so. You're going to seven or eight, everybody, except Robert Brown." I said, "What?" You know, I think in the books, they call that being crestfallen--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --or lachrymose, or what have you. And I finally got nerve and I said, "Teacher, why would you do that? I did just much as Willie Jones [ph.] and Leon Moore [ph.]." She said, "Yes, Robert, but we expected more of you." Now, how in the '40s [1940s] are you going to tell a little black kid that she expected more of me? And I said, "What the hell it--am I supposed to be doing?" You know, I have, I have no visions of a future. I hear, I heard somebody this morning that's talking about a career. I said, I've never (cough), thought about a career. I'm thinking about growing up, getting a factory job, and having a couple of kids, you know, and that was it. So, as a result of this, I moved out to Princeton Park [Princeton Park Homes, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Well, how--the family moved out there or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, will you be still at, so they didn't let you graduate from eighth grade?
Speaker 2: No, I graduated from the eighth grade--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --but I had to do the time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you had to do summer school or something or--
Speaker 2: No, I just did an extra semester.
Speaker 1: Okay, just did, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I moved, moved out to Princeton Park. So, one day, I'm emptying the garbage. And the kid from a couple of doors down came out and he said, "You from Chicago?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "Did you go to Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "Did you have a teacher named Ms. Hudson [ph.]?" And I said, "Yeah, you mean a little bulldog-faced B-I-T-C-H?" And he looked very strange. He said, "Yeah, that's my aunt." Well, she was the one that had flunked me. So, I said, "Well, when I start killing, I just got one more to go." And to this day, he's my best friend. She, she's always tried to, "Well, you know, we, we expected this and that." You know, it's just like me expecting you to run a couple of touchdowns in football games Sunday. You're not a football player, you're not thinking about doing that, but I'm expecting you to do it, so it was rough.
Story_ID: 365167
Speaker 1: Okay so, your parents [Doris Lemmings Brown and Brown's stepfather] moved to Princeton Park [Princeton Park Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  Now, this, what year would this be?  This would--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950].  And said you went to--now, where did you go to high school?  What--you, several different ones right? At first, or at least a couple (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went, I went to, I initially started out at Tilden [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And soon as I got there, I saw that wasn't going to work.  And see, once, once again, by not having knowledge of what people expect of you, I took a written exam, you know, that you give an incoming freshman.  And so, I come in a class a couple of days later.  And they say, "Oh, I want the following students to get your books, and go to room so and so, so and so."  And so, they call out these kids' names, and Robert Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown].  So, you know, I walk alone, balancing this five hundred pound question mark on my head.  And I go in this room, and then, all these kids are doing x equals so and so, so and so, and so on.  They had sent me from just regular math to an algebra class, three meek- three weeks after the class had started.  I was in there two weeks before I found out what it was that everybody was doing 'cause, you know, not, not, noticed, was speaking up for myself.  So, I managed to eke out a passing grade from that.  And I transferred, with Tilden's help, to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And I got over there and had Algebra 102, or whatever it was.  There were so many beautiful women over there that I just, you know, told the teacher, I'm flunking right now, don't wait 'til (unclear) (laughter).  Not having a whole bunch of study habits and what have you, but I was astute enough to pick up, you know, most of the--my stuff without having to study.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was you, what did you, what course of study did you follow, or college prep, or did you, was it a technical, I mean, a--
Speaker 2: No, it was just a regular high school prep because when I got to be a senior, they sent a little mimeographed slip around asking, are you going to college and, if so, which one?  And in big block letters, I wrote, "Ha, ha, ha," you, you know, you weren't going to catch me going to college.  All my life, I had been struggling and scuffling.  So, I was going avoid, avoid that the whole way.  So, yeah, just a four- four-year college--I mean, not college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just a general course of the school--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --studying, huh, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: So, did you take that higher math in high school, the algebra, and the other stuff?
Speaker 2: I took it for a second time.  As I told you, I was, I knew I was going to flunk, you know, I'm looking at all these stars and stuff, and you know, beautiful women, whereas before, all I saw was these big guys, you know, no nonsense, and stuff like that.  So, I flunked that, but I finally got through algebra the second time.  I had a algebra teacher.  Her claim to fame was that she tried out for the Follies [Ziegfeld Follies] with Ginger Rogers way back, you know, when everybody else was fighting the Indians [Native Americans].  And so, my--
Speaker 1: Now, this is a white woman, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but that was her claim to fame and, you know, I, I wouldn't destroy that for the world.  So, I was able to gear all my classes around to art.  You know, I'm cackling, you know, I'm in art, so on, and so, so, and I don't have to do this, I don't have to do it.  So, I didn't, I didn't take geometry, or trig [trigonometry], or calculus, you know.  And so, that's where I, I can remember, two plus two equal four.  And I had an art teacher who wasn't crazy about humor.  Well, you see, in grade school [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], we'd start doing humor-type stuff, you know, everybody used to draw.  But then a kid came, transferred in, and he started doing funny stuff.  Say, hey, you know, I'm going to try doing funny stuff.  And that's how, you know, it started.  And I, I began to look at everything with, with a humor slant.
Story_ID: 365168
Speaker 1: At the time, were you a fan of comic books and the comic strips in the newspaper?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I was.  But, you know, like now when I meet kids, they want me to draw, you know, some hero or some, or some superhero, or something like that.  And I say, "Well, hey, you can do on your own time.  I don't do that, I do this."  So, I, and didn't have anything.  We were just, you know, start creating a little humor on our own.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of Commodore [Chester Commodore] in the Defender [Chicago Defender], or any of the other black comic book artists--I mean, or comic artists?
Speaker 2: Later on, you know, I got to know Commodore and stuff but--
Speaker 1: Right.  George Lee [George L. Lee], I think, was in Chicago [Illinois], too, I think.  He was, he used to draw, 'Your History' ['Your History: From Beginning of Time to the Present'] by J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I wasn't necessarily slanted toward graphic art at the time.
Speaker 1: So, what was your subject matter when you would draw when you were a kid in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], and what kind of stuff did you draw?
Speaker 2: I remember I did, did a painting of the Los Angeles Rams playing football.  And then, I remember some people driving through a cornfield.  It was like a commercial, you know, (singing) "See the USA," you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If it was popular, it must have been hip, you know, so I would do that.
Speaker 1: Now, you didn't just sketch and doodle stuff on your own?  I mean, you know, did you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some--
Speaker 1: --like fun stuff to draw?  I know kids that draw.  They just draw all the time, usually, draw all kind of stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in some cases, but I was to the point where I'm trying to emulate somebody else's style and stuff.  And my art teacher, Mr. Johnson [ph.], was just more or less karate-chopped me away from that.  Or if I did anything humorous, you know, he would, oh, bad dog, bad dog.  So, it was, I had no great directions, you know, I just had the, had the talent.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have any exposure to the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois], or any of that group over there?  I know they were, they had some training over there at one point--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --for youth and, you know?
Speaker 2: I think I was in a contest and, and South Side Community Art Center rings a bell.  But Mr. Johnson, my art teacher, was, was the judge.  And the number one was--what's the, what's the sculptor, famous black sculptor?
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt?
Speaker 2: Richard Hunt won first place.  Somebody else won second place.  And I think I got third place, which was a twenty-five dollar bond.  So, I wouldn't say to Mr. Johnson was, you know, favoring us, but that twenty-five dollar bond sure came in handy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Richard Hunt in school with you, or was he in another school?
Speaker 2: No, he was in school, he was a year ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I ran into him one day down in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois].  And I said, "Richard, let's make a (unclear) a, a trade.  So, you give me one of your rejects, and I'll give you one of mine (laughter)."  And I don't know if he stopped laughing, said--I was at a cartoon cavalcade in, I guess it was Chattanooga [Tennessee], something like that.  And they had a little thing for, you know, a little cocktail thing at the museum.  So, I'm standing there, fat-mouthing, and I looked at this piece of sculpture.  And it's cascading over, over the railing at the top, and then it coming up from bottom, and they meet, meeting, and doing stuff.  And I said, "Man, that looks like Richard Hunt."  And it was (unclear) say, "Well, I'll find out who it is."  And he came back, he said, "Sure enough, it's Richard Hunt."
Speaker 1: He gets a lot of commissions, doesn't he?
Speaker 2: Oh, hey, tell me about it, tell me about it.  He got the one at Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois], Playboy.  It worked--well, hey, the man's good.  Don't make me a bad person, I'm only a lowly cartoonist, but he's good.
Story_ID: 365169
Speaker 1: There was a, so there's other talent in the school when you were there other than yourself, other people with art talent.
Speaker 2: I guess, you know, I don't know when they manifested it, or what have you.  I, hell, I didn't even know I had talent until I got into the war camps and stuff.  Now, the one thing that burns me up--I, I mean, mean, talk about failures and stuff like that.  I got some strange people who are in the Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] hall of fame.  My name has never been mentioned, so that I, I guess they kind of keep me at my feet on a level surface.  In fact, I didn't even know they had one, beside the point.  But how do you know when, when you're famous or what have you, I don't know.  But I didn't start making strides until I got in the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Now, I just want to ask you another question about Englewood before we get you out of high school.  Did you know a [HistoryMaker] LeRoy Winbush at all?
Speaker 2: I know the man.
Speaker 1: He was older than you, and came out long--I mean, long before you did, but he was an Englewood grad.
Speaker 2: I know the man.
Speaker 1: And he's a, you know, well-known artist in Chicago [Illinois] doing all kind of things, yeah.  But, yeah, LeRoy Winbush.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking about Pyburn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jerome Pyburn and the stuff like that?
Speaker 1: Now, Winbush, I think he just, he's basically retired now, but he used to make displays, and he's also, he's a painter, a photographer.  I don't know what he doesn't do.  And he scuba dives, too.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He's down in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois].  And he was, he looks something like, he looks like, something like you, to tell the truth.  But he's much older.  But, yeah, he's, but he's, yeah, he used to do big displays for Carson Pirie Scott [Carson Pirie Scott and Co.; Carson's] and, or Marshall Field's [Marshall Field and Company] for Christmas, and all sort of thing.  He used to put things together, big candles, and all the other stuff, wreaths and reindeer.
Speaker 2: No, I, I definitely would have known about him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But he came out before you did out of Englewood, yeah, Englewood High School.
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Englewood was the, you know, one of the good schools.  I, I went into my dean's office down in Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] to check how many hours I needed in order to graduate and stuff.  And they kept, flipped the thing over, and said, "Oh, you're one of the lucky ones."  And see, this is when you, you know, everybody was a, had a hair trigger.  I said, "What do you mean, the lucky ones?"  And I was getting ready for a confrontation.  Said, "We, you know, just noticed that the kids from Englewood and Parker [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois], Hyde Park [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and everything, they do better than kids from Marshall [Marshall High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Crane [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois], and stuff."  Well, I say, "Are you aware of all that?"  Say, "Oh, yeah," he said, "a lot of us care, so ain't much we can do about it in a lot of the cases."  Well, I said, "Oh, okay."  So, Englewood wasn't, wasn't a bad school.
Story_ID: 365170
Speaker 1: While on the subject, that you mentioned a profound interest in girls at one point, and that being a distraction.  Did that influence your art work considering your--I mean, when we think about, you know, you're gonna make your mark as a cartoonist in Playboy magazine in the future, were the seeds of art with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --a sexual content--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I always considered myself hip or clever.  I said, I'll leave that ris- risque stuff to the other guys, the big kids.  They can do that.  You know, I'll just come up with something every now and then.  Once you start getting money, your mind just goes oops, you can do anything.  So, my experience with doing full-page color cartoons for Playboy were, everything hanging out came later.  It just--I guess, I don't know if you want to call it maturation because I ain't the world's greatest draftsman or anything.  But I didn't know how to, you know, translate what I was saying at school and to anything.  You know, my idea of humor was two guys with two big noses and big feet saying something back and forth.  After you run out of those, then you gotta figure out different presentation, like I'd submit ideas.  And Hef [Hugh Hefner] would say, "Oh, put this guy over there, or turn the bed around so and so, so and so."  And I'd do it, and I said, "Oh, yeah," you know.  He knew what he wanted, he knew how to get it from you.
Speaker 1: The art director at Playboy?
Speaker 2: Hefner.
Speaker 1: Hefner, okay, Hefner, himself.
Speaker 2: Hefner has put his stamp on everything I've ever done for Playboy.  And let me say this about Mr. Hefner's time when I get my tom time in (laughter).  If you show him that you have, and the model come up out of talent, or something like that, he will let you do it, you know, just get out there on the floor.  Let me see what you got.  Your trick, the thing you have to resolve, is how do I get my stuff past the receptionist who might just be working for the day or something?  She's got a whole bunch of stuff, or somebody else, but before you get an okay on it, it's gotta come from Hefner.  And so, after all these years, he knows what I can do.  And he knows when I send in a certain idea that I'm gonna, you know, flesh it out, research it, and just do the best job I can.  But it's because he trained me like that.  He's giving me that--the carte blanche.  So, it, all the things you might hear about him might be true.  I, I can't help that.  But, you know, I think about all the things we've done together.  I know he's out there in La La Land, cackling.  I'm back here doing, doing likewise.

Speaker 1: Let me, now, when you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], had you--you said you hadn't won an art contest, but you won twenty-five dollars--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt won the thing.  And did you, were you recognized at all when you graduated as an artist?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they talk about your--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --ability at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were your prospects when you were on the verge of graduation?  What was this, 1950, uh--
Speaker 2: Four [1954].
Speaker 1: Four [1954], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you going to--well, what were you thinking about doing next?
Speaker 2: Didn't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just, you know, trying to survive.  I was on my own about then, and, you know, just like a billiard ball going from one, one corner to the next.
Speaker 1: Were you working different jobs in high school, or did you just go straight through without?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I, I bussed a whole lot of dishes at Big Bone Gus's [ph.] downtown.  The Old Barn out in Cicero [sic. Burbank, Illinois], Jerry Cluck [ph.], the owner of the Old Barn, he would give all the waiters a water glass for a little booze at the end of the night.  And so, not want to pass up any opportunity, I would bring my little Listerine bottle and my funnel, and put my booze in the bottle, and take it to school the next day.  And me and my buddies would sit up there with the Listerine bottles on the table.  And Ms. Jennie [ph.] says, "Well, you boys going to do a lot of kissing or something?"  And we just ah, ha, ha, ha, and sipping our, you know, it only takes a little capful and we eat, tore it up.  So, that was, that was my only disgrateful [sic. disgraceful] attitude in, in school.
Speaker 1: So, you just stayed out of trouble in school?
Speaker 2: Well, there was no trouble to get into as long as you left the big bruisers alone.  You know, you had these little--I think it was the daredevils who want to come around and left this school, and start a fight with somebody and stuff.  I'm trying to check out the little girl sitting up on the rock, you know, that had a big long concrete thing that they call a rock.  See, and if you had nice clothes and argyle socks, you went and sat out on the rock in style and profile, trying to impress somebody.  And now, you know, these kids run around with this big baggy pants, last, their hind parts hanging out, and the cap on backwards.  Don't even get me, started talking about that.  I'm from a different generation, but wasn't looking for any trouble.  Now, I did have some trouble from the front office at school because out, as I said before, I was living on my own.  And they could never pin me down exactly where I live 'cause you had to be in a certain district or something like that.
Speaker 1: So, you were living on your own?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that happen?  You didn't tell us how that happened.  How did you wind up living on your own?
Speaker 2: My old man, he wasn't too torn up over paying the bills, so he moved and he went, married to the next one.  So, when he got ready to move from Princeton Park [Princeton Park Homes, Chicago, Illinois], I said, I'm not going, you know, I was sixteen then, you know, had the knowledge of the world and stuff.  So, so my mom [Doris Lemmings Brown] called up my brother [Irving Brown], and he said, yeah, he would come and get me.  So, he and I, you know, moved in together on 60-, right off 63rd Street.  And then, he decided to get married.  And he fixed it up with some friends of his--67th [Street] and Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue] that I got a, a room with them.  And I was responsible for my rent and everything like that.  And it was like being reborn all over again.  I didn't get that static from home or, you know, dealing under the table, you know, all the things that I imagined that they were doing wrong, and stuff like that.  But I was on my own, and I was only sixteen.  So, some, some reason, this lady in the front office was trying to pin me down.  Meanwhile, my folks had moved to Detroit [Michigan].  So, she was trying to figure out what's going down.  And so, finally, I just said, "Ma'am, leave me alone, I'll be graduating in a month and a half.  I'll be out of your hair forever."  And she looked at me, boy, like I had just, you know, made the greatest revelation known to man.  I never heard from her again, so I, I was thankful for that.
Story_ID: 365172
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after graduation?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I went down to Tennessee to spend the summer there.  That's when I got in the confrontation--not a confrontation, I just, you know, learning to talk back to my [paternal] grandfather [Mitchell Brown] and stuff.  Yeah, I ain't gonna tell you everything.  But when September came, it's time to go back to the city.  I was waiting to go back.  And I, I finally got back to Detroit [Michigan].  And my buddy called me, and say, "Hey, man, when are you coming back to Chicago [Illinois]?"  And I said, "Man, I don't know."  I am laying up here, no dough.  So, he and his grandmother sent me ten dollars, and I went down to the Greyhound [The Greyhound Corporation; Greyhound Lines, Inc.] and bought a ticket, and had two or three dollars left, you know, in, in my jean, and came back to Chicago, and started staying with he and his family.  And I got a job packing jewelry with him.  It paid a dollar an hour.  And the way it worked out, I didn't have enough money to take a girl to the movie.  It would have stripped my budget.  So I, I said, this is not gonna work.  So, I get up early, and go out to a factory to see, you know, if I could get anything that paid more than a dollar an hour.  And they, they no longer put it in the newspaper as whites only, or colored only, or something, anything like--they could look at me and tell that I was a, a kid.  So, they said, "Are you a, a veteran?"  I said, "No."  "Are you a college graduate?"  I said, "No."  "Sorry, that's all we're hiring."  And so, I'd go and hurry, and get to my jewelry packing job.  And Christmas, Christmas is the high point, and for costume jewelry.  And so, we had to be prepared to work extra hard at that period.  So, I was working a double time and stuff like that.  And I'm thinking about all the stuff I can buy, you know, I can go down to Baskins [ph.] and (unclear), and Brooks Brothers, just what have you--oh, just go crazy.  So, finally, the rush was over.  And the guys comes around with the check.  And he brings me one check for forty dollars, and then he gives me a second check for forty dollars.  I say, "Hey, Junior [ph.], what happened to my time and a half?"  He said, "Time and a half," he said, "what, what union you belong to?"  I said, "What?"  So, that, that told me that I had to do something better.  Now, this is early January.  By January 12th, I was throwing up my hand, saying, I do, to the [U.S.] Air Force.  You know, my buddy, Wes [ph.], had told me that they were cutting out that G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], and he wanted to join the [U.S.] Coast Guard.  And I said, no, if I'm, I'm joining anything, it's going to be the Air Force, you know, 'cause they had cool uniforms and, you know, airplanes and stuff.  And that's how, that ended my, my free period when I was just on my own.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is this 1955 or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, early '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Early '55 [1955], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you leave the country, or did you, what, did you stay here?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on how you interpret it.  I went to the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas [Bexar County, Texas].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you left this county, part of the tour, another foreign part of the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to a hostile environment.  And they weren't Iraqis, they were Texans.
Story_ID: 365173
Speaker 1: Now you, you told me a story before we even, we started the formal interview about what happened to you and your buddies when you got a leave in San Antonio [Texas] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Yeah, I was, belonged to Flight 65 [ph.].  There was a bleep, bleep, bleep name for, for what they call, what they call us, Irans of 65 [ph.].  Anyway, a kid got his, his collarbone broken, stand-, he was just standing in formation.  It was always something like that.  And as I said before, the only thing we could do was march.  So, we went to drill comp, and that particular day, we were flawless, you know, 'cause I remember now, we was like all machinery.  Nobody messed up whatsoever.  Even the square worlders, they were okay.  Then we had two twin brothers, they, you know, idiots.  They would argue with anybody about that, where the world was square.  And said "No, man, it's a circle."  And they gotcha there.  They said, "You show me where there's four corners on a circle, and I'll do whatever, you know, you want to do."  They used to bring generals, colonels, politicians around to talk with this kid.  This is before the space flight and all that stuff.  And I, I just knew that the world was round.  You couldn't argue that with them.  Anyway, they weren't any problem.  So, we won drill comp, and the prize was a trip to town.  So, we said, and we'd, we'd been on the base [Lackland Air Force Base, Bexar County, Texas] there for a couple of months, so, you know, hey, we, we were ready.  And so, the next day, we got up and put on our little Parkland [ph.] uniforms and went down, and caught the bus going to town, and just as excited as we could be.  And get downtown, we get off the bus and we, we weren't looking for the Red Light District.  We were just happy young men full of life, and what have you.  There was a drugstore.  You remember they used to have the little counters in there.  We walk in, and here's four seats together at the counter.
Story_ID: 365174
Speaker 1: So, you go in there.  There are four seats.
Speaker 2: At the counter.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And we slide on to them.  And we've been there for two months, so we weren't, you know, expecting anything other than, you know, "What will you have, fellows?"  So, I said, "I'll have a--." She said, "I'm sorry, sir, we can't serve you."  I said, "What?"  "It's a Texas state law."  This wasn't just somebody from down the street, or a little homemaker decide--this is Texas speaking to us.  Then, we slunk out of there.  I, I can't remember if I was crying or what.  Little man, he was crying, and what have you.  And I was, I was just frustrated, and we went out.  And, and San Antonio [Texas] was a [U.S.] military town, so you got cadets and got officer, we, we were poor-mouthing all of them.  We wouldn't salute or anything.  Even, the first time I wear the uniform off the base [Lackland Air Force Base, Bexar County, Texas], and this is what I get?  It's un-, unbelievable.
Speaker 1: And not just the--because of individuals' prejudice, but because of Texas state law?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, I, I imagine Georgia, or Mississippi, getting shot at.  But, you know, and so, and this bullet comes from Texas.  Hey, I never, you know.  After that, I, I was, I, I had been taught, I knew.  So, we, we graduated from boot camp.  I came home, ten days' leave, and I had forecast, and I was to be stationed at Wichita Falls, Texas.  I said, "Oh, Lord, I didn't get of Texas."  So, I'm riding the train down to, you know, glum, mad, so, here's, here's a young black gentleman from Detroit [Michigan].  And he's on a train with some, some white friends of his, you know, all of us [U.S.] Air Force.  And we get down to the train station, Wichita Falls, and we had just missed the bus going out to Sheppard Air Force Base [Wichita County, Texas].  And so, we had to wait for one.  So, one of the white guys said, "Hey, I'm hungry, I'm going to have a sandwich."  And I'm, I'm just listening for, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  And Mo [ph.] say, "Yeah, I'm going to get one, too."  I said, "Oh, Lord."  So, sure enough, a couple of minutes later, we heard a guy say, "Oh, no, oh--"; the guy from behind the counter comes up, walks past them, comes all the way over to the military reservation where we're sitting.  Say, "I'm sorry fellows, I can't serve you, Texas state law."  Say, man, you know, we ain't ask you nothing, you know.  Check out the dude, and I'm calling the man names.  All he wanted to do was go in and eat, you know, just, like his friends were.  And that, that makes him a bad person.  So, yes, sir, I've been to Texas, but its moving fast since then.
Speaker 1: So, it's still reverberations of this, you said, when you see 'The Alamo' on television, right?  Did you ever see a picture of the Alamo [San Antonio, Texas] you feel?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, when they had the Alamo Bowls, so they'll, let's go out there, and beautiful San Antonio for this and that.  I've seen the Spurs [San Antonio Spurs] play.  I still remember they put me out.  You know, and if, if I'd been doing something, you know, against the law, or what have you, or ugly, or what have you, for no other reason, for being what I was, that was an education all by itself.  That knocked out, that never happened to me in Chicago [Illinois].  And people might roll their eyes and stuff.  So, yeah, but watching football game, and I guess, let's go down and, you know, enjoy this beautiful city.  All that stuff came floating back.  What little hair I had, stood on edge.  I, I could no longer, you know, watch the football game.  So, it, it lasted a long time, you know, you build scar tissue.
Story_ID: 365175
Speaker 1: Well how long were you in the [U.S.] Air Force, and what rank did you obtain, and did you have a chance to do any art?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yeah.  I was in the Air Force for three years, seven months, and twenty-eight days.  I let the hours ago.  I, I got out early to go back to school.  And I was in Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota.  And my one joy in life was to go up to group headquarters, and check on the status of my early discharge.  And the guys would say, "No, nothing yet, no, nothing yet."  So, after a couple of weeks of this, and time is drawing nigh for, you know, me to register in college, and these guys are saying, nothing yet.  I go--finally, they say, "Man, we lost your discharge."  And so, I go up to, to my orderly, Roman [ph.], I see the CO [commanding officer].  And he say, "They lost your dis--." They never heard of that.  So, he went up there, and chewed a little butt, and stuff like that.  And he, and he--I don't know whether it was racial or what, but the guys look up and see, care about to go, get out, go back to school, with all them delightful young ladies, just having fun, and they stuck out there in South Dakota.  I don't know, but I got--they rushed something through.  I got it all signed off, and squalled  my tires going out the gate.
Story_ID: 365176
Speaker 1: So, where did you head, did you head to Chicago [Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: I, I sat there for a moment at the gate.  If I turn right, that's going west to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] where my folks [Doris Lemmings Brown and Brown's stepfather] were.  And if I turn left, I was going back to Chicago.  I turned left, and came on back to Chicago 'cause, you know, hey, there's nothing for me out there.  But, yeah, I really got into art in the [U.S.] Air Force because there was so, so much stuff happening around the squadron.  So, I'd go to my room and do a little sketch of it.  And everyone would see it, and they enjoyed it in- including the, the people that, that I was drawing about.  And I couldn't get over it 'cause, you know, this is the mid-'50s [1950s].  I've told you about the stuff that transpired in Texas.  I was in Kansas City [Missouri] and South Dakota so, but all these areas were people by good ole boys, you know, like I wound up at Ellsworth Air Force Base [South Dakota].  Half them cats were from down home.  But I did some things.  I did one cartoon about the CO [commanding officer].  Here's a man that's got over 100 B-52s [Boeing B-52 Stratofortress] sitting out on, on the ramp that he's in charge of.  Each B-52 back then was like $10 million.
Speaker 1: And those are huge planes?
Speaker 2: Huge, huge, I used to spend (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Huge bombers, yeah.
Speaker 2: --stand on top, and I wanted to break into a dance 'cause it was just so big.  This man's, I won't say it was his thrill, or what have you.  He'd--when we'd have commanders' call, that's what gathered everybody together and talk about the condition, and what's going on in the Air Force and the squadron, and what have you.  He's one--one joy seemed to be messing with the brothers.  He'd wind up and say, "Well, you know, I told you I had a wise guy around here.  I tried to help him, but he wouldn't listen to me, so I jailed him."  And everybody ha, ha, ha, you know, I'm talking about five thousand airmen.  So, I happened to be pulling weekend duty.  And this very large green blackboard, you know, with the, on the rollers, when the people came to work on Monday, they, I--the one true character, caricature, that I ever did that hit the nail on the head.  I had this vulture-like colonel standing there.  And he's got his arms stretched out, and he's saying, "And so, I jailed them."  He made no other comment on that, didn't sign it either.  So, the next commanders' call, he goes through his regular spiel and say, "And there's an airman here who's gonna get his butt in a sling if he continues to draw cartoons of me."  I said, boy, I must have really got this cat.  So, commanders' call, you only have them like once a month.  So, the next commanders' call, the guys saying, "You know, what we need around here?  We need a newspaper.  We gonna need an editor.  We gonna need writers.  We're gonna need photographers.  And a cartoonist."  I said, I don't believe it.  I mean, I, like, I drove a stake through this guy's heart.  But the thing that impressed me most of the five thousand airmen, half of them good old boys, and the rest of 'em, I, I can't plumb the depth of their hearts and everything.  Nobody ratted it on me.  Nobody ate cheese, and said, "Well, you know, that Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown] can draw so," and so, you, you know, you, you begin to learn the power of the pen.  And I was able to get out of there with- without a, a gun fight.
Story_ID: 365177
Speaker 1: I was on duty one day--see, when they start up B-52s [Boeing B-52 Stratofortress], they're so big.  It costs so much to start them if there's a problem, you fix them right there on the flight line, so I had that duty one day.  And this cat's B-52 got broke.  I always like to say, he had a leak in his right-hand engine.  So, you know, I come out there, and I do like this, broke the line loose, and changed the packing, and the, the o ring seal and stuff like that, and tightened it up.  And they told him to hid it and it was fixed and, you know, I, I gave him one of these.  And my man shoved it through the firewall and took off.  I said, now, I'd love to be on 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'].  And all the years later, hoping, hoping that if he's still alive, saying, you know, this is from the cap, but you're going to jail.  But all this, all the, the, these things showed me that I had an ability, I had a talent.  I did not know how to work it necessarily.
Speaker 2: Did you work on the newsletter at the base [Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota]?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  I was going up to, to group headquarters, seeing if I can get that discharge, and get the hell on out of there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: When I--
Speaker 2: Do you think they might have been trying to find out who the cartoonist was by asking for a cartoonist for the newsletter (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, exactly what he was doing.  And, you know, and then if he found out, you know, I wasn't of his persuasion, oh, you think, Custer [George Custer] got hurt out there, you know.  They'd, they'd have another Little Bighorn [Battle of the Little Bighorn] out there.
Story_ID: 365178
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you got out, you went right to Chicago [Illinois], back to Chicago, right?
Speaker 2: Back to Chicago.  And got home, was staying with my, on my best friend's girl's family.  And I'm, I mop around for a couple of days.  And then, yeah, I got home too late to register for, for Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  So, I said, I--well, I gotta, you know, get a job.  And I went out, went downtown to this Civil Air people [Civil Air Patrol], what have you, and found out that I needed to go out to DuPage County [Illinois] to get a aviation doohickey going.  So, I said, I didn't have my car with me, so I said I'll go down to CT and A [Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)], while I'm down here to see what they're talking about.  Well, once they found out that, you know, I'd been in the service and had, you know, got an honorable discharge, and all that, blah, blah, blah, they kept me there all day, and hired me, and I started with them in a couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did you, what position did you get with CTA?
Speaker 2: Bus operator, which is the funniest job in the world.  I mean, you know, if you looking at the world objectively, there is so much humor going on in the streets.  I had to get sketch books and just, you know, jot it down.  You know, and you learn how to tell a story, you know, you, you diminish this, and extend that a little bit, and, you know, until you get a gag situation.  I mean, I wasn't recording it for posterity or anything.  And with all these big, beefy Irishmen at the, at the station--wouldn't even say good morning, or how you doing, and stuff like that.  They'd come over and see my sketchbook, and they would relate to them.  It, it was about them, too.  And they'd start laughing and carrying on and blah, blah, blah.  And so, you learn, say, well, I'll do this for so and so, and well, the older guys, they don't particularly like this, blah, blah, blah.  And the boss started borrowing my sketchbook on the weekend, you know, he'd have guests over and stuff, and it, it related to them.   And that's how I learned the art of storytelling.  You know, wasn't quite that simple.  And I had so many friends that are saying, "Oh, man, that's great, you ought to send that in."  I said, "Send it in where?"  "I don't know, but send it in."  So, okay, I had my travails also with CTA.  I come one, come in one cold wintry night, you know, to turn my money in, and get the hell on home.  I passed by the, you know, how they have these glass encased bulletin boards.  And there's a, a job offering in there, announcement.  They needed somebody in the art department downtown.  And I looked at it, I couldn't believe it.
Speaker 1: How--with CTA?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said, I don't believe this, you know, Christmas comes early--or late, whatever it was.  Well, I, I turned in my money, and I went and buzzed the door for the assistant superintendent.  And I go in and they say, "Yeah, how can I help you?"  I said, "Well, there's a job announcement out there on the bulletin board.  And I was wondering if I could have an application."  They said, "Well, how much time you got?"  I said, "I've been here about four or five months, whatever it was."  He said, "Oh, you don't have enough time and grade."  So, I understood that, you know, being from the [U.S. military] service and all that, seniority, you know, all that kind of stuff.  I said, "Okay."  And I stepped out into the night, and I thought that was it.
Story_ID: 365179
Speaker 1: Our station won an award that year for the safety record.  And so, all the biggies from downtown [Chicago, Illinois] came out for, you know, coffee and tea cakes, and what have you.  And they were, you know, laughing and singing back and forth.  And somebody said, "Oh, yeah, here's Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown].  You ought to see his sketchbook."  So, one of the guys from the art department was there.  He said, "I'll be damned."  He said, "We, we did everything we could trying to fill this job from within.  Nobody applied, and so we had to go outside the company to get it."  So, I'm saying, wait a minute.  I applied for the job back in November or December, something like that.  And Superintendent Cross [ph.] told me, I didn't have enough time and grade.  The guy said, "There's no requirement for time and grade."  So, you know, it was just, like Texas all over again, I guess.  You know, how, get, had gathered a grease job, but overall, I guess, it worked out.  You know, because I wasn't, I, I would have been making safety posters or those things that, you know, up inside.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) For the rest of your life?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So, I went back--yeah, well, I, I did a total of seven years, you know, for, for the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority].  You know, I'm telling people at cocktail parties, yeah, I worked for the CTA just temporarily.  So, and I look up and I'm one month short of five years.  So, I had to move or, you know.
Speaker 2: What was your route?  Did you have, did you have the same route most of the time?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, no.  I, I had, along Western [Avenue], nine months from Berwyn [Avenue] all the way down to 79th Street.  Then I had--my favorite was Garfield [Boulevard], you know, runs from Midway Airlines [Chicago Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] over to Michigan [Avenue], and down to--remember the London House [Chicago, Illinois], stuff like that?  So, you, you pick and choose these--wherever you could find the best run, you know.  We like the ones where we start around two something, and get off at ten, so we, you know, get ready for school the next day.  Yeah, Garfield, Western, 63rd Street, you know, that is if you, kamikaze pilot there, Ashland [Avenue].  And when I was on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois], it was Sheridan Road, Broadway [Avenue], Clark [Street].  I did them all.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.
Story_ID: 365180
Speaker 1: So, well what happened that you got out of the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority]?
Speaker 2: As I said, I was just working to be working until I could get some kind of direction.  You know, you--
Speaker 1: And you were--did you go to Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] during the time that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I started Wilson College a year after I got out of the [U.S. military] service--finished there.  You know, and I was going kind of part-time, 'cause I wasn't sure that I, I could do college material.  And I, I'd get off work, come home, ski- study a little bit.  And then, I had a answering service that would ring my phone until I woke up, you know, just so I could make those early classes, take a shower, get over there, get parked, and everything, go to class, with these idiots who would just sit there.  My, my social science teacher said, "Who saw 'The Wild One'?"  And, you know, I put my hand up.  He said, "Well, what do you think motivated Marlon Brando?"  I said, "Well, blah, blah."  I could have been, you know, telling a story of Dick and Jane.  He didn't care.  He just wanted to initiate his classroom procedure.  But you got these little young kids, though, that they're scared to death to say something or, you know, acting like they wanted to be a part of what have you.  And I said, I used to (unclear).  I said, how, how in the hell can you come all the way out there, and not say nothing, you know?  "Well, Robert Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown] is heavy."  I wasn't heavy, you know, I was just talking to the man.  And I didn't really have to get heavy until I went down to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  You know, I thought I was going to go down here with this same line of BS that I used at Wilson.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you come out of Wilson?
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Something like February something.
Speaker 1: So, did you get, did you take the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] or something and get, go to University of Illinois?  Is that was it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my first year at, at Wilson, I didn't use the G.I. Bill 'cause I didn't know how long I was going to be there.
Speaker 1: So, now, you're like, so you had to move to Springfield [Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Champaign [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Champaign, yeah, Champaign, yeah, Champaign, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: University of Illinois, Champaign.  Did you have to get a job in Champaign, too, or did it cover your expenses, too?
Speaker 2: No, that's where the, you know, the Hollywood syndrome comes on.  Whenever I needed money, I would sell cartoons at Playboy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, you can say I cartooned my way through college.
Story_ID: 365181
Speaker 1: Listen, now we need to go back to where you first started with Playboy now.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that we get the, we get the full, you know, chronology (laughter), and we don't, don't miss any steps.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, when, when I'd come home late at night, you know, I would do my little cartooning, you know, trying to learn, 'cause all these people were saying, you ought to send that in.  And I didn't know where to send it in.  But I said if, if I'm gonna get turned down, why did I get turned down by the best?  Anyway, why, why let the, you know, the Nashville Bugle [ph.], or somebody turn you down?  And so, I'd, I'd do these little ideas, and send them to the East Coast where all your magazines are coming from.  And they'd send them back, but they wouldn't even give me a rejection.  So, that, so being kind of depressed, I, I'd call down to Playboy and ask them, how do you go about, you know, submitting cartoon?  And Tex [ph.] said, "Well, you know, you put your ideas on eight and a half by eleven bond paper, and with a self-addressed, stamped envelope, and send them to me."  So, I had about seven dynamite ideas, but, you know, seven is such a hard number to handle.  Eight is very much better.  So, I took this little private joke, and put that in there.  So, a couple of weeks later, I come home from work, and there's this envelope in the vestibule, you know, Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown] from Playboy.  So, damn, they're getting pretty, at least, I'm going to get a rejection so that, and it said, "Dear Mr. Brown.  We're holding the following cartoon for further consideration."  I said, all right, yeah, sure, you, you're going to do something for the colored boy, all right, yeah, okay.  And then, a couple of weeks later, I come home.  There's another envelope in, in the foyer.  And it said, "Dear Mr. Brown.  Give us a black and white finish on the following cartoon."  And it was the, the little private joke I did.  This little boy, you know, back then, they used to make you stand in a corner.  And I had this little boy standing in a corner with a little tiny trumpet, and his mom and dad are peeking around the corner.  The mother said, "No, he hasn't been naughty.  He's just imitating Miles Davis," who's, you know, real hot at the time.  And I said, I will be damned, 'cause by, by the purchase of that cartoon, it took away all my excuses for not ever making it, or anything like that, you know.  You could always go to a party.  Well, yeah, I could be a great cartoonist, but they ain't gonna buy anything 'cause, you know.  So, I did it, and sent it in, and Hefner [Hugh Hefner] sent it back saying, "Why don't you put the little boy closer in the corner, so we can really see that, you know, he's being punished?"  And that was it.  So, from then on, I, I was really careful about my ideas and stuff instead of, you know, I used to be the life of the party stuff.  I wasn't always as drab and glum as I looked now, you know.  I was all cracking jokes or what have you.  But when you realize that you, you're dealing with something that you can potentially make money off of, or it's part of your financial background, you're not going to be so free will and willing.  So, I would send this stuff periodically, and make a sale or two, or what have you.  In fact, I sent in one that they rejected, but there was a note from Hefner saying the reason, rejected, because they had the same idea already in the house.  I said, "Aw, yeah, okay, sure, here it comes.  You're ripping off the colored boy."  But he sent me an issue of the Playboy, and it was a cartoon by Smeeley [ph.] and his, what, his setting was contemporary, whereas mine was back in the, you know, old days, but identical, you know, the punch line and everything.  Yeah, it was a good fairy and, and a guy in the bedstead and the caption was, "Now what were your other two wishes?"
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 365389
Speaker 1: We were talking about the early days of getting involved with Playboy.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): It was the, the good fairy.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, the cartoon, it was the same as yours--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or similar, except they had two different time periods.
Speaker 2: And see, you have to watch stuff like that because ideas is just like an ethereal-type thing, just floats through the air.  If you don't grab it, someone else will.  Playboy legal called me one day and asked me if I'd ever seen a cartoon by so and so, so and so, from Clarksville, Tennessee.  And I said no.  Said, "Well, he's suing us because he said that your cartoon is actually his."  And what, what it is, it was about--do you remember Stove Top stuffing?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It was on the TV--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --fifty million times a day.  Okay, he had done a cartoon relating to that.  I did one, so as I told you before, Hefner [Hugh Hefner] can visualize who's going to do the best job when he had me do it.  And I, I feel rotten as hell 'cause I know how badly this guy wanted it.  It's--well, it's like somebody told me to send that in.
Speaker 1: So, now, when you said you write all your own captions to these and do they--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, every now and then, they'll get a mystery cartoon that they send me, want me to give them a rush on it, so there's probably somebody in editorial that got this great idea.  And people think that, you know, it's easy to come up with ideas when it's not.  I mean, you know, full blown, after you work on 'em long enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and, you know, your cartoons are richly illustrated.  I mean, you really--they are paintings, a little paint--
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's part of my trying to improve each time I do one, 'cause you look at my early work and oh, you'd probably throw up for me.  You know, rough as cobs, and, you know, because I never had that much training in color.  I was selling cartoons when I went down to U of I [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  And when I realized that all I ever want to do is be a cartoonist, I tried to sign up for an illustration course.  And the computer kept throwing me off because I was signed up for graphic design.  And they were, you know, saying there were people that needed that spot.  But so, I had to start out learning to use acrylics on my own.  And I looked at a lot--a lot of that stuff now and say, hey, you know, I could have done better than that, or I should lighten up on this or that and stuff.  But nobody is throwing stones at me so.
Speaker 1: So, your cartoons are painted with acrylics primarily?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Acrylic on paper or--
Speaker 2: Illustration boards.
Speaker 1: Illustration board.
Speaker 2: It's kind of about that thick because once you mount it on an easel, a little portable easel, you can tape it down, and it won't curl.  You know, 'cause you start slopping that wet paint, and it'll, it'll curl on you and stuff.  The primary reason for using acrylics is when you make a mistake, you can white it out, or go over it.
Speaker 1: You can paint over it, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  But you still have to know what you're doing because I can see a lot of cartoons I've done where I've gone over something.  And it, it's just kind of dark, you know, because you don't have the white paper shining through.  So, you know, a good artist would get some gesso and wipe that whole area out.  And, in essence, it's like starting over but, you, you know, your work will never run.
Story_ID: 365390
Speaker 1: When you paint street scenes, and I know you've got a scene, do you go out and shoot photographs first of the scene, and then come back and paint the scene or--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --or do you pose people sometimes into different positions or--
Speaker 2: No, no, you--
Speaker 1: You just all just make it--
Speaker 2: You work it out because one thing, you must constantly remind yourself of is you're cartooning.  You're not illustrating.  You know, you say, oh, boy, this is going good, and I'm going to do this and going.  The primary thing is, you know, keep it to where people can turn to it, laughing, get the hell on out of there.  You know, if they look it, they don't even have to notice Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown] unless I mess up.  They'll say, "Who the hell did this," you know?  (Laughter) And that's not what you want.  But a lot of times, you, you have good luck.  Everything is going just--well, a case in point, I'm working on a painting up- upstairs now.  And my sweetie [Mary Ellen Brown] say, "Well, what are we gonna do tonight?"  That means to let go of what you're doing and let's go out.  So, I gotta drop whatever I'm doing.  And then, when you come back, "Where the hell was I?"  You know, it's, it's just, and she's retired now, so I have to, you know, go along with, with her.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you get married?  I mean, or--
Speaker 2: I got married December 24th, 1965.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My wife had graduated already.  I was a year behind her.
Speaker 1: At the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just looked over one day, and saw her walking out on campus and said, "Oh, my, goodness," you know.  So, it was love after, at first sight.  So, after I, I was working my last year on, on the bus [for the Chicago Transit Authority].  And I'm thinking, see, I've been pretty good, submitting sporadically and, and, you know, having the success I've had.  What would happen if I did it, like the big kids, and sent them something every week, no matter what I was doing, or no matter what was going on?  Just crank the stuff out, like a pro.  So, I get back down to campus, and we're on a semester system then, so you didn't have to really bear down until a month or so.  So, I sent them something every week--eight to twelve cartoons.  And then, the devil said, "Suppose they don't go for any of this stuff?  Suppose you, you know, just working in vain?"  So, I said, "Oh, Lord," so I stopped.  So, I was going down into the trash one morning, and I see this envelope in the vestibule.  And I go outside and put it in trash, come back in, pick it up, throw it on the couch.  And I open it up, and it was a letter in there from Hefner [Hugh Hefner] apologizing for the length of time, you know, in getting back to me.  I mean, he's generally on top of everything back then.  Anyway, he bought--I can't remember.  I think it's something, like fifteen cartoons, you know, like two or three for someone else to do, and two for somebody.  But there was a bunch of them for me, and then he said, "Oh, and if you'd like to, you can try these two in color.  If not, just do them in black and white."  Well, hey, you know, I'm an art student at the University of Illinois.  Quite naturally, I'm gonna, you know, do 'em.  So, I called Mary Ellen that night, and said, "Hey, I got enough money to buy you a ring."  She said, "Why, you know, I think I'd like to get married."  So, I said, "Oh, okay."  I said, "No problem, just as long as, you know, we work this intelligently, and not have no kids for two or three years."  I didn't know, but she and her mama couldn't wait for her to get married (laughter) so.
Story_ID: 365391
Speaker 1: You graduated from the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] in 1966?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  And just for the record, to go back saying, you started working at Play-, you started submitting ideas, Playboy, when, '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Is that it--1961.  So, so the devil was wrong and it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but you, you have to listen to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you, you don't know, to this day, I don't know.  A couple of years ago, I got a letter from my editor.  And she say, "Congratulations, you sold more cartoons at this one meeting than anyone in the past history."  That's a couple of years ago.  We fell out.  I haven't done a lick for them since.  You know, hey, I wasn't making all the money in the world.  I ain't worked for a monthly publication.  You know, I, I can't get that silver Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz] with that.  And then, you know, some of the subtle things that are going down that I didn't like, or it didn't take too well.  I said, hey, the hell with it, you know.  And she thought I was a bad person 'cause I wouldn't sign a contract.  If I signed a contract with you right now, what is it, January?  Well, it's going to run 'til next January.  And I wanted somebody to talk to in terms of this glass ceiling, glass wall, glass floor, everything where I wasn't progressing.  My work is, you know, going fine.  I'm drawing like crazy.  You know, it's like telling a pyramid working boy.  You do great stuff, just keep it up.  And all I'm saying was, wait a minute, what, you know.  I got a lot down in Arkansas where I was going to build our dream home, and we was gonna close up the twenty-four hour gate.  And you say, "Gee, whatever happened to Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown]?"  Well, hey, I'm still here.  And we got six grandkids now, so we're not going to Arkansas.  But I just didn't want to sign, sign another contract for what?  You know, that's what they can't understand.  They think I'm a bad person.  I'm just saying, hey, look, I'll go and work on some of these other paintings I got, or what have you.  People say, "Well, stick to Playboy for, for the exposure."  Well, every night, you've seen somebody on TV, died from exposure, so don't tell nobody.
Story_ID: 365392
Speaker 1: So you haven't done anything for Playboy for few years then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've done something about a year or so ago, you know, 'cause I told you they, they sent me a letter, praising me because I was on top.  You know, so I go around thinking about these ideas and jotting them down, and say, hey, why don't I do this, blah, blah, blah?  Yeah, I sold something, like nine at one time and, but at the same time, I'm still raising hell.  Somebody come and talk to me, you know, don't, don't have me nickel-and-dime in here always.  I'm seventy years old.  And not to be, and you don't go up against Pa Hefner [Hugh Hefner], and expect to win.  So, if you see me out in front of 1900 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] with my tin cup, I hope you'll understand.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, I mean, economically, you get, now do you get residuals from old work at all as a--
Speaker 2: No, just from foreign editions and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We--I'm living off what my wife [Mary Ellen Brown] has been able to squirrel away down through the years.  You know, I, I realized long ago, I wasn't, you know, going to have wealth untold, or anything like that.  But you cannot keep nickel-and-diming me across the board.  But, see, I got, I had an editor on one hand, and then Hefner on the other.  And the only one I could really report and relate to was her, and she just recently died.  So, here comes the devil again, say, "Hey, you're in a jam," and just life in a big city.  I'm forty years, forty-seven something years, on one corner ain't bad.
Speaker 1: So, now that you spend a lot of time, you paint and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to get back into painting.  But, you know, so my, my baby, she's retired, and she wanted me to retire with her.  But my mind, the way it works, you know, I keep coming over with ideas and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 365393
Speaker 1: Let me get back to the content of your work.  And then, we'll talk about, maybe talk about what you're doing now.  But how did you come up with the idea for Granny?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was accidental.  You know, I get an image, and then I try to come up with a caption or, you know, a theme for it.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: So, you came up with the image first before the captions (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  And the, what it was, the train was rattling through the mountains and slowed down, and Jesse James and his gang jumps on.  And they say, "Okay, we're going to rob all the women and kiss all the men."  And somebody say, "You can't do that."  And this little fellow says, "Well, who's robbing this train?  You and Jesse James."  And, okay, that's as far as I could tell you.  I didn't know to handle gay people or anything like that then, so but I had this picture of a train robbery.  Nobody at Playboy was doing much--train robbery cartoon.  So, I had this frustrated little old lady, you know, standing there in her underclothes, mad.  And one of the robbers is saying, "Honest, lady, we didn't come to rape or molest nobody.  We come to rob the damn train," so I did that one.  And about a year or so later, yeah--I, I think, yeah, the first Granny was, I did while I was at Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  And I came to Chicago [Illinois], and I did one--oh, yeah, I used to sit up all night listening to WBBM [WBBM Radio, Chicago, Illinois], remember Bill Doc Lee [Willie Edward Lee, Jr.]?  And he, he played gospel music, I think, say, "Oh, we're gonna go back down south and everything and talk about egg money and stuff."  I said, "Egg money," I remember that one, and grandma used to deal with the peddler.  So, I had this little guy with the young girl in the straw in a barn.  And here's this old lady with her hands on the hips.  And he fastens his coverall, saying, "Well, Martha [ph.], there goes the egg money."  And, you know, I just did it 'cause that's all I had to do.  It was the only idea I had really relevant.  And Hefner [Hugh Hefner] bought it.  So, years later, I saw him at, out at the Mansion [Playboy Mansion, Chicago, Illinois].  We are--all the cartoonists are out there having lunch.  And, quite naturally, they, they set me right next to the head man.  I said, "Hef, what the hell do you know about egg money?"  The cat told he was from Omaha, or you know, Nebraska, or what have you.  And so, he, he knew all that stuff.  And I said, "I will be damned."  That's what I'm saying.  I have to be very careful when coming up with these clever ideas 'cause he'll buy it, and then expect you to pull it off.  So, so anyway, my editor asked me--no, she told me, said, "Boy, you're doing a lot of little ladies jokes."  And she had to go back and show me.  I said, "Well, do you mind?"  She said, "No, Hef loves it."  When I heard that, you know, I sped home and started cranking out little old lady joke.  And that's, easiest things to come by because of a magazine full of these huge buxomly, blond goddesses.  You put a scrawny little old lady trying to get over in there, and it works.  So, that's the story of Granny.
Story_ID: 365394
Speaker 1: What are some of the other major themes that you, that you've used in your cartoons?
Speaker 2: Well, I told you, I like cowboy scenes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are some, there are some Indians [Native Americans] circling the wagon right in front of me here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  Well, it's, it's the things that go on in a movie as a kid that, you know, everybody can relate to.  Let's see, just common things of interest.  You, once again, you don't want to be too cute, too clever, or come up with something totally new because you're gonna lose 75 or 70 [percent] of, of your audience.  You want everybody to be able to jump in and laugh about it.
Speaker 1: Now, that's different from and it's--it may be true for your cartoon maybe, not all the time.  I know, we were mentioning Gahan Wilson a few minutes ago.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He's somebody that you have to look at his twice.  Not everybody didn't get Gahan Wilson.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, there you go. It's probably 75 percent of them not getting Gahan Wilson.  And--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But the ones who do, they really, they really like Gahan (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I'm trying to draw everybody into it.  Everybody can laugh.  It's whether you come up with something new and not--you want to reach back and touch a cord that everybody has, you know, been into at one time in their life.  They said, oh, yeah, the oh yeah-type laugh.  It--once, as long as you're laughing, you know, that's the main thing.  I found that out when I was in the war camp, sometimes I wouldn't even get the room ready for inspection.  I just put up all my crazy pictures on the wall, and the lieutenants and stuff would come in.  And once they start looking at them and laughing, I was over the hump.  It's, maybe the psych-, the psychological folks can, can figure that out.  Why so?  You know, laughter or the, the need for me to create laughter, you know, like you said, "Well, Buck [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown], what about that twenty bucks [dollars] you owe me?"  I'll start cracking jokes, getting you to laugh.  Said, "Well, just give me ten," you, you know, it's something about laughter.
Story_ID: 365395
Speaker 1: See, I have different theories about, you know, the essence of a cartoon would make people laugh, what have you.  I got one about Little Willie's Cafe [ph.].  And on that one, you know, it's a soul food place, and with the menu on the outside.  And when I did submitted it, Hefner [Hugh Hefner] said, "Tell Buck [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown] to redo it, and come up with a different caption."  So, I, I did it, and I said, there's no way in the world that another soul brother can see this, and not know that it was a soul brother that did it.  And it, it didn't, it didn't necessarily work like that.  It, it was a soul brother cleaning up his, his cafe and, and the waitress at the door.  And my original capture was, oh, yeah, I had Truman Capote, Jackie Kennedy [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis], and all, all of, you know, hippest people of the day, and they were saying, "It's the jet set, they want some soul food."  Okay, you know, that was okay.  So, she sent it back, and I put a caption of, "We've been discovered."  Now, it wasn't a type of thing where you're just going to lie down on the floor, and just roll from one side to the other.  Hefner described it as a powerful image.  If it's a powerful image, it'll work, you know, just as well as, you know, something that's just going to tear your ribs apart, laughing at.  So, and when I compose the stuff, I picture myself sometime as a pitcher at a ballgame.  I'll throw a fastball, and then, I'll throw an inside, a slider, then another fastball.  And then, I have to throw the changeup 'cause Hef knows, is, is looking for my next pitch.  So, you have to keep him off his, off his feet just as well as anyone else.
Speaker 2: Have you ever thought about standup comedy, or doing comedy in any other form than a cartoon, cartooning?
Speaker 1: Well, as I told you, I was the life of the party type at one time.  But once I get involved in two-dimensional types of--as a matter of fact, I got a sketch in there I wanted to show you that I did, that I sold to Cosby [Bill Cosby], this, the steamboat going down the river, but--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: No, I hadn't thought about it, especially nowadays, you know, I don't look good with my cap on backwards.  I don't like earring.  I like [HistoryMaker] Cedric The Entertainer.  My nephew wants to be a comedian.  He wanted to be a cartoonist at first, and I begged him, got down on both knees, and please, please.  Well, the main thing is I don't think he's, he's cut out for, for that.
Story_ID: 365189
Speaker 1: You were saying that there's, believe it or not, there's racism in the cartoon business?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't, you know, it's not a mean, spiteful thing where it, they look up, and see that you're a boo-boo, and change this thing.  They eliminated the characters in my comic strip--just kept the two soul brothers.  And, but somebody told me that they were trying to get the syndicate acclimated to where they could sell my strip to the little tiny out-of-the-way, the boonies, and stuff like that.  So, you could make five dollars a month off, off of them if you were lucky.  So, you know, there wasn't, there wasn't, you, you weren't going to make it as, as a black Jim Davis or a Charles Schulz [Charles M. Schulz].  And so, I couldn't get it to the point where they liked it any longer.  And so, one night, we decided to call it a day.  And I was tickled to death because, you know, it was driving me up the wall, you know, 'cause I had to be more than what I was, you know.  And I was raising hell when it started out.  So, I ran into the president a couple of years after, up in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], at a cartoonist get-together.  In fact, we were in the same golf cart together.
Speaker 1: Now, who is this, the--
Speaker 2: Mike Cargeria [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the head of the Tribune Syndicate [Chicago Tribune Syndicate] at the time.  And we, finally, after we warmed up and loosened up and stuff, we talk, started talking about it.  And I said, "Mike, you know, it don't matter whether I'm pink, purple, or polka dot.  I create so much humor in my life.  I just want to be able to use that, you know, to, to get something going.  I don't have to do a black strip or, you know, or do something about Eskimos.  Just let me be funny."  He kept saying, "Send me something."  So, you know, the newsstands on the corner, the guy selling papers and magazine--okay, I had a little guy who, at one of these newsstands, and he got the newspapers on the front and (unclear).  And he deals with the traffic coming in four different direction, and all the different people and stuff, and it worked as far as I was concerned.  So, I did it up, Xeroxed it, and sent it off to them.  They got it on a Monday.  I had return mail Thursday and Friday again.  Said, "Buck [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown], we took your latest submission, passed it around, and we all loved it.  And we all agreed to amend that it would work better if it was black."  I said, oh, Lord.  So, at the time, I had a American Staffordshire Terrier.  I kicked him up and down the right path about three weeks, you know, saying, why can't I just be funny?  But then, you know, I said, "Well, hey," me and the devil were talking about this.  So, I said, "If I want to be a syndicated cartoonist, have something to do every day.  I guess I had to make the character black."
Story_ID: 365190
Speaker 1: So, I came upstairs and reworked it, and start going into, and just like they say, it worked better, and see, he was black.  You ain't really mess with folks then, you know, you had the sacred brick.  They used to throw it at folks and stuff.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) A sacred brick?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, you know, how you keep a brick that hold your newspaper down?  Well, you know, you mess with it, you, you throw the sacred brick at.  So, what happened, I was invited to the cartoonists convention down in Columbus [Ohio], near Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  So, I don't know why, but I said, "Hm, why don't I just say this, and take it to them at Columbus?"  You know, all the syndicates send up representative.  And so, I go up, get down there.  They sent a woman.  I'm not going to mention her name 'cause flames would probably shoot out.  But I said, "I got something for you to take back to Orlando [ph.] and Mike [Mike Cargeria (ph.)], and all the guys and stuff.  I'll give it to you at dinner that night."  So, I'm sitting in the back of the dining room, signing autographs for all these kids and stuff, blah, blah, blah, hear this broad.  This young lady comes in, miniskirt, eyebrows about four inches in length.  And she's walking with that--, "How you doing, big boy?"  So, what in the hell is this?  You know, I'm saying, I'm a cartoonist.  I'm supposed to be crazy, but I'm serious as a heart attack about my work.  Well, what happened, there was a, the surgeon from Detroit [Michigan] who's into Ollie Harrington cartoons.  In fact, he'd flown them in, and set up an exhibit for him and stuff.  So, Ollie wasn't feeling too good that night, so he asked me to go with him, so I could meet Ollie.  Well, quite naturally, I said yeah.  So, and all this young lady was supposed to do is take my strip back to Orlando.  That's been 1989.  Do you, do you think I should stop waiting by the phone?  Nothing.  So, I said, "Hey, I'm giving up."  They say, you're not supposed to give up?  I'm giving up.  You know, it's, it's just too hard to do anything.  And I'm, I'm assuming that this is a case of her not getting lucky, you know.  It wasn't a thing about race.  I just find the toilet where she flushed my work down.  But that's why I said, it was racial, or what have you.  I can't just be funny.  I, I have to find a place to send it in (laughter).
Story_ID: 365191
Speaker 1: Did you do cartoons for other publications?  Did Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] ever publish your cartoons and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked for Sunny and Honey.  I did them little ugly kids in there.
Speaker 1: In Ebony Jr.!, that was?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and did the covers and some illustration.  I was burning--well, first, I really refused the work but, 'cause I told them I didn't like the way I was being handled, you know.  And so, the new lady, Mary Lewis came in.  She said, "Well, try us one more time."  And, hey, they were beautiful about, about it and so.  And the young lady called me up one day and said, "Did you hear about Marcia [sic.]?"  I said, "No."  Said, "Well, they're cutting out Ebony Jr.!, and she's on a three-week vacation in Europe.  And when she comes back, you know, there's a letter saying, 'See Johnny.'"  And so, she finished the letter, went in and see him.  Said, "Well, do I have to come back to the magazine?"  Said, "No, be out the building by five."  And the woman hadn't done anything wrong except, you know, being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And her assistant had all the little knick-knacks, you know, little plants that you put on the shelf, and stuff like that.  She didn't have her car.  So, she comes back the next day with her sister's car.  They followed her through the building, like she was a, a thief.  And I'm saying, this, you know, there's got to be a better way to handle this.  He was cutting out Ebony Jr.! 'cause he was starting an EM Man [Ebony Man] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, okay, fine, it's your dough.  You do it the way you want to, but, my God, you know, class doesn't have to end at three o'clock.  Well, you know, hey, he gets off on doing things like that, they told me.  And, this was a couple of years ago, we could go down there and he, he would have been there watching the store.
Story_ID: 365192
Speaker 1: I did work for several publishing companies and stuff, as an offshoot of stuff I did in Playboy, and what have you.  You do what you have to do in order to make it.
Speaker 2: I think you mentioned Scott Foresman.
Speaker 1: Scott Foresman (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You did some stuff for them.  They're out in Glenview [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Glenview, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Glenview, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm walking downtown, stopped for a light.  And here comes a guy that used to come to my class that was at, at Champaign [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  He was courting one of the girls.  So, we fat-mouthed until, for the length of the light.  And he starts out walking, he gets in the middle of the street, and said, "Do you do children's books?"  I said, this cat asking me, the great Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown], do I do children's books?  You know, aww, I was hurt.  But I say, "Hey, man, give me a call."  Man, they had a thing going--I forget what you call it.  If you got a publication coming out, and it's about minorities, you got to have a minority editor, writers and photographers, and stuff like that.  They found me as the artist.  They didn't have to go out and look for anybody.  Every week, I'm getting two or three assignments.  They're calling me, say, "Would you please bill us?"  So, you know, I'm drawing with both hands, saying, boy, I've come a long way real quick, haven't I?  Come to find out, this is part of the--what do you call it, when you get minorities involved in everything?
Speaker 2: Well, affirmative action or--
Speaker 1: Affirmative action, that's funny, I never can remember that.  Well, the man is only going to let you get away with that for so long.  So, instead of putting out black publication, they cease, brought it to a screeching halt.  And so, the, the black librarians, and what have you, they were begging us--what I'm saying, at people at Ebony Jr.!, please, could I, I help, could we help them get these publications, or give them a lease to doing this?  And, you know, they, they wouldn't.  And all that wonderful creative work I was doing, listen, you can hear the toilet flushing.  That was it.  And I mean, I made enough to pay down this house, and which, which, you know, was a whole bunch of money for a cartoonist.  Well, you know, I, I gravitated to publication.  I, I was one of the ten outstanding young men.  I ain't gonna tell you the year, 'cause now (unclear) to seventy years (laughter).  Don Walker got me to do, start doing the covers on his black business magazine because he figured out, you can't put a black businessman at a, on a cover of a magazine at the point of sale, you know, like when you check out, didn't go over too big.  So, I just start doing my type of humor on the cover and, you know, a lot of people criticize that as a business publication.  Oh, Lord, you know, but he tell them, he sitting in, in his office with more gold than Tutankhamun, telling me how my work is helping to sell his magazine.
Speaker 2: Now, which magazine is this?  This is--
Speaker 1: Dollars and Sense (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dollars and Sense, okay.
Speaker 1: I said, "Well, good, give me some."  And so, a couple of weeks later, he told me he was using Orville Hurt, 'cause Orville worked cheaper.  I said, oh, okay.  But, you know, I always figured if, if I'm doing a job for you, and I'm successful at it, hey, deal with me, you know, don't, don't act like I'm independently wealthy so.
Speaker 2: Well, the essence of what he's saying is, is not easy, freelancing, but it does have its rewards.  But it's not an easy thing to do all the time, it's a (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It has its, it has its rewards if you're out there, you know, covering all bases, and playing outfield on stuff like that.  But, suppose your talent level is right on a borderline.  Or I show you all my paintings and stuff so, hey, I know I'm going to make a sale here, you know, if you so inclined to buy something. If not, I'm in a jam, big jam.  Time to talk with the devil again.
Story_ID: 365193
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done at this point, is there anything that you would do differently, you know, if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Well, my last semester at Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], Playboy invited me up the Mansion [Playboy Mansion, Chicago, Illinois] for lunch.  And so, I get up there.  And he got all the stuff laid out, Bunnies [Playboy Bunnies] running around and stuff.  And Michelle [ph.] asked me what I planned to do when I graduated.  Say, "Well, try to get a job with an agency and, you know, do a little cartooning on the side."  She said, "Well, why don't you just stay with your cartooning, and see what come loose."  And, you know, here I am with a water glass of Jack Daniels and, you know, I ate a five-pound filet mignon saying, duh, I wish I, you know, sometimes wish I'd gone on into an agency.  And, well, I don't know, you know, 'cause the cartoons will take, take so much time to do that.  But, you know, that, I, I wouldn't be walking around, fussing about the, the rewards that I supposedly, you know, were missing out on.  I, I really don't know.  It, it always felt good to walk into an agency or something like, with my golf glove tucked in my back pocket, and my cane gold, and it's about my work all of the same.  See you, and, you know, they're going to sit in there watching the clock.  So I, I, yeah, but I would have liked to have tried it 'cause it's stuff that they put on TV.  It, it is, as we say in the ghetto, ain't nothing but a jump shot for a creative person to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, they--
Speaker 1: Did you have any interaction with Colors Agency [ph.], or any of the other big ones (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They claimed that they were going to call me and stuff like that.  But if you're working for one of them, why would you call a cartoonist to come in and just do it all right there, instead of the big meeting, and what have you?  Say, "Well, Buck [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown], that's not right.  We need a," okay, I'll put it over there.  I feel like I can do it, you know.  I don't need all the bad-mouthing and carrying on.  But you learn a lot in, in my racket, and I'm not saying I'm that big a hot-, hotshot.
Story_ID: 365194
Speaker 1: Is there any kind of association of black cartoonists for guys like, maybe Brunce [ph.] and Brandy [ph.], and [HistoryMaker] Morrie Turner, Tom Jackson, Aaron McGruder, or any of, you know?  Y'all get together and--
Speaker 2: We get together and stuff like that, but, you know, get together for what?  We're going to cartoon you to death (laughter), you know.  No, we, we got the same problems in most cases, or like the young cartoonists.  They, they used to send me literature concerning, you know, how rough and tough it was.  Well, it wasn't rough and tough for me to get my work bought and accepted.  It was just you were going to be at that same level, like one of my all-time heroes is--I'm trying--yeah, Leroy Neiman.
Speaker 1: Oh, the Olympic artist, the artist that does the athletes (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, the richest artist in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, you gotta give him his full title.  And the--well, I know him to be one, one of the best and stuff.  They, they tell the story about he was at the White House [Washington, D.C.] at a luncheon, and Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] was holding forth, you know, telling the story.  So, Leroy grabs a napkin and starts, you know, doing his sketching and stuff.  And Ted Kennedy is watching him.  So, Leroy is finished, Ted Kennedy said, "Would you sign that and give it to me?"  And Leroy said, "Hell, no, you can afford to pay for this.  I did work here."  Now, I pick--put myself in that situation.  I was--best wishes to Ted Kennedy, P.S., I loved both your brothers, and I'd had to hitchhike out of town.  The man's a great artist, beautiful person, and he's a businessman.  See, most of us, most of us people just, you know, like to paint pictures, and say, well, hey, how much more?  I don't know, just, you know, give me whatever you got.  I was at the eighty-eighth, the thirty-fifth anniversary party at, at the World's Trade Center [World Trade Center] in New York [New York].  And I'm trying to schmooze up, you know, next to Leroy and get my tom time in, and stuff like that.  He just looked me, dead now, said, "You gotta do it yourself, Buck [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown]."  I said, "What?"  "You gotta do it yourself," and blah, walk around.  You--I might have called him some kind of dirty names and stuff, but the man is absolutely right.  I appreciate that now.  You know, I couldn't then.  I thought he was going to call a, "Hey, Joe [ph.], yeah, yeah, Buck Brown here, you know, give him plenty of money and all of that."  You know, I, I was just trying to get in there.  But, see, now he came into my show in, at the Friars Club in New York [New York].  And my number one painting had just sold for five grand.  And so, hey, I'm, you know, tickled to death, drinking my little Jack Daniels on, on the rocks, so.  And I saying, I wish I could have sold this to Leroy, you know, just have a painting in Leroy's collection would be a feather in my cap, you know.  But I talked, I talked with him a couple of days later, said, "Man, we took the folks from my gallery over there.  And the guys laughed themselves to death."  So, I said, "Well, give me the number of the gallery."  So, I called over to the gallery, and say, "Oh, Buck, we just, oh, we were in tears, blah, blah, blah."  So, he said, "But so much of your work is," is not--what do you call that phrase--not in correct order, or incorrect, politically incorrect.  And, you know, me trying to be, once again, trying to smooth my way in.  And I didn't have enough heart to say, what the hell do you mean, politically incorrect, 'cause half of it was, you know, just my type stuff.  And the other half was Playboy stuff.  And the third, hey, you got three halves--was of Playboy and Grannies and stuff like that.  Well, you, I, I would love to have a gallery that I can just do stuff.  And then, ship it off to them, we'll let them handle it, and not worry about them ripping me off, or what have you, or anything like that--not to be.
Story_ID: 365195
Speaker 1: Do you have ownership of any of your original cartoons for Playboy?
Speaker 2: I got a ton of them upstairs.  I get all of my originals back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have any idea of what they are worth?
Speaker 2: They would have to be judged individually 'cause some of them aren't that hot or, you know.
Speaker 1: I just wondered because they, you know, a collection of anything in the art world, there is, as you know, by having to go to art school is worth more than just the individual wants.
Speaker 2: But see, I went up against so, so much jazz in, in my sojourns through life.  When, when I go to a Playboy function, like in '99 [1999], my, my spy, my girl, Rhonda [ph.], up at Playboy, found out that they were having a Playboy Expo in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And so, she, she had my ticket, my hotel, and everything all set up.  All I had to do was come, get the credentials, and blah, blah, blah.  And she didn't know if it's too late or what, but she had had a Granny blown up and stuff.  And I took ten originals, I think, up there with me, and I go up there.  And I, I wound up, eventually, doing about fifty or sixty thousand dollars' worth of business.  You know, and his, finally, because there were two brothers standing across the aisle from me just, you know, with that smile on their face.  I said, uh-huh, you didn't know, did you, because of the (unclear).  One guy was the producer of the 'Codename: The Destroyer' [sic.] movies.  He said, "Okay, are we agreed on a price?"  He said, "Okay, you fill that out and then sign it.  I'm going to the bathroom."  I said, "Why don't I fill it out, and you sign it when you come back?"  And then, another guy, he and his wife were behind me on the way up to the Mansion [Playboy Mansion, Los Angeles, California].  And I was fussing because I didn't think they were giving me my proper due.  And then they found out I was Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown], so you'd be on the first bus going up there and blah, blah, blah.  They came by the booth the next day.  They bought all the stuff that Marty Myers [Martin Myers], another cartoonist, had.  And I'm looking at this one, like what the hell is going on?  They said, "Don't you go anywhere, Buck, you're next."  Man bought everything that I had, plus a woman, that I was telling them about, that I had left at home.  You know, 'cause I was telling her how many Sistine Chapels [Apostolic Palace, Vatican City] I had, I mean cartoons relating to that.  I'm trying to think.  Also, my God, you know, how he reaches out to Adam ['The Creation of Adam,' Michelangelo].  And the caption was, "Pull My Finger," (laughter).  You got to really be from the old school to, to catch that.  But I did so much business in that little short span.  And I was away from a, you know, where the heavy action was.  I was back by that washroom, couldn't find out that was a hot spot 'cause everybody had to come that way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I would suggest, you probably sitting on a gold mine, but, you know, it's easy for me to say from here, but I would suggest you are.
Speaker 2: What, yeah, if, if I'm put in that, that position.  Nobody knows who I am, you know, hell, I can come on over, a feather sticking up in my hair, and saying how, and they said, that's not white, that's not Buck Brown.  You never know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you see, that's another thing.  They, they leave me out of the, the action.  And those, those folks out here have got money, 'cause they, the, the guy came by and we were doing about five, six thousand dollars.  They said, "Well, when you close up here, we'll go back to the hotel, and I got another thousand I'll give you."  I said, "Hey, I'm closed," 'cause he had just bought everything.  You know, and they don't understand.  I appreciate money just as much as, you know, the next dude, but I guess they just want you on the shelf.  It's there to do your little thing.  And, and if you rattle your chain, you know, they say, why is he getting ugly, you know?  We just want him for Playboy and that's it.  Meanwhile, you know, after--once again, got enough gold to, you know, make Tutankhamun upset.
Story_ID: 365196
Speaker 1: This question is what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community, the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I just realize, I hope they realize the jam that we're in, and what they can do about it is tightening up, themselves up.  Case in point, somebody find out the phone number where I lived.  Okay, they had a little column, like the one that used to be on the front of the newspaper, you know, dealing with humor.  For some reason, he wanted me to critique it.  So, I always, you know, trying to reach back, and help a brother in something like this, so I said, okay, come on by.  It was a little humor column, you know, you read it, um-hm, you know, brighten up your day.  Every other word was misspelled.  So, I say, "Hey, man, what is this?"  "Oh, yeah, I'll get that straightened up."  I said, "No, no, no, no, before you show it to someone like me, you should have a school teacher or somebody, you know, had some, knows something about English, spelling, or what have you, to tighten this up for you."  And he said, "Oh, well, you know," and so he couldn't understand my, my point to where he should get it together, and before he goes and show, before he sends it in, you know, like my problem.  And that they should also know that there's nothing wrong with really pursuing that which you, you know, you want to be a part of.  And they want me to talk to a nephew who likes to draw.  How can I talk to this dude and explain to him that if he does something, and he gets rejected ninety-nine times, how can I get him to go back for that hundredth time, like a kid that followed me at Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  Now, he explained to me that he--they didn't do a strip after I left.  They kept rerunning my, my stuff, and which I feel is wrong.  Somebody should have grabbed the opportunity to run with it.  He called them and said, "Man, could you teach me how to cartoon 'cause I want to quit my job?"  You know, like, it's a fifteen minute type deal.  It's, it's just the point that if you want to do something, you have to pursue it, you have to master it.  And, oh, and meanwhile, while you're doing all that, you have a good time.  You know, it's like, people hear about how tough college is and stuff like that.  Everybody I know who's gone to college has had a good time.  They met people different from, you know, what they're accustomed to, and what have you.  But they got to--I, I guess, it's the same as paying your dues.  And that's the only way I can see resolving some of the problems that we have being, being able to communicate, being able to gain the objectivity to say, hey, wait a minute, I'm not what I should be, you know, I'm not where I want to be and stuff.  You can't get where you want to be until you look back at what you're doing.  It's just like, Leroy [Leroy Neiman] told me.  He say, "You got to do it yourself, Buck [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown]."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can see that so clearly now, but, you know, I wanted to break a bottle and attack the man because he wasn't going to, you know, give me carte blanche into the world of painting.
Story_ID: 365197
Speaker 1: When you look at everything that you've done to this point, what today, would you consider to be your body of work, your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I figured it will just probably wither away.  And you wouldn't have to be concerned of what you've done, but if somebody can just look at where I started from, and with the thought in mind that I always wanted to be a cartoonist, you know, not a great cartoon-, I had no idea that I was gonna do the stuff that I'd done with Playboy.  But you, you can't see that until you, you know, you get involved and you start cranking out the stuff.  And things start coming loose.  You know, the thoughts that you have are not just little random thoughts but, you know, it's a basis of what, what drives you and the magazine, and everything like that.  And, you, we're all into this together.  It's just when I get ugly and say, "Hey, wait a minute, you know, something don't add up here.  He can't tell me, 'Well, hey, cartoonists have worked this way for years.'  What the hell is that, you know?"  I would like to be able to take that woman [Mary Ellen Brown] on a nice vacation every now and then.  I'd like to, you know, if we want to move, build another house, and so, it revolves on a very basic thing.  And, you know, wishing doesn't do it.  But you, you look at cable television, contrast it to magazines, and you, you can tell it's, it's a kind of sketchy thing.
Story_ID: 365198
Speaker 1: Who would you consider today--I mean, well, not, not, well, who is your favorite cartoonist?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say.  You come out cheap asking who is my least favorite cartoonist 'cause he, he, a cartoonist has so much to offer.  I think back to when I went to--
Speaker 1: Who are some of the favorite, you know, some of your favorites then?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I went to a cartoon thing up in New York [New York] years ago.  And this young lady came up to me at the cocktail party, and said her grandfather wanted to meet me.  I said, "Who's your grandfather?"  And she said, "Charles Addams." You know, of 'The Addams Family.'  Man, you talking about dying and going someplace.  And I went over and met him.  I said, "May I buy you a drink?"  You know, and so, I talking to God, you know, not the devil, a god.  Somebody from West Hill, Ohio came up and grabbed me, said, "Mr. Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown], I want you to get started, blah, blah, blah."  Well, you know, not one to turn somebody off, I turned it off and, and had a few words with the man.  I turned back around and Charles Addams was going out the door.  But I, I think he would have to be--if, if I had, if you pin me down, he would have to be my favorite because he--they put out an anthology of his work.  And I went out and bought it, and in going through it, I saw the stuff that he'd done forty years ago that I thought it was so new and hip for me.  And, you know, just pay the admiration just flowed.  So, I, I was saying, but, you know, this, everybody has--the individual thing is like a Charlie Rodrigues [Charles Rodrigues], oh, Rawlin Wilson [ph.], he just died recently.  And I would never just take the trophy and give it to one cartoonist.  I'd have to include them in a whole bunch of stuff.  Mike Peters [Michael Peters].  Yeah, he does Mother Goose and Grimm.  Cat called me up one night and told me to call these people down in Texas, and see what I could get going with it 'cause they were broke and going nowhere.  And they start putting out T-shirts of Granny on them.  And, ma'am, they've become, you know, John [ph.] this and that.  I called the dude up, and it was like walking into a drugstore in San Antonio [Texas] again.  "Oh, yeah, we'll get together sometime, okay, yeah, sure," so.

Speaker 1: Can you describe your family to us?  We haven't talked about your--we talked about your wife [Mary Ellen Brown], but you've got children and grandchildren, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My son [Robert Brown III] got married, and we all went to Jamaica for the wedding.  That was beautiful.  He lives in Bloomington [Illinois].  He's with State Farm.  He seemed to be doing quite well.  He has two daughters, beautiful little daughters.  My daughter [Tracy Brown Hill] married her childhood sweetheart [John Hill], and they live over in Indiana.  And they have four little boys, cute as they can be.  Quite naturally, they wanted a girl in there, but they couldn't get one, so I think they're gonna stop.  Other than that, better not say any more.

Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that you think I need to ask before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, it's just, there's a bunch of things about, you know, my cartooning in the [U.S. military] service and stuff that just help reinforce, gain-, gaining the confidence to go out there and say, hey, this is part of me, look at it.  You know, it, it takes a bit of a notion.  One thing, I really regret is that I never tried out for the Stars and Stripes, the service newspaper?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And picture me over in Korea, a hell hole of rats and that's combined.  And if I had gotten on with the Stars and Stripes, and I could have been in a little heart of downtown Tokyo [Japan] for a couple of years.  I see that now, you know, I see how easily I made it, you know, in other places, so life in a big city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sometimes you just don't realize what you have (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you know, how you get paralyzed with fear?  I just couldn't do it.  The first time I sold a cartoon to Esquire, I couldn't use a pen 'cause I was just, you know, stiff and paralyzed.  So, I took a sliver of bamboo, uh, not bamboo, balsa, and then dipped it in ink and drew with my left hand.  And I don't know if I did the whole thing like that, but, you know, just to get into it because at the time, Esquire was it, oh, you know, over Playboy, and everything like that.  You just, you know, get, and get, you get to know yourself, what you're about.  Say, you, you could say to young black people, you know, figure out what you want to be doing down the road twenty, thirty years from now, other than being in prison, you know.  How can you look at this country from Maine to Mexico, and see people doing the same thing, cap on backwards, fifteen earrings in each ear, oversized clothing, pants dragging, two hundred dollar sneakers.  What is that about?  But then again, you know, I, I didn't have to worry about drive-bys and stuff.

Speaker 1: My last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I, I have no, no idea.  You know, first of all, 'cause people don't know who I am now, which is, hey, I've, I've become accustomed.  You know, I was on a cruise ship, autographing--I think, four or five of my prints for this woman.  And before long, she said, "You did these?"  I said, "No, lady, I'm just some cat that's walking down the ocean and decided to write all over your, your--." She didn't know that I was an artist.  Said, so many people don't, and I no longer get up uptight about it.  You can't hit, hit the ball out the park every time.  So, now, I would like for my family, you know, say, "Hey, dad tried, dad was all right," and stuff like that.  But, you know, as far as me, you know, I, I used to think people, once I became a cartoonist, people would hold their kids up on their shoulder and say, "There goes Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown].  See, the huge fellow with the cape," you know, I'm a--it can't be that like that.  As I say, if you work it successfully, they don't even know who you are so.  I just, you know, didn't want them to say, "Well, he was just a cartoonist, and he was going to cartoon no matter what," you know, like the economic situation has changed so damn much.  I look at the cats signing the contracts for $50 million for a couple of years.  And I said, you know, what the hell does he do backstage or something to get that kind of money?  He'll go, I'm not there, I'm not paying them, or what have you.  But they're giving it up.  The doctor, yeah, I went to the doctor yesterday to have my blood checked.  And while I was in the washroom, my wife [Mary Ellen Brown] was talking with this kid.  And he was saying that his brother makes between 30 and 50 million per year.  Hey, hey, that's mindboggling.  What the hell can he be doing?  You know, I, I have a lot of skill and stuff, but, you know, I don't, I, I wouldn't know how to get in that range.  It's just like painting.  How do I get in the upper, in that same era with Leroy Neiman or Stanz [ph.] or something?  Don't, don't say, "Well, hey, boy, we must need Le-, Leroy Neiman or Buck Brown.  Now, here, he tried, but he didn't do much."  I, I guess that's the American way, I, I really don't know.  Economics, I guess.  But, no, I, I don't worry about being remembered.  You know, I, I get mail from people all over the world, you know, all they want is my autograph and, and a picture.  If, if that's what turns them on, fine.

Speaker 1: This is CD cover I did for Chiaroscuro [ Chiaroscuro Records] which is a recording company.  You know, I guess the guys, may not making a lot of money.  They just like to record jazz and stuff.  And I can't, I'm trying to remember the painting I took from there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Jay McShann album there.
Speaker 1: It's a Jay McShann album, but I, I think it was a famous taboo ad where the violinist is, is holding the young lady up but--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Now, go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is from a dance, a part of, we were having at Kimpo Air Force base [Kimpo Air Base; Gimpo International Airport, Seoul, South Korea], and I think it must have been early 195- '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the East West golf tournament [East West Cup] in Scottsdale, Alabama--I mean, Arizona.  And it's hard to remember names, except the guy in the green shirt, was driving a Bentley.  Yeah, I'll call him Mr. Bentley.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Ready, a camera roll, okay.
Speaker 1: That's my golf buddy, Al Dixon.  Doctor, I can't remember, it's Doc and Sylvia [ph.], and me, Buck Brown [HistoryMaker Robert "Buck" Brown].  They live out there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: This is gag photo, I guess, we must have been sampling the local booze or something.  We shot a bunch of photos in the hooch.  That's why I like the TV show, 'M*A*S*H,' because we had a hooch exactly like the one they have in there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: A giveaway thing that we had for the Playboy Expo out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. It was quite successful.
Speaker 2: And this is my--I guess, my favorite photo taken by Ed Warner, and I use it on all my bios and stuff.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Here's my golf tourney buddies, Buzz Dixon and Johnny Mathis backstage.  I guess that was at the Chicago Theatre [Chicago, Illinois].  We used to play quite a bit of golf with Johnny when he'd come to the city.  But evidently, something about his contract with the star people must have fizzled or something because he doesn't come this way during golf season, generally in the winter time.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Holiday Star Theatre [Star Plaza Theatre]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In Merrillville [Indiana] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: This is when I was celebrity golfer at the Robert Trent Jones golf course [Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail] in Alabama.  It was about ten golf courses in a row.  We, we played a different one every day, and I stunk up the place, boy.  I couldn't bust a grape.  That's back when it was ninety-five, a hundred degrees here, and down in Alabama.
Speaker 1: I did, for Cosby [Bill Cosby], this is a, just to give him the idea of what this thing was going to look out.  And it's entitled, Dixie Hummingbirds [ph.], and I got that guy with the cue card, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Cue card, yeah. (Laughter) That's great.
Speaker 1: A calendar put out by--I think, Velin [ph.] and Kraft Food [Kraft Foods Inc.].  And the thing that gets me about this, you know, it was not a competition, but it was assemblies of twelve different artists, and we each had a month.  They took a kid, a young guy, and, and used his painting for the cover.  And, hey, we thought that was great, you know, a guy that, competing with Buck Brown, and all these other guys and stuff, and they choose his painting.  So, I asked them, I say, "Heck, man, what do they give you in addition," 'cause, you know, they had him out front.  And they unveiled the, the winning thing.  And he said, "Nothing."  How can you spotlight a kid like that, and then, and then, this is Kraft--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): And they didn't give him (unclear).
Speaker 1: --Kraft, Kraft Food, and they got all the money in the world.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) like you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Hey--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, tell us about the hand again.
Speaker 1: A gentleman stopped by my boat, booth, and he explained that he--no, he didn't explain, he just wanted to take pictures of my hand, so I felt so used after it was over.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): So used--you go wash (unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is at Johnny's tournament [Johnny Mathis Seniors Classic], out in the Iron Gate [sic. Mountain Gate Country Club] in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], back in '85 [1985].  I know that's when it was 'cause that's the only time we worked out there.  You know, and they gave us assignment of parking cars.  And so, we did that for about fifteen minutes.  And I said, "Do you care about parking the cars?"  They said, "No."  I said, "I don't either," so we--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Sir, when was this photo taken?
Speaker 2: This one?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was taken in 1968.  I had just, just done what you call a series, you know, more than one cartoon.  So, they had me up at Playboy.  And, and Alexas Urba, who was the hot photographer at the time, took, took that one, and a couple more.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is me at a charity fundraiser with three, three of my best friends.  It was supposed to be a charity fundraiser, and I'm slipping these guys chips and stuff.  I mean, you know, they might have hurt me.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, this is the only anthology I have.  And I had to get ugly and threaten to stop working.  You know, because I said, "Well, the other cartoonists have," you know, they were doing a run of 225,000.  And so, I'm sitting in the family room one morning reading the Sun-Times [Chicago Sun-Times], and it says Playboy Press sold.  They had sold it to a company, and they took the remaining 180,000 and shredded them.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, this is a sketch of something, some young cartoonist did at this cartoonists convention where I was, once again, the star.  I wasn't too torn up about it, but, you know, that's ten, ten years ago.  I wish I looked that well now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: Although my proportioning is off on this.  This is one of my most successful pieces.  The prints sell quite well.  And the village bought it and paid my price for it.  I mean, which is no more than, you know, that I could ask than that.  That's how everybody had just been so and--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  Here, we have here--
Speaker 1: That is my old friend, Greg Morris, from 'Mission: Impossible,' you know, the guy used to get you out of scrapes and all that.  We were at the Playboy Club up in Lake Geneva [Wisconsin] back in '71 [1971].  I think that was [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks golf tournament.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  Who are those people?
Speaker 1: The gentleman on the left is my son, Bob [Robert Brown III], just turned forty; his wife, Lisa [Lisa Brown (ph.)]; my wife, Mary Ellen [Mary Ellen Brown].  That's me next to her; and immediately next to me is John [John Hill (ph.)], my son-in-law; my daughter, Tracy [Tracy Brown Hill], and Little Maxwell [ph.].
