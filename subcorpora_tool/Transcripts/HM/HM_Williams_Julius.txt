But I used to like going there because, you know, I actually liked the food. The food was--(laughs). That was the main draw. But I think those family times, you know, when we would go to Montréal [Québec, Canada] or, you know, those kind of family trips. They always bring--And then the other family trip to visit some of my other family in New Jersey who would--That would be a big family thing. Now I think about the distances. It's nothing. But it was only a hundred and something miles. And it would be like a whole day trip. And at the time they didn't have interstate--What's that?  the Jersey Turnpike wasn't there. You had to go on one (unclear). and you'd have to go through all these little communities with these stop lights, you know. And you know. There would be this whole family trip to get there. And you'd do this. And so those memories, you know, always in my mind. I can go back and forth from Washington to New York like nothing. You know. That's only a few minutes in a trip. And now I'm thinking, it used to be wow. It used to be a long--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You know most people then and most--many people now who are New Yorkers don't own an automobile. Did your parents own an automobile?
Speaker 2: They finally got--Until I was--They got the first automobile when we moved to--got a house in Queens. Got our place in Queens. And then I remember the first--We got our first car.  We moved there I think 1960 or 1959, 1960. And we got the first car in 1963. It was blue Chevrolet--Well Impala I remember (laughs). We had this Impala. So that was the first time we were getting a car. It was so, you know. You know, cars were such--We never had. You know, we rode the train and the bus. But this was a, you know, exciting movement when we got this (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So that allowed you to have these trips. So. (unclear) Amish country.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Amish country and--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) the only way you could have gotten there.
Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah, the only way. Right. So it was exciting. You know, we'd get up--wake up and get in the car and drive this, you know. I'll always remember this Impala. It was so exciting, you know, so--. (laughs)

Speaker 1: What was the first instrument that you picked up and played?
Speaker 2: the first instrument was a, you know, it was a piano and an organ. I just sat there and I, you know, just started playing by ear.
Speaker 1: So where was this piano?
Speaker 2: It was, you know, I remember at my uncle's house. And I would go over there. And I would, you know. I would hear things. And that's when they realized that I, you know, had some musical ability.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Where was your uncle? In New Jersey?
Speaker 2: No, he was in New York too. It was my sister--They moved to Queens also. My sister--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So you went there to play the piano.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Who played the piano? Your uncle or--?
Speaker 2: He played the piano.
Speaker 1: Did he give you lessons or--?
Speaker 2: No, he just would play stuff and I would, "Oh that was good." and I would memorize it. And go later on and play it back.
Speaker 1: So the piano was your first instrument.
Speaker 2: the first instrument.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Not drums or anything.
Speaker 2: No. But actually I take that back. Yeah, My father they got me this drum set. And, you know, that was after I had started playing the piano. And then I went to my father and said, "I wanna play drums." So I had these drums and drove my father crazy. (laughs) He just couldn't take it.
Speaker 1: Uh--huh. How about your mother? Did she complain?
Speaker 2: (laughs) So next thing I know, I think the drums were gone. And they went and got me this piano (laughs). I was so upset with this piano. I was--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What kind of piano was it?
Speaker 2: It was--I never--It was an upright piano. I forgot the name. It was a company I'd never heard of before. But it was--It was an offshoot of one of the major companies. But they changed the name. And it was an upright. And I must have--Once I got that piano, I played that nonstop.
Speaker 1: How old were you roughly now? We're talking about?
Speaker 2: Now maybe by this time I was pretty old. By this time maybe nine, ten, eleven.
Speaker 1: Now did you have lessons? Did you practice on your own? How did you--?
Speaker 2: I was practicing and I just did it on my own.
Speaker 1: Did you have lessons?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any lessons until my--When I got to junior high school. In junior high school one of the teachers heard me play. And he said, "Oh he has some." You know. "Oh let me see what I can do. You have some talent."
Speaker 1: but how'd you learn to play?
Speaker 2: I just played by ear. Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) and did you read music at that point?
Speaker 2: No I didn't read music at all. You know. Then I got lessons. And the teacher--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) In junior high?
Speaker 2: Then the teacher would --What she would do would be--She would, you know, play the music. You know she--I would come. She would have the music there and have--You know. I would say, "How does it go?"  And she would play it. And then I would memorize it and come back next week. And she didn't know I didn't read any music that she had handed me. I just memorized what she did and came back. And that when on for about a year. You know. And then one day we had a little recital. A little formal recital thing. And somebody--Susie Anne or somebody and somebody else when to play their pieces. And I went to play mine. But Susie--I forgot. I don't know who wasn't there to play. And she said, "Julius come up. You know, you've been playing, you know, harder stuff. Come up and play." And I said, "No."  She said, "You can read this. Come on. Come on up." (laughs) Said, "No." She said, "Come up." (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did you have any notions at that point or any feelings in middle school that music might be your life in any kind of way?
Speaker 2: No. (laughs) I loved it. You know, I loved it. But I probably--The truth of the matter is I would have. Except I came upon--That's why it's so important--I came upon a teacher who made me hate music. It was a general music class. And the teacher just turned me off to--Not so much the music. But on reading music. And at that point, you know, I said, "I don't wanna be, you know, bothered with this." You know, as I look back on it, it wasn't the music. It was actually the teacher at that point. Then when I had another teacher in middle school who came in--two other teachers, then all of a sudden music was opened up. It was like, "Oh yeah. I loved this."

Speaker 1: Had you started playing at church at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was playing at church at this point.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You were? At which church?
Speaker 2: I forgot. I was playing at a Holy Sanctified Church. Boy it was good. They paid me ten dollars a Sunday. And all I'd do is go in, in and play. So they would just--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And you were a teenager now--you were--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a teenager. Right. So they would just start singing and I would just play.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's a lot of money in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was more money (laughs) than I had. So I started--and then things started (unclear). By this time, early teens I started--I ended up --A couple of people came into my life. One was--Two people. It was John Motley from the--He was the Director of Music at the Board of Education in New York and  Coleridge Taylor Perkinson who was at that time, you know--he wrote the score to 'A Warm December'. Sidney Poitier. And he was conducting a symphony called 'Symphony of the New World'. At that time he was, you know, he was the music director to the Barbara McNair show.  At that time.
Speaker 1: Perkinson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Perkinson.  He was probably the most, you know, African American next to--at that time next to Quincy Jones. (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did you know--Did he ever have an apartment on Riverside Drive [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had it on 70 west--Yeah, 75th West Riverside Drive.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I went to a party at his house.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) You did.
Speaker 1: And I remember he had a wall like this. He had walls. And he had it all covered with labels from wine bottles. Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) yeah, I remember. Yeah. People said--
Speaker 1: Am I talking about the right guy?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's him.
Speaker 1: We had a blast that night.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: It went all night long.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's was Perkin--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And I remember I was fascinated with all those label--wine bottles
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Wine bottles. Perkinson (unclear).
Speaker 1: I remember him well.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was at that time he was the hot ticket in, you know.
Speaker 1: I had never heard of him actually. But, you know, my friend at the time said that she knew somebody. And they knew we were going to this place. And I got to meet him. And people told me who he was. But I didn't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was big.
Speaker 1: I've never forgotten him.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was--Perk was (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well let me--Tell me about--I want you to come back and tell me about Motley and Perkinson and how they influenced you.
Speaker 2: Well Motley int--there was a couple more even more people I should mention there was a, you know, a lady named  Hulda Parker [ph.] who was another, you know, African American woman who said, "You have a lot of talent." You know. She was a, you know, a music teacher in junior high school.  Another guy named Carl Benjamin [ph.]. They saw me and they said, "You know--." They were African Americans. And they said, "You know, you have really--You don't know the talent that you have." And they and one other person named Richard Blankston. That's when I almost got--I was in high school in the first year. He saw, you know, tremendous talent in me. I couldn't sing.  I was the worst singer in the world. But he knew I could pick up things and, you know. I was--by that time I learned how to read. Because my teacher almost killed me, you know.
Story_ID: 15471
Speaker 1: You have been playing so long by ear and by sound, you just had the natural feeling to, to get it out. Was it difficult to move from that system to now having to be read the music?
Speaker 2: It was very difficult. It was like--I was telling you the story after the teacher found out that I was just picking up things by ear and not really reading what's on the page, she made me read. You know, I had to struggle.
Speaker 1: That didn't turn you off?
Speaker 2: Well it didn't turn me--Well what happened was when I met, you know, people like John Motley and [Coleridge Taylor] Perkinson and I saw them on stage and you know--a--doing a concert with the Symphony of the New World. And he had, you know--and he came out with this leather suit. And he was conducting the symphony. And I said, "Man! This guy." You know. And then I saw one of his pieces, you know. And then I heard this composition. Then I said, "I wanna--I wanna write music. I wanna be a composer." So in order to write music, you have to be able to read music. So then I kind of just totally did everything I could to learn how to read and write music. I must have just--It was like I immersed myself into it so much. That I did it all day long, all night. I started reading books and, you know. You know, just studying, you know.  Just what--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) At that point you knew what you wanted to do--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --with your life, I think  So--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right then. By the time I got in--I'd say by the second year of high school I knew what--there was nothing else I was gonna do.
Speaker 1: Had you picked up any other instrument at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was picking up the violin.  Wanted the violin so I started playing the violin. And I--I did that mainly to also boost my reading. But then I kind of, you know. So then I became, you know. You know. Started playing this violin and I'm, you know, playing the instrument (mimes playing violin).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Mm-hmm. Any other instruments that came in?
Speaker 2: Yeah. And then I started playing, you know, clarinet and flute and--you know, what else did I pick? (laughs) You know, trumpet for a while.
Speaker 1: Did you have instruction in these (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took--I took some classes. You know. But I mainly because I wanted to be a composer was concentrating on the piano. And meeting Perkinson and also Dizzy Gillespie. Perkinson introduced me to Dizzy Gillespie. Perkinson introduced me to Dizzy. Well then Dizzy got me, you know, to take some lessons with, you know, with his pianist.
Speaker 1: You're still in high school?
Speaker 2: I was still in high school. So, you know, he got me to take these lessons. You know. So I had all these influences. We were in high school. And in, in high school we were totally into music. Because then (unclear) John Motley--I was one--got into the All City High School Chorus. Then he sort of picked kids who were really talented.  And put them in his blue collar all city concert choir. And what we were doing then was we were the kids that would do any dignitaries that would come to New York, you know, from the Shah of Iran. And I remember one time to (unclear) to--We would--They would take us out of school.
Speaker 1: I mean almost every day, every week somebody's--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Every week somebody's coming to New York.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we'd get to stay. I don't know. I don't remember. My last two years of high school I don't know what went on then. Every week. They would just say--call the school and say, "You know, you have to be at such and such at this time." And we would just get (unclear) train and go.

Speaker 1: What high school were you attending at this point?
Speaker 2: At this time Andrew Jackson High School [of Music and Art, Queens, New York]. I was in. which is not even in existence any more.
Speaker 1: Where was the high school?
Speaker 2: In Queens. In Cambria Heights, Queens. Queens.
Speaker 1: Was it a big school?
Speaker 2: It was a big school. I think it had about--something like 5000 kids. You know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (Unclear) they had a large amount of kids. And there were three major schools. There was--They had Springfield High School and, and you know. But at that time it was designated as the music and art high school.
Speaker 1: Andrew Jackson?
Speaker 2: Andrew--Either you could go there or you could go to [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and] Performing Arts  in New York, or [ Andrew Jackson High School of] Music and Art. So at that time it was (unclear) the music. 'Cause they had the strongest music program in--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Beyond your being consumed with music and in love with music and all the lessons and practice and performing that you were doing in high school, what other kinds of experiences did you have in high school--non-musical? What was high school like for you?  You had academic subjects?
Speaker 2: Right, academic subjects. I used to cut a lot of those. But (laughs) no, I didn't. Actually I liked science. I was really learning chemistry. And so I loved anything to do with putting anything together I was good at. English, well it was okay. Math, I don't know what the problem was with, you know, certain math. Obviously because I can do, you know, the most you know, wildest calculations on the rhythmic aspects of--I mean the most difficult calculation that nobody else could figure out--as long as it had to deal with music (laughs). and something that, you know.  I used to couldn't figure out--"Why I can't do this?"
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I always thought of music and math being very similar. Music is mathematics.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It is mathematics.  You can sit here and we could talk about the most complex rhythmical (laughs) thing that goes on. And just regular math it was just--May--you know, I kind of thought that it had--For me it had no context. I couldn't figure out the--You know. Music I knew it had a particular--There was a reason for it. The other--you know, I don't care (laughs). You know.  That he's five feet over there and how long it take to meet. You know. So. But, you know, knowing later on now I know that I--I could have done it. I didn't feel like doing it.
Speaker 1: Oh I loved science in high school. I loved it. And I majored in biology and chemistry in college. And I hated math and didn't do well in it. But I could do the math if it was applied to--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  That's it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --the sciences.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Just pure math.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Just pure math, it was there was no kind--And I'm really--but if it was the most--It could be the most(unclear) the most complicated (laughs). Nobody else. How do you do that so easy and you can't do well--(laughs)?" but, you know. Basketball-- I loved to play in basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you play for the high school team?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played for the high school team. Now I never made the--You know, because then I got--I was on a--but then I started to worry about my fingers. 'Cause then I wanted to be a musician. So I was afraid of, you know, getting it jammed and, and, but I used to--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But you played on the varsity?
Speaker 2: Yeah, varsity team for a little while. Then, you know, it was only the first year. And then I just said, "Aw, forget that." (laughs).
Story_ID: 15473
Speaker 1: Before we get you out of high school, kind of moving towards high school graduation. But looking back on your growing up years, your teenage years, what sights, sounds or smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I think the sights and sounds and smells that are in my teenage years. By the time I was in junior--a sophomore and junior in high school, I was never at the high school that much. Because of, you know, we started to--I was getting called out. So I remember the sights, smells of New York City and, you know, meeting different people. Different. You know, I had--The one good thing I met so many people. You know, so many famous people. Artists, Roberta Flack to whoever came into New York, we met at that period of time. And it was, you know. You know, kind of like learning. You know, you're in that whole learning environment. You know, it was a good way, you know.  I would always say to my parents, "We have a concert. We have to go to, you know--."
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Were these concerts both instrumental and vocal? Or both?
Speaker 2: They usually were both. I used to end up doing--You know, I used to play some. I used to do some of the arrangement. And I used to sing.  I was just singing in the choir. You know. But I never really wanted to sing. Really what I was doing is, you know. Hearing, you know. You know, the musical context and looking at the pieces. And then, you know, I think John saw me, you know, sometimes as an accompanist and as a, you know, performer.
Story_ID: 15474
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: 1972.
Speaker 1: 1972. Okay. And what happened that summer when you came out of high school? Do you remember that first summer out of high school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember. At that time my first summer out of high school, what did I do? It was the--My mother [Julia Williams] got me this job.  No, what was it? First summer out of high school, I was working at Manhattan School of Music. At that time we had--There was a firm called the Teenage Performing Arts, excuse me, Workshop. Which was part of--at that time the CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] Program. And what--We were paid--We were some of the kids that were paid. They paid us to go and take classes in music. And we would take, you know, theory and harmony. And we would also be part of a major production. So it was, you know. I was kind--That whole summer all I did was totally immerse in you know making music.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you enter Lehman College [of the City of New York] and the Hartt School of Music [Bronx, New York] immediately following your high school graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I went to Lehman College, which was kind of--kind of strange. Because originally when we--I don't think my (unclear) my grades--music grades was up--my, my regular wasn't so--so we didn't apply. I don't think--I was the first one out of our family ever to go to college. They didn't know how to, you know. At that time like now they have the--I did take the SATs or something. But they didn't know really--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What the process was.
Speaker 2: What the process was. You know, now kids, you know. You get recruited. But at that time, they didn't know the process. And I think my teachers tried to get me to go to Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York]. And they accepted me at Manhattan School. But it was, you know. My parents [Julius P. Williams, Sr. and Julia Williams] said, "Too exhorbitant. " It was, you know $4,000 a year. Now I think of $4,000 a year (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now it's forty.
Speaker 2: Yeah, forty-one, forty two. Four thousand a year. So we looked at the university system. We were thinking of going to Queens. And then, you know, I met one of the people at the school and he said, "Well you should come to Lehman College. It's a wonderful new music school. And you know,." We didn't know it was free. So at that time it--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It was part of the City College?
Speaker 2: City College and City University of New York.
Speaker 1: Where is it located?
Speaker 2: In the Bronx.
Speaker 1: In the Bronx?
Speaker 2: In the Bronx.  The North Bronx. And so, you know. I said, "Well let me go." So I ended up in Lehman. I shouldn't have went. But it was excellent. It turned out fine.
Speaker 1: So you went to the high school of music there?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Lehman. Lehman High School of Music. I went to his graduate student.
Speaker 1: So you went to Lehman College as an undergrad.
Speaker 2: As an undergrad. Right.
Speaker 1: What did you study? Music?
Speaker 2: Music. I was a music major.
Speaker 1: It was a four year program?
Speaker 2: It was a four year program.  It's part of the--It the same as Queens College. Another--(unclear). and so it's a four year college. And it used to be Hunter College. You went to Hunter College in the Bronx.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was the first--When I went to Lehman, it had just became Lehman College. It was part of the Hunter (unclear).
Speaker 1: Was it satisfying?  Was it advancing you in music? Were you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well the first year was a mess. The first year was a mess. Because they, you know. They didn't know--The program was not really set up right. And, you know, I was in all these, you know, music courses not for music. It was history courses or something. You know. But then the next year, then it started to change.  And they started to build the music department. And, of course, then Ulysses Kay who was my teacher, you know, you know, you know, saw me. And he thought, "Well, you know, you're a talented kid." And I started to be the star of the music department. I mean I became--I had the reign of the music--I did whatever I felt like doing. I did recitals, con--I had my own jazz ensemble. At the time I was in the newspaper a lot. In the school newspaper and I--You know. I was like the star of the music--And maybe it was good in the sense that, you know, I didn't go to, you know, Manhattan School of Music at the time or try to get Julliard [School, New York, New York] I went to this music department that was, you know, not large. And so I had total run of the place (laughs).
Speaker 1: And Ulysses Kay was a teacher in that department.
Speaker 2: He was distinguished at the time. He was a distinguished professor in the depar--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now tell us who he was and what's his impact, and mentorship was to you? What--?
Speaker 2: Well Uly Kay is--he--there are two African American firm, one is William Grant Still.  In fact they have a William Grant Still thing coming out. And the other is Uly, Uly Kay. Uly Kay is, Ulysses Kay was the first major African American composer who established a, you know, major career you know, the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] Orchestra played his music. If you think of--In fact, in many books they think of William Grant Still as dean of composers. But Ulysses Kay is one of the, the, the beginning of African American composers' historical movement.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: K-A-Y.
Speaker 1: K-A-Y, no E.
Speaker 2: No E. All right. He--he--he was--There was two distinct--In the city university systems they had what they called distinguished professorships. And two--one was Ulysses Kay and the other one--in music--was John Corigliano. You know, a major composer also.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And how do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: C-R-O-I-G-L-I-A-N-O [sic] and you may have to look it--John Corigliano.
Speaker 1: Corigliano.
Speaker 2: Corigliano. His father was the, the concert master of the New York Philharmonic for years and years and you know, but. But Uly Kay was, you know, out of all, whole New York City he was a major composer. And he saw me. He thought I had a lot of talent--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So what did Mr. Kay, Ulysses Kay mean to you at that point and time? And what did he do?
Speaker 2: Well he--because at one point I wanted to be a pop music star (laughs)  as Coleridge Taylor Perkinson, kind of, you know, Uly Kay gave me grounding to be this, you know, this serious classical concert music composer. And, you know, understanding, you know, the serial and the techniques of things that, you know, I never had. He studied with [Paul] Hindemith who was a major composer. And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Hinderman?
Speaker 2: Hindemith.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: H-I-N-D-E-, T-H-, M-I-T-H I think. Hindemith. Well we'll look it up. And so he, you know, he was the major influence, you know.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did you compose anything during your four years at Lehman that stands out in your career that you composed and--?
Speaker 2: Well I started composing in high school. By the time I was in third year in high school--Another composer his name was--Another person. I had all these mentors kind of. His name was Fred Norman. And Fred Norman was the arranger for Brook Benton. He did all the Broo--And Dinah Washington. If you don't--all the Dinah Washington recordings Fred Norman would do all the orchestration and arranging of those recordings in music.
Story_ID: 15475
Speaker 1: You were talking about Norman.
Speaker 2: Right. Fred Norman was a, you know. He saw me too when I did something, he'd say--he said--And he said I was--John Motley actually introduced me. He said that, "Go and study with him." So I would go to his house--he wouldn't charge me anything--him and his wife house--and he would, you know, give me these lessons, you know. I would bring my piece there and he would just say, "Well I don't think-- Let me show you." And he said, "He was the most talented--." You know, he told me later on, "You were the most talented kid" he ever saw. You know. I just came in and started orchestrating. And I'm like oh yeah. And he would give me these lessons. So he was, you know, years of how to write for orchestra.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) when you compose now, you have to write something for each of the instruments. Is that right?
Speaker 2: Right, right. So, you know. I just had the ability just to write it, you know, just to write it down for orchestra, for band for whatever. And he--but he showed me how to really do orchestration and arranging. Because and he would take me also. Between him and Coleridge Taylor Perkinson, they would take me to, you know, to you know, their recording sessions. To symphonic ensembles and to, you know. And I would hear all those things. In fact, by the time I was, you know, my first year in college, I--the New York Yankees asked me to, to, you know, write music for them. So it was a, you know. It was a good, you know, time.

Speaker 1: You graduated from Lehman College [Bronx, New York]. And all these experiences with all the mentoring and assistance, then you went on to further study?
Speaker 2: Yeah. After that I graduated from Lehman College. Then I went to--I'm trying to remember. Then I went to--from that point I went to--I got married. And then I went to--I got a job at Wesleyan University [Middletown, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Who did you marry?
Speaker 2: Lenora Williams. At the time Lenora Sampson and she was a singer also. We knew each other 'cause she was also in the choir in New York.
Speaker 1: You mean the high school choir?
Speaker 2: Yeah, high school choir.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (laughs) Also--so she was a singer. And then, you know. Now she's a M.D. But at that time (laughs) she was singing. And I got married. I must have been twenty--two. And then I ended up on the faculty at Wesleyan directing the gospel choir at that time.
Speaker 1: Now that was in what year? That was--?
Speaker 2: 1970 something. Or maybe--But we got--1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there. And then I ended up going to The Hartt School of Music.
Speaker 1: Now where is the Hartt School of Music then?
Speaker 2: In Connecticut.
Speaker 1: In Connecticut.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What city?
Speaker 2: It's in Hartford. West Hartford, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Oh okay. West Hartford.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did you study there? How long were you--?
Speaker 2: There I was a conducting major. I got a, a thing as a conductor in music education, in conducting. Because at that time they didn't have an orchestra conducting program. So they had to--You know, you know, now schools they have the, you know. You can just major. I had to take music education and major in orchestral conducting.
Speaker 1: Had you done any conducting before you went to Hartt?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I did some conducting with--'Cause I was being taught by Coleridge Taylor Perkinson and you know. But I got some things. I started doing, you know. In college I mentioned before in Lehman, you know, I wrote a piece for band at the time for the school band. And I got a chance to conduct that. And then I remember we were with the--what I really wanted to do, when I saw Perkinson do a concert with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company with the, with the orchestra. And then I knew that's what I wanted to do. And so I started, you know, studying conducting and wanting to be a conductor.
Speaker 1: How long were you at Hartt?  How long was that?
Speaker 2: I was there for two years. And I got, you know, my master's degree there. You know, in conducting.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you were married at this point?
Speaker 2: I was married at this time.
Speaker 1: And you said your wife is a physician. When did she--was in med school, where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to the University of Connecticut med school [Farmington, Connecticut] She was at the time--She went actually before that. She went into--she was a teacher. She got a job as a teacher in biology. Originally she got a--she was a double--I think in biology and music. You know, (laughs). and so--and then she said, "She didn't wanna be poor like me." So she went into (laughs) med school.
Speaker 1: Is she practicing today?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What's her specialty?
Speaker 2: Ob-Gyn [obstetrics and gynecology].
Speaker 1: My daughter's an Ob-Gyn.
Speaker 2: Oh good. (laughs)
Speaker 1: I know a little bit about that.
Story_ID: 15477
Speaker 1: So we finish with a master's degree in conducting. Hartt School of Music [West Hartford, Connecticut]. What was the next step? Where'd you go from there?
Speaker 2: Well then things started changing. Then I ended up--At the time even though I was going through Hartt School of Music, I was at the time I had became the Assistant Director of Music at Abyssinian [Baptist Church, Harlem, New York] also. And I was, you know, going from--and working--At the time I was working--I was younger. So I had a lot--I was doing the choir at Wesleyan University [Middletown, Connecticut] and a visiting fellow at Wesleyan. And I would go back and forth. But then I decided to go to Aspen. The Aspen Music Festival to become a--To study conducting.
Speaker 1: At the Aspen Music--?
Speaker 2: Festival [and School, Aspen, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Is that a school?
Speaker 2: A school. The Aspen Music School.
Speaker 1: Where is that?
Speaker 2: In Aspen, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell us about that experience.
Speaker 2: Well that was different. You know, there was me. There was--At first I was the only African American. (laughs) It was very few African Americans in--as conductors. And I think I was the only one at that time. I'm--I think--I was the only African American. And I went there to study conducting. I stayed, you know, three months in Aspen just, you know. But the experience was good. Because the experience--I ended up meeting major artists and stars that I would probably meet later on in classical music. Later on in my career that came about you know. It helped about a lot. So that was my, you know--I spent a summer there. You know, conducting. And there was music going around. I guess it's the same as like Tanglewood [Institute, Lenox, Massachusetts]. Tanglewood. There's you know. And I think that really put me on the track to be a, you know, to be a conductor. That was, you know, the first time I had a real chance to work with, you know, professional string players or string players who were at a high level. And, you know, and who--And I was able to see a lot of, you know, conductors. You know, the whole summer. All I saw was music, music, music. And, you know, it really was  you know, a kind of life-changing experience.
Speaker 1: Any particular conductors that were very influential in your experience there that you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I don't think there were any--of them individually, you know. I think just watching, learning from them, all the different ones. I got a chance to see what they do in rehearsal. I got a chance to see, you know, different levels of orchestras. We--In Aspen they had six orchestras. And they have a concert, two concerts, three concerts every week. So, you know, seeing these different ensembles. And then part of also, I think when I came there because I got a fellowship. Part of my fellowship since I couldn't afford it, of course, was to help audition all the string players. So by the time, you know, my first couple of weeks, I must have seen every, you know, 300 to 400 string music--players. But then that taught me, you know, people interaction. How to evaluate people, you know, students at a high level. I was brought to another realm of students. You know. Most of them came from [The] Juilliard [School, New York, New York] and you know. All the major, you know, music schools in the country. And so that really created a whole kind of a affect. And then I met another person who became my very dear friend. Her name was Sandra Rivers. Now Sandra--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Sandra Rivers?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Now Saundra is African American. She was the only other African--I saw this woman running up to the stage. And I'm saying, What's she doing, you know, going up there?" She was--She plays for Itzhak Perlman, all the major, you know, Isaac Stern and all the major, you know. But she won the Tchaikovsky competition. And she went to Juilliard and was, you know, a fantastic performer. And so Sandy and I became friends. So, you know, I started to make a network there. In fact, I ended up going back to Aspen for four years after the first year. Then I became a fellow the next year. And then the next couple of years they made me composer/conductor scholar fellow--a professional fellow in residence. And, you know, I really got to see all the professional, you know, people involved.

Speaker 1: I'm not a musician. I don't know that much about music. I enjoy listening. But for this interview and for those people who will listen to your interview over the years, what does a conductor have to know and know how to do in order to conduct? What is your field of knowledge? And what are the skills--what do you have to be able to do to be a conductor?
Speaker 2: It's kind of funny. My students always think, you know, it's kind of--Always around the middle of semester, they say, "this is hard." (laughs) This is a hard thing. I didn't know you had to do all this.' But the conductor not only do you have to, you know, you have to have the physical--It's like being a mime. When I move my hands I'm actually giving--I'm communicating with the ensemble. But you also have to be able to hear all the parts that are going, with everybody playing. You have to be able to read the score which, you know, there's maybe thirty instruments on the score. You have to be able to, you know, read each line. And then you have to also be able to create what's going on.
Speaker 1: You're saying in one score encompasses, embraces the different instruments?
Speaker 2: Right. One score--so if I'm having the orchestra score, you know, starting from the top you have the flutes. Then you have the oboes, clarinets, bassoons, the horns, the trumpets, trombones. Then the percussion, maybe piano and then you have violins, first second. Viola, cello and bass. And they're all on one score. And you have to be able to read the whole score down and see--You have to read it down and see what it sounds like. And you have to read where the music is going this way all at the same time. So, you know, it's a, it's a monumental task.  And then you have to be able to be a good leader. You know, you have to have the personality to control, you know, a hundred people in front of you, you know, all with their own mission (laughs). you know, statement (laughs).
Speaker 1: And you have first violin, second violin, third violin?
Speaker 2: Yeah, first violin, second violin (unclear). You got first clarinet, second clarinet--oboes, flutes, two flutes, two bassoons, two trumpets or three trumpets, maybe four horns, tympani, you know, you have you know all the basses. Cellos, basses, violas. You have you know, percussion instruments in the back, harp. And any other thing that is joined. Sometimes a chorus in front of you. So you have to be able to control all these forces. This large monumental force.
Story_ID: 15479
Speaker 1: You have a very, very extensive list of symphonies and operas and chamber orchestras that you've conducted. And conducting, conducting, conducting from what I've read. You've been in Savanna [Georgia], Dallas [Texas], Sacramento [California], Hartford [Connecticut], Vermont, Tulsa [Oklahoma], New Haven [Connecticut]. Tell us about some of these conducting experiences. Are they short term? Long term?
Speaker 2: Well usually, you know, I get guest conducting appearances. Well, you know, now that I'm, you know, you come in and you do the performance and you leave the city. Some of them are a little bit longer. But they, you know, it's one thing it's good when you go to a difference city 'cause it's different every time. You know. It's a--your orchestra usually is--in many cities it's the kind of prestige kind of artistic, you know, museum of life. This is what we are. We're sophisticated. 'Cause we are the symphony orchestra. So, you know, when you go and visit a city and you perform with it, you get a whole inflection of the type of people. What they're doing. The instrumental concept, you know. What the, you know, the sco--And usually when I go--A lot of times I visit the schools. You know, talk to the music students and--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What is the last big city you were in where you conducted a symphony orchestra or--what's the--?
Speaker 2: I think the last city I was in was a couple of weeks ago. In Akron, Ohio with the Akron Symphony.
Speaker 1: And what'd you do there?
Speaker 2: And this--We did a concert called 'Gospel meets Symphony' or something like that. And it was actually a lot of fun. What I do is try to put, you know, classical music on the program as well, as give a whole different--maybe spirituals. You know, give a whole comp--. But it was interesting 'cause I'd never been in Akron, Ohio.
Speaker 1: So you go there and you're commissioned to do--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Work for--How long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there for a week. But it usually takes longer than a week to plan the program. Because in this particular city they had the city-wide chorus. They used a chorus made of people in the community. Then you have the--Then, of course, the orchestra is there. And then, you know, and the soloist. So it's like putting together a big thing. And then this last concert there was 3000 people at the performance. and you know, evidently from all the reviews they loved me. (laughs)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Tell me about another of your favorite cities that you've been to maybe once or twice where you conducted? And the type of, of group that you conducted. What are some of your other favorites that just stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Well my favorite city I think conducting was in Europe. I--you know, I love going to Prague [Czech Republic].
Speaker 1: Prague?
Speaker 2: You know. I've done the Prague radio symphony a couple of times. I've done the [Bohuslav] Martinu Symphony and the--In fact I've been back to Prague at least five times in concert. You know. Because it's such a beautiful city. With the, you know, with the [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart, 'Don Giovanni' was there. So you got a whole picture of all, you know, the European musical life style. And also you see history. You know, from World War II. And, you know, you see a whole different idea. But in the United States there are many cities--I like going, you know, when I went to Savanna Georgia, that was fun. You know. You just can't--I can't describe it. It's like getting the flavor of the town, the people. And being African American, I mention that to, you know, sometimes, you, you know, most people don't know there are any African American conductors. You know, they're quite a few now. Maybe not quite a few. There're maybe about ten or eleven. Not quite a few. But there's a lot more. But, you know, it's a different, you know--They usually ask, you know, "Are you a rap artist? (laughs) or, you know, you know, what kind of music do you do?" you know. When you tell them you're a conductor they say, "That's different." (laughs)
Speaker 1: I noticed in reading information on your work, that you've conducted in Serbia and Croatia?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you go there and how did that happen?
Speaker 2: They asked me to come to do a tour with a orchestra called--I can't even pronounce it. Volnidvina [sic, Volvodanska] Symphony Orchestra. It was--not far from Belgrade [Serbia and Montenegro, formerly Yugoslavia]. And actually this was just before the war broke out. And the president Musta--I can't say the name. [Slobodan] Milosevic because he had just became--just became the new president. And the orchestra when I came was just, you know. A couple of weeks they asked me to come and appear with this orchestra and take it on tour. And here--I don't know how they heard of me, but they asked. And it was great. They paid me here in the United States (laughs) before I even got there. And I got there and they gave me--And it was a really good orchestra. Because at the time, the orchestra was full of Serbs, Croatians, you know. All the ethnic--Muslims--all the ethnic groups. And it was--you know--they saw this African- --and what's so interesting is color had nothing to do with it. They saw, "Oh, you know, this guy is coming to conduct this orchestra." And we did it. We toured a lot of different cities. It was really great at the time. But then one ominous thing went on. I remember one night one of the--I finished a concert. And--they liked jazz too. They always wanted to go play jazz after we do a concert in the afternoon. You know. Th- one of the major promoters came up. You know, we're sitting talking. He said, "Well how do you like the orchestra?" and I said, "Oh it's wonder--." "How do you like conducting the orchestra?"  "Oh it's a great orchestra." And then he said, "We have to get rid of some--" You know. "We have to clean the orchestra out. We have a new President. And we really gotta do some stuff to be sure that the orchestra is, is, is pure." And I didn't know what that meant. (laughs) I had no idea what that meant.  I went, "Okay."  And then when I got back to the States a couple of weeks later, we had all this stuff with the--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well I saw you had been there. I said, now was he there before or after?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah. Just before, yeah. In fact, I was there before that. Before that, I came 'cause they did my opera. I did part of my opera 'Guenevere'. At the time it was at the--They did it at the Arts festival in--Not (unclear). What's the city that Ron Brown's plane went down? It's on the coast. The old city. [Dubrovnik] And that used to be one of the major music and arts festivals in the world. That was the third major music and art festival in the world. And I think maybe that's when they first sung and I went and conducted there.
Speaker 1: How do you spell 'Guenevere'?
Speaker 2: G-U-E-N-E-V-E-R-E.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: I think (laughs).
Speaker 1: I have it. But we have to have it for the record too. In addition to your conducting, of course, your composing is also very, very significant. You've composed for dance, musical theater, film, you've composed for symphonies and operas and so on. Tell me about your composing and what were your biggest advances in composing? When did all that come together for you?
Speaker 2: I think, you know, my--I go through these periods. One day I'm a composer, the next day I'm a conductor. I think my biggest--What first helped me out as a composer was I think I'd have to say Zubin Mehta, with New York Philharmonic. Because Zubin asked to do one of my compositions. You know, being, you know, I think at the time, you know, in my 20s. And, you know, somebody's who's the music director of the Philharmonic says, "I wanna do one of your pieces." That's a major, you know, a major thing. Most people their whole life would never get the New York Philharmonic to play any of their music. And I think he saw me do something or arrange something. And he said, "Oh I would like to see some of your music." And I sent him one of my pieces. And out of the clear blue sky the New York Philharmonic called and said, "We wanna do one of your pieces."
Speaker 1: And his name again?
Speaker 2: Zubin Mehta.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: Z-U-B-I-N his other name M-E-H-T-A.
Story_ID: 15480
Speaker 1: What's the difference between composing and arranging?
Speaker 2: Well composing is your piece. It's your composition. You actually, you know, --.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Your creation.
Speaker 2: Your creation. Arranging, you can be--it could be somebody else's piece, but you're fixing it for--You're not fixing it. But you're, you know, you're writing it for a particular ensemble or orchestra, band or chorus. And writing in your style. But you don't actually own the piece.
Speaker 1: The reason I asked is, you know, I've done a lot of reading. And you said you're writing Roland Hayes. And I also interviewed his long time accompanist who's now deceased. But apparently they would argue and bicker with each other about who arranged what. And I remember his pianist telling me, "You know, Willie claims he did all the arranging." But he said, "I did the arranging."
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: I just wanna share that with you. But I wanted the audience to listen to your--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) to know. 'Cause I wanted to be clear.
Speaker 2: Yeah. (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay. [Henry Thacker] Harry Burleigh was one of the first African American arrangers. But you certainly didn't know him now. 'Cause he passed.
Speaker 2: No I didn't know him. But, you know, I knew his--I knew his-- Lin [ph.] Burleigh his--who was related to him. And, and--but, you know, I was always intrigued. I try--My whole life I'm always trying to make sure that, you know, I--touched African American composers and artists. I try to--I try to, you know, study them and read about them and look at their music.
Speaker 1: Well in 1999 at the twentieth anniversary of the Tri--C Jazz fest in Cleveland [Ohio] , you conducted there, or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I did--.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And it was a Duke Ellington sacred music?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: That was fun.  You know, they had the Duke Ellington's 'Sacred Service'. I think I, you know, It hasn't been done that much. But it was a wonderful experience. You know, I had an opera star Florence Cavar, you know, major opera singers, jazz singers. It was a wonderful thing. We did the 'Sacred Service' which he did in New York. You know, I forgot at which church it was. I think--Can't come to mind. I don't remember. But these services were a blend of religion and his music and the jazz. And, you know, they were eight part, you know, some dance. Some singing, some choral singing, big band arrangements and, you know, interspersed with his own style of musical performance.
Speaker 1: You were talking about the Duke Ellington sacred music program that you did in 1999 in Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know Duke Ellington?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't. I wish I did. I ended up writing an article for 'Merge' magazine, you know, stating how important his musical contribution was even in my life, you know, when I think about it. And what his commitment meant. But I would have loved to--and, you know, the strange thing? I met everybody else. And I didn't meet (laughs) Duke Ellington. And he was alive. And I met every other major artist that ever came.  And he's the only one that I didn't get a chance to meet.
Speaker 1: Count Basie?
Speaker 2: I met Count [William] Basie many times. In fact, like I mentioned I did the Count Basie--his funeral. I was music director at the--You know, I actually put together the music and did the music for the funeral at Abyssinian [Baptist Church, Harlem, New York].
Speaker 1: At Abyssinian?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The Baptist church in New York.
Speaker 1: Lionel Hampton?
Speaker 2: Lionel Hampton I met a couple of times. I didn't know him well, but I met him. You know, he's a wonderful, he was a wonderful funny person too (laughs). And actually very talented (unclear).
Speaker 1: Ella Fitzgerald?
Speaker 2: Ella Fitzgerald I met once. And met her in a program. Where was I at? It was either--It was in New York for something. It was--I think it was at a church thing, I met her once. You know, I never met her in concert. I would have loved to.
Story_ID: 15481
Speaker 1: There's a CD [compact disc] of African American symphonic music. And it's entitled 'Symphonic Brotherhood'. Tell me a little bit about the genesis of that and the content.
Speaker 2: Well (unclear)--I didn't have at the time--I didn't have any recording. And I wanted to record some composers of African American music. And the only--It's hard to get the--Because of the orchestras in the U.S., is--would have been wonderful. But the cost is just overwhelming. So I went to Albany Records at the time and asked them to--would they like a recor--In fact, I asked a couple of record-- Albany said, "Oh sure. We would love to have an, you know, a recording that would show African American in concert music form." You know. The other one was done by Paul Freeman which was done by CBS in the early--late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s]. But that was basically at that time out of print. And they said, "We would love to. You know, Why don't you--We would like to do a series." The series never happened. But I went and said, "Okay." And I got an orchestra [the Bohuslav Martinu Philharmonic]. And at this time in Zlin. The city of Zlin, Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic]. They said they would do it for--The cost was very, very low. Actually it was very good. And so then I asked a composer like David Baker who was at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana]. And I wanted to have one younger composer and one older composer. And David Baker was a, you know, a jazz musician educator. But also an African American composer of, of, of ability--I called him. And then another composer I asked--His name was Adolphus Hailstork who is now very, you know. His music is being performed all over. And he said, "Of course, Julius." And then I got a younger composer named Gary Nash Powell, who was at the time only twenty. So what I tried to do is get a span of history. You know, the older composer--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You had [Henry Thacker] Harry Burleigh in there too.
Speaker 2: And I went and researched Harry Burleigh--A piece from Harry Burleigh that was from--called 'The Young Warrior' that was when he wrote for the Italian troops. Harry Burleigh was loved by the Italians. The company that published his music was Recordy. And he was good friends with the people in Italy. They love Harry Burleigh You know he does arrangements. And so this piece he wrote for them in the early--I'm not quite sure-- '40s [1940s], '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s]. And I had to go and find the piece and get it from the Library of Congress. And then I, of course, put two of my pieces in the program. Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: A review of this CD--and I'm quoting--It says, "the fact that the five composers on this recording,  Adolphus Hailstork, Harry  Burleigh, Julius P. Williams, Garry Powell Nash, David N. Baker are of African descent will become clear only when viewing their photographs. The music should have already made an impact."
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: Tell me about the marketing and the success of that.
Speaker 2: Well the marketing success--(unclear). the marketing was good. Because, you know, people, you know, they know African American as, you know, in popular music culture. But they don't know, you know, the depth and the breath of African American concert composers. And so this was, you know, a wonderful review. In fact, that was one of the--the other review was not so wonderful. Because the reviewer mentioned that, you know, "Well why are they doing the music of the African American composers?" You know. "Just do the music alone. Why mention African American?" But I think, you know, we have a duty to show that, you know, that we are a wonderful community and that we have a breadth of all types of musical cultures. Not just one style. And so I was happy, you know. Even my composers today we always say, "Should we let them know that we're African American?" but I think we should. And I think you can listen to it. And you can--You can hear some of our culture come through. I don't care who it is. You can hear some of it there. But, you know, (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now what was your contribution to the 'Symphonic Brotherhood'? What was the piece that you had?
Speaker 2: Well the piece that I wrote was from my cantata called 'Easter Celebration'. And that cantata was commissioned by Shenandoah Conservatory in Virginia [at Shenandoah University, Winchester, Virginia] when I was a DuPont scholar. They invited me to Shenandoah to write a piece for all the ensembles on (chuckling) in the school and present it at Easter time. So it was written for Chorus and orchestra and soloists and the nurses (unclear). And, you know. And I decided to use two of the movements for this. One of the movements was orchestral music called 'Meditation'. And the other movement was a song called 'Is it True?' You know. It's, you know, the story--the true story so forth and so on. So, you know, I decided to put that in a recording and, you know, and people seemed to like it.

Speaker 1: You're the co-director of is it VIDEMUS?
Speaker 2: VIDEMUS.  VIDEMUS.
Speaker 1: VIDEMUS?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: V-I-D-E-M-U-S.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. When did you commence this activity? What is that about?
Speaker 2: Well VIDEMUS is a--in fact we're very thriving. It started actually in Boston [Massachusetts]. It started with a company called--I'm losing my train of thought (laughs)--I'll remember in a second. But it started in Boston with a company at--from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] under--Vivian Taylor started this company where they would bring African Americans to Boston to do concerts. Chamber concerts of African American music. Then it was taken over by Louise Toppin, who's a singer and moved the company to Louisiana. And when she moved it to Louisiana--Not Louisiana, North Carolina--I'm losing it--North Carolina.  She wanted to have--I'm trying to--I'm stalling 'cause I'm trying to remember the name. She moved it to [East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina]--she wanted to create a recording entity in this company. Because, you know, it's music and it would be good to have a recording of African American music. So three of us composers, myself and another composer named William Banfield and Louise Toppin started the company called Visionary Records. And the company is called--It is called VIDEMUS. But the recording company is called Visionary Records. And VIDEMUS became an entity not only for performing and doing concerts, but became an entity for African Americans to have their music heard on CD [compact disc]. And right now, VIDEMUS itself the company has about ten or fifteen records associated with it over the years. And Visionary Records, we're on our third recording or fourth recording. The last recording I made just recently. Not recently--In 2001 was a--was a Visionary Record recording.

Speaker 2: Oh. William Grant Still was the Dean of African American composers. He's really was the first African American composer to really--I guess in the white media to be up there with Aaron Copland and some of the great composers of the time. Aaron Copland--American composers--Charles Ives. So he, you know, is known as, you know, William Grant Still is our father of African American (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What was his period of time period?
Speaker 2: He was in the early, you know, maybe the late '20s [1920s] to about the '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s].

Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh many. I've had--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Which ones stand out in your mind?

And I took the--was asked by the White House to come and perform, you know. And we did a concert and I had a chance to--You know, they took me around and went to the President's office.

Speaker 2: I think it was his first terms. Yeah. It was his first term. And it was a--It was a wonderful experience. You know, I got the chance to go into the, you know, sit in the press room and realize this is where they sit (laughs). This is y'know--they had a pool--this is where they put the press?  You know, so. You know. But, you know, it was wonderful. You know, we did a concert.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) How long did you conduct the Washington Symphony? Is that a--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was three years, three years.
Speaker 1: Three years. Now was that a full-time?
Speaker 2: It was--No, it was part--time. But, you know, it was--Washington Symphony was the--th--there's a national symphony which is, you know. We always had problems. Because the Washington Symphony was the official orchestra of the city of Washington [D.C.]. And actually they were doing--They were in existence for sixty-three years. So just as long as the National Symphony. But evidently the National Symphony had something the Washington had (laughs)--didn't have (laughs). and they got most of the funding and they got the Kennedy Center [for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.] built for it.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. You know. So--But I was there for three years. I'm still, you know, not the music director. But the Laureate Conductor. And I still advise them in, you know. And every once in a while I go and do a concert with them. But it was being in Washington. I got to meet all the politicians and the pundits, the TV pundits and knew how Washington worked. Because I had to--Part of being a music director is also fundraising. So, I, you know, was part of the University club there. Which had, you know, all the people, who were, you know, supreme court judge, Judge [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg to, y'know, Sandra Day O'Connor to anybody who's anybody. You know, I got to know them because I was in Washington. And, you know, the congressmen. I would speak to the different constituencies to try to get money for the orchestra and do performances. And we'd be--We did a couple of performances. We invited major artists like, you know, Dionne Warwick to, you know, Oleta Adams to, you know. We did a thing called 'Symphony with the Divas'. Like women singers from different avenues of musical sounds. And, you know, from classical artists to jazz artists to pop. To the Clark Sisters to whatever. And it was--I mean it was fun. You know, I had a good time. But at the same time I was still working here at Berklee [College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 15484
Speaker 1: I wanted to come back to Boston [Massachusetts]. Tell me about your association with the Boston Symphony Orchestra? Have you--What have you done with them--?
Speaker 2: The only thing I did with the Boston Symphony is recently. It was last year.  Wynton Marsalis had his piece 'All Rise'. The Boston Symphony asked me to come and, you know, talk about the piece and give a critique about the music. And, you know, they did a seminar for the--educational seminar for the Boston Symphony. They have asked me to some associate with--We're still negotiating an association with the Boston Symphony.
Speaker 1: That's in process?
Speaker 2: That's processing. And I'm hoping to (laughs) how do I say this nicely? Hope that it still work out in a way (laughs) that, you know. There's--Boston is one of the cities, you know, with the, you know. The connection is still a little bit apart (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You've been here at the Berklee School of Music [Boston, Massachusetts] for ten years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for ten years.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. When you first arrived you were teaching what?
Speaker 2: When I first arrived I, you know, I was teaching--I've been with--I was teaching conducting. You know. In fact I'm still teaching basically what I was teaching then (laughs) when I first arrived.
Speaker 1: Were you full-time then?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, no I wasn't,  I was part-time.
Speaker 1: So you've always been part-time here at Berklee?
Speaker 2: No, I was part-time until about--I'm full-time now. I was--full-time actually teaching less than I was teaching part-time. But until about three, three and a half years ago. But I was part-time. And in a way I had to be part-time. Because I was, you know, going back and forth to Washington [D.C.]. At the time I was also at Skidmore College [Saratoga Springs, NY]. And I was director of orchestra at Skidmore. So I was--been all over the place.
Story_ID: 15485
Speaker 1: You mentioned your marrying your wife who was a high school sweetheart and in music also. And you have a family of how many children?
Speaker 2: I have three kids.
Speaker 1: Do--Have your family wife and children--have they traveled with you to these various sites when you've been conducting or teaching? Have they made any of these trips?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well they're used to me gone (laughs). Maybe that's why I'm still married 'cause I'm never home. So (laughs). That's why my wife says, "Good. When do you leave? When is your next trip (laughs)?" No.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Tell me about your three children, the oldest, the middle and the youngest.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well--.
Speaker 1: Give me their names and what they're doing.
Speaker 2: Yeah. My oldest is Julius III in another line of Juliuses. He's a musician also. He, you know, he graduated from NYU [New York University] in vocal performance. And right now he's teaching music in Conn--Windsor, Connecticut. And he's going to grad school.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) How old is he?
Speaker 2: He's twenty-six now. So I mean he actually went to Berklee [College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts] for a while.
Speaker 1: Oh he did.
Speaker 2: He went to, you know, some extra studies. 'cause he wanted to study music and business. But he's a musi--he can play the piano. Wonderful singer.  You know. Yeah. My daughter is, you know, she goes to Loomis Chaffee [School] in Har-, in Windsor [Connecticut]  --it's like a private high school country club.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I've heard of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And her name and age?
Speaker 2: She's sixteen. Her name is Ariel Williams. And then my youngest son his name is Malcolm Williams. He's twelve, he's gonna be thirteen.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm. Is he interested in music?

Speaker 1: (Laughs).Is that right?
Speaker 2: He wants to be a football--.
Speaker 1: Your oldest son is going to continue your legacy, your legacy.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Yeah.
Story_ID: 15486
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd like to talk about or add to this interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: You know, how difficult is it to become a conductor. It's a road that is a--I wanna--I'm tempted--A friend of mine wants me to put--to write a book (laughs). You know, how did I get to be where I got to be? And (unclear) a lot of turns and movements to get to the point where I'm at. Because, you know, at the certain point when I started, you know, most people will--In fact, there was a period, you know, where, you know, I used to play for a lot of popular artists and jazz artists. I had to use another name. Because I couldn't be associated with that if I was gonna be considered a symphonic conductor. In fact, I couldn't even conduct a choir. Had to change the name. You couldn't even conduct because--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I was just gonna ask you how you then survived and maneuvered around it?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's really interesting. You know, to think about it. Because if you get, you know, all the, you know, working in churches and doing, you know. We have access to, you know, choirs. And most African Americans, you know, musicians have been wonderful, are major choir directors. But if you are seen as a choir director, they will not let you in front of an orchestra.
Speaker 1: Not let you--?
Speaker 2: In front of conducting  an orchestra. You are not--they will not even let you look at it. They would say, "Prepare the choir and you'll do the concert." So it's been, you know, the trick to, you know, establish an identity as a symphonic conductor. Which has always been a very strong mainstream program. Because most of the symphonic, you know, boards of directors at the time I first started were, you know, blue-haired people that controlled, you know, things that (unclear). So it's been--interesting (laughs), you know, travel to get to the point, yeah. (laughs)
Story_ID: 15487
Speaker 1: I was just looking at my notes. And I wrote this down earlier because I--It was a film score.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, I've done a couple.
Speaker 1: (Unclear). The one I was interested in that simply just caught me, 'What Color is Love'?
Speaker 2: Right. It was a film I did. Actually it was in Boston. It was about a film of interracial marriage. Black and white marriage. And they asked me to write the score. And I had at the time Branford Marsalis--the singer--I can't remember, she just passed away. And she was in 'Sophisticated Ladies' and so forth and so on. And they asked me to write the score to it. It was a lot of fun. You know I'm--My manager is looking for more film scores.  I like doing film scores. You know, it's a--I guess my teacher also Coleridge Taylor Perkinson always, you know, it was a fun thing to do.
Speaker 1: You have won a number of awards and citations. But one that jumped out at me was the Kaiwa [sic, Kawai] America [Corporation] Artist Award. What is that?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well that's an award where the Kawai, which is the piano company, you know, named me as one of their artists. And, you know, and I endorse their piano products. Which is a wonderful piano that I've been using. And they supply me with all concert pianos, so any concert I do, I have Kawai piano--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) How long has that been going on? When did you receive that?
Speaker 2: I--That was--It's been about five years I think now. So. It's, you know. It's wonderful actually.
Story_ID: 15488
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: Oh I think it's--I, I think my life is fun. You know. I have a wonderful time, you know. Making music, flying around doing different--You know, sometimes I get tired. But I think I'm--the, the art of trying to create art and artistic beauty and trying to create musical energy is so so beautiful. So, you know. Actually I don't think I'd change anything. I think though if I were--Yeah. I think I'm pretty happy (laughs) pretty much so actually.
Speaker 1: What lesson or lessons do you have for young African American youth male and female who have talent and are interested in music as young children, teenagers. What advise do you have for the younger generation?
Speaker 2: It's changed now in the--. I think my advice would be that--The first thing is that if you really wanna do something, you, you know, don't let anybody else tell you you can't do it. Now first, you know, and you have to really totally dedicate yourself in wanting to do it and don't let any obstacles get in your way. If there's an obstacle in one way, then you have to go around that obstacle and find another way of doing it. But don't let it discourage you. You know. And at the same time always study and keep on studying. Like myself, it doesn't matter. I'm always learning something new every day. I try to, you know, keep studying and learning, you know, somebody told me--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What was the biggest obstacle that you think you faced at some point along the way that you were able to work around as--Is there any time in your life when things weren't going well or something stood in your way?
Speaker 2: Well many obstacles. You know--You know. First of all, you know, being an African American in the symphonic world is--was, you know, was a really hard thing to try to be. You know, you know. I would get, you know, send out letters. And, you know, people wouldn't even look at you, you know. I would--One in particular example I remember the Dallas [Texas] Symphony called up to have me--and, you know, they said they were interested in having me appear with them.  And they wouldn't let me appear with them until I have had to Morton--Morton Gould. Morton Gould who was at the time President of ASCAP [American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers] and a famous composer. He had to call them and tell them that Julius is, you know, a great conductor and a good musician and he should--he should appear with the orchestra. It's always been trying to, to, you know,  trying to figure out, you know, to let me have the chance or. "Is he good enough?" There's always been, "Is he really as good as he think he is?" There's always been that type of obstacle. And then in return then they go, "Oh well, maybe he is." And then, you know. So there's plenty of those that go around. And then in academic situations and many situations.
Speaker 1: When you appeared as the personality on CBS's [Columbia Broadcasting System] 'Sunday Morning' show I happened to see that. After I knew I was going to interview you, I recalled seeing you on that show. And I don't watch that program--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)--regularly either. So. What did that do for your career?
Speaker 2: Actually it did a--It did a lot. It did--It--For some strange reason when people see you on TV you must be legitimate. You know, it gave--It legitimizes who you are. You know, you know. It--You could say the same thing. I haven't changed. But all of a sudden, "Oh well, he must be--something.
Speaker 1: All right. Quickly. Briefly. Did you get some requests and invitations then to come here or there?
Speaker 2: Yes. I (unclear) Detroit [Michigan] at the time. You know, to audition for the orchestra. I got appearances and, you know, in Dallas and a few other places at that  time. It was a, you know. It was really, you know, love letters. Got 500 letters at the time (laughs). then I was at the University of Vermont [Burlington, Vermont]. And also I ran the New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga [New York]. I was the artistic director.
Speaker 1: At the time that you were on the CBS?
Speaker 2: Yeah CBS, yeah.
Speaker 1: On 'Sunday Morning'.
Speaker 2: On 'Sunday Morning'. So, you know, it was a, you know. I was real, I was alive. You know. So that was a, you know, a big break in my career.
Story_ID: 15489
Speaker 1: I wanna--I wanna write a book.  I haven't done that. I'd like to really sit down and really write a book.  That would be exciting to me.  But--and also a couple of things--I need--I wanna finish another opera and like a, to write another oratorio. And I really would like to write a symphony.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Which I haven't written a full symphony.
Speaker 2: You haven't written a full symphony.
Speaker 1: A full symphony.  A full forty minute--sy-.
Speaker 2: Now what does that entail?  What does that in terms of time and energy what does that--What does that mean?
Speaker 1: (laughs) I'm not quite sure yet myself.  But it would mean (laughs), you know, the sitting down and writing this score with--four movement score or whatever I decide to do-- to, you know, to make this, you know, monumental work that--you know--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: It's gonna take some time.  I would think a year, you know.  A year or two years of my life somewhere. Maybe I could get a grant and be on the beach and (laughs) work on it.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It'll happen. It'll happen.
Speaker 1: And I guess also I would like to do a really--I really would like to do a real nice--good movie.
Speaker 2: Movie?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  A film score.  I really would love to have a major motion picture.  So that's a goal that I would like to do.
Speaker 2: Gordon Parks did it all. You can.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns  for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That's a very important--My hope and concern is that we really unite more.  I see we--It's--You know, when I grew up in the '70s [1970s], you know, that was the black power--'60s [1960s] and '70s--black power we had--you know.  But now I see that's it splintering  and the power is not within us.  And then my concern also is if the youth--you know, that are coming up, you know, do they understand the importance of our culture?  And well, you know, not just--Especially music.  It's not just entertainment.  Will the art part of us will still be there?  You know. You know. We had the entertainment part, you know, especially with the rappers and the football players and the basketball players making millions and millions of dollars.  But will that cross over into the real artistic concept that need to be brought from the community?
Story_ID: 15491
Speaker 1: What values do you consider most important to you and in your life?
Speaker 2: A value I think, you know determination, hard work.  Don't take anything for granted.  You know, not to--Love people.  Love yourself.  You know, you know, don't have the agenda of trying to get somebody back.  Have an agenda of making something happen.  Making something happened that's good.  Those are very important values. The value to, to, to see ahead and to focus on a new beginning no matter where you started  from.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.  Last question.  How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (laughs).
Speaker 1: Not that you're going any place--you have a lot of work ahead of you.  But--.
Speaker 2: (laughs).
Speaker 1: But looking back on what you've tried to do and what you've accomplished and where you are today?
Speaker 2: What I want to be remembered is somebody who really tried to, you know, to do things  where he was sincere in doing them.  Really trying to be sincere. Not just for, you know, to be for a name for himself. But trying to make--you know.  To give something of himself."  So many people want that--the name for themselves.  I think I wanna give something from myself.  If I can do that, I think, you know, I hope my legacy will  live on.
