Speaker 1: I want you to start off by just stating your name and spelling it for us and also middle initial and your birth date.
Speaker 2: My name is Timuel, T-I-M-U-E-L, D [Dixon] as in David, Black, B-L-A-C-K, and I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, December the 7th, 1918.

Speaker 1: Now, I have five questions I usually ask, okay. What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't take vacations.  I go away on conferences and those, if I have no responsibility at the conference, are like my vacation.  Occasionally I go out of the country.  That's like a vacation, but it's not planned.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I like spring and fall in Chicago [Illinois].  Those are the two times that I enjoy most because I can walk casually and just see people so those are two times of the year that I enjoy most.
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I really don't have any favorite foods.  I grew up during the [Great] Depression, and at that period of my life you felt good having food to eat so I can pretty nearly go across ethnic foods.  I don't have any real favorites.  I like meat, pork, beef, lamb, veal.  I like--I don't like white bread.  I prefer bran or rye bread and corn bread, cooked bread, biscuits and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: How about favorite color?
Speaker 2: I guess dark, not too dark because I'm brown.  I like brown.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Mattie McConner Black] had a statement that came from her Bible, "Prayer changes things."  I like [Duke] Ellington's [composer, pianist, bandleader], "I like the sunrise because it brings a new day" or "Lord, dear Lord above, God of mercy, God of love, please look down and see my people through."  Those are quotations from someone else, but I enjoy thinking about those as statements of faith.
Speaker 1: The second one, what is that from--"Lord, dear Lord above, please look?"
Speaker 2: That's from Duke Ellington's 'My People,' from 'Come Sunday.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 3468
Speaker 1: What are some of the themes you would say that are reflected in--with state politics and black elected officials?  What role have they played?  What has been their legacy?  What have been the--just searching--what period are you familiar with, with state politics?  I'm only talking about state politics at this point.
Speaker 2: Well, with state politics, my familiarity doesn't really begin, except for listening to conversations, until the--after World War II when I returned from the [U.S.] Army, and then state politics began to loom large in my mind because of a new party being introduced, third party in Illinois, the Progressive Party, and that party--1948--was--purpose was to bring about social and political change and more equality in the participation in state affairs and national affairs. The Progressive Party, which was led by a former Secretary of Agriculture, and [Vice President] Henry Wallace who had also been Vice President to President [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt.  Whence many of us returned from the Army--and I was one of those--because we actually had served in a very deliberately segregated army and because some of us had been in some pretty rough situations--I have received four battle stars [military decoration], and my unit received the Croix de Guerre with Palm [military decoration] from the French Army and only a citation from the American Army--because I saw a difference in the way people were treated, particularly when I was in France and Belgium and even in England, there were those of us who came back determined that that would not continue to be the case. And the Progressive Party, which was a national party, offered an opportunity to make that change. So we had a branch of the Progressive Party here in Illinois that started, and such people as Oscar Brown, Sr. [attorney, businessman] and Oscar Brown, Jr. [composer, writer, director] and talking about local people in the state and Earl B. Dickerson [attorney, businessman] and many others who were formerly loyal party, Democratic or Republican Party members, took the leadership in the black community. And I began to look at the state legislature as being one of those places where we could begin to make at least local change in some of the decisions that were made--in the Army particularly. So that caused me and others to begin to look at state politics as being another opportunity to bring about social change.
Story_ID: 3469
Speaker 1: And what did you want to see happen with social change?  What things weren't happening that you thought were important?
Speaker 2: One of the things, by this time the second Great Migration is taking place. There were things like housing, overcrowded. By this time also you have another [U.S. Supreme Court] decision that came out of--the 'Hansberry [v. Lee'] decision of 1939 [sic, 1940], a 1948 decision, 'Shelley v. Kraemer,' which outlawed or at least made it impossible to enforce restrictive [housing] covenants that had been the order of the day up to that point.  The restrictive covenants simply meant that certain people were denied the opportunity to live in certain neighborhoods.  Education--the schools were coming fantastically overcrowded--double shift, triple shift, knowing that the decisions about, certain decisions about education were made at the state level, that was another goal, to break down segregation in the public schools.  Fair opportunities in employment, in state employment, became a major goal of our attention. So there were a number of things like that at the state level that we felt the governor of the state and the legislature of the state could play a role in bringing about.  We knew some of the people who were in the [Illinois] State House [of Representatives], blacks such as--well, Corneal Davis [politician] didn't come until later, but there were people in the State House whose names I forget, but there were at least three or four members in the State House that were people of color, and so we were putting pressure on them to carry out the mission.  We also had begun to hear about black legislators downstate in that period who could not find places to live, though they had been elected to the state legislature.  They were not allowed to live in the hotels where the other legislators were living, and they were protesting, and they were asking for support, which we gave them.  The trade unions had begun to be more active, and unions like the United Automobile Workers and the United Steelworkers and other unions had begun to play a role in state politics so it was not just black legislators but the white legislators as well that were subject to the--you know, needed the black vote to be able to be reelected.  We began to think--put pressure on these people.
Speaker 1: And did you find that there were people that took up your cause?  Were you able to elect, as the Progressive Party, have you been able to elect any candidate or were you more a party that were able to bring certain issues to the table?
Speaker 2: We were able to bring certain issues to the table.  In Illinois in the [U.S.] Presidential election in 1948, because there was some fear that the Progressive Party would draw votes from the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, for that matter, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party got together in the state legislature and made the Progressive Party illegal. So we could only bring about action not in the state legislature by switching our attention to the representatives of the party, of the other parties that we felt were vulnerable, but the Progressive Party itself in Illinois was made illegal by agreement with the two parties.
Story_ID: 3470
Speaker 1: The men who were in the [Illinois] state legislature, and you'd have to check the names for that period, were very race-oriented, and they carried the mantel of race proudly and vigorously.  They were race men.  They were not bound by the obligation at that time of a machine as we call it today.  They were part of the party, Republican or Democrat.  As Mr. Gaines, Charles Gaines's [politician] father, was a Republican, but he was a black man, and so the black agenda was the agenda that he would carry with him to the state legislature.  There were others, and I can't--as I say again, if I had known these were the kind of questions you were going to ask, I would have had some names--but there were several of those men, and they would report back to the community at rallies and meetings and organizations.  I was a member--I was an agent for what at that time was the Metropolitan Funeral System [insurance company], which later became the Metropolitan--with Metro Funeral System [unclear], which later became the Chicago Metropolitan Assurance Company--and that's a story in and of itself. And every Friday when we were doing our final reporting, we had a forum of these politicians, primarily state politicians who had come before us because they knew that we touched literally thousands of people in our weekly moves around the community.  Then what we said to most of those people was very persuasive.  After all, we were salesmen, and so we could persuade people to accept our version.  A lot people would ask us questions and things. So every Friday we would have one of these--one or more--of these state, these politicians to appear before the Met [Metropolitan Assurance Company], and they would go other agencies like ours, Jackson Funeral System or Supreme, and literally give an account of what they were doing, and we would ask them questions or make suggestions to them, so they were useful at period of time.  They were not under the control of a machine that could dictate what they ought to do, not as much as we have today, unfortunately.
Speaker 2: So when you say the reason that they weren't under dictates is that they were representing primarily black districts, and they were--that--.
Speaker 1: The obligation was to their constituency, and the constituency was, I might say at this point, fairly sophisticated.  See, we didn't have the interferences of television yet.  We didn't have the kind of--we didn't have much air conditioning so much of our life was spent on the streets talking to each other.  At home, because we didn't have television, we talked to one another, and much of that talk--after you paid the bills, talked about which bills you paid--would be about, "What is this particular person doing?"  They would go to the churches--most of them belonged to the big church, the standard churches--and they would talk to the congregations through the--with the permission of the minister, of course. So they influenced--so one of the things when the machine really began to come into being and take over, those were the places where the machine, particularly to the churches, the leaders of the new machines began to pull those ministers into his realm with promises that the church would benefit--in addition to the minister benefiting. So we began to get then a beginning of a shift from feeling that--with a few churches, not all--that there was a connection between Reverend Clarence Cobbs for example, the late Reverend Bishop [Louis Henry] Ford, who had rather sizeable congregations, but every church was not only religious, was also political.
Story_ID: 3471
Speaker 1: Oh, we had people who were on the street who were sophisticated like, let's say, Edgar G. Brown [politician]--"Goatee" Brown we called him because he had a goatee, great tennis player and a great golfer--but he'd travel all over the country.  He was an educated man, and he would--for example, it might say Goatee Brown is going to be talking on 47th Street, 47th and [Dr. Martin Luther] King Drive [Chicago, Illinois], 35th Street near the statue there or 51st Street, that he's going to be saying something, and he would bring information, and he was a good speaker, and people would literally crowd around where he was to listen.  We had a number of people like that.  We had the Washington Park Forum, which is in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], where we would have men like--I guess you would call it like on the North Side they had Bughouse Square.  Our Bughouse Square was at 54th [Street] and South Park [Avenue, now Dr. Martin Luther King Drive] in Washington Park. So you had informed speakers, and you looked forward to them bringing you this information and advising you about their point of view.  Now in the '30s [1930s], of course, some of that was led by members of the Communist Party, and they were very good at bringing information. So it was not an uninformed public. And then people would talk with one another much more than they do now.  In my house, for example, after my mother [Mattie McConner Black] and father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] talked about paying the bills, they would begin to talk--and I'm sitting there, and my brother's [Walter Kerrigan Black] sitting there--about what the politicians are doing. And on the street they would talk about what the politicians are doing, because in many ways fleeing the South for the first [Great] Migration was somewhat equivalent to the Europeans fleeing Europe.  It was more they were refugees.  My father had a good job in Birmingham [Alabama], but he couldn't easily vote.  There were many things.  His children, he thought, even in Birmingham, with pretty good schools in Birmingham, wasn't the quality of education that my mother and father thought their children deserved.  That was true of, in my experience, the majority of those who brought their families from the South to places like Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 3472
Speaker 1: At that period of time [1930s and 1940s]--remember again, they [black politicians] are responding to a group of informed refugees from the South. They themselves are very well. These are not cotton pickers.  These are relatively well-educated men.  Most of them have been to college.  Some of them are lawyers, like [William] Warfield [politician], for example.  They're not--so they are responding to a--in their way, with the limitations of numbers, they are advocates of the welfare of the community that sent them.  Were they considered irrelevant, they would not have been there.  It's just that simple.  It's a different world than today's world that we look at.  I would suspect at that point that 75 to 80 percent of the eligible black voters voted.  Now the numbers, you see, you've got to look at--in that period we're talking about with [William] Warfield [politician]--there were fewer than 250,000 blacks in Chicago [Illinois].  Today you've got almost a million, but they're different.  That population was concentrated, and because communication by word of mouth was an everyday thing--that was part of the enjoyment of meeting somebody, to talk about what's happening.  You might talk about somebody had enough money to buy an Essex [automobile] or something, but that was not the usual thing.  You were thinking, "How are we going to survive?  We left the South to live a better life."  Most of them volunteered.  They were not pushed off the land like the people in the second generation, second [Great] Migration. See, most of the migrants after World War II and even during World War II were literally pushed out of the rural agricultural areas of the South, and some of them stopped in cities, but they heard this [Chicago] was the promised land.  They had not voted.  They had no voting culture. The people who came after developed a voting culture.  You understand the difference?  So we're dominated now--I guess all over--but certainly in the black community, we're dominated by a folk whose parents came to Chicago or grandparents to get a job, good enough, better than anything they'd ever had in Mississippi or Arkansas or Alabama and those places. So politics for them was not as important as they'd now have a job--buy a car and ride back down home to show off to their relatives.  My mother [Mattie McConner Black] and father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] never went back south like most of those of that period unless somebody died.  They would come to Chicago from those places. The bitterness that they had towards the South was so deep; they never wanted to see it again. They'd talk about it, there was nostalgia, but they weren't going nowhere.
Story_ID: 3473
Speaker 1: [U.S. Representative] Oscar DePriest [politcian] became a county commissioner [of Cook County, Illinois] in about 1908 [sic, 1904].  If you look at the plaque on the [Cook] County building [Chicago, Illinois] down there, down at the County building, you see Oscar DePriest's name.  He was the sole person on that commission.  There had been others before him, but he was--from that point, he became a--I just don't remember him being a state legislator.  He and my mother  [Mattie McConner Black]  came from the same hometown.  He used to come by our house so he wasn't--but I may be wrong.  I may be wrong.
Speaker 2: Now he ended up serving in the [U.S.] Congress, right?
Speaker 1: He was the first black congressman after Reconstruction, the first.  He took the place of a man by the name of [U.S. Representative] Martin Madden [politician].  Madden Park is down there on 37th [Street] in the Ida B. Wells Complex [public housing project in Chicago, Illinois].  He was the first black congressman in the United States after Reconstruction.  He was one of the first elected black politicians in the United States, particularly from the North after Reconstruction.
Story_ID: 3474
Speaker 1: Can we just go back to Oscar De Priest [U.S. Representative-Illinois]?  Can you tell me real quickly what you think Oscar De Priest's legacy or his importance besides the fact that he was first.
Speaker 2: Oscar De Priest was a businessman who brought up quite a bit of property on the South Side and had the leverage because of his political to begin to open up opportunities for better housing for people in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s.]  He was a real estate man.  In the Congress of the United States, he was constantly fighting for legislation.  Remember, he is only one out of like 435 [members in the U.S. House of Representatives]--for more considerations of blacks.  He recommended and appointed the first black, one of the first black people to go to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] in the period of time.  The man was treated very badly.  He wasn't a man then--from Wendell Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois], he was just a boy.  He was treated very badly at West Point [Military Academy].  Oscar De Priest demanded that he and his wife--this became national--be able to eat in the congressional dining room in Washington D.C.  He broke that barrier.  On the local scene, he was a hero to most of us because, even before he was in the Congress, he was a member of the [Chicago] city council.  He was a very big man, a very impressive.  And he was constantly demanding--he was a Republican--he was constantly demanding better opportunities for blacks in terms of jobs.  So while he was in city hall as a member of the city council, many blacks, comparatively speaking, became employees of city government and county government.  So much so that when Anton J. Cermak ran against "Big Bill" Thompson, William Hale Thompson in 1932 [for mayor of city of Chicago, Illinois], one of the battle cries of his platform was he was going to 'clean out Uncle Tom's cabin'.  That was how Oscar De Priest had created, demanded jobs in local government for people of color.  He was very unusual.
Speaker 1: Now we were talking just briefly about Charles Skyles.  I had said "Psyches," but it's Skyles.
Speaker 2: Charles Skyles.
Speaker 1: You said that he was important because he was an agitator and activist.
Speaker 2: Yes he was.  He was a fiery, oratorical person who took his message to the people and got support from the people.  He was a relatively young man when he first went to the [Illinois] state legislature and he was the person along with Davis--Corneal Davis [member of Illinois General Assembly], that spoke out and broke some of the barriers to housing for state legislatures, and state legislators in Springfield, Illinois.  He was also very active in terms of schools at the state legislature, trying to get more funds and equality for schools in the black community.  He was a personable guy, easy to meet and spend a lot of time in the community finding out what the needs of the people were.
Speaker 1: Did any of these other names like Charles Armstrong or Kenneth Wilson or Fred Smith or William Robinson [members of Illinois General Assembly]--some people just served not very long.
Speaker 2: Well, Bill Robinson was a Republican, but his commitment was to the black community in spite of that, so he continuously was elected.  At that time, there were three in the state legislature.  Three persons could run from the same district.  So Bill Robinson would usually get elected because he was--the demand was that that would be, the agreement was that they would be a member of the other party, regardless of where it happened to be, who would be representing the minority people in that party, a number numerically were in the minority.  Bill Robinson was that guy, but he voted a liberal vote.  He was a very outspoken man; a very eloquent person and he continued to do that until he left the state legislature when he went into state government.  Some of the others that--I remember him more than I do any of the others.  We're beginning to come into a period now where the Democratic machine has pretty nearly garnered most of the black legislators.
Story_ID: 3475
Speaker 1: Now when did that--you had talked about that off camera, but when did that start happening and why?  Did it start at the city level and then spread to the state or did it happen simultaneously?
Speaker 2: Well I think it primarily started at the city level.  You see, after 1936 [mayoral] election, there developed in Chicago [Illinois] a thing called the Democratic Kelly-Nash machine.  A man by the name of  [Patrick] Pat Nash and the county commissioner, the county commissioner and also the--he was head of the Democratic Party. [Mayor] Edward J. Kelly persuaded [Chicago Alderman] William Dawson to bring his support over to the Democratic organization.  He did that by promising Dawson that he would have control of the patronage.  Dawson then became gradually more loyal to that machine than he did to his constituents.  So that began to happen in the '30s [1930s].  By the '40s [1940s], that had begun to be more and more the case.  Then in the '50s [1950s], with the election, because [Chicago Mayor] Martin [H.] Kennelly before [Mayor Richard J.] Daley never really had control of Bill Dawson, because Martin Kennelly was almost an outspoken racist, very clearly.  And he had denounced Dawson as protecting the rackets and the racketeers--what we called 'policy' in those days and what became 'numbers' later.  [Illinois state Representative Lewis A. H.] Larry Caldwell, who was also a member of the state legislature, introduced this legislation that legalized the numbers, which is now the lottery.  It was illegal.  Kennelly, hoping to be the nominee for the Democratic Party denounced Dawson as being a part of the racketeering business.  Dawson, who did help his friends in the numbers business and in the jitney business and in other business.  He did help them because they were not permitted to practice their businesses outside of the black community and they were tolerated. Taxi cabs which would not come into the black community, the jitney taxicabs were illegal.  Dawson protected the jitneys--the Jackie Reynolds and Dagrees (sp?) and others that owned those businesses--which made it very much more convenient for the black community which could not get transportation from Yellow Cab and Checker Cab.  Now when he was attacked by Kennelly he, I understand, simply at the slating session told Martin Kennelly "Mr. Mayor, you're not going to be nominated," and turned Richard J. Daley and said "Dick, you're going to be our man."  Then he went to the black community and through the various sources particularly the [newspaper] 'Chicago Defender,' which was much more widely read than it is now.  He simply said "They're picking on me because I'm colored," and the black community rallied around that sound and voted for the person that Dawson had been responsible for bringing to the forefront, and elected Richard J. Daley with overwhelming votes in the black community three times--1955, 1959, and 1963.
Story_ID: 3476
Speaker 1: At that time, [Chicago, Illinois Mayor] Richard J. Daley went to each one of the black ward committeemen and alderman.  Six of them, that we had by that time labeled as the 'Silent Six'--went to them and said, "You do not have to go to [U.S.] Congressman [William] Dawson" who continued to have his ward committeeman seat even though he was in [Washington] D.C.  So Daley said, "You do not have to go to him anymore.  Either come to me or Tom Keane," who was his floor leader in the city council.  So they began to do that, which then stripped William Dawson of his base of power.  The last time that I saw the Congressman, he was a very sad man.  The loyalties of those people that he had helped had been stripped away. He was outside sweeping in front of his own headquarters and said to me, "My friends don't come around to see me anymore," because they had been made politically and economically afraid to deal with the boss.  This is the man who brought much of the black community over to the Democratic Party--no longer had any base of power.  Six black ward committeemen and alderman, you can find out who they are.  I know who they are.  One of them I wouldn't want to mention.  But therefore Daley began to cater to the white ethnic community by using thinly veiled racial things like "welfare queens"--speaking about women who were receiving public aid.  Or "dirty streets"--insinuating that the people on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], in the black community were so unkempt that they littered the streets.  And fought very vigorously against open housing or integration of the public schools along with his appointed person, [Chicago Public Schools Superintendent] Benjamin [C.] Willis of "Willis Wagon" fame [practice of placing mobile classrooms in the playgrounds of overcrowded African American schools, while classrooms in nearby white schools were only partially used], to keep Chicago segregated.  Idea being that if it was not segregated, the schools were not segregated or were integrated--led in a business, from a businessman, Mr. Martin who was then the president and chairman of the board of Carson Pirie Scott [Chicago-based department store]. Who had admitted that he had gone to Daley and told him if he integrated the schools, the white middle class would leave the city.  What really happened is because they spent so much time on keeping the schools segregated, they neglected quality education for everybody.  Now that brings us up to the '60s [1960s].  What were the politicians doing by then?  By that time, they had been completely co-opted.  I went to Springfield [Illinois] to agitate for Fair Employment Practices Committee, for a committee--and could not get the support of even one black legislator.  I had to go to white legislators who were friends of mine to introduce this proposal.  That's how complete, it had happened.
Story_ID: 3477
Speaker 1: So the politics--so the timing for both the change and from Republican [political party] to the Democrat [political party] happened pretty simultaneously, both at actually the federal, state, and local level, really?
Speaker 2: Well yes, because at that time we only had one representative in the Congress.  Later the seventh congressional district--which is now [U.S. Congressman, Daniel K.] Danny Davis--came into being as the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] began to have a larger number of blacks. It was apparent that a black would be eventually selected.  The first one that was elected was a member of the Democratic organization up until the present, until Danny, was pretty nearly in the control of the Democratic machine--up until Danny Davis.
Speaker 1: And what--so my question, who, who do you think besides--you mentioned [Charles] Skyles and you mentioned Corneal Davis [members of Illinois General Assembly], who do you think--I mean, [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington definitely came through.
Speaker 2: He was an independent.  He wasn't--.
Speaker 1: No, he came through the machine at the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but he operated more like an independent, particularly on the race issues, which put him in disfavor with many of his black colleagues.  He was a rebel inside the machine; and his theory was, as he stated, "We need someone inside as well as outside."  So people like myself and [U.S. Congressman, Illinois] Gus Savage and others stayed outside and agitated from the outside.  But Harold Washington was, as much as he could be an independent, both as a state rep [representative] and as a state senator.  He introduced some very important legislation.  I guess the most dramatic, which would be, after the death of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  He introduced the first legislation demanding that a holiday be declared for Dr. King, the first one in the country.  But there were other issues that he also [supported].  I used to wonder, "How does he survive inside that?"  But most of the time on the issues that were not racially oriented, he went along with the machine.
Speaker 1: Now what other, what about people like [Illinois state senator Charles] Charlie Chew [Jr.] or [Illinois state senator Richard H.]  Dick Newhouse or [Illinois state representative] Eugene Barnes, [Illinois state representative] Jesse [D.] Madison; do any of those--Dick Newhouse he's talked about a lot.
Speaker 2: Maybe I shouldn't even talk about that (laughs).
Speaker 1: Why (laughs).  Ok.
Speaker 2: No, I'll have to deal with that in my book.
Speaker 1: Ok, ok.
Story_ID: 3478
Speaker 1: They wanted me to have breakfast with them to show unity to go to the meeting--the Triple CO [CCCO, Coordinating Council of Community Organizations), an organization for reform of public school policy] meeting that morning.  I couldn't do that.  It was at that meeting that Triple CO [CCCO] began to decline because people, the rumor, word got out and people like Jorja English [Palmer], now Lu Palmer's [political activist] wife and some others just simply broke up the meeting.  [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] comes to town because he thinks that's his base and that base eroded black against white.  It was just chaos.  They couldn't have a meeting.  Dr. King asked me to call the dissidents together through [civil rights activist Rev. Andrew] Andy Young.  Andy came to me and said, "Can you pull those people."  They considered me--misled old people being led by, old persons being led by these young radicals.  We had a meeting and Dr. King wouldn't listen.  We told him he had walked into a trap.  I had sent him a letter.  I have a copy of it here and I had sent [Marion S.] Barry [Jr.] a letter about the betrayal.  [Illinois state senator, Richard H.] Newhouse was the beneficiary.
Speaker 2: Of all that.  I see.
Speaker 1: I not calling him a bad guy.
Speaker 2: Right, he was the beneficiary.
Speaker 1: He was the beneficiary and he wasn't a bad senator.  Let me brag again, he was not the kind of senator that [Timuel] Tim Black would have been.  They knew that.  What is the connection?  Barry's organization is funded by white business community and philanthropy.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] is controlled by the Democratic [political party] Machine.  You catch what I'm saying?  Newhouse was, to the extent that he could be, an independent.  He was in an independent community and he was the guy who held out his vote until the [Illinois] state senate agreed to have its leader--the president of the senate, a black person--he held his vote out.  The organization making the compromise then appointed Cecil Partee [Illinois State Representative and Senator].  Cecil Partee was part of the organization, so they felt more comfortable with that.  Later, the mayor [Richard J. Daley] of the city of Chicago [Illinois] wanting his young son who had recently been elected to the Senate [Richard M. Daley], to become the president of the senate.  That was when Cecil Partee stepped aside and ran for Attorney General against a man that he was not, anyone could have told him, this Republican was very popular at that time.  He later went to jail (laughs), but he was very popular at that time.  No way that he was going to beat this man but he stepped aside.  And that's when he came back into city government, first through the leadership in the poverty program and then into the city treasurer.  To understand the politics of Chicago is to understand much of the machine politics of the rest of the country.  In fact, Chicago had the greatest machine because it now had captured the leadership, the elected leadership of the black community.  The black vote began to decline during this period because the machine, which they had been responsible for putting in order and making larger, no longer delivered very much for any of them, even those who were let go, for any of them..  So the black vote began to dwindle until it was down to less than a third of its strength.  Then of course, one more time, two more times really--the assassination of [Black Panther] Fred Hampton, which inspired a pretty big turn out and to some extent defeated [U.S. Congressman] Paul Simon who wanted to be [Illinois] governor.  Pretty big turnout and also defeated the States Attorney with a Republican.  Then of course, the strength was shown again when the [Chicago] mayor [Richard J. Daley] put up someone to run against [Chicago Alderman, Ralph H.] Metcalfe after Metcalfe had broken with the machine over two incidents that were important to him.  Though there were some of us who had not liked the way Ralph Metcalfe had behaved inside the machine.  Rather, than to show our opposition to the machine, we voted Metcalfe in as the [U.S.] congressman from the first congressional district on several occasions.  The vote was small.  His vote was big though in terms of the other candidate, but the vote was not a big turnout.

Speaker 1: It was only until the--[Chicago Mayor] Jane Byrne again, she called me up in New York--I had worked for her.  She called me up in New York to thank me and then she turned on the black community and constantly insulted.  She was good for the spirit of the black community. She insulted the black community enough so that Lu Palmer, who was holding classes of voter education--because he had practically dropped out of politics until that time, until Ralph--[he] began to have voter education classes.  Then his famous statement, "We shall see in '83 [1983]," talking about Jane Byrne.  Then [Rev.] Jesse Jackson [Sr.] was able to keep doing the jazz festival [ref. to Chicagofest city festival]--he was able to persuade Stevie Wonder [musician] not to come and all the black musicians followed Stevie Wonder and that kind of mobilized.  Then of course in 1982, we're able to get again, I was in there, to get [Edward] Ed Gardner [founder of Soft Sheen hair care products] to finance the voter registration.  Ed Gardner asked me personally to take over the chairmanship of the committee, Vote Community for Voter Education and Registration and Education.  I was the nominal chairman of that committee and Ed Gardner and [Reverend] Leon Finney [Chicago businessman] were the co-chairs in terms of the board and we registered something around--I forget the numbers--but somewhere around 263,000 new voters.  We registered something close to 80 percent of all the black vote-- South Side and West Side.  We had a turnout of about 90 percent of that black vote and 98 percent of that voted for Harold Washington [for mayor of Chicago], but Harold Washington, only, in the Democratic town, only won by 47,000 votes.  [Bernard] Bernie Epton created a slogan "Vote for me before it's too late" [slogan was "Epton--Before it's too late."].  Bernie's son [Jeff Epton] was a student of mine, his son and his daughter, and they didn't like what their father had done.  In fact, the son was by here recently to talk about the sadness in the fact that he lost his dad right after Harold [Washington] died.  But the town that it was traditionally when Jane Byrne won the primary, she won overwhelmingly the Democratic vote.  But when Harold Washington won the primary, because were able to keep both Jane Byrne and Richard M. Daley in the race, both thinking that they could win.  When he won because of that strategy, then one would have thought in this overwhelming Democratic town with [Alderman Edward] Vrdolyak and [Alderman Edward] Burke and all the rest, Tom--not [Thomas] Tom Keane, but you would have thought well he's in. No, he wasn't.  They went Republican at that point [Ed Vrdolyak switched parties in 1987].
Story_ID: 3480
Speaker 1: I was asking a question about going forward. What the current state of what you thought about forwarded.  Will this be just a brief period that we had with [Chicago, Illinois Mayor] Harold Washington there was some independent politics or would the time ever be revisited where you have true people who were race politicians and sort of that part of the--?
Speaker 2: Looks gloomy.  The political scene for the black folk at this point in Chicago [Illinois].  It looks pretty gloomy because the, not just in Chicago, in the state, they have been so, for the most part, so completely intimidated and co-opted despite the larger numbers that exist. Nineteen in the [Chicago] City Council can make a difference on any vote.  Something like twenty, nineteen or twenty, in the [Illinois] state legislature. They don't talk with one another.  They don't plan with one another as a group.  They are individually doing their thing.  Whereas, the Irish and all other groups are voting as blocs.  Now you have a new force coming into the being--being helped by the Anglos outside.  That is a growing conscious Latino community.  My guess is that the Latinos in the next, after the census are going to demand another seat in the Congress of the United States and more seats in the state legislature and more in the city council.  They are being organized by forces, which are supportive of the mayor or the administration or the machine.  The independent Latino politicians are being moved out like Jesus Garcia and others like him. and replaced by more conservative politicians like--I forget his name right off hand--who is taking the leadership and is the mayor's person for the Latino community over at the 25th and 26th wards.  Now their demands, justifiably so, are that they be given greater opportunities in the city.  When you go to the board of education or to the county there are new faces and new voices where blacks used to have those positions. The blacks who are still there in positions of power and positions of not power, but positions of influence are not using that influence even, because they are insecure.  Here's a city where 50--well about 60 percent of the school population is black, African American--that the operating chief is not only not black, but Catholic, in a community which is dominantly Protestant.  The chairman of the [school] board is Latino, very close to the mayor.  Appointed by the mayor, recommended by the mayor.  He had no dominant voices on that board, no male in any top position.  The two persons who are the top positions-spokespersons--are two African American females.  So the models for the children are non-black and non-male.  The housing--we look at who is in charge where Valerie Jarrett, at one time was the chief operating officer for the planning commission [Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development for the city of Chicago].  No longer.  As gentrification is taking place all over the city and particularly now moving into the old 'Black Belt', which has been popularized by calling it Bronzeville--it's a good sales statement.  Black politicians with those numbers are hardly heard from on those issues.
Speaker 1: To call 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois], 'Tobacco Road' is an insult.  The street that Duke Ellington [composer, musician] and Lena Horne [singer] and W.E.B. DuBois [educator, activist] and Paul Robeson [political activist, actor] strode with great dress, 'Tobacco Road'.  What is that for?  To attract others.  Now I'm glad it's the alderman, person, the alderman who I helped get--I got the first money for her [ref. to Alderman Dorothy Tillman] from Ed Gardner, has raised the issue of reparations.  But where's the reparations right here in the city of Chicago.  Where are the aldermen demanding reparations of a normal kind right here in Chicago?  Is that a distraction?  What is that?  With all that empty land all over the 'Black Belt' now being gradually sold or given away by the city to developers.  So to answer your question short, there was a quick and very exciting period during the [Harold] Washington years and even before.  But at this point politically, for many people, it's very depressing because they cannot see the leadership or the way out that they could see at that point with that very brief period when Harold Washington was the mayor.  That was a very deep feeling that things are going to change and they're going to be for the better.  Many of the Latino leaderships--Harold Washington also opened the avenues for much of the Latinos who are now in.  They've forgotten about it.  They talk about Latinos; they don't talk about Latinos and other minorities.  Our leaders are still talking about blacks and other minorities.  On the end of--you have a growing population of Asians.  Very sophisticated, very aggressive.  You have a growing population of Mid-east Palestinians particularly demanding their share.  Where is that share going to come from?  Who's expense will that share be coming from?  So maybe because I've gotten so old that I realize my time is limited. I'm objectively feeling, seeing, looking; cannot see unless there is some crisis the kind of cohesion and the kind of coherence that once existed before Harold Washington in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s] and even in the '40s [1940s] and then during the period of the civil rights struggle and briefly in the Harold Washington [mayoral administration] on the political level.  I can't see right now that opportunity emerging any time soon.  We know that at the state level because of the pressures from various groups, the governor had been forced to take some more liberal positions of what we call progressive, particularly on the death penalty. But when we look at the prisons themselves, the jails and prisons and see the population of those jails and prisons, where are the politicians in trying to educate and legislate conditions that would be more fair to everyone?  This is not to say that I believe that prisoners should be on the street.  But when we make the comparison, which was made vivid by the [Chicago] Tribune [newspaper] recently, of who goes to prison for using drugs.  We see the disparity in the criminal justice system which the state legislature has some.  The cry for reparations is simply a resolution.  Has no meaning except that it brings that matter to public attention.  The city cannot legislate that kind of thing as a reparations package but where is the unity necessary to bring that matter to the floor of the state capital or the federal government where [U.S. Congressman] John Conyers has been a voice in the wilderness, almost a voice in the wilderness for the last ten or fifteen years on this issue.  Where's that unity with thirty-seven members of the [United States] Congress, who happen to be black and I'm not leaving out the possibility with that unity.  That would be white allies, who would participate in supporting but they're not going to take the leadership on an issue of this kind.  Where is the plan?  Where is the program?
Story_ID: 3481
Speaker 1: My question for you is what are your hopes for the black community or what are your fears or hopes for the black community?  If someone, you know, our Civil Rights Movement who worked so hard.  You point to more voter turnout and the reasons for that.  The issues that have always been fought were either housing or education or--,
Speaker 2: Jobs.
Speaker 1: --jobs.  But what are your hopes or fears for the black community in this 21st century?
Speaker 2: I think the black middle class, the well-educated middle class blacks will integrate into the larger community in some respects at least socially and so forth.  My concerns are that bottom third who have little education, who have, in so many cases, no political organization that is espousing their cause.  That in so much of that bottom is single parents with three or four children.  Young women, who have no voice to speak in their behalf or to help them.  That's a frightening group to have in any situation.  Young men who are growing up fatherless and without adult male images, leadership.  Girls who likewise see the same thing. How do they learn how to deal with a man if they don't see one more regularly than a physician or companionship with a woman?  Seeing the woman dominate therefore when they get into a relationship their feelings are I never seen anybody to be the boss but this woman, my school teacher, my mother.  The boy's angry because almost everything around him is dominated by a female.  Speaking of that particular with those handicaps, those social handicaps and almost no education, where does he go?  When I talk with people from juvenile court and family court and otherwise and they tell the stories of these young men and young women, who in the criminal justice system they are not very optimistic about the future of those people.  Now that's a sizeable segment of the population.  They are now being displaced out the kinds of homes that they at least had.  Displacement of public housing--where will they go?  Schools no longer will take many of them simply because they are troublemakers or they have not met the standards in courts.  I have a book here called, 'Standardized Minds'--meaning that the standards that are being set are excluding large segments of the population, mostly black.  I'm a graduate of DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Even in the worst of the (Great) Depression, two thirds or more of all of us who started at the freshman level would graduate.  Recently as a part of a committee giving awards of a thousand dollars or so to a number of deserving young men and women at DuSable.  Sixteen of them for our group; the class started as a class of 536, last week they graduated 131.  Where did those others--and this is not untypical.  As you create charter schools and magnet schools.  Yes, there will be blacks who will be qualified and will go and succeed but what about these less fortunate.  Who speaks for them?  Who rallies?  Who organizes for them?  Well someone is going to do that.  Will it be the kind of people that we can trust and believe that they will carry them and try to get them into the main stream in the political world?  Or will they take them in another direction?
Story_ID: 3482
Speaker 1: I've been to Colombia [South America] and to Brazil [South America] and I've seen similar kinds of young men and young women, primarily young men, in those places as they drift out into the streets and Brazil--of course they are killed by the police and in Colombia they're organized and Columbia now belongs to the drug lords.  The good politicians cannot last in Colombia.  So fierce is the condition that the police somewhere recently, I think, more than a thousand police were killed because they were trying to uphold the law.  There is no law.  Now that's far fetched and way down the line but I think we have to look at those examples to see what the possibilities might be when you have a large group of people who are insulated and isolated from the (unclear) because they see no hope and no leadership.  One of my interviewees, young man who has been shot three times has five children by five different women, none of whom he is married to.  Living in public housing.  His mother doesn't want him.  Father is a drug addict.  And yet this young man indicated he would like to get out of it somehow.  He'd like to move out of it.  I just use him as one example.  There are others.  How do we get him out of there?  If our politicians, those who are given the power, potential power to begin to fight for social economic changes that would enable this young man.  He's only twenty-eight.  He's not going to die because he doesn't have a job.  He's not going to starve because he doesn't have access to money.  Education--he's not going to do that.  Young women who are there with three or four children; the children have to be fed, she has to be fed.  Because we ignore them is not going to stop them from eating.  They might not eat the best food.  Now the political leadership, if there was such, has a responsibility to respond to those needs, which many of these people cannot easily articulate.  But instead they're responding to the needs of another group, a more fortunate group.  Some of whom are black but not to respond to the needs of the folks and those folk are not organized.  The time I'm talking about in the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s], those politicians could not have survived before the take over; they could not have survived.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's a very interesting analysis.
Story_ID: 3483
Speaker 1: When you were telling your story I was thinking well, what about the times that W.E.B. DuBois [author, educator, social reformer] or the "Talented Tenth" and the whole larger number of us that weren't educated that you know, we're congregated together that needed housing and jobs and all that and I was wondering as you were talking with these types of discussions, you know, the us versus them but there may have been more of a vested interest at that time and in some cases, you know, of the established helping, you know the unestablishment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was an obligation.
Speaker 1: An obligation.
Speaker 2: Noblesse oblige.
Speaker 1: Right. Right. Right.
Speaker 2: There was a feeling of responsibility.  You see with the breakdown of--we really never got integrated but with the breakdown of the laws against it you see, the "Talented Tenth" quote, whatever that may mean, no longer live close by the untalented ninety percent, you see.  Days of my years in my block always there were doctors and some lawyers.  There were mostly poor people but if you could here a description it might help.  There's a difference between pure poverty.  Talking about economic poverty and poverty-stricken.  We have a growing segment of the population that is poverty-stricken.  We had no doubt when my mother [Mattie McConner Black] and father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] brought us that we were going--my mom and dad--I meet with my seventy-year-old friends and we've done quite well in general.  Some of them much better than others and we've done quite well and our children, at least went to college even though they may haven't done too well when they got there but they could go and their children could go.  But than you had the leavings in the period of the integration and I would guess if I took, accumulate the data that most of those who were left out are products of the migrants of the Second Great Migration.  When I talk with the kids at DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois], without exception, all of them are the first in their family to graduate from high school.  These are the cream of the crop at DuSable High School.  All of them, first in their [family] to graduate.  And yet in their homes the parents for the most are, particularly the mother wants those children to do better than she did.  There's so many other stories mixed up in--like the girl who had to leave her mother because the mother was a drug addict and was pushing her into prostitution.  Well, you've read Leon Dash's 'Rosa Lee's story.'  You should read it.
Story_ID: 3484
Speaker 1: Can I just real quickly ask you what your thoughts are about the Civil Rights Movement?  If all this work has been done and it allows a segment of our community to sort of migrate out of the community, I mean, what are your thoughts, you know, was it a good thing--?
Speaker 2: Too fast, too fast.  It as like when housing--when restricted covenants where removed as barriers that population that could, moved immediately.  You have several things that are happening.  Not only overcrowding. You have another culture which is coming to them.  For example, I'll just give you a quick example.  We who listen to the jazz or city blues. Now all of sudden you have a whole lot of country blues.  Billie Holiday is city blues.  Muddy Waters kind of country blues.  They're appealing to the white population but not to the larger segment of the black population.  Al Benson [Chicago radio disc jockey] replaces Daddy-O Daylie [Chicago radio disc jockey] and that becomes a commercialized kind of thing.  So what you have is not only a change of population but you have a change of culture in the old community that says in our language, I don't want to be bothered with them country people.  And we left and immersed ourselves in other kinds of community.  We took with us what?  Experience?  Leadership?  Knowledge about city government?  How you make demands on city government?  And that part of the community then gets neglected--West Side and South Side [Chicago, Illinois] because, again, the sophistication necessary to live comfortably in the city requires some ability to live it.  Then another big thing comes in the '60s [1960s] and particularly in the '70s [1970s] it accelerates.  The jobs went away and [sociologist William] Julius Wilson points out.  See, when my dad [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] came to Chicago and even up to the period of the early part of the Second Migration, you could expect to find a job.  You might not get one right away, but you could expect to get one.  Steel mill, stockyards, the manufacturing plants.  Just travel along the [Adlai] Stevenson Expressway and see all those empty buildings that are not being lofted, you see.  People without education, much education and no opportunity for a job.  My dad came; there was a job at the stockyards, a job at the steel mill.  My brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] and my sister and I, we had jobs and we had a community sense where all the money made came in the house and went to Mattie [McConner] Black and she would redistribute that money.  My dad would always keep enough for some tobacco and a bottle of booze and I would have money to take my girl to the show.  But then she would pay the bills.  That kind of harmonious relationship in families no longer is there.  So the resources are spent individually and meager though they may be, they may not come in very regularly.  You have a work force, a potential work force that has no outlet, no place to go for work.  You have a school system, all of us took our kids out of the public schools or we took them to schools in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] or some other neighborhood where we saw the schools were better.  So the young people do not have the kind of sweet teachers.  Think about teachers having those kids in the public schools.  Most of the teachers, the reason they want to teach is to make the money so they can send their kids to private schools or live in the suburbs.  Almost two thirds of all the teachers, white teachers particularly, they don't live in the city and there's no law to make them live in the city.  Other government employees have to live in the city but the teachers union broke the back.  I introduced the point to the teachers union that all teachers they let work in the city had to live in the city.  That was defeated very soundly by the way by some white-- black folks too, in positions of leadership.  So here you have youngsters who are isolated from the mainstream, their parents are isolated from the mainstream.  Their parent usually from the mainstream.  And when you say how do they catch up?  Had we been there those who had the experience, it would have probably helped a great deal had we just moved gradually like people are supposed to move.  Have we then taken over, those of us who are so middle class, have we taken over the communities where we moved to?  No.  Our strength has been seriously diminished by being in this integrated community.  Our voices may get heard, but our numbers are not there to force anything.  Some of us have voices that are sweet enough that those who really have the power will listen to them, but that's by chance.  There's no power in that.  That's influence.  That's not power, whereas in the old situation, we had the power to make it happen.
Story_ID: 3485
Speaker 1: I want to go back to just you need to talk about you and I know you were born in Birmingham, Alabama and that's where your family was from.  Do you know much about your parents and were they born, you know, were they both from Birmingham and their parents--do you ever visit them much?
Speaker 2: My mother [Mattie McConner Black] was from Florence, Alabama, which was the home of Oscar De Priest [politician], just to name one person and W. C. [William Christopher] Handy [musician] the so-called father of the blues, St. Louis Blues, Memphis Blues and so forth.  My father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] was from Jacksonville, Alabama and they met in Birmingham.  They were both leaving the plantation work or whatever it was and all of my grandparents were born in slavery, all of my grandparents were born in slavery so my mother and father met in Birmingham.  My father had previously married and had a daughter.  My mother and father married, let's see, I was living at the census track in Alabama and that was 1910 since the strike.  So my sister must have been about two or three years old and my mother and dad, I think, married about, well, the met about 1908 or something of that sort.  I was born, my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] was born in 1915 and I was born in 1918. And eight months, about eight months after I was born my mother and dad--prompted by my mother because she wanted to get my dad out of that place, because the kind of person he was--my grandmother came to Chicago [Illinois] to help her baby's daughter, my mother's baby sister with her children.  Her husband, Uncle Henry, was a rather difficult person to be with and you couldn't tell when he was going to stay or be home--but anyway Grandma came to Chicago to help [Aunt] Lucille with the children and she became ill while she was here and Momma saw that as a good opportunity to become to see her mother and to look around and she did.  She came back to Birmingham and she told my dad there's plenty of work and, in fact, legend has it that somebody said, in fact, they said it; if you can't make it in Chicago, you can't make it anywhere.  And that was an idea that there were so many jobs somebody would say bring the job over here so I can look at it and say if I want it or not.  That's how optimistic and how--but anyway I grew up here--.
Story_ID: 3486
Speaker 1: You, you said all your grandparents were born into slavery.  Do you remember any stories or anything being told, you know, from, about--.
Speaker 2: I was--I only saw my grandfather on my father's [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] side once and I just don't remember very much about that.  With my grandmother being here in Chicago [Illinois], even though I was quite young and didn't even know how to phrase the question, my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] and my sister did.  They were older.  My brother was four years older; my sister was older than that.  For whatever reasons, occasionally, not every day but occasionally they might ask and I think it must have been because they could not believe certain things.  They would ask my grandmother, what was slavery like.  And I can remember distinctly at least once, she started crying.  And I remember her saying, "Oh baby, it was awful," and begin to tell stories about why it was awful.  Well I didn't need the scholars at any place, the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] or any place else to indicate slavery wasn't so bad.  Grandma cried and said it was awful.  I don't need any statistics to prove to me that slavery was awful.  It was awful for Grandma.  Later as I had more chance to explore and read about the experiences about ex-slaves during reading the papers during the period of the [Great] Depression, the WPA [Works Progress Administration] Papers that oral histories where some of the scholars went and did oral histories of the slaves who remained.  Stories are very similar to what my grandma said.  Sometimes worse, sometimes maybe not so bad.  It depends on the slave owner and it's important to know for people who may not know that only seventeen percent of the population owned or controlled more than eighty percent of all the slaves.  Most of the slave owners had one and two and three slaves rather than a large plantation.  Most of the slavery was concentrated in a few large plantations in South Carolina, tobacco and stuff of that sort, and Mississippi.  At the time of the [U.S.] Civil War, Mississippi was the richest state, almost the richest state in the Union because of slavery.  They spent more money than any other state defending the Confederacy, which left them broke when the war was over, left Mississippi, and have never recovered, almost never urbanized so my grandmother's statement and then later my mother [Mattie McConner Black] and father's memories of what their parents had related to them--.
Story_ID: 3487
Speaker 1: You were saying my parents' statements?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my parents' memories of their parents' statements which they would relate to us made it very clear to me that slavery was a terrible institution.  And as I say later it was verified by things that I begin to read.  But that was the only first hand knowledge that I had with and ex-slave, my grandmother was born in slavery and, of course, my grandfather who I didn't have a chance to really get to know very well.  My mother [Mattie McConner Black] and father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] having worked as sharecroppers in the South thought of that as being like slavery and so they left to go to Birmingham [Alabama].  Now the verification of what they must have felt came during my experience in the [U.S.] Army.  That the young black man in my unit 308th Quartermaster Railhead, most left from rural Arkansas and Mississippi.  Most of them were so glad to get away from there but most of them could not read or write.  I'm speaking of the rural, I'm not talking about the kids from the cities.  Most of them could not read or write and when they told us stories of their lives, in those places in Arkansas and Mississippi, I had to write for many of them to their girlfriends or whatever and many of their girlfriends had left to come North to work in the--their wives had come North to work in the defense plants and never returned.  So, I had the direct experience of the tyranny of the South in many of those places. And then, of course, when I was in the Army, after I had been inducted reluctantly, I remember the race riot across the country in many places.  New York [February 1943] and Detroit [Michigan, June 1943] had the worse ones and I couldn't get up to Detroit.  My mother wanted me--my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] was in the Army--wanted me to go to Detroit to see how my cousins. My uncle had died, my Uncle Walter had died and Aunt Bertha was there by herself with the children. She wanted me to go.  I couldn't get out of the city [Chicago, Illinois] to go to Detroit.  So my father's position was, "If you got to fight, go up to Detroit, why are you going someplace else?"  My mother's position said, "Obey the law."  They sent me a draft notice the first time.  "Greetings, your 'Uncle Sam' has selected you from among your neighbors to serve your country."  And I sent it back saying, "I don't have any uncle named Sam.  I had an uncle named William and Henry but I don't have any uncle named Sam."  But they sent me back another one believe it or not.  My mother said, "Obey the law."  But I was drafted reluctantly and refused to pledge allegiance.
Story_ID: 3488
Speaker 1: You know I want to go back to your parents a little bit.  Their names, your mother's name was?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Mattie, Mattie McConner.
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: Timuel D. [Dixon Black], Senior.
Speaker 1: You were the only boy than?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I had a brother [Walter Kerrigan Black]. There's my brother's picture.  There's my brother's picture over there.  He was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: So there were three kids?
Speaker 2: My sister, who was--she was my sister regardless of the fact that my father married previously--she was my sister and a beautiful person because she let me get away with whatever I wanted to do and my brother and that was it.  Another factor in the First Migration that might be worth noting; most of the parents, despite the fact that they might have known nothing about birth control, did not have big families because the children were going to school.  The idea was the children were going to school, finish school, and go to college.  That was the idea.  Now that didn't always happen, but that was the idea.  So there were no big families. No longer could they pick cotton or tobacco, they're a liability; they're not an asset.  Now you see the Second Migration brought the children along and continued their habits in that new culture in the different culture because children of that period in their places were assets.
Speaker 1: So you were brought here when--your parents moved here when you were what?
Speaker 2: I was about eight.  We came in August of 1919.  A month after the [Chicago, Illinois race] riot--the riot was in July of 1919.
Speaker 1: And that was just--it was your mother being able to get out of there and let's get out of Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there's plenty of jobs.
Speaker 2: And we lived all right.  The home where I was born has been rehabbed by my older cousins and their children now returned because they returned.  It was a nice house. I've got some pictures around here.  You know, we were not--it was segregation--Jim Crow that was the barrier.

Speaker 1: But my question--I wanted to know a little bit about your parents and what they were like.  Like your mother [Mattie McConner Black], she was--how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was light-skinned by the way.  Not real, you knew she was Negro.  Legend has it that her grandmother chased a white man around the kitchen table and then she caught him and my grandmother came.  So (laughs) anyway it passed on down.  And she was well built woman, I mean shapely.  She was strong-looking.  Rather heavy set, not fat but rather heavy set.  Dimple cheeks and attitudinally, oh how would I describe Momma?  She believed that somehow God would make a way and so she was willing and did make great personal sacrifices for her children.  Now that group from Florence [Alabama] had a great deal of impact on each other because almost without exception before my late son [Timuel Kerrigan Black] passed.  He was saying, "Dad, I got to do a paper on Florence because everybody I know from Florence--," you know, his generation their mothers and daddies, if they didn't go to college they were insisting that everybody else go.  So it was a great deal of competition.  I didn't go until late, but my mother would nag me every night when I would come home drunk or whatever I was doing.  I found out that girls were different than boys, enjoyed that, but my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] was in college.  My sister and my mother's friends were calling her up telling them about their children.  Never ask about the ones that my brother and sister; always asked, "Well, how's T.D. [Timuel Dixon Black, Jr.] doing?"  She was a pacifist in many ways; without it being or saying you called that unless you messed with her children and then she lost her pacifistic attitude.  If you mess with her children she'll strangle you to death.  Warm, this kind of thing.  Everybody called my mother, whether they were related or not, they called her Aunt Mattie and they were welcomed into our house if they needed help.  She was a very generous person.
Story_ID: 3490
Speaker 1: My father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.], the only thing he believed in was his family, that's all.  I mean, if the guys came over to our house to play some cards or something that they did on payday and they'd say, "Come on Dix let's go out."  Daddy was going with them.  "You can have another drink here" but that was him.  He was a very--that was it, for him.  So he didn't--although he knew a lot of his friends from Birmingham [Alabama.]  Some of whom were very successful in business and stuff and I was surprised that the kind of people who knew him from Birmingham because he didn't talk a lot about it in terms of I know him, I know her.  He didn't talk about it.  But he was a strong little man and I believe my daddy could beat anybody in the world.  I just thought (laughs) I don't have to worry.  If I can't beat them, I'll go get daddy.  He'll do it.  Politically they were kind of different in the sense that my father was a Garveyite.  You've heard of Marcus Garvey.  He did not believe that there would ever be any hope for black people in this country and his idea was a back to Africa attitude.  He never went but that was his attitude. My mother [Mattie McConner Black] was an integrationist.  Now you say how do these two people get along with these diverse attitudes?  They loved one another.  It's that simple, they loved one another so they could have differences.  For example, Momma's whole thing was for the children.  My daddy didn't believe in over-spending.  So one day he came home and said, you know, my mom was telling him,  "Well it's for the children (unclear) deserve it."  "Mattie we can't afford that.  Listen, Mattie we can't afford it."  "(Unclear) it's for the children."  And I understood the nature of power there too.  He was the working person bringing in the money so he put his cigar in his mouth and just simply didn't talk about it.  Then he walked away.  And Momma said the only time I every heard, "You old shit ass."  Daddy put his cigar back in his mouth and said "Mattie, you shouldn't be talking like that around these children."  He' didn't have to get mad.  He had the power.  He exercised his power on payday.  So she was furious and another occasion Daddy came home--see my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] was always out trying to make some money.  He never did make very much but he was out there trying and I wouldn't--I didn't care about money, job nothing like that.  I just wanted to have something to eat.  And so he came home one day and apparently it was a bad day and my mother was washing the dishes and he said, pardon my language.  He said, "Mattie you know what Nick (?) said to me today?"  Momma was busy washing dishes.  She playing straight lady, you know.  "What he say?"  "Dick, you reckon the Lord know how these white folks treating us down here?"  Momma said, "What did you say.  What did you tell him Dixon?"  "I told him hell yeah he know.  He just don't give a damn."  I thought the sky was going to fall in and there was a banter, you see between them on that level that made listening not only easy but interesting.  You never could tell what the conversation was going to be or what was going to come out but they--when my mother died, my father wanted to die.  They've been married sixty years; so long that they almost looked alike.  They could anticipate what each other was about to say. And when my mother died, my daddy said, "Mattie, you don't have a right to leave me like this.  You don't have the right to leave me like this," and after that is was just a matter of time.  In that setting I got a feeling of family, many of us had that kind of experience.  My family wasn't that much of an exception.  It's important to remember at that time that I'm talking about approximately 80 percent of the children in the black community, 80 to 85 percent of the children that grew up in the black community grew up in two-parent households.  That only began to break down again when you go back to these migrations and stuff.  That only began to break down in the late '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  And now we have less than 35 percent of black children who are born into two-parent families; under 18 [percent] who are born into two-parent households.  My mother and father were good parents.
Story_ID: 3491
Speaker 1: Who do you think you're most like and why?
Speaker 2: I'm a combination of both.  That stupid thing I did about the--I was telling you about in the election.  My dad [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] never would have done that.  My mother's willing to be fair.  My daddy's only fairness was to his family.  Everything else, you go get your own--I'm going to take care of my own.  The willingness to die for a cause that you believe in--they both were--my mother [Mattie McConner Black] was much more willing to compromise maybe because my daddy's position was die.  You want to be a man, die.  So when I was in the [U.S.] Army, I almost had to do that on a couple of occasions.  I had to think on my mother's side, see?  But at one point, not because of being in the Army in the combat because of the way we were treated in the South.  I was prepared to--the white man had the backup in that case, he had to backup.  I was going.  I was going to go over there and get killed?  I may as well get killed right here in Richmond [at the Quartermaster Replacement Training Center, Fort Lee, Virginia].  That was my feeling.  So let's get it on.  So that's the daddy--I would have been ashamed to tell my father what had happened to me in Richmond, Virginia and then I backed away.  And I was just the way that he was.  My mother said, "Well, you know, you can give a little bit.  I don't want you to die, I don't want you to die."  So, there were a combination of those two people--my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] was much more like my mother.  He was much more like my mother.  Tender, gracious, all those nice gentlemanly things but I can be a gentleman but I don't have to be.
Story_ID: 3492
Speaker 1: Now what was the young Timuel like?  What was he like?  Was he quiet, was he rambunctious, was he mischievous?
Speaker 2: Depends on the circumstances but I would say on the whole most people who knew me growing up would have said I was quiet.  I was shy.  I didn't want to get into a situation where I might be wrong and feel uncomfortable.  So I was rather shy and with my mother [Mattie McConner Black] and her sisters and friends in the house, coming by and cooking and talking and stuff.  I was a good listener.  That's why if I get this oral history out you will see--a good listener.  I didn't have to insert myself into it but I was also so very curious and I remember--I don't know where--my mother and my aunt and all would talking about these grandiose plans they had for their children and all and I would interject into it sometimes, "Now how are you going to do that?"  I was always so to the point where they would say, "Here comes old Mr. Killjoy."  "How are you going to do that?  That's what you want to do but how are you going to do that?"  That was innocent inquiry and I was very young and I always wanted to know how are you going to do that.  I might say a little bit, in some ways introspective, except at certain times and that was born out of my ignorance of listening and then wondering how it was going to happen.  So in elementary school where I graduated finally, I was mischievous with the rest of the guys my age.  We'd wind up throwing erasers at each other until one day my mother was looking and came up and I didn't know she was and I had the eraser in my hand and getting ready to throw it and somebody said "T.D. [Timuel Dixon Black, Jr.] you're mother's standing outside," and I tried to put the eraser down softly but she had seen it.  My mother and father  [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] didn't believe in corporal punishment so they would--they didn't have to punish my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black].  He was such a nice guy.  He was my model, you see.  That's always terrible to be (unclear) because your brother or your sister is going to follow you.  And so, I always within the limits--oh, my mother and father didn't believe in corporal punishment.  What they would do is simply say I couldn't go out.  I would have rather taken a whipping because my friends would be coming by and saying come on out and play or doing something like.  Momma would say you can't go out for a week.  So when I'd come home from school I would have to just stay and read or study.  I couldn't go out and play softball or the games, you know, mumblety-peg or root the peg, the games that we boys played--shoot marbles and stuff like that.  And now I would have rather taken that whipping if that was in order but they didn't believe in corporal punishment.
Story_ID: 3493
Speaker 1: And why do you think that was the case?  That's not very, black [his parents not believing in corporal punishment].  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: Well my mother [Mattie McConner Black] wasn't exactly into being just black.  And that's the whole thing, she didn't go that far in school but my mother was very, very well read and she read the books. And when we'd go to--get ready to go to bed I remember her reading fairy stories and stuff to us, particularly early on when I was, younger.  She was very thoughtful about the future.  Very much immersed in the future so whatever would get you into the mainstream like she would say, we never lived close to poor white folks.  The white folks we lived close to were usually middle class and good schools.  I could walk from here to every house to where I have ever lived.  And the neighborhoods at that time were quite a bit up-to-date and schools were good and that was the main thing.  We might move out of an apartment like this to move to another apartment that was less because the schools were going to be better. So when I went to college some years later--when my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] first went to the University of Illinois [Champaign-Urbana], you didn't have to take all these funny tests and crap and remedial stuff.  He was ready to go to college to the University of Illinois like everybody else and I was ready and I finally went back.  I wondered what--people taking remedial something?  Not when I went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  It was all right.  That's a pretty good school.  So my mother's interest was and this competition because she's got her friend's children also going to school getting doctorates and stuff; was that we would fit in and so she would--music, my aunt was into classics and opera, Aunt Georgia.  You know Madame [Ernestine] Schumann-Heink and [Amelita] Galli-Curci was that tenor from Italy and then the black guys like Roland Hayes and Paul Robeson, and then we'd sneak in some Louis [Armstrong] and some Bessie Smith, Mamie Smith and stuff like that we'd slip in there.  We had a (unclear) from New Orleans [Louisiana] so it was a well-rounded kind of home education, and so for me it was--of course, most of my friends in the neighborhood, most of my friends had more than I did.  Obviously I'm talking about--my mother's talking about middle class and we should have been living with the poor folks.
Story_ID: 3494
Speaker 1: Coming back to the--this--so I begin to have this feeling of service and I began to see another part of the black community that I wasn't familiar with: the less fortunate.  Concentrated kind of part. So I really became educated.  I was making more money than most college graduates in this.  So I couldn't see any reason--my mother [Mattie McConner Black] was still talking about when you going back to school?  And so when I was drafted, I was promised the opportunity when I returned that I would be a--what they called a district superintendent which meant I would have a staff of seven or eight of field men, field agents. But, when I was in the service I became--and some of those people wrote me some beautiful letters--when I was in the service even more deeply my felling about injustice was there.  And then I saw Buchenwald, Germany--a prison camp [Nazi concentration camp].  And my CO [commanding officer] and I--I wasn't a liberator, I mean--we just went out of curiosity but we had heard about that.  Couldn't believe it.  I cannot believe that human beings would treat other non-combatant human beings that way.  I couldn't believe it, so we got in the jeep and we went up there and I saw it and I cried and my first utterance was "Kill all the Germans.  Kill them all."  And then I thought of the Germans who are in the American Army like [U.S. President Dwight D.] Eisenhower and Eichenburg or--then another thought.  This could happen to anybody--anywhere and we're seeing that manifested today in places.  In Africa and in Europe and other places--mass extermination.  Others may have been thinking about coming back home and making a lot of money, that never crossed me.  I knew I was going to make a living, I mean I've always had that kind of confidence I would make a living.  So when I returned I was intending to immediately go back to school because I had the G.I. Bill [federal assistance to veterans for educational purposes].  No longer any excuses, but then I met my first wife and we got married. And then we began to have a family, and then I began to tell about organizing the agents. And like anybody who handles a lot of money--sometimes you're going to not have all of it accounted for on quick notice.  So they blocked my--they knew what I was doing.  Now there were other guys who were much more, you know, in the red than I was, but they blocked my books and I walked in one day and I had been fired--another fortuitous, best thing that could have happened to me. It's like that Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois] incident when I was running and somebody hit me and I came to my senses.  They fired me.  Now there were other people who were much more short, they were shorter, I mean, in terms of money, and I was going to hand my in by report time but they wanted to get rid of me.  I was dangerous to the company.  The company which was a black company which was having all kind of speakers come in and talk about the race issue but at the same time as business people they said, "No, no," you know. So they had my check ready when I came there the day--and then I thought to myself I can make no more excuses now.  And I thought about where to go.  I first went over to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and than I thought maybe that would be too competitive and I went to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois]. And in some ways that--and that's when I met other people like [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington, [Charles] Chuck Hamilton--retired professor of political science at Columbia [University, New York, New York], Dempsey Travis [real estate entrepreneur], Warren Bacon, all of us practically returned, and the guy who heads the Jazz Showcase [Joseph Segal], who was playing jazz then, he was at Roosevelt and [U.S. Congressman, Illinois] Gus Savage.  Gus was real radical--Gus was so radical I thought he was a white Communist.  I didn't know he was a black guy until I met him.  And let's see--he's out in Evanston [Illinois] now.  I just met a lot of people, girls on the West Side, who was a leader on the West Side, just a lot of people who shared the same kind of view about the world, and then St. Clair Drake was my favorite instructor.  So it was he that suggested that I should go to graduate school and he thought of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I said, "I can't go, I have a family."  And so he was finishing up his doctorate at the U of C [University of Chicago].  [Dr. William] Allison Davis [sociologist, professor] had just gotten there and so he suggested that I go to U of C and that's why I wound up at the U of C. I never finished the doctorate because I got involved in the Civil Rights Movement and I had everything done but the paper, everything.
Story_ID: 3495
Speaker 1: What was your undergraduate degree?
Speaker 2: Sociology.
Speaker 1: Sociology and why did you choose that?
Speaker 2: I was intending to be a researcher and I thought sociology was (unclear)--and partly because [St. Clair] Drake.  Drake was a sociologist in anthropology so I thought, I'd like to do this--this guy does this so well and so interesting.  You know, and they had just published.  He and [Horace] Cayton has just published 'Black Metropolis' and again, I came back home with the idea of involve myself in social change, and I thought I ought to be informed. So my earliest feelings were not so much to be an activist but to be a scholar.  To do the research so that other people--who were doing the activist.  But I found myself caught up in the activist period.  Remember, I had my first experience--I had some of it.  My father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] was in the labor movement and my first time on a picket line was when I was twelve years old at 43rd [Street] and Prairie [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] and the issue was don't spend your money where you don't work.  I had almost been sentenced severely in the United States Army because I organized my whole regiment on an issue with doing the Battle of the Bulge [World War II 1944 German offensive] and I didn't know what I was doing and the man said, "This is not the CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations], this is not the AFL [American Federation of Labor]." And I realized he was right and I was--had it not been for some of the black officers who went to Paris [France] to pick up help, I probably would have been dishonorably discharged for all kinds of reasons.
Story_ID: 3496
Speaker 1: I was accused of--a Belgian prostitute accused me of raping her and that was by design, because of my attitude. And fortunately, I could prove that I was not even close to where she was, but her--I was with the wrong group that evening.  I was with guys from Chicago [Illinois] and New York and Detroit [Michigan]. And so I had to deal with the discredit their officers, who were black, and I just happened to be with them because I got along better with them than I did with guys of my unit, you know, we were city boys. And this woman just went straight down the line.  She got to me, pointed to me.  So they took me into the stockade and I was--it was a sad time. I got--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Did you have to go through a court martial?  Were you--?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) No, this--one of the black officers went to Paris [France] to the Adjutant General's office and he brought back--what's his name? Who later became and alderman here--who had an automobile name in the 20th Ward [of Chicago, Illinois]. But he brought back this officer, this black officer and they did an investigation and they found that this was a prevalent way of behavior, and that these white officers hated having equal black officers. The black officers told this girl, this woman, "We know why you want us but he's not part of us."
Speaker 2: Could you say that again?
Speaker 1: "We know why you want us.  You want to discredit us but he's not a part of that."  So then they put me in the lineup again and she came down the line and she couldn't find me.  So they let me, you know, go free.  But I knew what it was.  My commanding officer--let me give you--there was so much of this.  They had a manual in World War II, 'How You Treat Colored Troops,' especially for the white officers, 'How to Treat Colored Troops.'  One day I'm sitting at the desk in the orderly room and my captain--I had access to the records too. And I passed the test, AGCT  [Army General Classification Test] on the first time better than he did the second time, but he was the officer.  When I was in Camp Lee [later called Fort Lee, Virgina], they closed down the opportunity for those of us who qualified to go to OCS [Officer Candidate School] because they had enough--what they considered enough black officers in the Officer Candidate School so that's went they sent us overseas.  Most of us became non-commissioned officers so we had access to the records and stuff.  Now he's aware that I'm aware that he didn't do as well on the test the second time that I did on the first time.  I'm looking at him reading this book, 'How You Treat Colored Troops.'  My daddy [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] and me, forced me to say, "Sir what is that you're reading?" very politely.  It was embarrassing to him.  So he fumbled around and tried to explain and I said, "Sir, you will not find me in that book."  I was furious and I meant that.  "You will not find me in that book."  Now the problem he faced was because I knew the logistics--and we were in the supply unit, we handled ammunition, food.  That is was not easy to deal with me without losing that--and I always tell young people today, "Be indispensable.  Be indispensable, and than you can get away with a lot of stuff.  But if you're not than they dispense with you." And I--so I was in that kind of a position.  They didn't have in this relatively illiterate group of people, there were just a few of us that could handle three million levels of suppliers almost every day to get them on those trucks and up to the front where they were needed.  So anyway, the guy that came back with this officer was Clifford Camel, who later became alderman but he was a captain or major.  Went through the ranks of the 8th Regiment Armory, which has its own story here in Chicago [first armory built for black regiment] where the military school [ref. to Chicago Military Academy public school] is now. So you had--that was all black, so the officers went and people like Cliff wound up in--let's see who else was there?  There were just so many, but it was the gifted guys.  So he came back and did some investigating and they found out that there was corruption of all kind among the officers in many of the places there so they had to make up. So they left it at that time but I was on a rest in quarters. And during the 'Battle of the Bulge' in where we were, we had German prisoners doing the work, doing the heavy work and stuff. And the Germans, this is their last stab because we, the United States had bombed out most of their air supplies and stuff. But they began to drop young SS [Schutzstaffel] troopers [Nazi elite soldiers] behind the lines with the intentions of destroying the supplies.  That was the one thing they had.  Because we had treated our German prisoners humanely, most of them, they didn't want to fight either.  They just happened to be there.  Some of them came to me and said, "Mister, we have saboteurs," which meant then, we had to take the white troops out of operation at night. Because our orders were if you see a white soldier--see the white troops they dropped spoke perfect English. Some had lived in the United States.  You ask them a question the Brooklyn Dodgers [baseball team]--the Dodgers were in Brooklyn [New York] at that time--they might be able to answer you what the Brooklyn Dodgers were doing.  These were young, tough young men.  So our orders were to capture or kill them if you see them.  So they took all the normal white soldiers out.  Well, then that left no one to load those cars up, you see.  So that meant that we had to then do that in addition to patrol duty and that was part of the organizing.  Now, I didn't have to do it but those guys came to me and told me and we have to reorganize and the CO [commanding officer], that was just one incident.  So I was a troublemaker.  I mean when I'd go from one unit to another they'd say--the officers would call me in and say, "We see that you're a troublemaker. Is that true?"  I said, "No.  No, I don't cause any trouble.  I don't know how that got in there."  And so I came back home with another attitude and that was to change the world, I haven't worked--haven't worked too well.
Story_ID: 3497
Speaker 1: You went to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois].  You found a nuturing environment, really.
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.  Very much so.  White and black.
Speaker 1: White and black.
Speaker 2: (Nods for yes).
Speaker 1: It was a unique place then?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh yes, very exciting, very exciting, very exciting.  See a lot of us were returning from service with all of our experiences.  Quite a number of the newcomers, the whites were white Jewish.  They had seen some of the problems of World [War] II with their relatives.  See there were almost no Jewish people living today that didn't lose somebody in the Holocaust.  So they had an immediate attachment.  So we had--and then with our professors, the reason Roosevelt came into being was a rebellion against the old [Central] YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] College [Chicago, Illinois]. That was the outgrowth of rebellion on the part of the professors against the restrictions.  Roosevelt was the first school--predominantly white school in the country to accept people of color--black folk--without reservation as long as you could do the work.  So it was very popular and we were raising money by the same company that I used to work for that took the leadership in raising money on a regular basis to support Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: The insurance company [Metropolitan Burial Society]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had an annual fundraiser for Roosevelt.  It was very popular, very popular.  So, and the--and most of our professors were either Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], U of C [University of Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now what was the difference in the experience between Roosevelt and U of C?  Was there much of a difference or how was--what was [Dr. William] Allison Davis like?
Speaker 2: Oh, Allison Davis was a beautiful guy.  Quiet.  You know, when he first came over there, the first full professor at a major university in the United States, he could not join the Reynolds Club [men's social center on the University of Chicago campus].  You know, the club for the--he couldn't find a place to live so he lived in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois].  He was the mentor to St. Clair Drake.  Yeah, he was--when they did the book they did together called, what's the name?  When Drake was just apprenticing, what's the name of that?  Southern something.  At that time, [Dr. William] Allison Davis was at the United Church of Christ College in New Orleans.  I forget the name right off hand.  Not Xavier, Xavier is--it's that other one [Dillard College, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Nice little college.  I was--but he was a professor there and the university, in order to off set its reputation as being non-blacks was looking for someone, [Dr.] Allison Davis was trained Ph.D. in anthropology but seldom every taught anthropology.  At the university he taught across disciplines.  He was a quiet guy.  When he first--when students, particularly those from the South, would come into his class and see this obvious man of color, 'cause you can't tell it by his son.  You see this man of color, they would move to the back.  He never raised his voice, but he was so good that by the time the first week or so was over, they'd be scrambling to get to the front (laughs) to get this guy. And he was eventually to be my--he was.  He used to call me up every week, "When you coming back and finish that work?  When you coming back and finish that work?"  Because, at that time I was the only black person at the doctorate level in the program.  But I've gotten caught up with the [labor] Movement in '54 [1954], '55 [1955], I was fully immersed.  I wasn't going to take no time off this.  Two years off to do that stuff.  I never regretted it.
Speaker 1: So were would you--
Speaker 2: I was already older.  You know, I was in my thirties by this time.
Story_ID: 3498
Speaker 1: Would you consider yourself--were you working in the [Civil Rights] Movement or you were just caught up in the movement?  Were you working?  You go back to work--
Speaker 2: I was in the labor movement.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were in the labor movement.
Speaker 2: I was in the labor movement.  I was helping to organize the teacher's union.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: When you left the U of C [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: OH yeah, yeah.  That was just one part of the total movement.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I was in the peace movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not confined to the race issue.  That happened to be the core but I was in the whole peace issue, which was very important to me.
Speaker 1: Well, who were you working with at these points, at these different times?  Were you working for unions or were you working for--
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't working.  I was working, I was teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where my income was.
Speaker 1: So you were teaching, you were teaching in '55 [1955]?  You left--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I started teaching in '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I left--.
Speaker 1: In public schools.
Speaker 2: In public schools, yeah.  I was out at Gary [Theodore] Roosevelt  [High School, Gary, Indiana] first.  No, first I went back to my old alma mater, DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and they had a great basketball team and the team went downstate.  But then I had an offer to go to another place and I went to Gary, Gary Roosevelt.  So at Gary Roosevelt I had one of the great basketball players, who later became very famous and teachers mistreated him.  Gary Roosevelt was all black.  [Richard] Dick Barnett, "Skull" Barnett, you've heard of Skull?  Skull was one of my students and I encouraged him to stay in school and he now has a Ph.D. in psychology after he left the floor.  Yeah, I went--and then I--the principal of Roosevelt and I didn't get along too well and he was about to try to ruin my--well he did hurt me. Because I had a call to teach in a high school in White Plains, New York which I was looking forward to. And Mr. [H. Theodore] Tatum, who had the last say--they had sent me my airplane ticket to come there to be interviewed.  And Tatum waited patiently until everybody--then he wrote that letter indicating that they shouldn't hire me and--because he was my last employer.  Mr. Tatum was a--Roosevelt at that time had the most highly trained faculty in the state of Indiana.  Many of the people had--all--most of them should have been teaching at the college level.  Two of them became college presidents.  So it was indeed, but it had an elitist class division and I transcend class.  If you let me I'll transcend race--all of those barriers that keep us apart. But for Tatum, because when he came to Gary he was the most highly educated Negro in Gary, he was given responsibilities for the political control of the Garyites [people from Gary, Indiana].  Good school in terms of that upper third, upper fourth, but for the ones who would be ignored, the bottom ones, lived in public housing and stuff, it was just like any other segregated kind of thing.  And so I stayed there for two years and by this time I'm in demand.  I never worried about a job.  I mean, that's not my life. I never worried about a job, but I don't need much and I pay my bills, so if you fire me (unclear)--before too long, pay my bills so I go get another job and pay my bills.  Say what I want to say when I get ready.

Speaker 1: That's what--as an activist, as a person who spent a lot of time and different, as you say, you know, of causes and different movements. What--did you see similarities between these movements?  Any movement was an okay movement or was it--were there--.
Speaker 2: Well, most movements that are social, have a social origin are related to other things.  The race issue is an American social issue, not just black, because if you're able to keep a segment of the population out of the mainstream, you reduce the value of the parts that are in the mainstream, because in a competitive capitalistic system you can always threaten those who are better off with those who are not.  'Cause you have those who are not wanting the things that those who have and fighting for 'em and will deal with them when they get a chance.  The peace issue. If we don't have good race relations we not going to have peace on the local scene and eventually on the international scene.  Most wars start, in their infancy, with a group rebelling against the kind of treatment that they receive, and war emerges out of that.  So peace becomes--not peace, you know, justice becomes paramount not just peace.  So within the framework of peace you've got to have justice.  So when we deal with--the criminal justice system, for example, we see the differences in treatment of by race or ethnicity.  Then we have to have, not just peace, we have to have justice. Now we may have to go to war to have justice, so that's kind of contradictory. But how do you go to war? Various kinds of ways.  So there's an interrelatedness with those social issues but then in order to make the change, it is important to have some impact or some control on the political and the economic system. So the struggle is a total one.  You have to be influenced or control those who make the political decisions inside what we call a civilized society, and you must have some control over the distribution of economic resources so that you will not create tensions and undesirable activities among those who are among the have-nots.
Story_ID: 3500
Speaker 1: You were talking about your mother [Mattie McConner Black] and how she--how education was important.
Speaker 2: Education was very important and so coming back to me as my--in my elementary school--and we changed schools a bit and then I find the last six years of my elementary school I was at one school, [Edmund] Burke [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois].  And Burke was very, very, very, you know--where the population that preceded us for the most part was there for a little while was Irish Catholic, middle class, Jewish, middle class.  Merchants sometimes, but white middle class.  By the time we graduated school it was almost all black.  But in that class, in my class, the competition was pretty good.  One of our guys wound up being, Charles White, the artist--he and I graduated grammar school together.  Charles was already showing his talent when we--Carl Cotton, who became one of the first and maybe the only black taxidermist in a major museum.  He was at the Field Museum [of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois] for many, many years.  [Herbert] Herbie Evans, who is a chief [State Civil Court] judge in New York now--he went to New York as a dancer.  Marie Brandt, who was a choreographer for Duke Ellington.  I can't dance but I watched them dance.  There was a lot of talent in that group.  There were some rough guys too though.  When I got to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], because of my economic situation and because the teachers didn't want blacks there at that time, we couldn't use the swimming pool.  Couldn't go to the proms--had to create their own proms.  And I'm in the [Great] Depression--by this time the class factor is entering into it.  I'm not getting invited to the parties and stuff with the rest of the kids.  I began to get into--with the tough guys, with the rough 58th Street crowd.  They were not necessarily poor, but they were usually guys from single family homes whose mommas were working all day and they just had a lot of freedom.  And they were kind of a--sometimes they begin to be off-beat in terms of the law and I was into that, and I can understand how kids get into a gang and can't find their way out, until an incident happens where I had to find my way out because I could not have explained to my mother and father [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] anything about that particular incident.  I got hit by another guy with a baseball bat and I thought I was paralyzed, and I just dropped out of it at age thirteen, I just dropped out of that group.  They wanted to give me a whipping, and tried, didn't use guns and that stuff in that day.  But I was pretty good with my fists and much better with my feet, so between running and fighting I was able--and I picked up with another group and that group was the fun group.  That was a group, [Robert] Bob Carroll, Carl Cotton, Lester Reed--I gotta call Lester--all of them gone. And another culture then at this time--Bob Carroll and his father was a Methodist minister, had people coming by his house like Countee Cullen [poet], Reginald Forsythe [black composer] and all that kind of musical. And so I got to see that part of black life.  And then I transferred myself. I forged my mother's signature and went from Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois] to Wendell Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Scared to death because the reputation of folks was not--what my mother thought it ought to be.  And I knew a lot of people at Phillips.  I was afraid to ask where the office was, that's the kind of shyness I was and when I found one of my friends, Naomi, Naomi Young, she showed me where the office was and I was assigned to a homeroom and the guy who was sitting--they were seating you alphabetically, the guy who was sitting in the seat right behind me, a fellow by the name of  [Nathaniel Adams] Nat ["King"] Cole [singer] and we got to know each other. He was always talking about music and I was wondering how in the world is he talking about music. He should be talking about algebra or geometry or something and he's talking about music and then his friends would come by--and Nat and I kept in touch until a month before he died.  He called and told me--we were trying to have a tribute to the man who taught so many of those guys,  'Captain' Dyett,  Walter Henri Dyett [band director] at [Wendell] Phillips [High School] and then later at DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I was so glad that I transferred.
Speaker 1: To Phillips?
Speaker 2: To Phillips and Phillips was in--Phillips was 39th Street--.
Story_ID: 3501
Speaker 1: Now why did you do that?  Why did you forge your mother's [Mattie McConner Black] signature?
Speaker 2: Because she would never, ever, never have permitted me to transfer.  She told me just to overcome whatever the problems are.
Speaker 1: And what were the problems?
Speaker 2: Problems?  I was hanging out with the wrong guys.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I was hanging out with the wrong guys and, you know, most of those guys died before they were thirty (laughs).  Yeah, they were guys who--you know, they took all kinds of chances and now, I liked that too.  It was adventurous. But I knew that I couldn't take that home. I couldn't explain it. So, again, the family makes the difference.  Most of those guys were--the family situation where the mother was working and they were away, I mean like noble, and all those guys they were free--they didn't have no rules.  Like many boys, you know, boys do what their mommas--boys can manage a momma, and that's how they learn to manage women later on because they managed mommas so well when they were growing up. And so I couldn't do that.  Momma wasn't going to managed ithat way because she had to report to Daddy [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] and Daddy going to say do what your momma say to do.  So, I was trapped.  I couldn't quit school.  There was no way I could quit school--like those guys could quit and most of them did.  I couldn't quit school and couldn't find no way to quit school.  But I couldn't explain it to that woman who's freinds are calling up and telling how well their children are doing in school and she couldn't explain to me not being in school.  How do you explain that to anybody? And my dad is standing there saying do what your momma say.  So I was trapped.  I wasn't good, I was just trapped.  So I left and went to [Wendell] Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and for me that was--the academic standards at Phillips were not challenging to me but I had to lower my own attitude because I got on the basketball team.  I played on the basketball team.  They were shorter then. You could be short and play.  In fact we were one of the first all black team that played downstate in the 'Sweet 16' [basketball tournament playoffs].  Phillips had a fire and we moved to the new building which had been prepared for this overflowing black population in schools and that became the "New Wendell Phillips" and then a group of people, I think mostly women, had read enough to know that there was a man by the name of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, who was the first settler in Chicago [Illinois] and they demanded that the new building be named after him and the old building be resumed as a high school, the Wendell Phillips High School.  And so that period of growing up was fun.  We were not that far away from the Savoy [Ballroom] and the Regal [Theatre] and the Met [Metropolitan Theater].  If we really wanted to, we'd go downtown and brag about we saw [Duke] Ellington or [Cab] Calloway before he got to the Regal. They were going to come there but that was kind of a competitiveness.  I was hanging out in the pool room--Dad's Pool Room on 51st [Street] and Indiana [Avenue]. And my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] never did that either--missed so much fun.  And there were some very interesting characters. [Bill] 'Bojangles' Robinson came by there one night.  Bojangles, the tap dancer, he came by there one night in his Duesenberg [automobile] and one of my slick friends beat him out of a thousand dollars.  He was mad.  This guy was so good--that was the way he made his living, this fellow was a pool shark and he just stayed just far enough away from--above Bojangles that Bojangles thought he was going to win the next round.  Never could happen with this guy.  I didn't play that well, but I liked the company. I would--my contribution is that I would come over to the University of Chicago [Rockefeller] Chapel and listen, sometimes, to the lectures about people like--I didn't know it at that time, what's his name?  His father went to the university and was a professor.
Speaker 1: You're talking about [Dr. William] Allison Davis?
Speaker 2: No, Allison, this was way before Allison, but these are graduates.
Speaker 1: I mean his father, his father.
Speaker 2: Allison's father was my advisor when I was at the University [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  No, this was after. But I'm thinking about--oh, God. But anyway there was a number of people like that.  President [Benjamin E. Mays]--the late president of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  These were all--see at that point if you graduated from a southern, you know, historically black school and you decided you wanted to go to graduate school to be a lawyer or a doctor, you couldn't do it in the South.  They would, therefore, give you the money or finance you coming to a northern school and many of them came to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. And Julian Bond--Horace Mann Bond, that's Horace Mann Bond--Julian Bond is Horace Mann Bond--and that was a very aristocratic family in Georgia.  I mean, and Julian as you watch him, you know, he's.  So I'd come for his father, president of Morehouse. Mordecai Johnson, who is the president of [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--I'd come over and listen to these guys then I'd go back to the pool room and they would feed off of what--I mean, they wouldn't--they were glad I was doing that and then we'd have conversation about what they said in the pool room. And there was a guy who came--would come in there fairly regularly.  We didn't know who he was.
Speaker 1: Hang on a second--.
Speaker 2: (Pause in intervew).
Speaker 1: Hanging out in pool rooms and the people like to ask you--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I would--I would do that and I would go down to the--well, one fellow came in while he was writing it then, 'Native Son' and he would come and we didn't even know who he was.  He'd just come in.  He was a nice guy and we found out later that he was--what's his name?
Speaker 1: Richard Wright.
Speaker 2: Richard Wright, yeah. He was just a nice person.
Story_ID: 3502
Speaker 1: The pool room was primarily young people and the fellow who owned the pool room, "Dad," we called him, would tolerate no monkeyshines and he'd put you out.  So our parents [Timuel David Black, Sr. and Mattie McConner] were not worried about us being in the pool room, and because most of us knew each other and we weren't necessarily hustling--that was something, like the guy who beat [Bill] 'Bojangles' [Robinson].  But there was a constant interchange and race was there.  You know, I remember standing out--and we had some good guys, we could signify [competitive game of insults].  You know, you might get--Redd Foxx [comedian] might come in and we had guys real quick.  I remember one day we were standing outside the pool room and two pretty girls came by and Otis looked at them and he said, "My, my will I ever," and one of the girls trying to be smart said, "No, no, nigger never."  And Otis said, without missing a beat, "Where there's life, there's hope." And she said, "Where there's a tree, there's a rope," and he beat her. "That's for the blue-eyed girls."  But we were raised in that atmosphere with Redd Foxx, you had to learn how to--I never signified and I never played the dozens [competitive game of insults] because I didn't know.  I wasn't gonna have anybody talking about my momma.  I wasn't going to get into that and Redd, if you got in deep, he would, and others like him.  We had a lot of real artists in terms of expressions that they could match and have a competition almost on this.  So I kept quiet there except when somebody pretty nearly asked me something or I had to say something, and I'd shoot a little pool and then we'd just go walk around the neighborhood and listen to the music because there was no air conditioning. So all of these jazz spots you could hear the music outside and you could stop and see--hear Ray Nance [trumpeter] when he had his little band or Marl Young [pianist] or all those guys we could--they had so many places.  Maybe on Sunday we would take a walk and listen to some new music that we just began to appreciate.  Gospel, which was being sung in storefront churches--the few that existed, there weren't a lot of store front churches then.  Mahalia Jackson [gospel singer], Sister Rosetta Tharpe [gospel singer] and we'd talk about this. Who's the best?  Or we'd go and hear the bands and talk about the quality--and you didn't have to read no music. Your ears were good.  I got all that stuff over there and all that stuff--and then I was working when my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] went back to college.  I took his job in a grocery store at 59th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  I was just out of high school--I had been working on 47th Street and in that block was the [playwright Lorraine] Hansberry family with their chauffeur and all and one of the policy kings, Ily Kelly and I was kind of the delivery boy as well as the clerk in the store. And I got to see and meet all of these kind of people and they would invite me to their homes after hours and things. And because I never--tried to always be modest about what I might know. Inadvertently sometimes, if they asked me or if I thought the stake was too big and I knew the answer, I'd slip it in and than be quiet again.  I was accepted in these various circles--from the bottom of them.  You know, I'd sit on the bar where Billy Eckstine [singer] was.  Where the jazz musicians and things up on 55th Street next to the old theater and they would--I was part of them--I was part, not part of their group--I didn't know that kind of talk. And later before I was drafted, one of the girls who lived in my building, in the building were we lived at 66th [Street] and Calumet [Avenue], developed a nice relationship with Lester Young. You know, 'Prez,' the tenor saxophone player. And so he'd come by and see her and they would--and she would invite me to go with them after he wasn't playing. And then I got to know Billie Holiday, and opened up--and I'm getting older now--and opened up a place called the Pershing, no not the Pershing but the place on Oakwood Boulevard and [William "Count"] Basie [jazz bandleader, composer] and all those guys just to, not Basie himself but his band used to stay at the Oakwood Manor because I knew Prez and Clotille and her brother--we could go there and watch those guys run up and down the hall playing their music.  I mean, they played better music--challenged each other in the hall then they did on the stage because they could do whatever they wanted to do.
Story_ID: 3503
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you around that time though you were from the time--.
Speaker 2: Now I'm not in school.  I've graduated.
Speaker 1: I know you've graduated from school--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) From high school.
Speaker 1: So you were more--you were more of a student of life in many ways.  You're working but you're on--you're experiencing life.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. And I've forgotten to explain that I got to know that girls were different than boys and that took some--.
Speaker 1: Took some what (laughs)?
Speaker 2: (Laughs).  It took some time to find out if that was really true or not and thank God it was. So I am--we were men about town. You know, a young man about town.  But time is moving on.  I move up to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and work--my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] graduates and he can't find a job and he's a college graduate, you know and all that.  He had been refused an opportunity, he and Dave Pelkey had been refused an opportunity to go to law school at the University of Illinois Law School [Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] because of the race. They took on the race issue and made an issue of it.  There were the only two blacks who were to be enrolled at the law school in Champaign-Urbana. And they took it on into the guys at the NAA [NAACP, National Asscoiation for the Advancement of Colored People].  And the Dean called and told him, "Withdraw that suit, or we're gonna see that you"--withdraw the suit, not about the law school, about segregation in Champaign-Urbana, which is just like a southern town. They had taken--their girlfriends had come down to Chicago [Illinois] to spend what they call homecoming or whatever they call it and they were trying to show off--go to the nicer restaurants and stuff, and they were refused admission so they sued along with some of their white friends at the University [of Illinois]. And they called Dave and walked in, told them if they didn't withdraw from that suit--the dean of the college--they would not pass, they would not make it through law school.  So he came home and went to the University and then he came home and went up to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] where we all and I was--and we were playing basketball for Greenbaum Tannery [leather tanning company]. And Greenbaum Tannery had a lot of immigrants as well as some of us blacks.  This was just before the war, getting ready for the war [World War II].  The United States was the supply basket for the rest of the world, and the pay was bad.  We had good jobs 'cause we represented the company in a very positive way, so we had pretty good jobs.  But again, that's another part of the life that my mother particularly foisted on us.  There's not enough for you to be getting along.  What about your brother, your sister, who may be less fortunate?  You have a responsibility to them.  So I took on one of the floor supervisors on that issue and I got fired. And my brother--I went the branch of the Urban League in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] to protest that. And the woman who was the head of it had been--her brother was a friend of my brother, and her father was pastor of St. Mark Methodist Church which was on 50th [Street].  Anyway we were moving our case pretty good, but I got fired so I didn't have any income. So I came back to Chicago. And the [military] draft is just beginning, and my brother and a white fellow begin to organize that plant.  White guy--I forget his name--a nice guy, organized the white ethnic part, and my brother organized the blacks and then they came together and closed the plant down.  Now what they didn't know and I don't think they even cared, was that the national president of the union was an avowed Communist.  My brother had met a young lady from Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], whose father and mother quite wealthy people in Shreveport, Louisiana. And she'd come to the University of Illinois under those conditions and I say, she wanted to go to grad school and she couldn't go unless she would have went out of Louisiana.  So she came to Illinois.  So he married her while he was in Milwaukee.  She graduated and came up to Milwaukee--Weaver--and I came back to Chicago.  Then my brother and this other white fellow very quickly were drafted. But neither one of them despite their college education and all, could go to OCS [Officer Candidate School].  That was true of a lot of us who had anything to do with the radical movement whether you were a member of the [Communist] Party or not.  If you hung around it, you were therefore labeled and they searched your background all the way to almost to kindergarten to find out what kind of person were you.
Speaker 1: What was OCS?
Speaker 2: Officer Candidate School.  All the people with bars and stuff.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see sure, okay.
Speaker 2: That non-commissioned officer guy with stripes and stuff on there.  Now he got to be a master sergeant or a sergeant major like both of us guys got to be.  You had more power than the captain because you talked to the colonel and the major and they told you what to tell the captain to do.  But my mother [Mattie McConnor Black], there's that lady again, because all of her friends children were going to OSC, she wanted us to go to OCS.  I didn't care, I didn't care but my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] he did and the fact that this picture over there, he did and so it really hurt him that he didn't know what he was capable of doing.
Story_ID: 3504
Speaker 1: I came back to Chicago [Illinois] and went to work for this Metropolitan Burial Society.  That's a part of the funeral system, and that was almost accidental.  I was walking down the street and one of my friends, Isabelle, was working for the Jackson's and I just happened to see him and he said,  "Well come over here." And we had been grammar school kids together and he had married the niece of Mr. Livingston, who was the president of Jackson Funeral System, it was like a small insurance company.  Mr. Livingston didn't have any children so his niece was like his daughter.  When Jack married her then he became a big shot in the company but he was a good salesman.  He was very good.  I got his stuff too.  And Roy--I was walking down the street.  I was going to work there and I saw Roy Wood, [radio personality] a fellow by the name of Roy Wood, and he died about two years ago in Birmingham [Alabama] but who was quite a character here.  He helped to start off--you know, the black station here.  The one with [Chicago Alderman Clifford] Cliff Kelly.
Speaker 2: WVON [Chicago, Illinois radio station].
Speaker 1: Yeah. He and another one of my schoolmates, Bernadine Washington [radio personality].  So I saw Roy walking down the street and this was 1941, and Roy said, "Where are you working ," and I told him I was working for Met and he said "Ah, they don't make any money," and he pulled out this check. 1941 now, more than a hundred dollars and I said "What?  Can I come over there [to Jackson Funeral System]?" because they were right across the street from one another.  One was at 47th [Street] and one was at 45th [Street].  And so I did.  I went over there and took the training necessary and I went out on what they called a debit.  They gave me a debit and my debit was located around this place where I had hung out with the [Count] Basie guys from Langley [Avenue] to Cottage Grove [Avenue] and from 42nd Street to Oakwood Boulevard--no, really Pershing Road--and I learned then that I liked dealing with people.  I had to get rid of some of that shyness and I felt I was doing a tremendous service because what we did was guarantee that our policyholders would have a decent funeral.  At this time, white insurance companies were not taking any blacks.  There is no funeral service for blacks that you could get outside of the black community, none.  And my job was to sell these people this small insurance policy, which they could either cash in if someone passed, or if someone passed, they would get a full service funeral--a very dignified funeral.  That building next to that white building on 45th [Street] and King Drive was the funeral parlor. And when people would have their relatives or somebody pass, they would call me up and ask for my advice and I would tell them, then I would attend and help to arrange the funeral for them. And I felt very good about that. And I saw in this building black men and women who were executives, who were in charge, who were the boss and that was for me, just a thrilling thing. Now this book--this book over here. This boy did his dissertation on that whole issue of black business. But I was still militant. So I was gonna organize all the agents. But I didn't get a chance to do it--that was when I got that second letter telling me I had been drafted and I went to service in August of 1943. And because I had never been south in a--I had never been south in an uncontrolled kind of situation.
Story_ID: 3505
Speaker 1: You were going to ask a question about the movements.
Speaker 2: I was going to ask about movements but okay, I was going to ask what movement because you were talking about where you can be effective, when movements really can be affective, you know, when there ends up being some ability to sort of control distribution of resources and so I was asking the movements that you've been involved in.  What do you consider to be the most successful?
Speaker 1: Well the Civil Rights Movement, certainly made dramatic changes.  They were more obvious than any of the others.  The breakthrough, in terms of changing the laws that discriminate against people in terms of education and housing.  On paper, very definitely.  The enforcement of those things have not been what I would have liked but at least no longer is it legal.  We have cut out the de jure aspect.  Now what we ought to be working on and can work on is the de facto aspects which means then that we have in place and have to keep in place the whole issue of affirmative action.  That's the greatest reparations that could occur that does not injure hardly anyone in the richest nation in the world where we have an accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few and a growing disparity between what they have and those at the bottom.  We avoid trouble if we give those at the bottom who happen to be black or, are in some cases black females, because we're just beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women.  Black women just a little above black men in terms of the benefits.  So the breakthrough in the Civil Rights Movement of the '60s [1960s], '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '67 [1967], I guess, when Title Seven [of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, prohibiting discrimination for access to federally assisted programs on grounds of race, color, or national origin] came into being or something of that sort.  Officially have been very important but it's hard for me to separate that from the labor movement.  When I remember working in Ma and Pa grocery stores during the [Great] Depression seven days a week, sometimes ten, twelve hours a day for seven dollars a week and then a man came along by the name of 'St. Louis' Kelly--J. Lavert Kelly [President, Waiters and Bartenders Union], who organized us young black into a retail clerks union when we couldn't get into the white retail clerks union we organized our own union. Then later we were bided into the Retail Clerks Union but my pay jumped almost immediately from seven dollars a week to fifteen dollars a week. And then to seventeen fifty a week and I was given a day off so I had time to enjoy more then I had prior to that.  So the labor movement in my younger years was a very, very important breakthrough.  It made, of course, the retail clerks continued until their pay got better and better but I saw that as an organizing opportunity as well.  So when we get to the Civil Rights Movement those of us who had had experience in the labor movement, organizing and so, found it fairly easy to organize the unorganized, you know, who wanted to bring about change.  The peace movement has not been as successful.  Maybe because of the massive nature of the forces involved but even there, we've seen changes and we keep on trying to bring about a better world with people communicating and dealing with each other as human beings.

Speaker 1: Now you started out, I mean, you had (unintelligible) all your life, so you are a teacher in a classroom but you very quickly, well I won't say you were always an activist so those two things that sort of melded together.  But then at some point then you decide that politics is the way, you know to best be an activist?
Speaker 2: No I didn't exactly want--I never wanted to be a professional politician.  Never wanted to be.  My involvement as a candidate came because of the persuasion of other people, not because I volunteered to do that.  And those people thought that I would best be the person to bring about the changes on these other issues: education, housing. I would be one of those to take leadership and I would have but I know this, that politics--control of the political operation is the only true base of power.  People get it confused with money but you could have--if I was in charge, say I'm the boss of everything politically and [Microsoft CEO] [William] Bill Gates got ninety billion [dollars]. All I have to do, if I'm the boss, is declare his ninety billion counterfeit and go into a new currency, you see, and that has happened in places where you see the currency become of no value.  I was in Brazil going from one place to another and by the time I got to the other place my money was no good because the government had changed and they had declared whatever they call that stuff down there [in 1994, the 'cruzeiro real' was replaced with the 'real'], no good.  I had to pay the taxi driver and I didn't have any money.  I had some stuff in my pocket that looked like what I thought was money but no longer was it money, (unclear).  So if one controls the political apparatus then when they have control of the real power.  That power is economic, it is military, it has control of the apparatus of meeting out the rewards and punishments whenever--to whomever they please.  See, [German Nazi leader Adolf] Hitler was voted into office and immediately the thing he did was amass--concentrate all the power and through that be able to say to certain people like homosexuals. See, a lot of people forget about they were other blacks, gypsies.  You no longer can go to that school.  You no longer can live in that house.  All very legal, all very legal.  The Jews, you no longer can--get in this ghetto.  I don't care how much education you've got.  I don't care how much money--get in this ghetto.  That's the law.  That's political.  Jews had lots of money, many of them.  You know, House of Rothschild was Jewish.  You've heard of the House of Rothschild?  Yeah, that's Jewish banking.  They helped to finance two or three wars.  But when Hitler said, "I'm in charge of this stuff," with his coterie, and by the way some of those were Jewish that were up close to the man.

Speaker 1: But do you think because of your activism that you were a better teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See most of the students that I had--the other night at the (unintelligible)--most of those were white kids and they anecdotally told stories of how I had affected their lives and one of them was because I was out there.  It was my student in 1963, when the powers that be withdrew my basic forces from the labor movement and took them up in the 5th ward and then to [Oscar Stanton] DePriest, it was the students who then came to the rescue and made my showing creditable.  I didn't win because I didn't have the control but most of my best-trained people were demanded that they go up and work for Lynn Dupree because they thought that this black guy was going to beat Lynn.  I never thought that but they thought that.  They didn't want to take any chances and [United Auto Workers union president] Walter Reuther from Detroit [Michigan] put some pressure on [Willoughby] Bill Abner from Chicago and Willoughby had to go up into the 5th Ward.  So my students had the chance and my student saw me defend them sometimes against the principal.  They saw me, very early, challenging questions other teachers that they would not dare to do that on things that I considered unjustly and the word gets around and I'm proud to say that whenever; I might get on the bus or anywhere and somebody says, "There's Mr. [Timuel Dixon] Black [Jr.]."  I was in London [England], one of my former students came up out of the subway--big old crowd in London, "There's Mr. Black!"  "What you doing over here you old dumb boy?"  He happened to be a black guy going to a London School of Economics [and Political Science, London, England].  "You know, you supposed to be dumb."  He came up to me one day and he said, "Mr. Black did you go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?"  And I said "Yeah."  He said "Was it hard?"  I said, "I told you I went there didn't I?"  And in his quiet way he went on over to the University of Chicago, continued, got his Ph.D. in Economics and I saw him and he was getting his post-doctoral at the London School of Economics.  So I see somebody will be driving down the street and they'll say, "Mr. Black, where you going?"  I'll get me a free ride.

Speaker 1: I was teaching in a school once, well, it was in New York, not the city.  Where was I?  Ithaca I think it was.  When I went into the building all of the students, all of the teachers, everybody in the building was white but me, including the janitor.  The student's assumption was that I was only being brought there as a token and their role was to prove how dumb I was.  Well, they didn't understand me at all.  I'm in control of this.  So just hang tight and learn something.  Before the semester was over many more students wanted to get into my class.  The principal assumed along with these teachers who are now jealous that I'm nurturing, giving these kids grades they don't deserve.  They're working their butts off.  I don't have no foolishness in there.  We can have a good time but do my work.  And so the--he came in one day.  He wasn't that well trained and certainly not in my field and I was teaching world history and U.S. history and so, and the slave trade as a part of world history, the most profitable aspect of the commercial revolution: slave trade.  The commodities of the slave trade--that was more precious than anything else.  He came in and he looked and he said--the kids were just, oh they were roarin.' They were just showing off how (laughing) good they were because I had that kind of interchange.  So after they kind of--after they settled down--I mean they weren't raucous, they were just teaching each other.  They were teaching each other as well as--so he said "What is that you're teaching, Mr. [Timuel Dixon] Black [Jr.]?" I said "World history."  He said, "Well that's not the way the book--that's not the way the lesson plan or whatever it is--."  I said, "Oh, I'm teaching corrected world history and corrected U.S. history.  Here, you want to see this and if you have any problems you just let me know where I've been incorrect and I'll correct it."  Now the first year at graduation, in the yearbook there are two things, the teacher you--the class you like best and the teacher you like best.  I was first.  The next year, this was another school, next year the same thing.  They took that out of the book.  Took those two questions, those two issues out of the yearbook.  I think I've got some of the books here, took it out.  But I got ready to--when I was at [David Glasgow] Farragut [High School, Chicago, Illinois], which was within the Pilsen--Little Village neighborhood which was mostly Bohemian [Czech-German ethnic group] at that time.  This is where [Chicago Mayor Anton] Cermak came from.  I had--during the Civil Rights Movement they had thrown Bernard Lee, who was with [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], most of the time right behind him; he never said anything.  Bernie and the former mayor of Washington [D.C.], Marion Barry, man they had thrown him down the steps at the capitol in Montgomery, Alabama.  You know, I think 'Bama State [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] is there.  They had thrown him down the steps when they were protesting.  So they came here and Bennett Johnson, that's the guy I was trying to think about, was that he was out in Evanston [Illinois] now.  So I said oh well, let's have them over at my class.  Now my class, my classes where--they elected their own chairman or president and at least one day a week they would run the whole class.  Pick a subject and they'd run the class.  I would be just another part of the class.  So they came up.  So when I found out that Marion and Bernie were going to be available then I set the class up.  I forget what day it was.  I didn't matter which day that--since they were organized all ready, all they had to do was take over.  Now most of that class--most of those classes were--because they insisted--the principal did--that I have the best students of the higher classes and so when Bernard--and I suggested that they invite the principal to sit in on this discussion.  So when Bernie and Marion came they begin to tell their stories being in SNCC/C.O.R.E. [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee/Congress of Racial Equality] and how they were treated.  Now these white children who are doing the same thing to these black kids in that neighborhood at that time, these are the children of the Second Migration.

Speaker 1: They could never have done that to guys in my (unclear).  They would have gotten the shit beaten out of them.  But the southern flavor carried in, we can't win kind of thing and that's another story of how the gangs emerged and so they're just fascinated by the story.  "This is happening in America?"  The principal is sitting there asking the questions.  So, somebody, some of the teachers there called the superintendent's office downtown.  Now the superintendent had all ready been told to get rid of me, politically, but he couldn't do that; that's my base.  Get rid of me, get rid of the school and they told--you got to get rid of these two guys [Bernard Lee and Marion Barry] and he called me in and told me I had to get rid of them.  I said, "No, I'm not going to tell these two young men, who are putting their lives on the line to make democracy work, that they can't be in my classroom.  Now if you want them to go, you tell them.  I'm not going to tell them."  About this time, there's a rumble in the hall and a whole lot of young people, my students and others, mostly black and white, led by a Bohemian girl, Bonnie, come walking down the hall to the principal's office.  (Laughs)  They said, "What are you trying to do with Mr. [Timuel Dixon] Black [Jr.]?"  And he said nothing.  That's when I left Farragut [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I went to Hyde Park [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  The point I'm making is that those students, I see them occasionally now; black and white and they will go back and tell us about some of the stories, some of the things, some of the experiences they had.  Not necessarily--my assumption is that anybody can learn that stuff that they teach in school, reading, writing that ain't nothing but you've got to give them something to learn for.  Some motivation, they want to learn to plunge in and than they teach themselves.  They may come and ask you some questions every once in a while but they are teaching themselves with you as a resource and so the thrill of learning, as you know, internally has nothing to do with what somebody says to you.  It may stimulate your mind a little bit.  But, it's what you say to yourself, inside.  And once you're able to get that kind of gear rolling, then you learn.  You learn faster and you learn better.  So, whatever the good luck I may have had I have literally thousands of students who think I helped them to learn something.  And I tell them, "I didn't have nothing but smart students."  My students were so smart they made me think I was smart because they're so smart.  All of them smart.  That's the only thing.
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you and I'm sure anyone who's been a student can say it takes a special teacher to touch a person.  They're not all created equal out here, there.
Speaker 1: Well, I would just for people to remember me as a person who tried to make the world a better place.  And in specific ways made a contribution that certainly centered more on race than anything else but it was inclusive of all of humankind.  And if I have done anything to prove that desire then I would like for others who feel so inspired to know something about how I tried and how they may even improve on some of the things, bring in new ideas.  Because as a pastor in North Carolina said in a sermon when I was in the [U.S.] Army and I was feeling very bad about it,  "I am a part of each and each is a part of me and as my brother suffers I too suffer.  As my brother prospers, I too prosper."  Therefore, I have to be my brother's keeper if I'm to survive as a human being.  So if that feeling can be imparted to other people, then I will feel that my job was not in vain and yet I can see in my own lifetime things have changed.  When I measure a certain level, quantitatively, I know there's been a change.  I believe I made a contribution to some of that change.
Speaker 2: Now, how old--I don't think that's--I mean, they--.
Speaker 1: I was in my forties.

Speaker 1: What do you think your parents would say now if they saw you?
Speaker 2: Oh, they'd be proud.  They were proud then.  When I started going to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] my mother [Mattie McConner Black] would call up all those friends that used to bother her and tell them,  "T.D.'s at the University of Chicago.  I thought you might want to know."  (Laughs)  And when my dad [Timuel Dixon Black, Sr.] was about to move on he said, "I don't see why I should live any longer.  You and [brother] Walter are doing okay and Mattie's gone.  What do I have to live for?"  His life had been fulfilled.  My mother was constantly bragging about both my brother and my sister had passed earlier.  She introduced my brother and my aunt was (unclear).  "This is Professor [Timuel Dixon] Black [Jr.].  This is Attorney [Walter] Black," talking about my brother.  Way beyond the rewards for them were not in the material things that we were able to give them but in the spiritual that they had been able to realize through us the hopes and dreams that their parents brought out of slavery.  When I go to Senegal and to Goree [Island] outside of the city there and I look out on that ocean where one day some of my ancestors were brought in chains up to be placed on the ship as cargo; I have to think oh, what it must have been like not knowing where you're going, who was going to be in charge.  What was in their minds?  They were the cream of the crop.  That's what they choose the cream that they could find.  To that extent than, they had to have faith.  The spirituality, not Christianity.  They didn't know anything about no Christianity but a spirituality that comes way beyond any so-called labeled religion, you know, they had to believe that somehow there was a power that was bigger than everything that was going to see them through.  I had responsibilities to carry on their mission to others, white or black that tomorrow is another day because when you lose that sense of tomorrow, it's over.  What frightens me is among too many young people, black and white, the sense of tomorrow is not there.  Fortunate and less fortunate. This shit called television has closed their minds with the garbage that is on most of the time.  Immediate consumption, materialism, so the spiritual aspect does not get in very easily--and yet I sense the loneliness that is there.  The ones more fortunate can hide it much easier but when I have a chance to talk with them I get it.  They would like to know what's missing in their lives.  Just the communication between human beings is so sparse now.  You push a button, you get all the information you need, you think over that computer or whatever it's called.  You can look at the television, all the stuff you need but you can't ask the television the right questions.  You can't respond in the right way and so when my late son [Timuel Kerrigan Black] was a kid, I remember him running around behind the television to see who that was talking and he was disappointed when he couldn't find nobody back there.  But then the system soon makes you believe that what that image said to you is all there is to know.  And therefore you are abound by those decisions that you accept.  So without sounding too morose I'm gratified that I had the opportunity to live in these generations where I could have a mother and father that I could talk with.  That I had a grandmother that I saw and have had the chance since then to go to Dakar Senegal several times and to Ghana, along the west coast of Africa where my memory can--where my imagination can run wild and to have had a chance to grow up in a city like Chicago [Illinois] where I was able to make a little difference.

Speaker 1: Robert Ming who was the first black law professor at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  He's gone now.  Bob Ming was a world-famous person.  The next person is Richard Hatcher who became the mayor of the city of Gary [Indiana], first black mayor, and the tall guy there is my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black].  Now the relationship of the two lawyers with Hatcher is they saved Hatcher.  Hatcher was undergoing a siege brought on in combination with the Lake County [Indiana] chairman of the Democratic [political] Party in cooperation with the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, Richard Daley, and he was undergoing a situation where he was being accused of something, and he couldn't prove that that was wrong, and my brother, because of my relationship with Mr. Hatcher--Hatcher used to come over to my house when I was in Chicago [Illinois] almost every Saturday, and we--because of the kind of guy he is--insisted he should run for mayor and finally was convinced because he was winning as a city councilman on a seat that was citywide.  He wasn't running in a district so he was winning.  We thought he could win as mayor so when he announced and it seemed he had that possibility, they plotted to disgrace him, and my brother [Walter Kerrigan Black] and Mr. Ming came to his defense, and finally a white Polish woman who felt guilty about participating in that thing came to them, those two lawyers, and let the stuff spill out.
