Speaker 1: And we know that you're a chancellor of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], but how do you describe or define your profession--your occupation?
Speaker 2: My day job--my main occupation is college professor. I've been a member of the faculty at MIT since 1975.  And I've been Chancellor since 19--since 2001.
Story_ID: 5134
Speaker 1: We have some 'People' magazine-type questions just to kind of warm up and perhaps add a little human interest and some glimpses of your personality.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Chicken.
Speaker 1: Chicken.
Speaker 2: I've never seen a chicken I didn't like. And the only thing you can ruin a chicken--the only way you can ruin a chicken is overcook it.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I think I'm a summer person.
Speaker 1: And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: And your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I think the only place that is a consistent destination for me is Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. You may discover over the next couple of hours that there's something that pops up more often than not. Or I may say something to tell you I like to say this.
Speaker 1: I'll watch for the repetition.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: If there is any.
Story_ID: 5135
Speaker 1: We'd like to start by learning something about your family. Would you give us your mother's name and tell us a little bit about your mother? And what you remember about her. Is she still living?
Speaker 2: No. My mother passed in 1995. Her name was Mabel [Jenkins Clay]. And worked her life as a laborer. While at one point it was farm labor. At other, in her more recent time, say the last twenty years or so, she died at age seventy. She worked in a restaurant.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in New Hanover County in Wilmington [North Carolina]. I'm not sure exactly what spot. But in the county. Both my parents came from the Wilmington area.
Speaker 1: And did she grow up in the same area pretty much?
Speaker 2: She grew up in the same area. And my mother, my father and I graduated from the same high school [Williston High School, Wilmington, North Carolina]. My mother I think was class of '44 [1944], '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay. We'll come back to that. How would you describe, or how do you remember your mother's personality? What--what was she like as a person?
Speaker 2: She was warm. She tended to attract people around her. She was social. Not overly serious--not overly strict I should say. She was serious. Not overly strict. But a little bit strict. A wonderfully supportive person throughout.
Speaker 1: What are some of the stories that you remember her telling you as you were growing up about her life? About her parents, her experiences perhaps before you were born? The things that stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: She was not a great story teller. And I think the stories in my family more often came from my grandmother [Minnie Jenkins] or my uncles than from my mother.
Story_ID: 5136
Speaker 1: My grandmother was a big part of my life. She lived in the area, and she lived long past my mother [Mabel Jenkins Clay]. She died in about 1998 at age ninety-four.
Speaker 2: This is your mother's mother.
Speaker 1: Yes. My grand--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Her name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Minnie [Jenkins].
Speaker 2: Minnie.  And where was she born?
Speaker 1: She was born in New Hanover County [North Carolina] as well. We're all from the same area.
Speaker 2: How do you remember your grandmother? Can you say a little more about her?
Speaker 1: I think grandmothers have a bit more liberty and a bit more ability to be all of the things that I just described about my mother [Mabel], except in a generous way. She was the mother of the family. So she wasn't just the grandmother. She was a very powerful person in the family. I was the oldest grandchild. And I think--I'm not sure I want this on tape, but I think she treated me sort of special. She probably in many ways was a co-mother for me during this time. She did tell stories. They were not long or detailed stories. But they were stories that gave me a little bit of a sense of how she grew up. She grew up mainly doing farm work. And did that for many years. Into her, you know, mature years as an adult. She, toward the end of her career, or her work life I should say, worked in a seafood processing plant. She was the kind of person who was very honest. Was very strong and very active. She sang in the choir for many years. I recall when I was very small she hosted--I'm trying to think of what they call them--they were sort of mutual aid societies. Women got together and sort of collected fifty cents. And put it aside. And then when somebody needed help, they would dip into the pot. So she would have her society meetings. And played that role in the community. Close along came insurance. And people sort of did a lot less of that. She was a very positive person. I recall her saying--sort of being the teacher of manners and relationships. I remember her saying things like, "The only thing you can kick is a football." And, you know, "Be nice to people. It doesn't cost anything to be nice." So she was very much the soul and spirit of the family.
Speaker 2: What about your mother's father? You--can you tell us anything about him?
Speaker 1: My mother's father I never knew. He was killed in an accident long before I was born.
Story_ID: 5137
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father. What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was William [Clay]. I didn't know him nearly as well. He wasn't very much in our life, and lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] during most of my time. I did get to visit him. Or he visited me two or three times a year. And I did get to meet his parents. My other grandparents and met my aunts. But they really weren't that closely connected to the family.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories that your father shared with you during the times that you had with him?
Speaker 2: I think not. It was mostly observations, suggestions. Maybe they were quite wise. But I guess they weren't repeated often enough for me to remember them very well.
Story_ID: 5138
Speaker 1: Do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'm the oldest. But I have four brothers. All but one of them is still alive. And they all live in Wilmington [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: All live in Wilmington? Would you give us the names of your brothers?
Speaker 2: George, Tim and Allen [Clay]. And they're the ones who are still with us.
Speaker 1: And their occupations? Or their--?
Speaker 2: One is retired. Sort of odd being the oldest and I'm still working and he's retired. But he worked for many years for Corning Glass. And, you know, industry sort of says, "Okay, you can go." And he said, "Okay." (laughs) Tim works in Wilmington and Allen does. Both of them have public jobs as they used to call them. They basically have a variety of tasks. My older brother George was a training instructor for Corning.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What would you boys do--?
Speaker 2: Herbert [Clay] is the fourth brother who passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About five years ago.
Speaker 1: What did you and your four brothers do with each other growing up? How do you remember your relationship with your brothers?
Speaker 2: We just played.
Speaker 1: Played what?
Speaker 2: I guess in the city they call it stickball. We thought we were playing baseball. Football, games, marbles. I never flew a kite. We never flew a kite. Because there was one kid in the neighborhood who did and he mistakenly used wire instead of rope and was electrocuted. So that ruled out kites for the whole neighborhood. A very sad situation. But you know, there are other things. Walks in the woods. That's still something I like to do. And cops and robbers or whatever. The sort of normal games that kids play.
Story_ID: 5139
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of growing up? What is your farthest back--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I like to tell people I remember--
Speaker 1: Farthest back--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Being rocked in a rocking chair. Nobody believes me. But I do think I remember that, and, you know, that was--I don't know how old I was. But that's my earliest memory.
Speaker 1: And what else? What other--some of the other furthest back memories that you have as a youngster?
Speaker 2: I remember sort of walking around to neighbors, you know, and sort of asking questions. People always thought I was inquisitive. And happily no one ever told me to be quiet. Or, "Stop. Why are you asking that?" But I do recall that.
Story_ID: 5140
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood you were born into, and that you were raised in as a youngster? Five, six, seven years old. What was your neighborhood like? Your community?
Speaker 2: In sociology we would call it a line village.  I'm not sure it's a neighborhood. It was Highway 17, about four or five miles outside of Wilmington [North Carolina]. It's now very urban. But then it was not really suburban. And, you know, pretty close to rural. But you had houses along the highway. And every so often there would be a dirt road. And down the dirt road there would be a few houses. And people tended to relate in the distance that could be walked by a reasonably healthy person. So that meant two or three miles. And that was the neighborhood. It was a neighborhood that was probably one third commercial, like stores and you know, shops and other things. About one third white, and about one third black.
Speaker 1: Could you describe the house that you lived in?
Speaker 2: The house I was born in--none of these houses exist any more. The area has--the particular area that I'm talking about has become all commercial, which is good for the people who own property there. But the neighborhood is gone. The first house was--I don't remember it very well, in great detail. 'Cause I was, you know, under six when we left. But I recall it having a kitchen, a dining room, a bathroom and two bedrooms. And that was it. There were several houses next door. And, in fact, there were about five houses that were very close together. And then there was a great wasteland for two or three hundred yards.
Speaker 1: Now you said you left. Why did you leave and where did you go?
Speaker 2: We just moved. And we didn't move far away. We moved in fact, less than a mile a way. And that house had a bit more space and a bit more land. It was obviously newer, but otherwise not especially different.
Story_ID: 5141
Speaker 1: What do you remember about your family life? Holidays, special events with your mother [Mabel Jenkins Clay] and your brothers [George, Tim, Allen and Herbert Clay]? Or what are the fondest memories that you have of your family?
Speaker 2: It was a pretty ordinary situation. Everybody sort of went somewhere during the day. And we all came home between 3:45 [P.M.], and my bus brought me back from school. And the adults got home, you know, about the same time, or a little later. And we'd have supper.  And probably about the time I was seven or eight we had television. We had a seventeen inch Sylvania which could only be played for a couple of hours. Because the tubes would get hot. And then they would blow. And then you would have to wait until you got the money to go buy another tube. Not the big tube, the picture tube. But the little tubes. And we had a few records. Not that many. And three radio stations. One was religious, one was classical, and one was everything else. I seldom listen to radio. But I think in terms of sort of group activity, watching games and watching certain television shows. We didn't do a lot of--we didn't go to any restaurants. Because this was pre-1964 [in Wilmington, North Carolina]. So the only restaurants we could go to were black restaurants. Or we could go to the back door in other restaurants and get take-out. So going to the black restaurant downtown was a treat. It wasn't a big treat, because all you got was a hot dog. If you were well-to-do, you could get a fried pork chop and so forth. But we didn't see wasting money on a pork chop when you could eat it at home and have more, and more time.
Story_ID: 5142
Speaker 1: Going to church was a pretty common event.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was my next question.
Speaker 1: Yes. And during the entire time I was at home, Reverend Miller was minister. And he was a very wonderful man. And took a very strong interest in Sunday School. And I was very active in Sunday School. One of my aunts was the Sunday School teacher. And one of the things that my mother [Mabel Jenkins Clay] and my grandmother [Minnie Jenkins] and my uncles, one of whom was a deacon in the church, encouraged me to do was to participate in what they call holiday programs. And these were events. They were big events in the community. I mean actually there would on those occasions be more people in church for the program, than the sermon. And the point was that children of, as young as four, three or four would go up on stage and say something. And it might be, you know, "Happy Easter." Or it might be, you know, reciting a poem or reading a scripture. And I was always encouraged to participate in that. And through high school actually. You know, to the point that I wasn't reciting a poem that was given to me by the Sunday School teacher. But actually writing something. Or being a bit more creative. And that was strongly encouraged.
Speaker 2: The name of the church for the record.
Speaker 1: Enoch Chapel Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Again?
Speaker 1: Enoch Chapel "E-N-O-C" [sic, Enoch] Chapel.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Missionary Baptist Church [Wilmington, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a church--I'd say half the people--not half. That's an exaggeration. Probably a third of the people would say they're related to each other. And there were some interesting characters in the church. Which sort of gave me a sense of the variety of the people in that sort of neck of the woods as we called it. We had, for example, a couple of were more aristocratic than Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip. And they always had a brand new Studebaker [automobile]. But they were only in church half the year. Actually only less than that. And I never understood why. I thought they were very important people and they were too busy to come to church. But as it turned out, they were the maid and butler to a very rich family some place else. And that--when that family went to their other homes, like the summer home or the winter home, then they would give this couple off. And then they would come back to Wilmington [North Carolina] in their new Studebaker and their fancy suit and gold pocket watch. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you interact with them at all? Or--in any kind of way?
Speaker 1: Yeah. In a sort of way, "Hello. How are you?" and, you know, they would pat you on the head and say, "You did a nice job." Or something. Then we had a gentleman who, we called him 'Uncle Os', for Oscar, who as long as I can remember was ancient. And I was told he lived to be 107. But he would drive a mule and cart. So everybody else would be coming to church in their Chevrolets [automobile], or maybe their trucks. But he would drive up and hitch his mule to the tree next to the church. And he would amble in. And I thought that was nice. And one day I heard some one say, "He's getting married." And I thought it was outrageous that this man who was ancient was getting married. And, of course, he invited the whole church to his wedding. And I was delighted to go. And, you know, like every other groom, he was smiling and grinning. And so was his bride. And, you know, they lived another ten years before she died. And then he died. And then, of course, there were characters in the neighborhood about whom people had stories. One guy had a really large brick house. And people whispered that he used to own a still [illegal distillery]. But I wasn't supposed to ask about that. There were also cases where we would have, where I remember the minister talking in what I considered as a precocious kid, rather strange. From time to time Reverend Miller would preach and say, "I'm gonna try to preach today." And I would say, "What do you mean try to preach? I mean, you know, you've been preaching for fifty years." I mean, but his point was that he had a point to make. And he wasn't sure he could make it. But he was gonna try to make it. And I've always liked that phrase, "I'm gonna try to preach." And, you know, I don't say it to kids. But there've been times when I would say, "I'm gonna try to teach." Or "I'm gonna try to convey or try to envision." Because I know that, you know, there's two sides to communication. There's what you say and then there's what people hear.
Story_ID: 5143
Speaker 1: Is there any other one individual that was influential in your life at that time that you remember very fondly? Anybody who kind of stands out that assisted you in some way?
Speaker 2: Well, I would certainly emphasize my grandmother [Minnie Jenkins] who after her mother-in-law passed, and after my great-grandmother passed, my grandmother because the mother of the church, as I indicated earlier. And that was a fairly significant thing. I mean, you know, people asked her all sorts of things. And she felt empowered to tell people things. And then I'd emphasize my uncle. My--who is still, who is now the patriarch of the family. He's about, I guess, eighty-two, eighty-three. My moth--bro--my mother's oldest brother.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Brother.
Speaker 2: And I think he, I suspect probably is the source of my work ethic. Now I probably didn't appreciate it at the time. Because, you know, when I wanted to play ball, he wanted me to cut the grass or help him do something. But I think the kinds of things that he used to say are the kinds of things that I would--I now act out. I remember one time having plans to do something on Labor Day. And he had a different plan for how I used that day. And I sort of protested. And he said, "Well, if you work on Labor Day, you'll have a job for the rest of the year." Which I thought was silly and not very helpful. But, you know, I work on Labor Day. You know, unless--it's--if I need to work on Labor Day. But I think in, you know--he's the kind of person who, when I look back on it, was an entrepreneur. He sold fish to people out in the country who didn't have a car, in a town when there were no supermarkets. So he would be the guy who would show up on Wednesday on [Interstate] Route 55 [in Wilmington, North Carolina] with fresh fish. And then he had, you know, did other kinds of things. And even now, you know, in a place that's suburban, manages to probably sell, you know, more collard greens than the local supermarket. Just because, you know, he doesn't have anything else to do, but go out and put down the plants. And then about this time of year, sell them. Sometimes he makes people pick their own. And he counts the leaves and says how much they owe him. So these people are all very influential. And for those who are still alive, they still are.
Story_ID: 5144
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: You asked me earlier about places we used to go. We used to go to the beach. Wilmington [North Carolina] is five miles from the beach. But that was a part of the beach that wasn't open to us. So the black population went to the beach--Topsail Beach which is about forty miles north, or Atlantic Beach which was about fifty miles south. In South Carolina. So going to the beach was a big thing. And I always--I still associate summer with salty water, salty air, seafood. So that's one. Sounds I don't remember. Crickets. You know, I don't hear crickets very often in Jamaica Plain [Massachusetts]. But when I do hear them, I think back to that's sort of a normal night sound.
Speaker 1: Any other memories in your early growing up years that we might not have touched upon in our immediate conversation? Anything else that stands out in your mind?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. I just recall, you know, it being a very warm and encouraging place. Nobody in my neighborhood was well-to-do. We thought richness was associated with other people far away. But we did not interpret how we were as being poor. That doesn't fit objective fact. But that's how we felt. And so, you know, if somebody came to visit you, and, you know, brought you an orange and some, you know, peppermint candy as a Christmas present, you were extremely grateful. Well I'm almost sure now kids would be insulted. You know, "That's all you could bring?" But it's a simple place, a simple time, and simple love and goodness.
Story_ID: 5145
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I was in the first group of students to go to the William Harry Blount Elementary School [Wilmington, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: This was 1952.
Speaker 1: 1952. Tell me something about the early years at that school for you. What was it like being there?
Speaker 2: This was a new school. This school across the street had been built--it was a wooden school. It probably had served the community for thirty, forty years. This was a new school named after a black physician in Wilmington [North Carolina] who I guess, was sufficiently revered to get his name on this new elementary school. I don't know exactly how many students there were in this school. But based on looking now at the building, I'd say three or four hundred. And I--it was a modern school. It would even be considered probably good design even today. I had a wonderful first grade teacher who--in fact I remember almost all of my elementary school teachers.
Speaker 1: Tell us about them.
Speaker 2: The first one--the first grade teacher I'm blanking on. I'm sure I will come back to that. The second grade teacher was Miss Williams. The first grade teacher died, Miss Mack--Miss Iris Mack. She died when I was in the third grade. And that was sort of my first sort of non-family tragedy. To come to school one day and be told that your favorite teacher had died. And then I had Miss Alice Williams. She wasn't quite as warm and embracing. But she was very nice. Third grade teacher was Miss Buffet. And then her sister was my fourth grade teacher, Miss Ferguson. And then fifth grade was my all time favorite elementary school teacher, Miss Good. And she was diabetic. And that was sort of the first introduction to diabetes. Because there was a brief time when she was sick. And she would sort of stop class and say, "I think I have to have a little snack now." Which I thought was sort of strange. But I understood it. And have learned. In the sixth grade, this was the beginning of tracking. All of the black students from various elementary schools around the county were transferred to Gregory Middle School. No. Gregory Elementary School for the sixth grade. And then to Williston Junior High School for middle school. And then Williston High School in the high school years. This was an attempt basically to respond to Sputnik [Russia's space program]. This all happened '56 [1956], '57 [1957]. And so students from all around the country were dragged in. And we were 6A. There was A, B, C, or D. We were A. And I think grade six and seven were collided. And we sort of traveled through middle school and high school as a group. I have my fortieth reunion at Thanksgiving. So.
Speaker 1: This coming?
Speaker 2: This coming Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: What are your fondest memories of the early elementary grades one to five--before you actually moved to grade six at the--?
Speaker 2: I remember going to school without any prior sense--I never went to daycare. Such daycare as I had was a lady down the--nearby, maybe a ten minute walk from my house--who had enterprises. She would keep one or two children.  One was me for a period. She would take in laundry. And she would cook cakes, and do various other things and make money. She lived in a very big house. I never knew her husband. But he apparently was an entrepreneur too, and died. And she was left with these two sons and some land. And when I think of sights, I think of going there early in the morning and have her go out and get a couple of eggs from under the chicken and come in and scramble them. I haven't seen--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And you were how old at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh I was five--four or five.
Speaker 1: And what was your mother [Mabel Jenkins Clay] doing during the day?
Speaker 2: Oh they were all working.
Speaker 1: They were working.
Speaker 2: And I was too young to go to school. And there was no daycare or anything like that. So I could still see those bright yellow eggs that, you know, were--never got cold.
Speaker 1: That's a sight. (laughs)
Speaker 2: But school was very encouraging. And when I say that, I say it in the sense that there were expectations about behavior. I recall only one kind of episode of bad behavior that would anywhere correlate with the kinds of things that we now see as a regular thing to be managed in school. There was one naughty kid who assaulted his fourth grade teacher. And by assaulted, I mean he sort of--she tried to pull him into his seat or out of his seat, and he was bigger than she was. And he pulled back or pushed back. And that was quite a scandal.
Story_ID: 5146
Speaker 1: You mentioned the move into grade six. Students coming from other elementaries. And then a move again to seventh and eighth to a different--.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean the seventh--I mean I was moved into the sixth grade of another elementary school. So I had to leave. And then go on to the middle school.
Speaker 1: Well you mentioned--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was right across the street.
Speaker 1: Well you mentioned that this was Sputnik [Russia's space program] time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there a connection around this educational movement? Or you just happened to say that was--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think any connection I would refer to would be my sort of later life reconstruction. I remember though in 1968--1954, when I was eight, when the Brown v. the Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas] was announced. And I didn't know what it was. I just knew what people said. And how they talked about it in quite hushed tones. As in, "This will never happen." Or, "This will bring back the [Ku Klux] Klan," or "This will do other things that were awful."  There was the assumption that it wouldn't affect anything in my life, 'cause white folks in North Carolina weren't about to desegregate school. And during the entire time I was there, there was just one student who in 1957 was transferred to a white middle school. And the reason I know that was he rode our bus. He didn't ride the bus with the white kids. He--the bus would swing by and pick him up. And then swing over to the white school and drop him off. And then take the rest of us on to our school. And I always felt sorry for him. Because, you know, he was by himself. And we were busy with collecting friends. And while he never seem especially frightened or sad, I never saw a smile on his face either.
Speaker 1: Did the Brown decision, in the years following that year, have any affect upon the school in your area?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean was there any implication for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah. When I went to the sixth grade that was the first year of acceleration. I mentioned that sixth grade, six and seven were collided. That is we were given more advanced materials. We had a science kit. Not a science lab. A science kit meaning there's a big box that the custodians brought in to Miss Nixon's school--Sadie Nixon. And, you know, she gave us harder worker or more homework and that sort of thing. It was very clear what was happening. I didn't fully understand in the context of Sputnik.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So you're saying this was, may have been a response to both the Sputnik event and Brown--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, it was Sputnik. It wasn't Brown.
Speaker 1: Oh, it wasn't Brown.
Speaker 2: It wasn't Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I should say that there was a kind of parallel processing on the Brown case. There was no movement toward desegregation in the county [New Hanover County, North Carolina]. Or in the state [of North Carolina] for--certainly the eastern part of the state. So any action was all in the political realm or in the legal realm. But within the black community, there was a kind of parallel processing. There were higher expectations. College was talked about more actively. By the time I got to high school [Williston High School, Wilmington, North Carolina], college recruiters were coming around. I recall when I was a junior a representative came from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. Now I thought that was a pretty big deal. We had students go to the Ivy League on a regular basis. And the biggest news about graduation was how many in the class won scholarships? Which schools the top ten class members would be going to? And how they were choosing between, you know, different schools. I'm not Catholic obviously. But we had a Catholic priest, who was very aggressive about recruiting black students. And, you know, I remember Father Curtin (ph.) coming around and, you know, pulling people out of the class and talking to them. And we would regularly send students to [University of] Notre Dame [Notre Dame, Indiana], Providence College [Providence, Rhode Island] and other places. So there was clearly a higher level of activity and expectation and encouragement within the black community. And the acceleration was quite prominent. We didn't have AP [advanced placement] classes. But we had televised classes. That is there were several subjects that offered standard across--college prep courses in North Carolina. And we all went to the auditorium and then to W-UNC [University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina] and took our history or whatever it was. And had a common exam. And, you know, we were told how we did relative to other students in the state.
Story_ID: 5147
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a pretty good student. I always made honor society and crowning scepter. And I think I was number seven in the class. But the smartest person in our cohort didn't graduate. And whenever my heads starts to swell a little bit, I think back to a woman who I won't call her name, since, you know, the world is now an open book. But I recall back in sixth and seventh grade [at Williston Middle School, Wilmington, North Carolina], she did not come to school on a regular basis. But when she came, she did perfect work. I mean, she would look at a math problem and it would be solved. And, of course, I had to work at it. And I generally got it right. But not without some effort. And she became a caretaker for her many younger siblings and eventually dropped out. Now I don't know whatever happened to her. Because she, you know, had a year or so of very intermittent attendance, and then dropped off the radar. And whenever I'm feeling too smart for--I think about her and I know she was a lot smarter than I was.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject? What did you enjoy the most in terms of your studies?
Speaker 2: History and social science. When I went to the university [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], you know, I went to the political science department and said, "I know Poly Sci 41," you know, "Give me the final exam and give me credit." And they looked at me sort of strange. And said, "Okay. We'll do that." And they put me in this room and I got a B on the exam. And they looked at me funny again. And said, "Okay." And that was it. I ate the stuff up. I watched 'Face the'--not 'Face the Nation.' 'Meet the Press' [television programs] from the early days of Lawrence Spivak.
Speaker 1: What--?
Speaker 2: Pre-[President John F.] Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Pre-Kennedy.
Speaker 2: What other experiences, besides the academic experience in high school [at Williston High School, Wilmington, North Carolina], what other high school experiences do you remember and meant a lot to you? And perhaps influenced you in some way?
Speaker 1: I was always a very shy person. Even--that impression might not have been gotten from other things I've said. But I think the point is that people--my mother [Mabel Jenkins Clay], and grandmother [Minnie Jenkins], and uncles, and relatives, and church people, and later teachers, all sort of worked to change that. And I remember being pushed. You know, we had electives in high school. And I was told by one of my homeroom teachers, "Your elective will be drama and public speaking." Now she didn't ask me if I wanted drama and public speaking. But that's what I got. As opposed to art and typing for example. Which, the typing might have been beneficial. And art, no hope. So I participated in drama. I did a play. I don't remember what the play was. But I was the leading man in it. And did pretty good in drama. I ran for President of the Student Council. I remember one teacher saying to me--the woman who would be my English teacher through most of high school, and homeroom teacher--sort of said to me when she suggested something that I ought to do. And I thought, "Oh no, I don't think so." She said, "Well you can't live under a basket. Nobody will ever see you if you're under a basket." I remember that, as though it was said yesterday. And so they engineered me from under the basket. I did conclude--I don't know whether I was being preemptive--that I should run for student council president. And I sort of jumped in it with both feet. You know, organizing the campaign and have homeroom representatives and making signs and won by 93 percent--93 percent of the vote.
Speaker 2: Did you have any--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Against a woman who I'm going to see at the class reunion. So, see if she is still shocked. (laughs)
Story_ID: 5148
Speaker 1: Did you have any kind of definite ideas, as you went through high school, about where you were going to be and what you were gonna do after high school? Did you have anything while you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Beyond those desires to be a fireman or that sort of thing, which never were very prominent with me--I remember in high school [at Williston High School, Wilmington, North Carolina] wanting to go into international relations. In fact, I suspect if we could find my high school yearbook, that is probably what it would say. And I sort of stuck with that until near high school graduation. When we had in the library a comedy album by Dick Gregory. And I've since seen Dick Gregory, and thanked him for this. But the--one of the jokes"= on the album was, "The United States is a strange country. They will go five thousand miles to Moscow and tell them how to run the Soviet Union. But they won't go around the corner and solve the problems there, and they own it." And I think that was the beginning of the shift. When I went to college I think I might have, might have had a brief interest in law. And then political science, and subsequently urban studies and city planning.
Story_ID: 5149
Speaker 1: How did you happen to go to the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill [Chapel Hill, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: That's a good question. Because starting in about the tenth grade, every college that I ever heard of or I would hear mentioned, I would write off for a catalogue. So I think probably by the time I was a senior, I had, you know, twenty catalogues that I looked through. I never visited any of the colleges. Two things struck me about--I only applied to two colleges. I applied to Howard, [University, Washington, D.C.] and I applied to UNC [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina]. I decided on UNC because this was--I was--my senior year in high school [at Williston High School, Wilmington, North Carolina] was the fall of 1963. The Civil Rights Movement had started in Greensboro [North Carolina] and had spread to a number of places, including Chapel Hill. And I have two memories of Chapel Hill at that time. One was the news about the civil rights activity in Chapel Hill. And about the political reference to it as a kind of a strange place that was sort of un-American, and Communist-run the place and that sort of things. I said, "That sounds like my sort of place." The other was, they had and still have a set of well-endowed scholarships. They're called the [John Motley] Morehead Scholarships. Forgetting his whole name. But whatever his name, Morehead, endowed the scholarships, endowed fellowships, endowed professorships, and built the Morehead Planetarium and was sort of the grand benefactor. One of the many grand benefactors of the University. And selecting the Morehead fellows was a big deal. There would be seventy or eighty young men. And they would sort of have a kind of special time on the television. The announcement of the Morehead Fellows--Morehead scholars. Just as we now do the, you know, the [John D. and Catherine T.] MacArthur [Foundation] genius awards. And I remember sitting at home one November evening--or one winter evening. I don't know whether it was November or not. But, you know, in the cold part of the year, watching this very old man who couldn't stand. So he would sit. He had on a three piece suit. And a pocket watch. He was big and baldheaded. And he sort of introduced each of the Morehead Scholars, and said, "These are the Morehead Scholars of 1963. They are all white, they're all bright and they're all mine." I said, "Well this is a contrast. But I wanna go there." So I applied and I went and was very happy.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now what?
Speaker 2: I did have an older brother of a close friend of mine, of a classmate of mine, who had gone to Chapel Hill before me. So I wasn't totally ignorant of the place. 'Cause he, you know, would bring back news of it. And he liked it. So I thought that if I could get in, I would go.
Story_ID: 5150
Speaker 1: How many African American, black students were there when you entered as a freshman, sophomore year.
Speaker 2: Our class had twelve black students. The class size was 2400. We were the first class with any number. In previous years the number had been one or two. And there'd be one or two in the professional school, so Julius Chambers, who was a very famous lawyer, was the first in the law school. There was another woman who was first in the school of journalism. There was another guy who was in medical school. But other than that, one or two. And there was the class of '68 [1968]. And we were twelve.
Speaker 1: Tell me about going to the University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill, North Carolina]. What was it like being a black student those four years? And particularly you were right at the--at the height and the energy of the Civil Rights Movement. Tell us--tell me what it was like being there.
Speaker 2: Well the first thing I had to deal with was money. The university in current terms was dirt cheap. But there was nevertheless money, and their student budget was I think $1200 a year. And I didn't have $1200. My family didn't have $1200. So the question was, how would I pay for it? And as it turned out it was one third, one third, one third. One third I borrowed. One third I'd work for. And the other one third needed to be scholarship. I asked the University for a scholarship and they declined. And somehow I learned about this service, the National Scholarship and Service Fund for Negro Students [later National Scholarship Service]. It was an organization in New York that still exists. And their strategy--their goal at the time was to make it possible for black students in the South to go to Southern universities. And their requirement was that you apply for aid, and if you don't get it, they will close the gap. So that's--that was my scholarship. I went to university. I earned my money, my third, as a waiter and as a bag boy in a grocery store. That was sort of the year before going to college, the summer before going to college. So when I went to college, I sort of had in the bank what I needed. And I was able to be a student. At the end of the year--not the end of the year. But in like February or March, when you apply for financial aid, I went and said, "I think I'll apply for a scholarship." I had gone to the university--I had done well at the University and made the Dean's list. So I said, "There's no reason why they shouldn't give me a scholarship." So I recall going to the meeting with the financial aid director. And he looked over my grades and said, "Well I guess you meet our requirements." So then I got a scholarship which meant that I had to work less. Because I didn't really have a way to easily close the gap without working a lot. So the University gave me a scholarship at that point. And so I was in good shape. Actually it was a very exciting time. In fact, I look at many college students today and say, "You have a boring experience." It was exciting in ways that I can't even imagine. The social life was fine. But that wasn't my main reason for being there. And, as far as women are concerned, we basically had to leave town. You know, there were--it was all men in the freshman class--in the undergraduate college, except for nurses. And there was one black woman who was a first year nursing student. So the Civil Rights Movement continued. And that represented an activity. I was very active with the campus NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Story_ID: 5151
Speaker 1: I became active in sort of campus debating political activities. We had a group which I couldn't join until I was a junior [at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina]. Because it's limited to thirty. And, you know, they interview you and, you know, look at you in all dimensions to see whether you can join. But it was called the Carolina Political Union. And basically what they would do is, whoever came to campus of note--the backroom deal was that after they speak to the masses, they'd then have a private session with the Carolina Political Union. So the year after I became a member, I remember--and this was about '66 [1966], '67 [1967]. We had some pretty major figures in history. I remember John Welch of the John Birch Society. And, of course, I didn't agree with anything he had to say. But it was my view about that and about other things that I really want to go and hear what he's saying. And then ask some questions, so that I could understand the perspective. So I did this with the John--with the Welch, with Al Capp, the cartoon guy, John--Mike Mansfield, who was majority leader of the [U.S.] Senate, came.  [Edward] Ted Kennedy came. Ted Kennedy I think had a long day. He was sort of sleepy by the time we got to him at 10:00 [P.M.]. But Mike Mansfield was telling. Because this was 1967. The war arguments were well-known. And we sat at a big round table. Leather chairs, thirty leather chairs at a huge round table. And he came in and gave some perfunctory remarks. And then we lit into him. You know.  He'd say, "Domino."  We went through--not me. But all of us went through five minutes about how the "Domino effect" made no sense. Then he would talk about strategic interests, and commitments and deterrents. And all of those things we said, "Those things don't make any sense."  Then he got down to--and we could see that he was getting tense and defensive. But he's a very statesman like, very cool man. And he said in the end, "All I can say is, Lyndon Johnson is the President." And I said I--we said, "Well, that we understand." But there were others. The summer of '67 [1967] I went to the National Student Association meeting. This--I don't know if they still have such a group. But student activists and student government people from all over the country met at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland]. It was the summer before the '68 [1968] election. And a good friend of mine had a good friend who had been a graduate of the University. Al Lowenstein, who was running for--who was planning to run for [U.S.] Congress from Long Island [New York]. But in the meantime he was part of the "Dump [President Lyndon B.] Johnson" group. So he was at the meeting after we had, you know, regular stuff all day. He would start the other convention at 11:00 at night. And for a week he convinced us that we could dump Lyndon Johnson. And he talked about it and talked about it. And I must say honestly, I was skeptical. I said, "You mean we ragtag group of students are gonna dump the President of the United States?"
Story_ID: 5152
Speaker 1: Professor Clay, would you continue telling us about this dump [President Lyndon B.] Johnson movement?
Speaker 2: Well there were a variety of activities that this rump group planned over the next several months designed to protest the war to get Johnson to step aside to generate another candidate. And all of those things happened. There were protests. There were very big protests. A big one in November of that year as I recall. [Eugene] Gene McCarthy emerged, Robert Kennedy emerged much later. And on September--I mean March--the end of March in 1998 [sic, 1968].  [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson indicated that he would not run, and that opened up a very ugly period. That was March 30 [1968], or something like that. Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated I believe the Thursday before Easter April 4 [1968], or something like that. And then--so it was a very painful spring. It seemed like a period of great hope. That we had gotten rid of the President. The opportunity to select somebody new. Great sadness. Martin Luther King was assassinated. Then Robert Kennedy. I recall feeling that I didn't think McCarthy had a chance. But I thought Kennedy would be a shoo-in. and so his assassination was sort of politically painful. And I recall that I graduated [from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina]--I don't remember the exact date. Probably the last week in May [1968]. So I was at home in Wilmington [North Carolina] when Robert Kennedy was assassinated. So I think I woke up in the middle of the night, having gone to sleep with the radio on, listening to a ballgame. And then hearing the news and sort of feeling that, the beginning of that sadness.
Speaker 1: What did that assassination and King's assassination mean to you personally at that time? I mean did it--was it a turning point in your life in any particular way? Or--?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was a turning point. But it was a period of great disappointment. Because both of these were giants. I had personally met Dr. King when one summer I was working in western North Carolina and decided to hitchhike to Atlanta [Georgia] to visit Dr. King's church [Ebenezer Baptist Church]. You never know when he's gonna be there. But luckily the Sunday I was there he was being a regular pastor with a regular church full of people. And a regular, you know, reception and then dinner after the church service. So I got to meet him. Of course, I had followed his career over many years. And I thought he was a model for lots of things. And, of course, with Robert Kennedy, I thought, you know, he would be the shoo-in. He could beat whoever the Republicans would put forward--Richard Nixon. And I didn't have that degree of confidence in Gene McCarthy. I thought he was a bit quixotic. And politics had turned quite funny. You will remember that Robert Kennedy, you know, people said, I'm either for [George] Wallace or [Robert] Kennedy."
Story_ID: 5153
Speaker 1: Were you at the March on Washington [D.C., 1963]?
Speaker 2: I was not at the March on Washington. That happened in the last month--leading up to when I went off to college [at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina]. And I think in what I'm sure was experienced in many places, I was not given the time off to go to Washington. So if I had gone, I would have not gotten those last few dollars I needed to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you play any specific roles in college within the Civil Rights Movement? Either on Chapel Hill campus or with other groups of students at other college campuses? Were you involved in any specific activities?
Speaker 2: Before I answer that, let me go back to high school [Williston High School, Wilmington, North Carolina]. 'Cause I think the Civil Rights Movement was quite active while I was in high school as well.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Sure.
Speaker 2: And the two things--the thing that I remember most clearly, is that by the time I got to be senior and was president of the student body, it was clear that it was not gonna be desegregation in my county. And I was determined that we had to do something. So I went to the principal, and suggested to the principal, "You know, we ought to figure out a way to have a joint activity with the local white high school." And the suggestion I had was that we would exchange student programs. That we would send a group to do something--singing group, 'cause, you know, singing was a pretty Southern thing. Said, "We would send a group to their high school and assembly and do a program. And I would go over and say a few words. And then they would do the same thing."  Now our principal was a stately man, a very conservative man who not only didn't rock the boat, he sort of put a, you know, wedge in to make sure the boat wasn't too much affected by the wind. But he looked at me a little strangely and a little sympathetically. And came back in a few days and said, "We can do this." And, you know, everybody came out and, you know, hailed this as great progress or something. But that was the end of it for the time being. Desegregation wouldn't come until I was half way through college.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) But did it happen?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. It happened.
Speaker 1: Well were you part of the group that went to the white school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the group?
Speaker 2: Oh it was a singing group. We had excellent choral groups.
Speaker 1: And a group from the white high school, what was their performance? Music too?
Speaker 2: It was music as well. And sort of each other's assembly. Assemblies were pretty common. I think they were regular. I can't say they were every week or every month. But they were regular. And sometimes they would be seasonal. Sometimes they would be inspirational. And sometimes they would be plays or other things. So we did do that.
Story_ID: 5154
Speaker 1: On the [University of North Carolina] campus in Chapel Hill [North Carolina] I was involved in a number of activities. I think the one I'm most proud of is that I started a group called Carolina Talent Search. The University still did not do outreach to recruit black students. My class had twelve. The next class probably had fifteen to twenty, and so forth. And these numbers were growing too small. We could all still sit around the table. So I started a group--well it wasn't just me. There were others. We went to the Chancellor. And we, you know, complained about the usual things. And the Chancellor--the Dean, who was more of a Neanderthal than the Chancellor. I don't mind saying that, 'cause they really were Neanderthals. I recall one time we were protesting something. And the Dean looked at me and said, "You know, the world is complicated. I'm a Baptist and I went to a Methodist school. And the Baptist--the Methodists didn't treat the Baptists very well." Of course, we looked at each other and said, "We aren't talking about Baptists and Methodists." But what it became clear was, they were going to do recruitment. They said as much. In fact, I remember a debate after my freshman year. When we discovered that the housing office put an "N" on the card of all black students. When we discovered that except for one--me, we all lived on the third floor of a particular dorm. And we went to see the Chancellor again, and complained about that. And somebody tipped us off that the "N" was there. So we then, in a fit of not-too-good thinking, suggested that they remove references to race on the application. Now any of us could have figured out who the black students were. Just look at which high schools they came from. And I even had the list. Because we were beginning this recruitment thing. And, of course, they did that. And then they said, "Well we don't know how many black students are here. We don't count them." We reversed that. We went back a few months later when we discovered that this didn't make sense. So I've been color blind and it's not very--it's not very good. So we went back. And there were a number of people on campus who were sympathetic. And so with a couple of phone calls, and a couple of visits, we were able to generate quite a bit of cash and rent-a-car commitments. And people loaned us cars and put together a group of black and white students and we went around recruiting students. I mean we were a sort of admissions operation. There were about a dozen of us. I even came to Massachusetts, because, you know, we had a couple of leads that there were, you know, lots of black students in New England colleges. So I came up in November of '67 [1967]. Went to New Hampshire, and out into Connecticut and western Massachusetts and the Boston area recruiting for the UNC [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill].
Speaker 2: Anything else that you want to say--.
Speaker 1: We also had some other activities.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was involved as I indicated in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and student government. I was one of the--in one of the organizations that filed a lawsuit against the governor for a speaker ban. There was a Marxist historian who was invited to speak. The legislature heard about it--passed a law saying, "Marxists, Communists and sympathizers can't speak on university campuses." Well, we didn't think that was consistent with the First Amendment [of the U.S. Constitution]. So we filed suit and eventually won. So I mean you had--you know, you had to pick your activities. 'Cause there were lots of things to do. And then I went to class. I was an honor student in sociology.
Story_ID: 5155
Speaker 1: Any professors that stand out in your mind who were particularly influential or meaningful to you during that time? Or--?
Speaker 2: Well, my advisor was Dr. Cramer, Richard Cramer, who was sort of assigned to me as an advisor when I was in--became a major in Sociology [at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina]. But he was also the honors advisor. And at least at the time the way you got into honors was to have the requisite grades, and then be tapped on the shoulder. And tapped on the shoulder meant that you would then participate in a summer research project, have an honors seminar, and write a thesis. And so that was sort of my introduction to research, to being a part of a research team and the like. Our class was Thursday night at his house. He made wonderful spaghetti. And we hardly ever talked about sociology. We talked about lots of other things. It was just a nice event.
Story_ID: 5156
Speaker 1: As you moved through your senior year at the University [of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] and you come to graduation, what were your plans at that point and time?
Speaker 2: Some time in the fall and I'm sure some months before then, I was trying to figure out what I would do. Keep in mind that the [military] draft was running strong. And I had a deferment that would run out the week after I graduated [May, 1968]. I wanted to go to graduate school. And I wanted to go in a field that was flexible and open. I had come to understand that since--if I graduated from law school I couldn't be guaranteed a job on the Supreme Court. I sort of lost interest in being a lawyer. I say that only half-facetiously. I really did look at the curriculum and say, "I don't really wanna study torts and civil procedure and the like." And then I settled on city planning. It's a combination of the advisors I had in, you know, what seemed like a profession that was on the ascendancy, that was public service-oriented. Not overly traditional or narrow. And I asked people, "Well where should I go to graduate school?"  And MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was on the list. Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was on the list. Berkeley [University of California at Berkeley] was on the list and of course, UNC [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]. These were the top four along with Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York]. Those were the best schools. I ruled out UNC, because having grown up on the edge of a small city in the South, I didn't think that was very good--very good setting to study city planning. I didn't wanna go to the West coast. No particular reason. But it just didn't appeal to me. And so when I came to visit for recruiting, in the fall, November of '67 [1967], I visited MIT and I visited Harvard. And the contrast between the two was quite sharp. I spent roughly a half day at each. At MIT they basically said, "Come on in." I had an interview with [Bernard] Bernie Friedan who would be my advisor and mentor through student days and into my academic career. He answered my questions and asked me questions. And it was a thoughtful conversation. He walked me down the hall and introduced me to people. Seemed like a nice place. Harvard was stuffy. I seem--I felt like I was imposing. I never really had an interview. I talked to somebody, but I never felt that they were checking me out, and I couldn't check them out. And the place didn't seem as lively. Nearly as lively. The students didn't seem to be happily and busily about their work. And so when I got the letters of admission from both, it was not hard for me to choose MIT. I came to MIT in the fall of '68 [1968]. And little did I know that about half a dozen students transferred from Harvard to MIT, from their city planning program. So it wasn't--I understood that, for whatever reason, Harvard did not--was no longer excellent in this. In fact, was sufficiently unexcellent that people were leaving to come here. So I was happy with that decision. Some people advised me, "Go to Harvard. How can you turn down Harvard?" I did and I'm glad.
Story_ID: 5157
Speaker 1: I told you that, you know, your deferment runs out a week after you graduate from college. So, sure enough, on about the second week in June [1968], I received an order to report to the bus station to be drafted. And, needless to say, I didn't wanna go. So I began a sixteen month effort to dodge the [military] draft. I had no objective basis for not being 1A or whatever the rank was--rating was. But there were a long list of things that I could apply for, that I could claim, that I could offer. And I proceeded to go through the list. So during my first year in graduate school, I carried around this folder to keep track of the dates. They said, you know, "Reply by the 14th of December [1968]." On the 13th of December I put the application in the mail to apply for something else. They were all rejected. The only thing that they found was a slight deformity in a lower vertebrae. And the doctor said, "That may be--I'll put on here that you shouldn't lift heavy loads." In fact, that was a problem. And I've since discovered that it's something that I have to worry about. But I was offered a lot of things along the way. I had people offer to cut off my trigger finger. I was offered a trip to Canada, and I would need to move to Canada. Offered marriage complete with children. Somebody asked me if I were, you know, religious. You know, could I claim to have been called by God to preach?" I rejected all of those. Even though there were times, I must confess, I was tempted. And I didn't wanna complain--claim any moral defects. That, you know, some of which if you claim them, they really wouldn't take you. So I got drafted the end of my first year in graduate school. And people were wonderfully generous along the way, including MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. They, you know, offered me a teaching job. And it really wasn't a teaching job. But it looked like a teaching job. And that provided another appeal that got me an extra month--the draft people. And so I went, and served fifteen months in Vietnam and came back. And when I came back, I came back as a Ph.D. student. Having started as a master's student, I sort of had time to think and made a decision to go for a research teaching career.
Speaker 2: Say a little bit about your Vietnam experience, fifteen months. How did that leave you when you came back. How did you feel?
Speaker 1: A very good friend of mine who was a year ahead of me at [the University of North Carolina] Chapel Hill [Chapel Hill, North Carolina] went ahead of me. And when--he went--took ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps]. So he went in as a second lieutenant. And when he came back, he was still in the Army. But he came back for holiday or furlough or whatever it was. And his advice to me--I mean he--this was a kind of happy go lucky guy who, you know, you wouldn't think had a serious bone in his body. But I recall meeting with him around the Christmas holidays. And he looked me in the eye and said, "Do not go to OCS [Officer Candidates School]. Do not become an officer. There's nothing more at risk of being shot than a tall lieutenant who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground." And that was the end of any--so I just drifted along. I was a Corporal and PFC [Private First Class] and handed out t-shirts for fifteen months in Vietnam.
Speaker 2: You're back--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Again, people were very nice to me. They sent me books to read. I had a 'Time' magazine subscription. My grandmother [Minnie Jenkins] sent me a cake. So I managed.
Story_ID: 5158
Speaker 1: Back here working on the Ph.D. Tell me out that experience. And how that worked for you?
Speaker 2: I think--and I've obviously been here for a long time. So I sort of know how the system works. And it worked wonderfully well and generously for me from day one. People offered criticism, and I happily was open to it. I was offered opportunities and given some advice on which ones to take and which ones to pass. I think I was given progressively more challenging tasks to do as a research assistant, and teaching assistant. And the little thing that in those days graduate students needed, like computer time, and travel money, and money to buy books, or pay for typing and that sort of thing, they were always there.
Speaker 1: What was your research agenda as a Ph.D. student? What issues or topics were you exploring?
Speaker 2: I did my dissertation on black suburbanization. Housing and urban development were my specializations. And a focus of my doctoral work was the process of black suburbanization. So I looked at the process in the Washington [D.C.] area and northern New Jersey.
Speaker 1: You didn't face any problems or obstacles through your Ph.D. experience? Or anything that--?
Speaker 2: I don't recall a specific obstacle as a student. I had married [Cassandra Clay] by that time. So I wasn't living on campus and you know, we lived in Cambridge [Massachusetts]. And, you know, it was a very nice place to live.
Story_ID: 5159
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you when you met your wife [Cassandra Clay]? How you met your wife? And when you got married? Tell us about--
Speaker 2: I met my wife in high school [at Williston High School, Wilmington, North Carolina]. She went to a different high school in another city. But we were both active in student government. So we met at a convention. And I think we actually, we both were candidates and losers in that particular year that we were there. We met again when we were in interns in state government in North Carolina. I was an intern with the Board of Higher Education, and she was an intern with the State Bureau of Corrections. The--there were about thirty or so interns, half men, half women. The men lived in a fraternity house. The women lived in a dormitory. And because we had the house, the house was sort of the center of activity. And that was the beginning of our social life.
Speaker 1: Then did she--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The was--that was the summer of '68 [1968]. We got, we married in June of '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Okay. And you have a family? You have--.
Speaker 2: I have a daughter.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Elizabeth. And she's twenty-four.
Speaker 1: And her college experience?
Speaker 2: She went to Columbia [University, New York, New York]. And is now working for a firm and living in New York. No. Living in Washington [D.C.]. She wants to live in New York. (laughs)

Speaker 1: You have your Ph.D., MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] 1975.  Then what happened?
Speaker 2: I did--along the way while I was working on the dissertation, I was offered several job opportunities. Usually research and consulting, or agency jobs--non-profit agency jobs. And I turned them all down. I was advised that you should get your Ph.D. "Get it complete, and you'll have the rest of your life to do these other things, which could be distractions."  And around me, I could see students who had gone away and came back. And you don't get the same attention from the faculty if you're at some distance, than if you're down the hall, or in front of their face. So I took the advice. So I turned down the jobs and I was a student throughout my Ph.D. program. I had an RA [research assistant] and teaching instructor positions along the way. But on campus, down the hall the whole time. When it was clear I was going to get the Ph.D., I did interview at a couple of other schools. And it was sort of suggested to me that I could stay at MIT. And I agreed to do that. So at some point in January or February, 1975, I went down, paid my twenty dollars to get the degree, and went over to HR [Human Resources] and signed up for health plan and--to be an assistant professor.
Story_ID: 5161
Speaker 1: Who were the professors in Urban Studies and Planning [at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that were most supportive of you, and nurtured you along? Who stands out in your mind as being particularly helpful?
Speaker 2: I think there were four over the period. [Bernard] Bernie Friedan I've mentioned. He was my advisor through graduate school. He chaired my committee. And was head of the group. He was Director of the [Harvard-MIT] Joint Center for Urban Studies. And I later became Assistant Director. Langley Keyes who was the senior--other senior member in my general area of teaching. He and Bernie--Langley is still on the faculty. Bernie has retired. Lloyd Rodwin who was head of the department at the time. He was a wonderfully generous man. He listened. And he didn't always, you know, operate in--by democratic means. But he was listening. And he typically took care of everybody in his own way. But he was especially generous in hospitality. Because this was a time both when he was department head and later when he was sort of the senior statesman in the department. He and his wife would host students with their guests. He was very famous in international development. And so a combination of his international interests and the general urban and domestic interests in the department. There were always interesting visitors to the department. And I would say on, I'd say five or six times a year, I would go to his house, where he and his wife would generously entertain just the right number of people. The house would be full. But not so full that you were sort of outside. And he [Langley Keyes] provided strong support for me as a student and then as a fac--as a young faculty member. And then later Don Schon, who was department head when I was associate department head, and sort of--I think I took one course with him. But he was a wonderful teacher about organizations and organizational behavior and the individual facing an organization, practicing in an organization.
Story_ID: 5162
Speaker 1: What courses did you teach initially when you became an assistant professor? What were your course responsibilities?
Speaker 2: I taught some undergraduate courses in urban planning. That was--the year I came on was about the first year we offered undergraduate courses and undergraduate major. And then I taught housing courses to graduate students. I was director of an internship program. And I would sort of teach core courses in planning. Research courses as well as practice courses.
Story_ID: 5163
Speaker 1: From roughly 1980 to 1984, you were Assistant Director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies, Harvard-MIT.  What was your role as the Assistant Director?
Speaker 2: I started out at the Joint Center when I was a graduate student as a research assistant.  Every year there would be a set of projects. And each project would have some number of graduate students.  I moved from there to winning a Joint Center fellowship.  There are roughly four or five awarded each year to students at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and students at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in appropriate fields.  And that work as an RA [research assistant] was a job.  Though the fellowship was a different kind of affiliation.  Because among the products of the Joint Center was a venue for discussion of major urban and development issues.  And there would be a twice monthly luncheon at which all of the people in the Boston [Massachusetts] area would come.  There would usually be somebody from out of town who would be the main speaker.  And there would be lot of what we now call networking.  Also as a Fellow, you got an office.  And so you were part of the woodwork.  And that's still one of the nicest office settings I've had.  Even though it was a large closet.  But I had my own phone and we had a secretary.  And we had a little bit of money.  And we thought sure we were scholars.  Every one there was a Ph.D. student.  When I finished the fellowship and joined the faculty, about five years later, the Director [Bernard Friedan] who was my advisor asked me if I would come to the Joint Center as Assistant Director.  There were two.  One from Harvard and one from MIT.  There was an effort of symmetry then.  The director would be from one institution.  The chair of the board would be from another institution. My specific roles had to do mainly with the projects that I worked on in housing.  But I also had some responsibility from some of the community functions.  The lunches, meeting with visitors who came.  And assisting the director in some of the sort of administrative functions.  When I think back on it, it wasn't a heavy-lifting kind of arrangement.  Because we were all expected to be working on projects and I was half-time faculty.  So I had my regular classes at MIT to teach, and students to advise.  But it was a nice networking opportunity.  The Joint Center was to be twenty-five years old in 1985.  And by all appearances the marriage between Harvard was happy until 1984.  And then came the divorce.  And what survived as the Joint Center has nothing to do with MIT and nothing to do with urban studies generally.  It's a entirely Harvard thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They got the house.
Story_ID: 5164
Speaker 1: Tell me about your progression from faculty appointment 1975 to the appointment as the Chancellor of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in June of 2001?  And give us some dates as benchmarks.  How did that happen? What's the progression?
Speaker 2: The dates are a bit fuzzy.  But roughly I was an assistant professor for the normal period of time.  And except for directing the internship, it was purely research and teaching.  I probably had more than my share of committee assignments. Or something that we hopefully would not force on junior faculty today.  But at the time it didn't seem unusual.  I had the opportunity to meet with a few of my colleagues outside of my department.  Not very many.  And for a good part of that, I was at the [Harvard-MIT] Joint Center [for Urban Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts] half the time.  So there're still people at MIT who look at the dates and say, "Gee, I was there when you were there.  But I never saw you."  And that was the reason.  In about 1982, or '84 [1984], somewhere in that period, I was--went up for tenure.  I guess we could say six years after 19--well the dates are fuzzy.  But I went up for tenure after taking a one-year leave of absence.  During which I worked at the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation [Washington, D.C.]. That emerged out of a book that I wrote ['Neighborhood Renewal: Middle-Class Resettlement and Incumbent Upgrading in American Neighborhoods'].  That was the first exploration into the process of gentrification.  And the book was on contrasting gentrification with a upgrading of neighborhoods by the people who lived in them.  They were working class and low-income population.  I contrasted the two processes.  So the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation was a national organization that still exists, that tries to promote the upgrading part of this revitalization.  And I worked with them in developing an evaluation process.  That was my leave in Washington [D.C.] in 1979, '80 [1980].  And our daughter [Elizabeth Clay] was born towards the end of that period, while we were in Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went up for tenure six years after being an Assistant Professor.  Seven years given I was on leave for a year.  And I was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure.  And let's see.  It was probably then that I started to have more responsibility.  I was Chair of--I eventually became head of the degree program--the master's program [in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT].  And then--and the committee.  And probably had a couple of other assignments that I'd have to look at my resume to sort out.  And in 1989, I was approached about becoming Associate Department Head in a process that would lead to my becoming Department Head.  Now nobody said that.  But the way things work around here is that in nearly all cases, the future head of the department is somebody sitting around the table.  And it's not exactly a matter of taking a turn.  But that had been communicated to me quietly.  So I became associate department head in 1990.  Don [Donald Allen] Schon became department head.  He indicated to me that he would serve two years and then would retire.  And he did. And when he retired, I became department head.  It was a period where we had just worked out a strategic plan for the department.  That was part of what we did during the time when he was department head and I was associate department head.  And I took it quite seriously since I would be the one to start the implementation of it. And in the period when I was department head, we hired a number of faculty and I think reinforced the strength of the department.  Since the mid '60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s], MIT occupied the number one spot as--in City Planning Departments around the country.  The people at [University of California at] Berkeley probably took a bit of exception to that.  But they're the only ones able to.  And I think our leadership continues to this day.  I don't think we ever lost it.  And I think what I did was be a part of that period where we tried to figure out what is it we do now that would seal the leadership, and sort of prepare us for the next generation of activity. Some of the things that I was able to do and some I was not able to do.  Because I only served in the job two years, when I was asked to be Associate Provost.  And that was 1994.  And I served as Associate Provost until 2001, when I was asked to be the Chancellor.
Speaker 1: As Associate Provost, what were your roles and responsibilities?
Speaker 2: I think the simplest way to put it is that you assist the Provost.  I had some special responsibility for what were emerging as a number of international initiatives that MIT was taking, and for generally or collaborative and sort of community activities.  And when I say community activities, I don't mean necessarily what we do in Boston [Massachusetts] or Cambridge.  But what we do essentially to make this operate as a university.  These activities mainly had to do with faculty committees that address one problem or another.  And I worked on a variety of things from MIT's approach to daycare to our international activities to reviewing certain procedures, and just working on general things that, I think, over the years have made MIT a great place.
Speaker 1: You become Chancellor.  How did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well I've never backed down from a challenge.  So there was never a issue--well I never campaigned for any of these jobs either.  So--and I think that there's a little bit of a sense that if you campaign for a job around here, you won't get it.  Because in most of these positions, as department head especially, you act with considerable flexibility and in some cases power.  And people are happy about that.  But they don't want you to get overly excited about it.  The assumption is that you will hold the position for X years and then you'll go back to being a faculty member. So that encourages collegiality.  And that's certainly been my experience.  So when the opportunity to be Chancellor came along, I was, of course, delighted and honored. And have been pleased to serve in that position now for a little over three years.
Story_ID: 5165
Speaker 1: One of the statements that [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] President [Charles M.] Vest made when he appointed you Chancellor, he said you were an outstanding consensus builder.  Can you give me some examples of consensus that you were able to generate here?  Some crises situations that you were confronted with and you--?
Speaker 2: Probably the best example of that are things I can't talk about.  Because I would sort of have to figure out--I'd have to figure out how to tell you who was on which side.  And that's not the main point.  And, of course, it's also true that someone could say, "He likes to avoid conflict."  Rather than people fight it out, he sort of moves in and tries to, you know, bring something positive out of the conflict.  I sort of like that. I think, you know, if you were to go back to my days on the sand lot playing baseball, I would be the kid who would be asked to, you know, hold the eyeglasses, while the other two guys fought it out.  I never saw a reason to start a fight, except one time just to make it clear that I could.  So yeah, that has been a role I played.  I think there is a part of me which tried to make the best of the situation.  Not just the best of a bad situation, but how to make an opportunity turn into a real success.
Speaker 1: What are your responsibilities as Chancellor of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]?
Speaker 2: Well the Chancellor works with the Provost as the two senior officers below the president on the academic side.  And my responsibilities have to deal with education and research.  Pardon me.  Education and student life.  And the Provost is more faculty and labs and departments and centers.  That's an artificial way to describe it.  But that's a simple way of describing it.  So all things having to deal with education and student life are part of the things I'm responsible for.  Now we're lucky in that Chuck [Vest] has built a great team.  So when I say I'm responsible for it, the number of things I actually get to do is a relatively short list.  And then when you look at all of the things that I think we've accomplished over the last several years.  There are a number of things that I've always been interested in advancing.  I do believe in an institution being student-friendly.  And so whether as a faculty member or a department head or Chancellor, I've always tried to make this a better educational experience for students.  I'm currently interested in using the opportunity in a place like this to build leadership skills.  I think that's something that would enhance our education greatly.  And I'm interested in helping students learn outside of the--outside of their comfort zone. Outside of this institution and outside of the country. So the activities that we promote for international research and collaboration look for ways of making sure students are considered--not last, but certainly as part of our priority.
Story_ID: 5166
Speaker 1: Speaking of students--are there former students of yours when you were Department Head Professor in City Planning Urban Studies who are now out as practitioners doing important things that you're really proud of?  Do you have some students you mentored who are really moving ahead?
Speaker 2: I won't mention names.  But, you know, there are at least two directors of planning at major cities around the country who are my former students. One of them who is head of planning in Baltimore [Maryland] I met recently.  And he, you know, had a meteoric rise in his field.  Done a great job.  Another student is head of The Enterprise Foundation [Columbia, Maryland] which is one of the largest community revitalization activities in the country.  Another--one of my first students is director of downtown planning in Miami [Florida].
Story_ID: 5167
Speaker 1: What would you say has been your major achievement during the last three years as Chancellor [of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Is there any particular achievement that you're proud of and wanna mention?
Speaker 2: I think we had as an intention going back to '98 [1998], so it precedes my starting this job, but includes my predecessor and then me when I came along in 2001, is to greatly enhance MIT's undergraduate education and student life.  The MIT of 2004 is not the MIT in the minds of most of the people looking at this video.  I think we are a broadly diversified institution.  Not just in the complexion of the skins of our students, but in the kinds of experiences--intellectual experiences that they have.  The kinds of activities that they have a passion for and that we support.  The kind of physical environment that is represented on this place, and outstanding in the world.  I think we have--have a brand that we have used effectively to build the institution and to add value to the experience that our students have while they're here and as they leave.  Now I can't claim all of that.  We've been led throughout this by an outstanding President, [Charles M.] Chuck Vest.  And I've had a great team of people to work with over these years.  And I can't overemphasize that.  Because, you know, we have had to make organizational changes over the years.  And you know, I think we have a perfect team now.
Story_ID: 5168
Speaker 1: You've been associated with several national initiatives dealing with housing.  You mentioned a few minutes ago the National Reinvestment Corporation. I also read in the materials that I was provided with about [The] Community Builders [Inc].  Tell me about Community Builders.  What is it?  And what's your role?  And--?
Speaker 2: Well as I indicated earlier housing and community development are my main areas of interest.  And I was fortunate enough to be appointed to the board of a small neighborhood organization in Boston [Massachusetts] in 1980.  It was then called the Greater Boston Community Development [Inc].  It has since morphed to be probably the largest nonprofit developer of housing in the country.  With offices--main offices of--is in Boston.  But we also have offices in other regions.  As far south as Louisville [Kentucky].  As far to the west as Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]and south into North Carolina and Miami [Florida] and then of course, other parts of New England, Connecticut, Rhode Island.  Over this period--and I'm now chair of the board.  And have been on the board all of these years as we morphed. We have taken advantage not just of housing programs, government programs that have been in place, but increasingly we've been able to leverage a nonprofit and for-profit investments in housing and community development, in a way that I think has made us a leader in the kinds of things that I try to teach.  There is a saying, you know, that those who can, do, and those who can't, teach.  I can't say I've ever built a house.  But I can say that I've been part of an organization that is built thousands of houses.  During the middle of this period, going back to the mid--late '80s [1980s] in a piece of research I did, I documented a coming maturity of some of the housing developments that would--were done in the mid '60s [1960s].  By maturity, I mean that the contracts for subsidy that they were initially developed under would expire.  And the issue would then be what would happen to that housing.  Whether it would be lost or whether it would be part of gentrification and be lost to poor people, or whether it would be torn down, whether it would be revitalized.  Because after thirty years, you do need to fix places up.  So I did a study.  It was documented the degree to which this was a emerging problem.  That was published, I believe, in 1987.  There was a congressional commission established that I had the honor of serving on, to develop a set of policies that would guide the government through the period since 1989.  And one of the organizations that sort of emerged to address that issue was the National Housing Trust [Inc.], that I continue to serve as a board member.
Speaker 1: The purpose of the trust--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Founding board member which makes me feel a little old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The purpose and the outcomes of the trust at this point?
Speaker 2: Well I think the purpose was to take advantage of resources and levers to preserve this housing, which I documented was at risk.  To preserve this housing.  And I think we've done a good job.  Not just we. But we have I think modeled some processes for doing it.  And we have sort of been advocates in [U.S.] Congress for doing it.  We brought a number of foundations such as the [John D. and Catherine T.] MacArthur Foundation and the Fannie Mae Foundation aboard to support these efforts.  And there's been some good efforts at empowering residents to take over and owners after the early investors no longer had an interest.
Speaker 1: The Housing Act of 1990--specifically how did your research and your writing impact on that act?  Can you bring those two together for me?
Speaker 2: I won't make any claims.  But  the work I did that was published in 1987, 'At Risk of Loss [The Endangered Future of Low-Income Rental Housing Resources]' is the title of the study--I certainly think did document that we were coming into a crisis, and that required congressional action.  Because laws that had--defined as housing would have to define its future.  I did have an opportunity to testify before Congress.  And as I indicated serve on the commission.  And I don't wanna make any claims beyond that.  Because, you know, there're some parts of the law that I think were for that time very good.  And certainly allowed organizations like the [National] Housing Trust to go forward.  But I also think they dropped the ball on some things.  And if you will recall, that was the time when we had the savings and loan crisis, which distracted Congress and others from housing and housing finance issues.  So there was not the sufficient follow-through that I would have liked.
Story_ID: 5169
Speaker 1: I know that you're very excited about being chairperson of the board of Roxbury Community College [Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts], a college that has been through a lot of ups and downs over the years.  When did you become the chair of the board?  And tell us about your involvement with Roxbury Community College.
Speaker 2: The college did go through about a ten-year period of I think for lack of a better word, very poor leadership.  Very poor stewardship on the part of the state and fell into some serious weakness.  This is a public community college located in Roxbury. The governor three years ago essentially dismissed the board and appointed a group of us--seven of the eleven board members. Two of the old board members were retained.  Those two plus a student member and an alumni member, both new, joined the seven of us who were appointed by the governor.  I was elected to be the board chair [in 2002].  And have been chair for the past two and a half years.  Of course, I never campaigned for that job.  Either to be on the board or to be the chair.  Though I must say that this is one hint that I did drop broadly.  I would say to my friends in and out of politics that something ought to be done.  And they listened.  And something was done.  And then when I got a call from the governor's representative to ask if I would serve on the board, I had no basis for saying, "No."  And I've been on it to serve.  And I think we've gone a long way toward turning the college around, even though there've been four budget cuts in the two and a half years that--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Who was the governor that--?
Speaker 2: Jane Swift.
Speaker 1: Jane Swift.
Speaker 2: A Republican.
Speaker 1: Any other local or regional or national housing activities that you're presently involved in that you'd like to share?  You've probably mentioned the primary ones.
Speaker 2: I think what I mentioned are the primary ones.  I think all along there were projects and activities and committees and so forth.  But I think I've mentioned the main ones, where I--where the work was either an extension or a way my research was used for a major leadership opportunity or duty that I assumed.
Story_ID: 5170
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you have lived your life?  And what is important to you?  What has been important to you during your lifetime?
Speaker 2: I think I'm--I will claim credit for having made some good choices.  I can claim credit for having listened to some wise people.  And I can claim credit for having seen giants and climbed up on their shoulders.  The rest I will leave for other people to make claims about.  But I think I've had a very good life.  And I would sort of recommend it to people.  I certainly think people would make some different choices than I've made.  But as long as they're good in their context, I think they will arrive at my age with a degree of comfort and satisfaction.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you still would like to do that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: Well I think--and this may--I'm not sure what this speaks to.  But I don't contemplate retirement in the usual sense of the word.  So I would always welcome additional opportunities. I certainly have opportunities here for the time being.  And, you know, will look for something else to do when I cease being Chancellor.  University professor is still one of the best jobs in America.  And so I don't have any--I'm not anxious to leave it.  But I certainly can imagine that there will be opportunities that in that role or in a related role, I could work for a while to come.
Story_ID: 5171
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a question I've never thought about.  I guess I would like to be remembered as someone who took the advice that I offered earlier, that I took from my grandmother [Minnie Jenkins] to, you know, "Don't kick anything except for football and now a soccer ball.  And be nice to people and try to do the right thing."
Speaker 1: Another question which may overlap this recent discussion. But what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well I'd like people to look back and see things that I did continue to have a positive benefit or represent insight or a model of good service.  I haven't invented anything.  I haven't, you know, created a company that, you know, I can--will bear my name or a product or an invention.  So I'm basically going to have to leave some artifacts of service behind.  And that's fine.
Story_ID: 5172
Speaker 1: Given that your research on housing of low income peoples, affordable housing, the preservation of housing largely centers on urban America where the majority of African American people live--given that you've taken on the responsibility of leading the board of Roxbury Community College [Roxbury Crossing, Massachusetts] which is a college for primarily black, Spanish-speaking students, what are your hopes and concerns for African Americans and the African American community?
Speaker 2: I think I have the same hope that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] expressed in the March on Washington.  He envisioned the day when there would be substantial equality in terms of life experience.  And those experiences would not be based on race.  He put in more poetic terms than I am.  But we have not reached that day yet.  We have made some progress that I think is quite clear to most people since then.  When I went to college I did not--sitting across from the chancellor I did not imagine one day that I too would be a chancellor.  But at the same time, I think that we have a number of things that are sources of great concern, sufficient.  That I think the progress is slowing and that we run the risk--in fact, we have already experienced some setbacks.  Let me just list some of the things in sort of a broad brush that I think represent real concerns for me.  And a real either lack of progress or reversals.  The first is that I think we have not recovered from losing Dr. King as a leader.  There's always a risk in having so much of your hopes in a given person.  Or even a given organization.  We have generated some wonderful people as individuals since then.  But that list is unfortunately not long.  And in some case when you get down to the community level, it's not deep. There've been places where there've been mayors elected, but not to sufficient staple of the next generation of leaders.  Not to sufficient stable of agency heads or organization heads who could consolidate the kinds of initiatives that the mayors took.  And then unfortunately many of those mayors were--even when they did a very good job, there is not a sufficient set of footprints behind them.  If you look at Mayor [Tom] Bradley was Mayor of Los Angeles [California] for twenty years.  He was a wonderful mayor. But there wasn't much behind him.  Mayor [David] Dinkins provided leadership to New York [New York] at a critical time.  We had some terms of other cities.  And I won't get into all of the names.  But we didn't build on that.  And as a result, we not only have--we not only don't have a leader of national stature that has the voice and power of a Dr. King, we don't have a consistent supply of them at the state and local level.  And when some one like Barack Obama emerges, he seems almost like, "Where has this guy been when we have been needing him for so many years in all fifty states?"  So I think that's one concern I have.  I think that one of the--you didn't ask me things that I've read a lot about lately.  And one of the things that I've gone back to read has been '[Americans from Africa:] Slavery and its Aftermath.'  And I see in so many cases the lasting effects--the legacy of slavery.  And one of them which I think we have to a great degree is the continuing set of challenges faced by males.  Slavery as a system preferred females.  Empowered females.  Rewarded females.  And we've made some progress in reversing that.  But not enough.  And I think this generation is slipping in back in some ways that are quite troubling.  It's not all black.  Because, you know, I think the--it's beginning now to be a yearly new story right after high school graduation.  "Where are the boys?"  But I think we have the problem more seriously and more consequentially than the population as a whole.  I think we also have not figured out how to make steady progress politically.  George [W.] Bush in the 2000 election got 92 percent of the black vote.  No!  I'm sorry.  Al Gore got 92 percent of the black vote.  While that's probably the way the voting should occur, it is potentially not as powerful to have substantial influence in both political parties.  And we haven't yet figured out how to have more political impact. Now if we had a Republican party that was more inviting, more mainstream and less objectionable to blacks, then we might have that.  And there are states where that's been true.  New York, Maryland, Illinois for example.  But right now it's terribly polarized.  And I think many young people don't get the same satisfaction in political involvement now--that I remember having as a young man.  So I could go on with the list.  But those are some of the things that give me concern.  Because I think they stand in the way of making the kind of progress and having a greater momentum for progress that I so much remember as being the legacy of the '60s [1960s].  We had some very tragic events during those periods.  And I can think of individuals that I knew or settings where I knew there was a lot of pain.  Not everybody came out celebrating--or advancing.  There were some real setbacks but I also recall that there was something to be proud about just about every day.  And the body has a way of remembering the great steps forward, and the great sense of pride you had in it.  And somehow forgetting the things that didn't go so well.  I think young people today don't have quite that sense.  We see a lot more bad news about our people and about what's happening and what's happening to us, than we see good news.  And it certainly covers a broader range of people.  There're always first, there're always exceptions, there're always exceptional people.  But I think for our--the kinds of statistics I look at, we don't have a lot daily to be proud about.

Speaker 1: In addition to your intense focus and interest in housing, you've also had an interest in community based organizational development.  Do you think that that arena--Where does that arena fit today in terms of helping our youth to understand the crises that we're facing socially and helping our youth to move towards taking some responsibility for their community?
Speaker 2: It may sound like a contradiction.  But I think one of the real inventions and one of the real success stories in the recent two or three decades has been the emergence of community-based groups.  Because when we look at many neighborhoods, they are stronger than they used to be.  We don't talk about communities as anomie in the way we talked about them in the '60s [1960s].  We don't talk about lack of organizational capacity in the same way.  We have organizations that have done some wonderful things.  Roxbury [Massachusetts], Harlem [New York], North Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], all much more empowered communities than they were a generation ago, because of organizations that have taken some responsibility.  We have not figured out--and every year I have at least one or two students who go at the question again, "How can we use this power in this capacity to intervene on behalf of young people?"  Sadly, I think that they're bound to have very limited power.  As long as education is so severely underinvested.  I describe an educational experience in a poor Southern county where I'm absolutely sure more kids had a better experience with more powerful impacts than we can speak to with schools in many of our major cities.  I mean schools bragged about how many or what percent of the students they sent to college. And which tier the colleges were in.  And many of our inner city schools are going to college--going to first year college is more the exception. And the gap is getting wider as education becomes more consequential.
