Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Full name is M, initial only, Lucius, L-U-C-I-U-S, Walker, W-A-L-K-E-R, Junior, M. Lucius Walker, Jr.
Speaker 1: And, well, if you don't mind me asking, what does the M stand for?
Speaker 2: That's the initial only.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, as recorded on my birth certificate, but historically, it's, had some other significance.  It's actually Mazafraden originally, but--I'm sorry, when I say originally, I mean before my time.  But that was the original--and I'm not even sure I know how to spell the original name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you say it again slowly?
Speaker 2: Maza--Mazafraden.  It had some African root, yeah, 'cause my grandfather spent time in Liberia.
Speaker 1: Mazafraden.
Speaker 2: Mazafraden, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, twelve, December 16, 1936, Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], Freeman's Hospital, Freedman's Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were born right on the campus of Howard University.
Speaker 2: Howard University, right, right.  Well, at that time, I guess most blacks were born (laughter) at Freedman's Hospital, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at least in this area.
Speaker 1: All right, and, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Retired professor and dean of the School of Engineering at Howard University.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date?  That's a good question (laughter).  I think it's the 15th, July 15, 2012, yeah.
Speaker 1: And where are at the--
Speaker 2: It's actually the 14th.
Speaker 1: Oh, is it?  Today's the 14th.
Speaker 2: Oh, it is the 15th, thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought it was, 'cause yesterday was the 14th.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, it's today.
Speaker 1: All right, so the 15th, 2012, and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at Highland Beach, Maryland.
Story_ID: 626313
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight warm up questions we ask--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food.  Yes, I do have a favorite food.  Oh, you wanna know what it is (laughter).  That's a good question.  Let's say a chocolate bar (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really, chocolate, okay. Which I'm not supposed to eat by the way (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 1: Well, I have two favorite colors, crimson and cream.  I happen to be a member of Kappa Alpha Phi Fraternity, and those are our colors, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 1: Spring, when the weather is warm and, and cozy.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], next to Highland Beach [Maryland] (laughter).  I'm on vacation here all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Hmm, "The future is now" (laughter).
Story_ID: 626314
Speaker 1: All right, now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family first--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --then I'm gonna ask about your father's side, and then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Inez, I-N-E-Z, Landers, L-A-N-D-E-R-S, Walker, W-A-L-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, without using my reference, I can't give you her date of birth (laughter).  It's around 1915, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia]
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: Well, my, I'm familiar with my grandfather and grandmother.  My grandmother was Cora, I think Cora Henrietta Landers, and she was apparently a white immigrant who came in through New York.  And somehow, I don't know the details of how my grandfather met her, but in any event, they were engaged and stayed married through their lives.
Speaker 1: Now, she was from York--
Speaker 2: New York, New York.
Speaker 1: New York, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: New York, okay, and she's--do you know what country she came from?
Speaker 2: I am not absolutely sure.  You have to, you can look at her picture.  Maybe (laughter)--I don't know whether that would suggest anything or not.
Speaker 1: You say she was a recent immigrant into New York?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my grandfather, as best I know, was actually born in Washington, [District of Columbia] metropolitan area, and he lived out his career--what's unique about him is he lived out his career as a barber, in fact, a barber on Capitol Hill.  So he's noted by recognition in 'Ripley's Believe it or Not' for having cut five generations of one congressman's family's hair (laughter).  So he, he was quite a distinguished gentleman and diligent.  In fact, I have a picture of he and the family on the table.  So you can, you know, get, I think just seeing the picture, get an appreciation of what their family was like.
Speaker 1: This is interesting.  I think a lot of people today, when they think of black barbers, especially in the North, they think of black men that cut the hair of other black people--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --you know, exclusively, mostly black men, but some black women too.  But he was cutting hair in a day, and the tradition on Capitol Hill is that the barbers are black, right?
Speaker 2: I believe so, yes.
Speaker 1: And at one time, since there were no black congressmen, they cut all white people's hair.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So this--
Speaker 2: Right, well, you know, Washington was not an explicitly segregated community.  But on the other hand, it was segregated.  And there were a lot of services that blacks, you know, from the community, provided to the total community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, well, one ironic thing about my father's, about my mother's family was that her brother, Horace, opted to be a pilot in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].  And, in fact, I have a picture of him there where he was, I guess, given some sort of award locally for his flying expertise.  But all through--and he left the family because he was indistinguishable.  In other words, my understanding is he wanted to fly and, you know, if he were thought of as being black, then he would have trouble, you know, exploiting his flying ambitions.  So the net result was that he finally abandoned the family, and I think maybe was occasionally in touch over the balance of his life.  And I don't know how old he was or what time that happened, but that story, you know, persisted in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so he was a pilot, and this is Horace Landers?
Speaker 2: Horace Landers, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, now, so did the family ever hear from him again when he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they heard from him.  They used to, you know, just for brief periods of time, he would say hello.  But, you know, he was not actively involved with the family beyond a certain age until his death.
Speaker 1: Well, we heard, you hear those stories occasionally, and, you know, people, I think a lot of people don't really know anybody that actually did that.  But that's a story out of your family history.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did, okay, are any stories from the barber about some of the people whose hair he cut and--
Speaker 2: No, no story other than the five generations, which like I said, made the--, was highlighted in 'Ripley's Believe it or Not' which is, you know, that suggests that it's fairly significant, you know, the whole notion of cutting five generations of hair.
Speaker 1: I just think that he probably could, he probably heard a lot of stories in the barbershop.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure he did, but not ones that were shared with me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he, okay.  I imagine confidentiality was, you know, probably some kind of a requisite of being a barber.
Speaker 2: Oh, pretty much, I'm sure that it was as well, but, but how can I describe it.  We were sort of stayed family in the sense that, you know, we respected one another, but there was no quote "moments of confession" to each other, you know what I'm saying.  You just, not times we told each other secrets of our lives, you know.  It was kind of formal like in many ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although I spent many years as a kid at their house, you know, over at the house.  He lived on A Street Northeast.  In fact, most of my mother's family lived in what would be now known as, you know, Capitol Hill and, you know, we probably couldn't afford to live there today (laughter), to say the least.  But at that time, areas immediately around the Capitol were fairly well integrated, although we went to separate schools, went to separate schools.  I went to Lovejoy which was an all-black school in that neighborhood, 12th and D Street Northeast.  I do remember where it was located.  And likewise, Terrell Junior High School and Armstrong High School, all were, you know, segregated institutions.
Story_ID: 626315
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories from your mother's [Inez Landers] side of the family about slavery or Reconstruction [period after the American Civil War, 1865 to 1877]?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall, not that I recall, yeah.  So I just, like I said, they tended to be just, well, somewhat, stayed is the only word I can think that kind of describes, you know--and in some ways, maybe they just didn't want me to carry the burden of, you know, whatever their experiences were.  I'm sure they had some childhood ones, but like I said, my, my grandfather was distinctively black and he was married to a white woman.  So I'm sure, you know, you talk about the early 1900s, that that had its moments.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was wondering if there were any stories about, you know, strains on their relationship.
Speaker 2: No, but they never shared it with me.  I'm sure they had them, but they never shared them with me.  You know, I think it was a strange, not a strange, but, you know, some effort to not burden young people too much with some of the realities of life.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, as a kid growing up, I mean I played with, you know, black and white kids in my neighborhood.  I only, there was only one instance--well, I'd say really, yeah, one instance where there was a problem.  I was a little kid, and this old white man kicked me in the tree box.  That was just accidentally, but I mean I don't--I'm sorry, accidently.  I don't know if that's the right way to describe it.  I think it was intentional.  But the point is, my father took him to court.  But as it turns out, nothing was ever done about it, you know.  And, of course, I guess we never saw him again.  He was just sort of wandering through the neighborhood, and I was on the tree boxing, and I suddenly felt this thump.  It wasn't life threatening, but it was hard enough to be concerned, yeah, so.  That was, you know, my racial experience as a young kid growing up in Northeast Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were just like blocks from the Capitol.
Speaker 2: Yeah, blocks, yeah, it's not far, no.  My grandfather and his family lived at 7th and A Street, North--Southeast.  My family home was at 9th and A Street Northeast--no, did I say 7th and A, yeah, no, 7th and C Street Northeast and 9th and A Street.  And then my, my grandfather's brother lived at 10th and C Street, roughly, Southeast, of course, which was at that time not the greatest neighborhood, but it wasn't bad.  Different, you know, when I say "great," I mean as opposed to where I lived and as opposed to where my grandfather on my mother's side lived.
Story_ID: 626316
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Inez Landers] have any stories about growing up that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly, not particularly.  But again, she was very fair skinned, and there were some concerns.  And my father [Lucius Walker, Sr.] was distinctively black and so, you know, I think there were some issues for them, like when, I'm sure when he went to, to Virginia or to Florida where he was from, you know, she rode in the back of the car (laughter).
Speaker 1: As if she was a passenger.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a passenger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother, now, did she finish high school or go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she finished high school and she was at D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia], what was it?  Miners' Teachers College for a year or two, but then she married my father and I was conceived, and she left school.  She only worked briefly during World War II at the government printing office.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did she go to Armstrong?
Speaker 2: No, no, she went to Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dunbar actually was the academic high school in the Washington--well, it's the black academic high school in the Washington area.
Speaker 1: And Armstrong would have been what?
Speaker 2: Armstrong was called the technical high school.  There were actually, let me think a minute.  It was, Armstrong which was a technical high school.  Dunbar was the academic high school, Cordoza (ph.) was a business high school, Phelps was a vocational high school.  And then later comes, came Spingarn, which I don't know what, 'cause I don't recall what it covered at the time, but that's basically how the high schools were organized back in the, academically, back in those days, that time when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your mother ever share with you an aspiration or ambition that she wanted, that she had when she was young?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, other than wanting a good job.  I mean, in other words, both my parents were products of the [Great] Depression, and they always were concerned about working regularly, you know.  In fact, that influenced my father's career significantly 'cause he got his master's degree in physics at Howard [University, Washington, D.C] and taught as an instructor at Howard, but then practically, he felt the D.C. public school system was more secure and, you know, decided to pursue a career in the D.C. public school system.
Story_ID: 626317
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: M. Lucius Walker, Sr. (laughter), same, initial only.
Speaker 1: Initial.
Speaker 2: I think his first name was initial only, yes.  Well, it's senior, so it had to be (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Around 1908, if I remember correctly.  I have it in the questionnaire, but I (laughter), unfortunately, I can't recall right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's about 1908, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Jacksonville, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, they were very unique for that time.  My grandfather was an African Methodist Episcopal minister, AME minister.  And, in fact, he was known as Rev. Dr. Thomas H.B. Walker, and he was extraordinary because he was an author.  He published his first book (unclear) on the history of Liberia in 1921.  And his first book on the presidents of Liberia in 1915 and which he shared copies.  I have those books on the table.  He shared copies of those books with me, but never said a lot about them.  In the introduction, he highlights the fact that, that he was inspired to write these books, one, because, you know, he felt that Negro children only had an opportunity to see white presidents, let's say, you know, the Lincolns and the Washingtons and the so on.  And so he thought that the books he had written was very important because it described, you know, civil men who provided leadership in Liberia over, I think there were about ten or fifteen presidents that's covered in these books.  And then he also rationalized, well, it's alleged that he may have had some philosophically connected to the Marcus Garvey Movement, but he was not a follower of Marcus Garvey per se, in the sense that he indicated that, you know, he could only see the problem in America being solved one of three ways.  One was amalgamation.  And he said, that's unlikely.  The other was for us to form a separate state or a separate state be formed where blacks would, you know, occupy and control and run, and the third was the possibility of repatriation in Africa.  So he thought that's why it was important to, you know, describe civil kind of Africa that was not, you know, I mean it was not technologically in line, but it was pretty advanced, at least for that time in Liberia.  He also--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: So that was his, you know, his philosophy and his, what inspired him to write.  But he wrote many books.  And I can't recall the names of all of 'em.  I've listed some.
Speaker 1: Now, he was, I--now, did he visit Liberia at some point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he actually visited Liberia many times in his life.  In fact, the family home in Jacksonville [Florida], you know, the porch was made up of cement embedded with stones from, you know, various countries of the world, he visited over his lifetime.  He was quite an exceptional person, black person for that time.  And, but he also was married to someone who happens to be a very exceptional black woman.  That was Rosa Glover Holmes Walker who was a funeral parlor director or owned the funeral--, a set of funeral homes, which still exists today by the way, although I have no, you know--, 'cause it turns out, when, you know, estates were settled, the funeral homes went to her family land.  And so, but they still exists, and she was recognized, in fact, you know, it's quote "her papers" that are maintained in the University of North Florida's [Jacksonville, Florida] library, and, you know, where she was recognized as a very outstanding entrepreneur and successful businesswoman 'cause they had quite a few, quite a bit of real estate at the time of their deaths, to say the least.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I think we have a picture of, like a panoramic picture of the funeral home and the street--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --with people standing there and with the cars, her cars were special, right.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  But that really was the St. Joseph Aid Society.  Now, I (laughter), which was, yeah, including her two cars from the funeral services she provided.  I mean they was limousines.  I don't think you'd simply describe them as cars.  So I mean that was a quite an achievement for then.  I think that was, that picture probably was around 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she had these two limousines.
Story_ID: 626318
Speaker 1: Now, the St. Joseph Aid Society was a function of the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church, right?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I'm a little confused, and I remember some of the society's (unclear), tried to explore it further.  In fact, the cane that I left on the table is my grandfather's cane where he's cited as the Grand Supreme Commander of the St. Joseph Aid Society.  And, you know, it looks like, and it's also some Masonic type of symbols on the cane.  It's a cherry wood cane, hand carved by apparently some member of his following.  And so, he apparently was, you know, fairly well beloved amongst the people who surrounded him.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any idea what the St. Joseph's Aid Society did?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have to admit, I've been trying to figure that out, but, and to some extent I think it provided a recourse for insurances and various things that, you know, burial insurance, a brotherhood, a social organization.  It had many dimensions as best I can determine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, take--oh, I guess you can't do that easily.  I said, take a look at the cane.  It's sort of, some of the symbols suggest the nature of the organization.
Speaker 1: Well, maybe we can get a picture of it at the end.
Speaker 2: Okay, good, good.
Speaker 1: We'll do that at the end.
Speaker 2: So, I know the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church had missions to Liberia and maybe some other African countries too.  But I know they went to, they had mission in Liberia.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: And so one of the people we interviewed, Dr. Rachel Boone Keith in Detroit [Michigan], was born in Liberia.  Her parents were missionaries, AME missionaries in Liberia.  She was born around 1920 or so, you know, in Liberia.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, just, so now, we also had a, have a copy that you sent us of a letter from W.E.B. Dubois to your grandfather concerning the Pan African Congress in 19, I think 21 [1921]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in London [England].
Speaker 1: Although he certainly was linked in to a lot of important figures of the times, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, was he ever bishop of the entire AME church or--
Speaker 1: I don't think so.  I think the--, his strongest recognition is the role he played in the founding and development of the Simpson Memorial Church in Jacksonville, Florida and now I've forgotten the name of the church in Daytona Beach [Florida], out of which Bethune-Cookman College came.  So both of those were, you know, seemed to be significant achievements of the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you were saying, I think before we started the interview that, that the church and Daytona Beach was the church out of which Bethune-Cookman College came--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and was Mary McCloud Bethune one of his parishioners there?
Speaker 1: Apparently so, apparently.  Well, they had, you know, they had a close relationship.  Like I said, whenever he would visit Washington District of Columbia]--in fact, he took me down to her office several times over my life.  I mean I don't, you know, I was just a little kid, but it was quite significant, you know, the opportunity to meet her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not that she had a lot to say to me, but (laughter) you know, she certainly was a--what's her name, [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt's favorite person, or one of her favorite people, if I remember correctly--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eleanor Roosevelt said--
Speaker 1: Eleanor, I think so, I think Eleanor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was Eleanor's [Roosevelt] close associate.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 626319
Speaker 1: So, at any rate, well, now, your, your father [Lucius Walker, Sr.] grew up in--
Speaker 2: Jacksonville [Florida].
Speaker 1: Jacksonville, yeah.
Speaker 2: He made the route North, I think he spent some time in Tuskegee Normal School [now Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And then he came to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] to study physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Tuskegee Normal School, you get a teacher's degree or normal degree.
Speaker 2: Right, right, so he was there briefly, and then he came, as far as I recall, and that was by word of mouth.  He told me had been there for a while, and then he came to Howard and earned his bachelor's degree and master's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I might, I might add that he and my, my mother's [Inez Landers] brother--in fact, this is probably how he came to know my mother, were the first master's degree recipients from, from Howard University in physics.  I think he got, I think my, her brother got his degree in 1930, and my father got his master's degree in '34 [1934], if I remember correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, he was, you know, an aspiring physicist.  Now, he did tell me a tale, you know, that relates to racism because he, he always recalled the fact that, that when he was young, somehow he built this radio for some science fair and somehow someone confiscated it from him, and he was very offended by that, you know, 'cause he was not--I wouldn't call him a nerd, but he was kind of into science.  I mean he liked science, and loved science, and, but he, you know, other than through his teaching, he never had much opportunity to be involved in science.  He was a close--, he was a student of--there were two Coleman professors.  I remember this well.  At Howard, there was a white Coleman and a black Coleman, and he was close to both of them.  And a lot of people over the years have told me of how he helped them, you know, pass their physics course when they were students at Howard.
Story_ID: 626320
Speaker 1: My father [Lucius Walker, Sr.] and my mother's [Inez Landers] brother were both in the physics program at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], in the graduate program.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, now, is there a story behind your father's involvement in physics, you know.  That's a--
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, he just always as a young person aspired to be a scientist, you know what I'm saying.  At least that's what he told me.  And then he sort of influenced my thinking as well, you know, and gave me some confidence that if it was something I wanted to achieve, I could, which I think was a very important dimension that's missing from some young and women's lives, you know, someone who tells them, look, you know, (laughter).  My father, incidentally, my father never tutored me per se.  What he did was always reassure me that within my own abilities I could do the work, which is kind of a different perspective from, you know, you think that maybe he taught me physics.  He never taught me physics.  He taught me that if I needed to do physics, I could, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, you know, with the emphasis today, I know we've been talking about STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] education in the black community for years and how it's not, the hard sciences and some of the equipment to pursue them are not available in the black community--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --especially in the old days when the one-room schools and people, you know.  But, so I just imagine there's a story here on some level behind your father being even involved in physics in that, during that time period, you know.  I mean, you know, Howard had a department but who inspired--did your father ever talk about how he was inspired to pursue physics?
Speaker 1: Well, it strikes me that he liked science before he ever came to Howard.  But I may, you know, that's as best I recall, his telling me that, well, as a young person, like I said, I told you the story about, you know, he had entered a science fair and somehow, someone confiscated his science project.  He was eternally upset about that even though he was, you know.  I mean it was a thing of his past when I was growing up, you know.  He was maybe thirty or forty years old and still talking about his high school science project (laughter), said someone had confiscated it, you know, so and unfairly so.  So, he, he--but there's no science, I mean nothing beyond that I could really say at this time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That occurs to me.
Story_ID: 626321
Speaker 1: Did he have any other stories about growing up in Jackson--now, he grew up in Jacksonville [Florida], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he grew up in Jacksonville.  Well, you know, those were tough times.  Sometimes he was rather bitter about his, you know, race-based experiences.  I'd say that, you know, sometimes he used language that I didn't, I didn't particularly care for, but, you know, he felt compelled to be mad sometimes.
Speaker 1: Your father was born in 1908, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around 1908, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he experienced being in the South during the worst era in southern history in terms of lynching and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So he was pretty mad about those things, to say the least.  I mean not that he daily expressed, I mean, no, yeah, not that every day expressed it, but there were times when, you know, it was quite evident that they weighed heavily on his mind.  That, and the Great Depression (laughter).  Those are two things that, you know, wore him out, to say the least.
Speaker 1: Now, another thing that he experienced at, now, he was at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] when, I guess, the top black, one of the top black scientist of all times, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you mean George Washington Carver, right, right.
Speaker 1: --was (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I'm sure that's what attracted him there for a while, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories about George Washington Carver [African American scientist]?  Did he meet him or--
Speaker 2: No, to be honest, he, I don't recall him, or than saying that he was a great scientist and, you know, did marvelous things with the peanut (laughter).
Speaker 1: But he didn't have a personal, he never really--
Speaker 2: No, again, let me emphasize that my family tends to be somewhat stayed and not, you know, didn't have these little caveats that, you know, it was kind of formal like most of my life, you know.  I mean I'm, I would say he tended to be a little shy and slightly introverted.  And I was much that way most of my life as well.  I've come out a little bit having had a lot of public opportunities, but it was hard for me to say, I'll give you an interview because of (laughter), I don't like the lights, you know.  So, I'm saying he was kind of that.
Speaker 1: I understand, but I have to ask these questions 'cause--
Speaker 2: No, I understand.  No problem, please.
Speaker 1: --Tuskegee with George Washington Carver there--
Speaker 2: No, I understand, I understand.
Speaker 1: --I gotta ask about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no, he was proud, proud of, you know, the brief time he was there.  But he never said a great deal about it, you know.  And I'm sure he did fairly well as a student, because he seemed to be comfortable with math and science--math and physics and science.
Speaker 1: I think the architect, Robert Taylor, was there at the same time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Robert Taylor.  Yeah, in fact, Robert Taylor is a relative of a good friend of mine, Clarice Divvel (ph.), yeah.  In fact, didn't they name a building after him not long ago or something?  I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Last spring--
Speaker 2: Spring, last spring, right.  She was down for that.  You interviewed her not long ago.  When I say, "you", I mean your organization.
Speaker 1: It was me.  Yeah, it was me, yeah.
Speaker 2: Clarice Divvel Walker, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But we're not related, but we both share the last name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, anyway, so your father, did he--he probably didn't now, but I'm gonna ask anyway, did he have a story about why he left Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] to come to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: No, he did not.  I suspect that, but I suspect because Howard was probably the only black school at that time to offer the bachelor's degree in physics and master's in physics.  That's what I suspect.  You know, and, of course, it had, Howard has a unique reputation too as a, you know, as a what?  A leadership oriented school, and a strong academic program.  Over the years, there's been a lot of outstanding scholars that have passed through Howard to say the least.  Woo, I am amazed myself when I think of some, even from my own school.  Somewhere in our conversation, I'll share with you some of them, yeah.
Story_ID: 626322
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, your father comes to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] and, now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Not per se, but my--I find it interesting, you see, my mother's [Inez Landers] family was, was four girls and three boys, two of whom were college bound, and, of course, Horace [Inez Landers' brother] was a pilot.  So it's very interesting that my father, you know, got to know those brothers well (laughter).  He probably wondered, had some interests in the brothers' sisters, (laughter) you know, who were fairly attractive women.  You know, we all think of our mothers as being attractive, but the point is, you know, I think she was exceptionally attractive.  And so I'm sure that had a little bit to do with his relationship to her brothers (laughter).  And they, but they remained life-long friends, all of them, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but there's no story about how they met.  Did they meet on the campus of Howard?
Speaker 2: I am not sure.  That's conceivable because, you know, Miner's Teachers College [Washington, District of Columbia] was right on the edge of Howard's campus, which is now a facility, in fact, Howard owns.  But in those years that was, you know, like a separate institution standing right on the corner of Howard's campus.
Story_ID: 626323
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Inez Landers and Lucius Walker, Sr.] personalities and their dispositions, their looks, their habits, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I'm somewhat of a blend between the two.  My father was shorter than myself and my mother and somewhat shy whereas my mother was a person who always, you know, forthright in her statements, belief and intentions and what have you (laughter), you know.  And, yeah, I would, I would--except where financial decisions were involved, I would say she was the dominant personality of the household.  Yeah, she was quite an interesting person, I mean from the standpoint of, you know, her determination and her stick-to-it-ness and that kind of thing and her rigidity, you know, (laughter).  You know, you came to dinner at five o'clock and you ate breakfast at nine o'clock, and, you know (laughter), all those kinds of things.  You went to the bathroom on schedule (laughter).  No, she was a--, she was quite an individual in terms of, you know, what she considered to be things that are right for us to do.
Story_ID: 626324
Speaker 1: Can you name your siblings and tell us where you fit--
Speaker 2: I have no siblings.
Speaker 1: So you're the only child?
Speaker 2: I'm an only child, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both my father [Lucius Walker, Sr.] and mother's [Inez Landers] families, there were seven children, but somehow my father didn't feel he could afford another child.  Yeah, he always, you know, kind of highlighted that.  My mother, well, in fact, I had a rather big head.  She said, (laughter)--I'm not sure if this is for TV consumption, but she said that after that experience, she couldn't have any more children (laughter).  So, so, you know, she used to somehow tease me about, in fact, I even got a complex a little bit about having a large head (laughter), yeah.  Yeah, that was kind of interesting I thought.
Story_ID: 626325
Speaker 1: We were talking about, oh, your earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 2: Well, sadly, I mean, basically, I just remember being in the hospital.  I had, I remember my tonsillitis only because that was uncomfortable.  And then I subsequently had a bout with gall bladder which was uncomfortable, and they mistakenly didn't remove my gall bladder at the time.  So subsequently, I had the gall bladder removed again when I was about forty years old.  But, but I never will forget, you know, at the time, I had to spend like a month in the hospital.  Today, you go in and out in two or three days.  And one of the big problems was after laying in one position for a long time, hey, that's where my body (unclear), and the nurse had to come [sound] bang my knees in order to straight out my legs.  And, whoa, that really frightened me, and it was uncomfortable to say the least.  But once it was done, I was all right.
Speaker 1: So, did you--
Speaker 2: That was really my early--well, I remember that.  That's on the negative side.  On the positive side, I guess I always, my family always enjoyed holidays, you know.  So Christmas was always an exciting event, and the fourth of July was an exciting event.  My birthday was an exciting event.  So they always, you know, took time out to celebrate major holidays, May Day, at the schools was solid evening.  They used to wrap the May Day pole (laughter).  So those were always things that we, you know, celebrated and were, gave a little deviation from the normal, you know, and the special, special events, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So those were happy moments.
Story_ID: 626326
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, describe the house you grew up in and--
Speaker 2: Well, it was a small house, 9th and A Street, Northeast [Washington, District of Columbia].  Well, there was a mix of houses on the block, the houses, they would range anywhere from, my house would probably be in the couple hundred thousand range, and there were houses that would easily be in the million dollar range on the same block.  And it was a small house, I mean, I remember three bedrooms.  I think it had one bathroom (laughter).  And I guess my father [Lucous Walker, Sr.] and mother [Inez Landers], I think they, in fact, bought the house from, from my mother's father, if I remember correctly.  And, you know, it was a comfortable house.  It wasn't very large to say the least.  So it was small, maybe what, 1,500 square feet inside, livable space.  It had a basement.  It was unfinished and I always thought someday my daddy would finish the basement, but it never quite got done.  It had an access from the backyard to "A" Street, which was kind of, never, quite ever cleaned up.  But it was there.  And I kept, I had my little doggy, Butch, who stayed in the backyard all the time.  My father didn't believe in dogs in the house (laughter), and rain, snow or sunshine, the dog was outside.  And, but he lived a good life.  He lived to maybe about, when he was about 15, he left home and never came back.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, those were the days, in those days, could you just let a dog roam around, sort of, I mean you--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --didn't have to have him tied up all the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, a lot of dogs, you would see them walking on the street, yeah.  But I mean in terms of backyard, you know, it was a fairly good-sized backyard.  So he had a lot of room to roam around.  We never let him loose per se, other than when he would accidentally get away, 'cause he was not trained like--actually, these dogs while, they're kind of rebellious, if I let them out of the car and I say "house", they come to the house.  If I say "car", they go to the car.  But every now and then, they do something else (laughter), whereas, my dog when I was young, didn't follow commands too well.  Of course, I didn't understand training dogs then either.  But, not that I understand them perfectly now, 'cause every now and then they'll mess up.
Speaker 1: So, what kind of dog was Butch?
Speaker 2: Butch was a mongrel.  It's the best way I can describe him.  I couldn't identify him with any particular bred but a very loveable dog, and, you know, friendly.
Speaker 1: Well, what did he look like?
Speaker 2: Like a mutt (laughter).  He didn't look like any specific breed.
Speaker 1: Was he big or little or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was a small dog, well, yeah, small, a little bigger than these dogs, but not a lot bigger.  And I do remember one other thing.  He bit me in my butt once and a neighbor's dog bit me on my butt.  Both times I had to go to the hospital to get those, what do you call those shots?
Speaker 1: Rabies shots?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Tetanus.
Speaker 2: Yeah, tetanus shot.  That was a, woo, that shot was something else.  That's all I can say (laughter).  And I do remember being bitten on the rear end twice when I was a youngster.
Speaker 1: Now, when you stayed in the hospital, was that at Freedman's Hospital?
Speaker 2: Yes, hold it one minute.  Hold it.  No, Children's Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Children's Hospital which was at 11th and V, 12th and V, Northwest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't far from Freedman's, but no, it was, most, you know, pediatric surgery was done there at that time, if I remember correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in your household growing up was your mother and your father and you.  And now, did any of your grandparents or cousins live with you or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Just the three of you?
Speaker 2: Just the three, but we lived not far from my grandfather and his youngest daughter, who, you know, cared for him for most of his life, yeah.  That was only, what, maybe four or five blocks, walk from one to the other.
Speaker 1: This is your mother's father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's father, right, right.  In fact, when my mother worked in, you know, at the printing, government printing office, very often my Aunt Ora would watch me, you know, at the house or I would go over there and stay.
Story_ID: 626327
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a quiet neighborhood for the most part.  And like I said, it was a neighborhood that had a strong mix of economic classes.  I mean there were the poorest people you could imagine on the block.  There were also very well off people, then middle-class people like my parents who were teachers and all, like my father was a teacher-type of thing, which wasn't--you know, it was a comfortable income but not anything to boast about.  There was one, there was one apartment building on the, on the what, West side of the street and one down the street where one of my closest friends were custodians.  That was Dickey, well, David and John Byrd, sad to--well, well, not--everyone in that family deceased except for, for David Byrd, who lives someone in this area.  I, I see maybe every five or ten years.  But so, I don't know.  It was clearly urban, you know.  It, well, it was a park across the street from where I lived.  It was a small park, you know, like on the corner at Maryland Avenue and A, which, which housed a camp during World War II.  So you, it actually had machine guns and so on over there, stationed and, you know, a fence so that people couldn't just, you know, go into the park.  And when I say "park", it wasn't much larger than this lot, but, you know, you'd see all these anti-aircraft guns and what have you strewn around.  It was kind of nerve racking in a strange way.  And, of course, I do remember back in those days when the sirens would go off, you know, they really were practices for, you know, for military attacks.
Speaker 1: Air raids and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, air raids, right, right.  So, I remember that about the neighborhood.  We used to play, what, well, when the camp was not there, we would sometimes play in that little park area, some football and, you know, ride bicycles on the street.  It may have been eight or ten kids all together that were, you know, formed sort of a friendship, were in the close age range.  And, in fact, I was a ring bearer.  I meant to bring that picture, which I didn't, at one of my neighbor's wedding.  I had a reunion, fifty-year reunion which, but they gave us pictures from back then.  I must have been about five years old at the time.  But, so I mean, you know, it was a nice neighborhood.  Occasionally, we'd have some little confrontations.  I remember as kids, you know, we'd throw water balloons.  The police were a little upset by that.  So they took a, believe it or not, they chose one of the white kids and took him around the corner in the alley and spanked him.  Of course, that didn't work out too well for them.  I'm sure, I don't know what the final conclusion was, but his father happened to be a physician.  You know, he was a fairly affluent member of the neighborhood, but they didn't, you know, they didn't know that.  They just were looking for a kid to remind not to throw these water balloons on people--well, we weren't throwing them on people.  We would just throw them in people's yards and things like that.  So, I kind of remember that instance.  But what else can I say about the neighborhood.  Well, everybody was cordial to one another, you know, for the most part. No dramatics (laughter).
Speaker 1: So the population was mixed in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was mixed, yes.  It was, in fact, mixed, well, we did (unclear) like on the West side of the street, there were no black people who lived on the West side.  Black people only lived on the East side of the street, and this was, you know, a small street, nice street in Northeast.  But, yeah, so that's more or less how I remember the area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, a lot of fun moments and a lot of sad moments, but they had more to do with running up and down the street and falling and scratching your knee (laughter) as opposed to, you know, tensions between people 'cause we all got along well, simply that when we went to school, we went in a different direction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we never talked about that when we played together.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular ethnic group that dominated the neighborhood in terms of white students or were they just kind of--
Speaker 2: No, I think it was mixed, but I'm not sure.  I didn't really--I wasn't sensitive to, you know, ethnic differences amongst white people.  You know, and there were, let me see, one, two, three, four, there were four black families on my side of the street, I remember.  And, well, I can't, I remember Percy, little Purcell, Purcell was one of the families, and sadly, I remember one of his, Purcell went out one evening, came back slashed.  But he had gone to one of these house parties.  House parties were a big thing when I was young.  And he'd gone into some other neighborhood to a house party, and, you know, some fight with some of his classmates or someone that left him slashed for life.  But he was okay.  I mean he recovered, just that he had a horrible scar down the side of his face.  But my parents would never let me go to such a party anyway (laughter), so I'd have getting out of the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, as an only child, I suppose with a lot of adults around you, your parents there, and then you've got your grandfather and your aunt down the street--
Speaker 2: Right, right, oh, no question.
Speaker 1: So, you had a lot of supervision, I would take it.
Speaker 2: Oh, no doubt, no doubt.  And also, well, the other thing that we used to do was, which was a lot of fun, was we would, you know, at the time, you could buy a pass.  We had street cars in Washington.  I don't know if you know, it was like trams or railroad cars that run up and down the street.  In fact, they're in the process of putting one back in over on 8th Street.  But Washington was laced with those when I was young.
Speaker 1: A streetcar is an electric car, running on a track--
Speaker 2: Track, yeah, right.  And so on the weekends though passes, you know, people would give us passes, and then we would ride the streetcar to the end of the line.  And, you know, that would a little fun to ride out for, you know, to wherever the end of the line was.
Speaker 1: So you don't remember where it ended?
Speaker 2: Cabin John, I think was one of them, and, of course, at that time, Cabin John was like a little picnic area that was discrim--that was segregated.  But we would just ride there and come right back home, you know, as opposed to getting out and having picnic (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you started school at, did you go to preschool at all?
Speaker 2: No, no preschool.  Preschool was, I don't think I ever heard of the word "preschool" when I was in school.  Yeah, I went to Lovejoy [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Did you go to kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Kindergarten, yeah, there was kindergarten, yeah, kindergarten through sixth.  And then junior high was sixth through nine, and high was nine--I mean tenth through twelve.
Story_ID: 626328
Speaker 1: You went to Lovejoy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Elementary School [Washington, District of Columbia], and you started there in kindergarten, and you were like, five, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably, 12 and D Street, Northeast, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this would be 1941, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Right, around that time, right.
Speaker 1: All right, 1941.  Now, this is the same year as the beginning of World War II.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, so, well, tell us about school.  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I enjoyed school.  It wasn't, wasn't thrilling to me.  It was kind of like a task when I was, you know, younger.  But for the most part, it was fun.
Speaker 1: Now, the names of the places here resonate history.  They all do, you know.  Lovejoy School, I'm sure is named for Elijah Lovejoy, the abolitionist--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: --who was martyred in Illinois--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, before the Civil War, and, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --so I'm just, I just thought I'd raise that.  The people that created this black school, this, they--it's a public school in a black community, they were very conscious of who they were and where they came from.  So,--
Speaker 2: That's certainly true, although I was less conscious of Lovejoy, but Terrell, in fact, the guy, Ray Langston who, if I can reach to show you the, the Frederick Douglas Museum, you know, is in the Terrell family or he and his wife are somehow in the Terrell.
Speaker 1: This is the family of the famous Mary Church Terrell.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So these are all like, Armstrong is even a, you know, reference to a historical figure during the Reconstruction [period after the American Civil War]--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and was responsible for that school.  So, anyway, so you're at Lovejoy Elementary.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Well, the curriculum wasn't organized that way.  Oh, I see, you mean within the whatever you studied.  I guess basically math and, you know, arithmetic, what have you (laughter).  Yeah, I enjoyed those, science as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What about teachers?  Are any teachers you remember that were particularly helpful to you or that you thought were really good teachers?
Speaker 2: If I remember, Ms. Lewis was our homeroom teacher.  Of course, we stayed in one room most of the day, at least for the upper years at Lovejoy.  And she was a, you know, a little regimentarian and, you know, but very polite and graceful in her way, quite a distinguished person.  In fact, that's what I remember of most of my teachers up to, you know, junior high school. And they--well, even high school as well, but I didn't stay in high school very long.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Mrs. Lewis you remember particularly from school.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Did your teachers live in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure where they lived.  No, they didn't live in my neighborhood, but, you know, I'm not sure where they lived.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you a popular student in school or--
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  I was rather quiet and introverted.  I guess I would describe myself that way, you know.  I was little shy of people, didn't like to--well, I enjoyed, I enjoyed (laughter), what do you call it?  Recess (laughter), and seeing and knowing other kids.  We used to play marbles a lot (laughter), which was kind of fun.  But, but generally, I was, you know, fairly quiet.  I think I had one encounter with a bully so to speak, but we kind of wrestled it out, you know, in a way that, you know, I was first fortunate, not hurt 'cause he was a little stronger and bigger than I was.  But finally, we had, you know, the showdown at the O.K. Corral, and I came out okay, you know, but not the winner, but okay (laughter).  And so, and after that never any problems.
Speaker 1: But he didn't mess with you any more after that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he didn't mess with me anymore, right.
Story_ID: 626329
Speaker 1: What did you like to do as a kid growing up?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, well, as I indicated before, I liked things (laughter).  In other words, I liked to do math problems.  I liked to build things.  I loved to build things, and I loved to dismantle things.  You know, I always would, you know, try to help repair things or fix things in the household, you know.  And then, you know, at the time, I guess I had a, the toys I remember were a Lionel Choo-Choo train, you know, so just putting that together, dismantling it, was fun.  And then that was an electric train, and then I remember my Erector Set, which was at the time, I forget the name of it, but rather than being the classic Erector set, it was the one that had the gussets.  And the rubber gussets, you know, you put the parts together with a rubber gusset and a rivet.  And so I remember building a lot of things that, you know, were actually basically described in the booklet and certain things that I would imagine, you know.  But that would, you know, I'd try to build.  So, and also model airplanes as I got a little older.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have, were you influenced by the movies or radio, that sort of thing when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  Well, I always enjoyed movies of the Wild West, you know the Lone Ranger and Tonto (laughter), movies of that character.  But, Roy Rogers was famous at the time when I was a kid.  What else?  But it was third cowboy, but I can't remember who it was.
Speaker 1: Gene Autry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gene Autry, right, Gene Autry, right, right.  So, yeah, I, you know, all those movies were all, they represented a kind of fantasy that (laughter), you know, highlighted a heroism but not too brutally, you know, different from some of today's movies, which are outright violent, brutal and horrific.  But those movies were a little more gracious in their approach to life.
Speaker 1: Right, right, that's true.  Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  I was, I went to, believe it or not, the Calvary Episcopal Church in Northeast Washington which wasn't far from where I lived.  A rather famous local minister was James O. West, Jr.  So, I certainly recall him strongly over the years and occasionally, I'd go to Sunday school, but not--my parents never forced me, you know, to quote "be religious".
Speaker 1: Okay, so were they religious?
Speaker 2: My parents were, my father went to church and my mother.  Both went regularly to church.  But, they, you know, they weren't exponents of religion so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, now, were you involved in activities like Boy Scouts and--
Speaker 2: No, my parents for some reason didn't think Boy Scouts were such a great idea.  Yeah, I would like to have been involved.  I always admired those people who could be in Boy Scouts, and my best friends in the neighborhood were in Boy Scouts, but my parents didn't seem to think that was good--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --to be a member of the Boy Scouts.
Speaker 1: Now, what about sports?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was not particularly athletic.  I mean I enjoyed golf.  I enjoyed tennis, I enjoyed a lot of different games, but I wouldn't, I was never good enough to quote "be on the team", so to speak (laughter).  So, although, as I grew older, my golf got better.  I did win a few golf trophies over my life, not first place, but, you know (laughter), maybe third or runner up, you know.  But that's with a handicap.  But I never was, you know, never had been recognized for my athletic prowess, so to so to speak, yeah.
Story_ID: 626330
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories of the war [World War II] years?
Speaker 2: You mean, who--
Speaker 1: And you were a little kid in school, I guess, during the World War II?
Speaker 2: Yeah, World War II, I told you, there was actually an encampment across the street from where I lived.  So I certainly remember that.  And, of course, the air raids, and, you know, I think for the most part were not actual air raids, but, you know, (laughter) tests raids.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us what that is.  I kind of vaguely remember that.
Speaker 2: Well, the sirens go off, and, you know, obviously everybody assumes their position in the encampment, you know, behind the machine guns.  And they weren't actually firing into the sky, but they were, quote "prepared to do so".  So that was kind of exciting to say the least.  Well, I mean it wasn't exciting in a fun kind of way.  It was fearful, you know, the fact that these things were taking place.  And--
Speaker 1: I think in Britain in those days, they were actually experiencing air raids from the Germans--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --being bombed and in the U.S., they were, the siren would go off, right, here?
Speaker 2: Right, right, the siren would go off--
Speaker 1: As a rehearsal for--
Speaker 2: Rehearsal, right.  That's right.  So, so, you know, that somehow made you somewhat fearful of, you know, the actual event occurring.  But--
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: --on that, I can't recall a lot.
Story_ID: 626331
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any heroes when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Heroes, (laughter) Batman and Robin (laughter), you know.  And, oh, well, I guess in, well, talking about community heroes, Joe Louis was a big hero to me, you know.  And what was the guy's name, Owens [Jesse Owens] who ran in the Olympic, I think in '36 [1936]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jesse Owens.
Speaker 2: Jesse Owens, right, right.
Speaker 1: Now, he ran the year that you were born, but I guess when you were coming along, he was a hero.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Well, I mean looking back, he was a hero.  And then, of course, there was a woman tennis player, Althea Gibson, I remember her well.  And I said, well, I said, Joe Louis, I think, yeah.  But Joe Louis would play golf.  My uncle sometimes would engage him in a game.  I'm not sure who won.  I think my uncle probably lost (laughter) to tell you the truth.  But they, you know, Langston Golf Course was "the" golf course for blacks in the Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] area when I was young.  I think that was the only golf course where you could play golf.  But, well, it was a nice course.  It was a very popular golf course amongst everyone today.  But at that time, it was, you know, strictly for black people.  And so, you know, when Joe Louis would come to town, he'd very often play golf there.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you ever meet Joe Louis?
Speaker 2: No, I never met him, but my uncle, my Uncle Willie Walker, William Walker, I think, you know, knew him fairly well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were ten when, I guess when Jackie Robinson broke into baseball.
Speaker 2: Right, that was a big event, no doubt about it.  I wasn't a great baseball fan, but I had an uncle on my mother's side, an uncle-in-law, who loved baseball.  In fact, he would occasionally carry me to baseball games up in New York, although what I liked about going to New York was Coney Island (laughter) to tell you the truth and the Parachute Drop (laughter), you know.  So we would go to some Yankees' [New York Yankees; baseball team] games, but he was obsessed with baseball.  He loved baseball.  You know, he would travel wherever necessary to see a game.  And, you know, till his death, he would sit there in his waning moments looking at baseball games on television (laughter).  Oh, man, he was, he was really heavily into it.  Well, he didn't have any sons, so I sort of, you know, filled his need for male companionship at these games.

Speaker 1: Now you attended Armstrong High School, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, you say Armstrong High School was a technical high school?
Speaker 2: Technical.  At that time, it was the school that offered like pre-engineering, you know.  That's a recent phenomena, pre-engineering as part of a, you know, high school program with these so called, what do you call 'em?  Magnet schools, but at that time, it offered pre-engineering.  It offered printing, if I remember correctly.  It offered, oh, what?  I can't remember what some of the other skills taught there were, but it was, like I said, it was so-called technical as opposed to vocational.  You know, vocational, you learn to do woodwork, you know, run lays and things like that.  But Armstrong was more for the academically, oriented technical programs, yeah.  So I only was there a year before I went to college.
Speaker 1: Now, what happened?  Now, see, you were in, at Armstrong on time, right?  You entered when you were fourteen?
Speaker 2: 1952, yeah, I, well, I entered Armstrong in 1952.  I was, what?  Fourteen when I went to Armstrong.  And I stayed there for one year 'cause I went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] when I was fifteen years old.
Speaker 1: How did you, now, how did this take place?  How did you wind up going--
Speaker 2: Well, it was a thing called the Ford Foundation Early, what?  Early Admission Program.  It was at many, it was held at several schools around the country, black schools.  It was Morehouse [College], Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and there was Columbia [University, New York], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and some other school that had such a program.  And the whole idea was to give a young person college experience before he was threatened with the draft.  I think that was one of the rationales.  And so, you know, I qualified for the program along with twenty-nine other people.  In fact, the picture's in the report, twenty-nine people qualified for the program.  And, you know, my parents felt it was, you know, better opportunity to be educated than was available in the high schools here.  So they, you know, encouraged me to consider it.
Speaker 1: Now, were these all black people that were chosen for this program?
Speaker 2: Well, there were all black people at Morehouse and at Fisk, but at the other schools, I'm sure there was a mix of students.
Speaker 1: I didn't know if it was a program just for black students or for--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was for black and white students, but, you know, but--and there may have even been black students that went to the white, some of the white schools because they were for the most part, Ivy League schools.  And I think you were considered, you know, at all of the schools, but, and there may have been some, you know, difference level that, you know, 'cause I think when I took the test, I think that also would have included Columbia and Yale.  But I'm not, I don't recall having admission to those schools through this program.
Story_ID: 626333
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you go to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], and this is the first time you've been outside of D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia], right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you go to Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents drive you down there or--
Speaker 2: No, no, I took the choo-choo train.  Lord, have mercy.  I never was so astonished in my life.  When I got off the train, and looked up, I saw that "Colored Only" sign, Jesus Christ, that was depressing (laughter), I'll tell you that.  Woo, that was not one of my life's best experiences.  On the other hand, Morehouse College was a very rich environment to study it.  It was very inspirational.  Morehouse is, if you're talking about motivation, just the nature of the campus and the (unclear), the school was unbelievably good.  And, of twenty-nine students, I would say I bet you at least eighty percent of those students have been very successful in life.  In fact, Maynard Jackson was one of my classmates.  Major Owens, the congressman from New York was one of my classmates.  Peter Shatodd, (ph.) who was a, a plastic surgeon in Seattle, Washington, originally from New Orleans [Louisiana] was one of my classmates.  Johnny Barber who I understand was a speech writer for Martin Luther King [Jr.], was one of my classmates.  I just had--James Till, was head of neuro-radiology at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  In fact, I think he still may be in charge.  I'm not sure, but he was, he was a brilliant radiology, diagnostician.  He was truly an outstanding, that was--now that was one of the smartest people I had ever met in my life (laughter).  He had a photographic memory.  He could remember sports statistics going back forever.  He was an unbelievable guy.  Well, and he, and all, whenever he'd study for an exam, he'd simply pull out his book the night before and read it (laughter), and then he'd make an A.  He made all A's.  Well, Peter Shatodd, well, they were an interesting contrast because at Morehouse, there were two students who had perfect records.  That was Peter Shatodd and James Till.  Till only studied the night before an exam.  Peter Shatodd always, every day would come to class with a little, his eyes were just a little slither, you know, he was sleepy, tired from study.  But both of them made all As, and I used to always, when I counsel young men and women, remind them that it's not important how he got there, but both got there, you know, and with outstanding careers and records, you know.  So I always, they were quite an inspiration.  And, of course, Maynard Jackson is, you know, spiritually a great inspiration.  Even as a student, he was, there was something special about him.  You know, he had an air that would suggest that he would someday be a leader, but not a great scholar, but a good leader of people.  And there were other students who, you know, became physicians and dentists and I remember, what?  Oh, one school superintendent, that was Edmond Gedridge (ph.) from Houston, Texas, Bobby English was recognized as an outstanding teacher in the Houston, I guess, I mean in the high school system.  Let me think, I'm trying to remember some other people.  But there are others who, James Bacon, I think was a dentist.  Oh, Chuck Walton was a congressman in Indiana, you know, I mean a state congressman in Indiana.  Let me think, but in any event, those were just some of the, some of the people who were part of that program.  There were some, they also had some people who were like, what, sort of mentors to us who were, you know, well, well, all the students in this program were admitted between the ages of fifteen and sixteen and a half.  And so they had some, you know, older, good students who they would try to pair with us.  We lived in a separate dormitory together.  And I remember Aaron Jackson.  He was head of urology at Howard, Bob--what was Bob's last name (laughter), was head of cardiology at Howard.  Now, I can't remember his name.  I don't know why that's slipping me.  Bob, what's Bob's last name?  Can't remember it right, now, but the point is, you know, it was a remarkable class in terms of, you know, the achievement statistics, really fantastic.
Story_ID: 626334
Speaker 1: So how long was the program [Ford Foundation Early Education Program] supposed to last?  Was it just for a year or?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was--well, the full scholarship was two years.  And, of course, personally, my ambition was to become an engineer.  And so I, you know, went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] for two years which I thought would be better preparation for my subsequent studies of engineering than, you know, just staying in high school because we, you know, we were following a regular college curriculum, but without having the last two years of high school.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, so when the, at the end of the two years, did you have the option to stay at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I could have stayed there.  Yeah, I could have stayed at Morehouse.  No, but I, but I--let me see.  I'm trying to remember.  I don't know if it was, I can't remember whether we would have had a full scholarship at that point or not.  But the point is that, you know, my inspiration was to become an engineer.  Well, I felt Morehouse was really a great, you know, experience for students.  It's a, it's a wonderful, wonderful institution to say the least.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, Benjamin Mays [president of Morehouse College from 1940 to 1967] was outstanding, academically.  We had to go to chapel every day (laughter) and learn the Ten Commandments over and over again (laughter), at one level or another.  And, but you met a lot of different, you know, got exposed to a lot of different people through the daily chapel, 'cause one was Chief Akins.  He was a developer in Atlanta, you know, was, back in those days, I guess you wouldn't typically think of a black developer.  But he developed the--I can't, what was the name of that community?  Holmes something community there--oh, Walahaugie (ph.) Apartments.  That was one of his developments, and he really was quite a successful man. Every now and then he would light a hundred dollar bill and give it to the president (laughter) or something like that.  But that's somewhat of an exaggeration, but he was a friend of Morehouse, and he contributed a lot to the school over, you know, over his life.
Story_ID: 626335
Speaker 1: You wanted to major in engineering or physics?
Speaker 2: Engineering.
Speaker 1: Engineering, right.
Speaker 2: So that's why I transferred to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], yeah.  And Howard was one of the few historically black colleges offering engineering programs at that time.  That, those were, what, Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] Howard [University], Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], Tus--did I say Tuskegee, Howard, Hampton, Tennessee State, Southern [University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Prairie View [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Prairie View, Texas] offered engineering at that time, if I remember correctly.  Well, roughly, you know.  So, but, you know, like I said, I always wanted to be an engineering major.
Story_ID: 626336
Speaker 1: And, of course, it [going to Howard University for his bachelor's degree] also gave me a second chance because once I enrolled at Howard, I, you know, ninety-nine percent of my grades were As whereas when I was at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], it was sort of a mix of grades.  I mean I was an honor student, but not at that level.
Speaker 2: So you think Morehouse was tougher than Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 1: No, no, it was different.  Well, you know, at Howard I was taking courses I really loved, and I wanted to be successful in.  Actually, I'll be honest with you.  I never, as a student, enjoyed the liberal arts courses as much as I enjoyed engineering courses.  So I would sometimes be a little negligent with respect to the liberal arts courses.  And, but once I got to Howard, I was largely taking engineering courses, a few other courses, which, like economics and what else?  No history, I forgot what else I took.  But I'm talking about in terms of liberal arts courses and, you know, I was taking statics and dynamics and thermodynamics and all those courses I loved.  So I really, you know, ate those alive.  So, I did much better as a student at Howard than at, at, than at Morehouse.  Then I went to graduate work at Carnegie [Institute of Technology] and did well as a--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't wanna get you out of Howard yet.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Let's ask about, like, who was at Howard?  Who were your teachers and your mentors at Howard and--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, well, let me go back and say that, you know, at Morehouse, you know, there's no question that Benjamin Mays [president of Morehouse College from 1940 to 1967] was an inspiration, to say the least.  And (laughter), now, I'm embarrassed, I actually looked up the guy's name who taught chemistry.  But there was a principle I learned through my experience there.  We had, all of the four students had protested--oh, McBay, McBay.  He's the chemistry teacher--
Speaker 2: Henry, Henry McBay.
Speaker 1: Henry McBay, right.  And he was the chemistry teacher, and of course, we were all protesting, you know, how rigid he was and how difficult basic chemistry was and general chemistry was.  And so, you know, we carried that protest to the President Mays.  President Mays called us together for a tea one Sunday afternoon and, you know, reminded us that he had great confidence in McBay and that, you know, that he didn't plan to compromise, that the challenge was on our shoulders to be successful in that class.  So, you know stuck by his professor and we all benefited because I think may 99 percent of the kids ultimately passed the class, maybe not at the level we wanted to pass it, but, you know, we got through the class without it because McBay was threatening to flunk all of us.  But, you know, May reassured us that he had confidence in the professor, and he assured us that we could do the job, which we did (laughter).  And it, you know, so we all benefited spiritually from that.  And it was a principle, you know, I think I, in my career, carried over in many cases that I had to arbitrate involving faculty, students and standards and that kind of thing, you know.  So, it was a, it was very beneficial, that particular experience, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  You asked something about how--well, I did, my mentors as Howard, I guess would include a gentleman named Steve Davis who succeeded [Lewis] Downing who had been a dean for thirty-four years.  And Davis became dean for a brief period of time, but unfortunately, that was a, you know, right at the beginning of student unrest.  So eventually, he, you know, lost the position, largely out of the climate that existed at that time more so than, you know, competence and dedication.
Speaker 2: The climate in what year--
Speaker 1: That was around sixty--he became dean in '64 [1964], if I remember correctly.  But he only, you know, he only remained dean for a few years till Cheek [James Cheek] came as president in '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 626337
Speaker 1: Yeah, Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia], we were talking about some of your inspirations at Howard.  What were your teachers and--
Speaker 2: Okay, well, like I said, Steve Davis was one of my teachers at Howard [University] who I thought was, you know, he, he was interested in perpetuating an engineering program at Howard, so, you know, since I had done well academically, he was always trying to encourage me to consider, you know, getting an advance degree and, you know, a teaching career at Howard, which I ultimately did.  He, so he was very, very good at that.  He was an interesting chap.  I guess he'd gotten his bachelor's degree at Howard and then his master's degree in engineering at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  At that time, you know, the highest degree required for an engineering education was a master's degree.  But, now, you know, it changed.  It was changing fast at the time he became dean.  He, he was, you know, a person that really had the institution at heart and wanted to see us, you know, carry forward.  He felt it was a lot of work to be done, you know, in terms of providing young black men and women an opportunity for higher education.  And so they used to joke that we were integrated faster than we were integrating (laughter).  And so he wanted to accelerate the integrating part, you know, in terms of having available qualified people in the engineering profession.  Yeah, he was certainly a proponent of that.  Well, Dean [Lewis] Downing as well, but Dean Downing was kind of a quiet gentleman, whereas Steve Davis would throw his chalk at you to remind you that he had, that his thoughts were serious (laughter).  And then subsequent to Davis, there was a guy, well, I'll show the article on 'Consulting Engineering', and that was Lee Jay Purnell.  And Lee was very influential only in the sense of, you know, giving me some concept of what the engineering practice was all about.  And he, he said he only worked at Howard to pay his income taxes.  He had a yacht while he was on the faculty at Howard.  So he was pretty successful as a businessman, and, you know, engineering designer.  And so that, you know, sort of set a, gave me some perception about what being a good engineer involved and that it could be beneficial, not that I was ever particularly, you know, I mean that was not my highest priority, but he, he showed the world that you could do it, in spite of a lot of obstacles that we faced.  And then following, actually, before I became dean a young man came to Howard University.  His name was Percy Pierre [also a HistoryMaker].  He's a black Ph.D. from, from, I think he got his degree from [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], if I remember correctly; slightly younger than I was.  He came to interview to be the chairman of the department of electrical engineering.  When he heard the deanship was available, he went straight to the president and said, I want to be dean (laughter).  And I happen to have been the chairman of the search committee.  And, you know, we finally settled on him after a lot of [deliberation].
Story_ID: 626338
Speaker 1: [Percy] Pierre [also a HistoryMaker] was a bold young man, and he, you know, in his, well, he was at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], he was dean [of the engineering college] from, I think '71 [1971] to '77 [1977] when I became acting dean.  But the point is, Pierre was, he was a very bold and courageous person, I'd say.  He always, you know, put his head right in the lion's mouth.  And so, you know, he gave me some sense of, you know, standing to what you believed in, you know, that maybe I, in my shyness didn't have.  But he was very, very good in that regard.
Story_ID: 626339
Speaker 1: So as a student at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], you finished at Howard in '54 [1954]--
Speaker 2: '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: '54 [1954]?
Speaker 2: '57 [1957]?
Speaker 1: '57 [1957], okay.
Speaker 2: I started Howard in '54 [1954], and I finished at Howard  in '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, finished in '57 [1957].  Okay, and you graduated, you were the first summa cum laude graduate--
Speaker 2: In the history of the school.  The school was founded around 1911, I mean the first from any of the engineering programs.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so you had a 3.8 grade point average?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was 3.86, something like that.
Speaker 1: The highest ever recorded in the annals of the school.
Speaker 2: Right, at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You were president of the Howard Student Council too?
Speaker 2: Council, right, right.
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't, I thought you were shy?  Now, this is--
Speaker 2: Well, I was, but I'm not shy to the (laughter) point that's not, being, wanting to be somebody, wanting to be, you know.  There's a difference between shyness and what your aspirations and involvements are.
Speaker 1: Okay, so student council president, now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was Student Council President, vice president of Tau Beta Pi, National Engineering honorary.  I was active in ASME [American Society of Mechanical Engineers], student chapter of Mechanical Engineering.
Speaker 1: And you were president of that, it says here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Speaker 2: Engineering, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you were pretty popular at Howard, I would guess, on some level.  You were the president of the Student--
Speaker 2: Council, right.
Speaker 1: Student Council.  What were some of the issues the students were dealing with in those days?  Were there any--in '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Interesting enough, having good parties (laughter) and good celebrations.  So I, at the time, I started something called 'Jazz and Technology', and, you know, a variety of programs.  At that time, that's when the Student Council budget started growing a little bit.  And so we had some, you know, that gave us some dimension that had not existed during prior year.  So we had the, ENA [Education Networks of America] picnic.  We did a lot of things that, you know, tended to bring the students together in a big social setting.  And, you know, it was valuable for the school's morale 'cause engineering was a pretty rigid program to study, to say the least.
Story_ID: 626340
Speaker 1: So, now, you went on to Carnegie--
Speaker 2: Mellon University.
Speaker 1: --Institute, which--
Speaker 2: Carnegie Institute of Technology, which is now Carnegie Mellon.
Speaker 1: It's now Carnegie Mellon, right, in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now, how did you arrange that?
Speaker 2: Well, I just applied for a graduate study there, you know, master's degree, so that's what I, you know, after I earned my bachelor's [degree] at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  And I, oh, well, what excited me about Carnegie [Institute of Technology] was the so-called 'Carnegie Plan of Study', which was highlighted in a guy's book, Dennis (unclear) Wood Plank 'Engineering Analysis' book had in the appendix sort of an outline of the Carnegie philosophy for education.  And that really, that--when I say philosophy, engineering education, and that really appealed to me.  And I was, and basically, you know, it's just structured program, I mean problem solving in a way that I thought made a lot of sense.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a scholarship to Carnegie?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I had a scholarship, right.  I had to, you know--
Speaker 1: Was it recommended by one of your professors as a better place to go to get your master's degree?
Speaker 2: No, I think Carnegie was more of my own choosing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you kind of knew they were a good school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, someone at Howard was using this book called 'Engineering Analysis', that had this plan in the back.  When I read that plan, it just excited me from an intellectual point of view, so I chose to go there and get the benefits of, you know, that educational model.
Speaker 1: The plan is the 'Carnegie Guide for Study', you were talking about, yeah, is that what?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought it was called the 'Carnegie Plan' at the time, but maybe I'm not sure.  It's--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, go on.  You were talking about the plan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, what I'm saying it's basically, sort of a methodology for problem solving that seemed appealing.  It also highlighted interdisciplinary studies as being important, and, you know.  In fact, you know, that began to open up my vision about why liberal arts was important, which I really never had before then.  I was strictly a techie, you know, and I began to see that, hey, all these disciplines come together at one point or another.  And it's something that we should have all understood earlier.  We wouldn't have some of the, you know, the unfortunate byproducts of technology that we have, you know, if we would, been a little more careful early on and listened to one another across disciplines, at least I feel that way (laughter), you know.  And some of that was unleashed, you know, by my exposure to the so-called 'Carnegie Plan'.  Carnegie was working strongly.  They had a, they eventually developed a program in engineering and public policy.  They eventually had a School of Urban and Public Affairs and had their School of Industrial Administration, which all became well recognized.  But they also had an outstanding School of Fine Arts.  A lot of major actresses and actors come out of that school and musicians.  And so it was exciting that, you know, they should have been, you know, as effective as they are in these different disciplines.  In fact, I'm trying to think of.  Oh, (laughter), I was gonna tell you an interesting story.  My, my, my cousin-in-law, Andrew Cocking stayed at my house--this was after I was dean at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  And he, you know, somehow thought of me as, you know, somewhat of a role model.  And so when he finally earned his bachelor's degree in engineering for civil, in civil engineering at Howard, which he really had to work very hard to do, much harder than I ever had to work, but the point is he, you know, elected to go to Carnegie where he got a degree in Urban and Public Affairs.  Now, he's a, what, well, he was originally from Jamaica, and he's the president of, I think it's Merchants Limited Bank [Capital and Credit Merchant Bank Limited], something like that in Jamaica.  You can look up his name, Andrew Cocking, on the web, and it'll tell you more of the details.  And he just now, I'm hoping some day he'll express himself by contribution to the university because I think he, in U.S. dollars is worth maybe fifteen million at this time, which is not bad.  So, but the point is that it was, you know, I mean he had some vision of what was available at Carnegie.  He studied Urban and Public Policy and benefited immensely from it, you know, 'cause without that additional background, he probably would have had trouble, you know, realizing the position that he now has.
Story_ID: 626341
Speaker 1: Okay, at Carnegie Mellon, your thesis was about 'Viscous Dispersion in Waterhammer', right?
Speaker 2: Well, that was for my master's degree [at Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], yes.
Speaker 1: Right, that's what I mean, yeah, your thesis.
Speaker 2: Okay, right, okay.
Speaker 1: Right, but you got your master's first and then later on--
Speaker 2: Ph.D., right.
Speaker 1: PhD, so what was that about?  Can you explain the science of that for us, for laymen?
Speaker 2: Well, when you turn the water off, if you hear the pipes bang, you now, bang (laughter), then you, then you've created a waterhammer situation.  Water is flowing in the pipe and you suddenly shut it off, very often there's an interaction between the pipe and the fluid and it gives you a loud sound which represents a high stress and could result in, you know, failure of the, the piping system.  So, but it also is, you know, a terrible sound that you don't wanna hear.  So that's why it was an important thing scientifically to study at that time.  Also, the tools became available, well, we were, for looking at it because that was when the IBM 650 had just, you know, come on board at the institution.  And we were using that to solve, you know, complex numerical analysis problems.
Speaker 1: So this is like a big, you know, mainframe computer, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, (laughter) 650 was actually fairly small mainframe, by the subsequent standards, but now, you know, hey, my phone is a computer that's more powerful than the 650 was at that time.  So the technology has changed dramatically in terms of what you can do, you know, in terms of physical size.
Speaker 1: This is 19--we're talking about 1960?
Speaker 2: No, well, we're talking about '57 [1957], '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when I got, I got my master's degree in '58 [1958].
Story_ID: 626342
Speaker 1: So, now, did you get married during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Well, '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: I met her at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].  Interestingly enough, there was a physician who had several daughters and nieces and aunts that were staying at his house over in northeast Washington.  So in order to, to provide an opportunity for them to meet--I hate to say young men, she used to, he used to have these parties on Friday night.  And somehow he'd, the family had befriended my wife who was originally from Jamaica.  And so, you know, it was at these gatherings that I met her.  I was actually on the faculty of Howard which would have been somewhat unacceptable at the time 'cause that was in 1957--'58 [1958], '59 [1959] that I came to know her.  And we were married in '61 [1961].
Story_ID: 626343
Speaker 1: So after you got your master's degree, you were, you taught here at, you were hired as an assistant professor at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you were still at that time, I guess, working on--were you still working on your Ph.D. at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I just started, I didn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no, no.  I came back to Howard to teach for a year.  And everyone strongly encouraged me to earn a Ph.D. because that was gonna be the (unclear) degree for higher education, full participation in higher education as time went by.  So they encouraged me to go back to graduate school, so I stayed at Howard as assistant professor from '58 [1958], but I was an instructor from '57 [1957], I mean '58 [1958] to '59 [1959].  And then I went back to Carnegie [Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] to work on my Ph.D. degree.
Story_ID: 626344
Speaker 1: And at that time, I was working on the--, in terms of research, I was studying centrifugally powered thrust bearings, yeah, thrust, air bearings.  And that application in high, you know, in computers 'cause you had these very high-speed disks in computers, and the whole idea would be to, you know, maybe maintain a 10,000th of an inch clearance without literally pumping air between the surfaces but just a lot of centrifugal force to pull the air through the clearance.  And so that's what I was studying mathematically, was the optimal configuration for doing that.  And, but I was, I mean I don't know whether the computers use, whether they use it or not.  It was just a theoretical study.  IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] may have used it or computer companies may have used it and they may not have used it.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, but, now, who were your advisors at Carnegie Mellon.
Speaker 1: Carnegie, a fellow named Bob Hornbeck who sadly died at a very young age, and Dr. Fletcher Osterle who was, had just returned to Carnegie [Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] from Delft University in Holland and actually, it was another professor, Will Rullo(ph.) who was also active in terms of, you know, being my advisor.
Speaker 2: Okay. Alright. So when you finished [earning his Ph.D. degree at Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in '66 [1966], you came back to Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] as an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, actually, I came back in '63 [1963], and then I actually taught for three years.  And before I earned my Ph.D. degree, I had the brilliant notion that I was real anxious to learn more about computers and the application of engineering problem solving.  So while my Ph.D. advisor, Dr. Osterle, had encouraged me to write up my Ph.D. thesis, I wanted to do another problem that was gonna shake the world (laughter).  That was the numerical analysis of laminar compressive fo--compressed--laminar compressive flow in the intra-freezing of a pipe.  Now, that's a very fundamental problem, I guess first done analytically by (unclear) for incompressible fluids.  But for compressible fluids, it hadn't been done before.  So I thought that that would, you know, be something special, but also give me more opportunities to learn about the application of computers, you know, to the solution of fluid mechanical, fluid mechanics problems.  So that's how it was that I essentially wrote a second Ph.D. thesis.  And, again, it was also not world-shaking, but, you know, I think made a small contribution to knowledge, you know what I'm saying.  So, I, I enjoyed doing it, and I think I, you know, I benefited over my life in terms of understanding, you know, the role of computers and the capacity of computers, the application of computers to problem solving.
Story_ID: 626345
Speaker 1: Now, were your duties at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] primarily teaching or did you have time to do research?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, it was not a lot of research being done at Howard in the School of Engineering.  I was doing some by way of a few projects that I got involved in as well as, you know, spending time with corporations, I think it's '69 [1969].  And so I spent time with International Research and Technology Corporation where, which was a research organ at, think tank, looking at civilian types of problems, transportation in particular.  And so I tried to, you know, make up--I mean I knew that being involved in research was critical to being involved in the teaching profession, but I didn't feel that I could realize that in the Howard environment at that time.  That would be different today because today we have a lot of faculty that are, you know, actively engaged in research, whereas at that time, there were very few faculty actively engaged in research.  And we, at the time, you know, we didn't have many Ph.D.s.  I was maybe one of two or three Ph.D.s on the faculty at the time I, you know, resumed teaching at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you primarily had a class, I mean a teaching load basically, you know, that's what you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a teaching load--
Speaker 1: --teaching heavy?
Speaker 2: And some administrative duties here and there.
Story_ID: 626346
Speaker 1: Now, in '71 [1971], you wrote, 'Statistics of Blacks in Engineering'.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And this is--now, what's the significance of this?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, you know, the statistics on blacks in engineering was not well understood.  And so--which was important in terms of designing recruiting activities and, and priorities for, you know, doling out money (laughter).  And so what the statistics made clear--well, let the world understand because sadly, less than a percent of the engineering graduates at the time were, you know, African American or minority graduates.  And it also, you know, I focused also on the question of parity and what was required trying to (unclear) to achieve parity sometime in the future.  And so, you know, I'm talking about as an engineering practitioner, but you're talking about what, maybe five years of college study, plus a thirty-year career, you know.  So that, you know, would create an increase in the engineering manpower pool.  But in any event, using some models, you know, made some forecasts, and sadly, you know, at the rate that we were increasing, at the time, I was quoted by Stanford, what's his name, oh, man?  Stanford G. Smith of General Motors [GM], you know, if we, he said we were on this, if we continued on this lazy trajectory, we wouldn't realize parity maybe till 2035 and 2050, if we, you know--no, 2050 if we didn't increase our representation and 2035 if we increased somewhat.  But in any event, it was more a matter of helping people understand, you know, where we were 'cause a lot of industries were running around like, I used to say digamous (unclear), searching for an honest man.  It was scarce to find, hard to find.  So, that was the point, just, you know, broadening understanding of availability.
Story_ID: 626347
Speaker 1: I was also a member of the Engineering Manpower Commission, so, you know, I had access to a lot of data when it first came out.  And so, you know, I'd always apprise the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] 'cause we formed, was trying to form, we formed something called the Council of Deans of Historically Black Engineering Colleges.  So we also understood our role in producing people, you know, qualified in engineering.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, that, I mean that was what the so-called statistics was, paper was all about.
Story_ID: 626348
Speaker 1: Now, tell us what the significance of this is.  In '73 [1973], you published a 'User Interactive Data Acquisition and Reduction System for the Study of Cardiac Dynamics'.
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter), well, at that time, I was working bio-engineering with the head of physiologist, physiology at Howard, who also was an MD in cardiology.  And so, we were studying, ghee, what?  Well, we were using computers to retrieve data, you know, from intact, awake animals, dogs at that time.  It was something I guess I feel less proud of now, but the point is, well, in the sense of, you know, be humane to animals.  But the point is that, that's what we were doing at the time.  And, you know, I helped the cardiologists, physiologist understand the model, some of the phenomena that was taking place in, you know, in the, in the left ventricular dynamics of animals, dogs in particular.  So, you know, and they were models for humans because, you know, they envisioned in outer space astronauts would have problems, you know, because of the change in environment in terms of, you know, left ventricular behavior.  So they were interested in being able to control left ventricular behavior, you know, using, well, neuro-humeral kind of controls, and that's what this is, well, and I'm very, abstract way.  That's what it was all about.  That was Dr. Ed Hawthorne (ph.) that headed up that program along with William Sandler who was at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Ames [Research Center, California] and headed up their bio-engineering technology work.
Story_ID: 626349
Speaker 1: We were just talking about the paper, 'Science, Technology, I and Black America', and this is another attempt to kind of prod the community to--
Speaker 2: Right, right, well, recognize the importance of science and technology, you know, to our future in American and the world, you know.  So, I mean a lot of young people don't quite see how important it is.  In fact, some of 'em just disregard it except today when they have an opportunity to get one of those iPhones or iPods, they get excited.  But, you know, in terms of the underlying research and development connected with these devices, you know, someone has to, the roles that some people have to play, they don't see it as being important.  In fact, I guess [President Barack] Obama recently called for what, 10,000 new engineering graduates per year.  And actually, I guess, you know, that'd probably be, today, an understatement when you think in terms of, you know, a China population of, what, a billion people or more, who are graduating more engineers than we're graduating.  And so, you know, and technical superiority is important, you know, to the future of this country and to its economics and the economic well being of all people, our people in particular.  So I just, well, so, you know, I share the concern and, in fact, today it's recognized, well, then we were talking about primarily minority engineering graduates.  But now, we're talking about graduates from all, all race and ethnic groups, you know, here in America.  We need, you know, more engineers to, quote "successfully carry our technological future".
Speaker 1: So the whole country's lagging behind other countries.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, the whole country's lagging behind at this point.  But whereas at that time, the issue was more, you know, blacks and women, were lagging behind the, you know, male population in terms of their roles in engineering.  And engineering did represent--it does represent a good economic opportunity for young men and women because of all four-year college graduates, engineers tend to earn the highest starting salaries, so this has some impact on the economic well being of people, you know, employed people.
Speaker 1: Now, I remember seeing several issues of 'Black Collegiate' where the idea of, they pushed the idea of becoming an engineer, black students--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, I was in a number of those articles over time.
Speaker 1: Right, here's a, we have one of the outlines from 1985, where the idea of becoming an engineer was pushed.  And so, so you--I suppose, you say you spent a lot of your time--
Speaker 2: Pushing (laughter) for, especially for minorities and women over the years, no question about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well have things changed?  Are there more black students now in engineering at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] than there were before?
Speaker 2: Well, let me say that the number of students, black students studying engineering has increased, but it's not increased to the extent that we will realize parity any time soon in the, you know, in the workforce of engineers.  But it has generally increased over the, since the national effort to increase minority engineers started in 1973, '72 [1972], '73 [1973], around that time.  You know, it's gone--a lot of money has been invested in this, in seeing some improvement in this regard in the country.  But we still have a ways to go.  Now, I have to admit, I haven't been following the statistics a whole lot lately, but--and that's generally from talking to my friends and colleagues, you know, who are active, you know, the status, is a general status in terms of our representation, yeah.  So, so, and, you know, you think about, I always say the future is now, that's because, hey, when you start talking about professions, you're talking about a lead time of maybe twenty or thirty years to get to the point where you're making, you know, a substantial, technical contribution in the, you know, in the field in which you're working.  Don't misunderstand me.  There are brilliant people like Steve Jobs [former CEO of Apple, Inc.] and who's Microsoft, oh, boy, can't even think.
Speaker 1: Gates.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bill Gates, yeah, who without even an engineering degree have done substantial things.  But when we were talking about the, you know, the mood then, we were talking about a lot more time, you know, to get the full benefits of one's participation.
Story_ID: 626350
Speaker 1: Now, so what have been some of the highlights of your career at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia]?  What would you say they are, if you could pick like three things maybe, as highlights?
Speaker 2: Well, one, I mean I've always enjoyed, you know, working with young men and women and, you know, seeing and I'm hoping, hopefully, opening up their vision, you know, for the future and especially as it relates to engineering opportunities.  And, of course, Howard gave me a platform to pursue that concept and hopefully, I've inspired many people to, you know, be, pursue engineering careers and be successful in their careers as engineers.  Secondly, I guess it would be, and I was real worried back--well, and National Science Foundation [NSF] introduced the idea of engineering education coalitions in the late '80s [1980s], I was concerned that, you know, we'd be a full part of that exercise of--the notion was to renew engineering education and its infrastructure with a special emphasis on increasing, you know, minority and women participating in engineering.  But, but it involved more than just the, the people power issue.  It also involved, you know, curriculum reforms and, and curriculum restructuring.  So, you know, I took the initiative to organize a number of schools under what was titled 'The ECSEL Coalition'.  And so finally, I was successful in bringing these schools together, which included MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I had a (unclear), my son finished MIT.  So that sort of gave me access.  I, City College of New York, University of Washington, Seattle, Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland].  That should be seven schools.  So those were members of our coalition, and we were funded for, you know, fifteen million dollars for five years, over a five-year period to, to carry out these studies.  Subsequently, we were refunded, although I was, you know, so you kind of know when to hold and you know when to fold (laughter).  So I was sort of moving out of engineering education, and my directorship of Excel, and, but we were subsequently refunded for another fifteen million [dollars].  And actually, over the course of the program itself, we were funded maybe a couple extra million [dollars] here and there, you know, during the first five years.  So I felt some pride that, you know, we were able to play some role, and our greatest contribution was, I think, introducing engineering in the beginning years of students' course of study.  And so we had, we had some, that was the Engineering Design 'cause that was our theme, designed across the curriculum broadly conceived was the essence of engineering.  And so, so a lot of schools now, you know, try to introduce students, you know, early on in their academic careers to, you know, doing engineering problems and doing engineering designs.  And the one, the design we had, it was very exciting in the Washington metropolitan area.  It was homeless shelters.  You know, a lot of people sleep in the streets during the coldest month of the year, but the students, you know, came up with some low-budget, low-cost type of shelters that these, you know, people could live in.  And they actually tested them in the streets here and there.  But that has, you know, finally, we understood, you had to be a little careful about that (laughter) because of the liabilities involved in this, you know, in this society that we live in.  But in any event, that was one of the contributions that we made, and then on the other end, well, the other end was, you know, maybe changing people's philosophy about how to teach, you know.  Myself was, you know, more weighted to just the chalk-talk method as opposed to the whole idea of involving students in the teaching learning process, and, which I think, you know, we were fairly effective at different institutions in changing the philosophy, you know, of how to teach.  Well, you've probably heard the Chinese proverb, what is it, "Tell me and I forget, show me and I remember, and involve me, I understand".  That was the concept.  And so that was one of those things that we got across.  And then the last thing was, you know, just to make all participating schools more conscious of the need to increase minority and women as engineering graduates.  So those were the three by-products of the effort and, you know, one thing I came to understand was that when you talk about social change, you're talking about a big investment and a lot, lot in terms of, in terms of money and time, wow.  It's unbelievably costly to realize social change, but, but, you know, I think all of our schools benefited from the program.  And there's some evidence, because like I said, it was funded for an additional ten or, ten years or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What else?  Well, those were a couple of the major things that I was involved in, that I feel excited about the outcome.  I guess that was the largest quote "program" that I, you know, had any role in developing.
Story_ID: 626351
Speaker 1: Now, one thing we discussed before we started was a car that was one of the projects in the engineering department that you discussed--there're probably others too, but tell us about this car and the cooperation between the engineering department--
Speaker 2: Oh, right, right--
Speaker 1: --and the liberal arts department?
Speaker 2: Right, okay.  There's a solar car competition that schools participate in across the nation.  And we at least tried to develop an entry for the, I forget which year it was, '94 [1992], '92 [1992], but in any event, the whole idea was to bring together people from various disciplines, you know, to develop--design and develop and produce a car.  And we had a team of students that involved the art program at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], the business program at Howard, and, you know, engineering majors, electrical, mechanical, civil, chemical majors.  And so they worked together for several years to develop the solar-powered car.  The distance the car would travel was like 1,500 miles, and, you know, exclusively powered by the sun.  And so while we were not totally successful, we were in the sense that we were working with a sculpture major, who came out with truly a beautiful design.  It's, I think highlighted in one of those documents.  And, you know, we did power up the vehicle, used it a couple of times in the, you now, like in the homecoming parade at Howard.  So people said, ooh, (laughter), kind of amazed at this very attractive and it's developed from the School of Engineering.  But unfortunately, we never really got it to the point where we could participate in the national competition.  In fact, there's a movie called 'Race to the Sun' that highlights the competition that, well, 'cause there's a world level competition which is held normally down in Australia, and so, but in any event, we were in that game for a while.  And it was always fun working on such engineering interdisciplinary projects.  And we, but the principle, we continued through a course known as the Engineering Capstone Design Courses at Howard where, you know, people from different disciplines contribute, you know, to some design project.  And, of course, I personally have always enjoyed being involved in such projects.  The first entry along those lines was back in 1972 when we participated in a so-called "urban vehicle" competition.  We converted a, a, what was it?  About a 1965 Renault Dauphine to run off of compressed natural gas.  We also developed one of the early five-mile per hour bumpers, you know.  That was part of the project.  Ironically, our bumper functioned properly, it protected the car, except that, believe it or not, when we mounted a tag, there was a screw, and the screw wasn't cut off like it should have been, and it nicked the car body.  The insurance adjusters charged us five hundred dollars for that.  And so we did, you know, while we focused on that aspect of the design to win something, (laughter) we didn't because of that nick in the car body, which was maybe, you know, a little hump like that.  And they charged us 500 bucks.  And so that did not give us a perfect result (laughter).  But I think the underlying principle was even the one that's used in, you know, collapsible bumper design today, a little combination of elastic defamation and plastic defamation and friction that, you know, where the energy is absorbed.  And so, you know, we'd like to think we were pioneers in some advancements in the bumper design of the world, but, you know, nobody specifically credited us with it.  But I was just trying to help you understand how it was evaluated.  The insurance costs of having an accident was, you know, which determined where you stood in the final results.
Story_ID: 626352
Speaker 1: You retired in 2002, right?
Speaker 2: 2002, right.
Speaker 1: 2002, okay.
Speaker 2: So, but I don't--for several years continued to work with the Capstone Design course at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] as well as with young men and women on specific, you know, engineering and science projects.  I worked a little while with the team at Banneker on the iRobot competition.  And, you know, so we developed a robot for that competition, and, you know, provided them with access to a lot of Howard resources that enabled them to, you know, be active in that program.  And then I worked with some individual students, tutoring them and, in fact, I was very proud of the basketball player from, what's the name of that Catholic school, not (unclear) [Galudent], Catholic school down by the railroad station.  I can't remember the name, but in any event, I, it was a basketball player that was having problems with his, you know, doing a project for physics, which involved a truck that was to travel a certain distance and drop its payload, you know, into a, into a hole, and then come back.  So, you know, we discussed it and worked on that for a long time.  And I was proud because he made 100 when the count, when, you know, on his project and did a success--you know, did a, I think he got an A in his class.  But he, he was pretty excited about that, you know, and he wasn't, you know, he had not historically been someone that enjoyed science projects.  I don't know what he finally did when he went to college.  I'm sure he probably tried to shoot the basketball successfully (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --which makes a lot of sense, in a strange way in today's world.
Story_ID: 626353
Speaker 1: Now, it says here that in 2004, the percentage of black college graduates majoring in engineering fields increased from two percent to more than 12 percent in, well, but in thirty years though.  It took thirty years to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thirty years, right, right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so 12 percent of the graduates is pretty much, you know, the population of, for black folks--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for that year, but I'm not sure whether that's, whether that exceeded year after year or it's--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.  That was for 2004.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you've got to exceed the parity for more than, for several years in order to achieve it in the profession itself.
Speaker 1: You're right about that.  In 2008, you received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Howard University.  Now, you're an alumnus, and you also taught here for forty-four years?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that was the crescendo for my career.  I was very, feel very honored to have received that award.  That was, you know, essentially the highest award you can get at Howard, other than an honorary degree, which you're--it was--
Speaker 1: Our founder--
Speaker 2: Julia, yeah, your founder received that--
Speaker 1: Julieanna Richardson received--
Speaker 2: Julieanna Richardson, right, received that this year.
Speaker 1: --Honorary Doctorate this year.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Right, as we speak (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know, someone, for an alumni, normally, that is not an award, but the Charter Day Award is quite a celebration, about 2,000 people over at the Washington [District of Columbia] Hilton Hotel.  So it gives you an idea of the scope of the program.  So I was truly honored to have received that award, as well as the NACME [National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering] Award too, the NACME Award which is $10,000, but not to me, but to the charity of my choice.  That was, I forgot what year that was given.
Speaker 1: Now, NACME is the National Association of--
Speaker 2: National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering.
Story_ID: 626354
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done, in your career, I mean what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, hopefully, inspiring a lot of young men and women to pursue engineering careers, period (laughter).  You know, that would--and at a high standard.  I mean, I, you know, and, you know, and I take, as I say, great pride in the fact that a lot of Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] students, and they're not all under my tenure as dean, but have done extremely well by way of earning engineering degrees.  I mean, for example, Togo West, who was the Secretary of the Army.  Now, he was actually in school when I was, you know, earning my PhD degree, but he, you know, was Secretary of the Army.  You have Carolyn Myers, who's now president, has been president of Norfolk State University [Norfolk, Virginia] and now president of Jackson State University, which is a very large school in Mississippi, Jackson, Mississippi.  You have, these are people who also I might mention.  Togo [West] is an electrical engineering graduate.  Carolyn Myers, Dr. Myers is a, is a mechanical engineering graduate who re-entered the work force after, you know, having three children, and, you know, earned her Ph.D. at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], and, you know, joined higher education.  But, [cough] excuse me, so, you know, has become a university president twice.  What's his name, Cheick [Modibo] Diarra, he's now the prime minister of Mali.  And he was the president of Microsoft, Africa.  We have Oscar Barton right over here at the Naval Academy who's head of mechanical engineering, was a Ph.D. Howard graduate.
Speaker 1: Oscar--
Speaker 2: Barton, yeah.
Speaker 1: Barton, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he was, he actually, his first degree was from Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], but he got his Ph.D. at Howard and now head of the mechanical engineering department at the Naval Academy.  People like Charles Watkins who was dean for years at the City College of New York.  Jim Johnson, who succeeded me as dean and now is director of EPA's [Environmental Protection Agency] Extra Bureau Program, research programs.  And ironically, his predecessor lives down the street from me.  Jim is also from Annapolis [Maryland].  I guess you're gonna see him this afternoon.
Speaker 1: Johnson, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  And, well, it was just a few people.  There are certainly others.  There's a four-star general too, was an engineering graduate.  And E.D. Robinson, who is a multi-millionaire Wall Street investment banker is a product of our electrical engineering program.  We've had vice president of Exxon-Mobile [Corporation], in fact, was the president of the fuels program for a long time, but now is, I think, vice president for research and development at Exxon-Mobile, right over here in Virginia.  We've got the McKissic twins who've done very well in pretty substantial engineering operations both here and New York City.  Their father was the president of, was the first black architectural firm out of Nashville, Tennessee that did a lot of work around the country.  And subsequently, they've taken over.  Now, they have offices in many different cities.  And then, of course, I mentioned earlier, Andrew Cocking, who's president of Merchants Limited Bank [Capital and Credit Merchant Bank Limited].  The list is, well, I can think of a lot of other people.  My memory is getting a little slow at this point (laughter), but, but a lot of people that we can be proud of who've held positions that, you know, you wouldn't have imagined engineering graduates holding as well as people who hold positions that you expect engineering graduates to hold.  But it's quite a large number.
Speaker 1: So you think the discipline and the, the kind of training--
Speaker 2: Training.
Speaker 1: --training you get as an engineer--
Speaker 2: Yes, has opened up some career opportunities that they may not have otherwise had.  I'm not sure.  I don't wanna say that absolutely, but, but I mean, you know, you'd be--most people would be surprised to learn that Carolyn Myers, a mechanical engineering graduate of Howard is president of Jackson State University and was president of Norfolk State University.  And she's done a wonderful job at both of these institutions from what I gather.  She's, well, she was one of--I would consider her to be one of my wards at Howard over the years, you know.  She was very, very keen, and, you know, you just felt that she had the potential for, you know, achieving a leadership role.  Oh, there's one other, ghee whiz.  She's a vice president at Procter and Gamble, was it Procter Gamble, Procter and Gamble.
Speaker 1: In Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Cincinnati.  What is her name?  I know her so well.  I'm thinking about, I can't draw her name right now.  But she's done extremely well.  But the list is a very, very long one.  I just, you know, my memory is very short, but the list is long (laughter), and, but those are some people who've done some things you may or may not have expected them to do--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as engineering graduates, yeah.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, when I used to do outreach in some of the public schools in Washington [District of Columbia] metropolitan area, I visited, Terrell Junior High School was one of the schools that we had a close relationship with at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And so when I asked one of the teachers what he foresaw or what did he see as a major problem, he said that half of the students in my class don't know where they're gonna eat this evening.  And half of them don't know where they're gonna sleep.  And so I think that's a, remains a problem that we need to overcome.  It's also the concept of black community, you know, if you're asking the question out of context, because, you know, there's a lot of pockets of poverty in isolation that exists in some ways different from times past where we had the unifying notion of, you know, racism and discrimination and what have you.  And every often these pockets develop sort of their own culture and, and value system that in all cases is not particularly healthy.  And even in Annapolis [Maryland], I would say we have about five or six project-type communities that are unhealthy clusters of people.  Somehow we've gotta somehow break that cycle and condition, and I don't know how we're gonna do it, but it's one that we need to give a lot of thought to, I know that because while, you know, we see so many people being successful today, there's another group that just doesn't--I mean, in other words, it's not growing and advancing at the rate that we, we need in order to, you know, wholesomely participate in the future of America.  So I am, those are the, you know, kind of two things that I personally feel quite concerned about.
Story_ID: 626356
Speaker 1: Okay, sir, when you look back on everything you've done to this time and, again, I mean is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: No, I've been blessed in many ways, and, you know, fortunate to, have enjoyed a good career at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], you know, an opportunity-laden career, a main career, you know, in the sense that we've been working with young people for a long time.  I'm not sure what I would do differently.  I probably, I'm sure there's some things I would do differently, but by and large, I feel, you know, that, you know, I've had some achievements and some things that, you know, most things I'm fairly proud of that I've been involved in over my life, and, and feel blessed to have because it's not all, you know, a matter of my own choice.  It's, hey, chance plays some role in where you are at this point in time.  So, I'm thankful for, you know, God's blessings in that regard.
Story_ID: 626357
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your family.  Now, you have children, grandchildren and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the sad part is my wife and I are separated.  She's a dentist in the Virgin Islands, and she's a, been a successful person.  I talk with her periodically.  We still communicate, but we're not officially, quote "divorced".  She's a, she was a director of dental services for the U.S. Virgin Islands.  And we have two children, Monique, who you see with her twin daughters, Violet and Lilly, here today.  Fortunately, they came to visit me not long ago, and I hope they will stay with me for a while.  And my daughter is a freelance writer.  And my son is a--she also has another daughter who's in New York.  She's an assistant producer in New York and seems to be progressing well in that very challenging field.  My son is a MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate, and a--that's an engineering graduate from MIT and a Stanford engineering master's degree recipient and a law degree recipient from Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  And now he's serving senior vice president at Disney Interactive Media Graphics.  He previously had been vice president for, for Yahoo News.  In fact, he was instrumental in developing Yahoo News as a program.  And so he's been doing fairly well most of his career.  He started out, his address when he first finished law school was No. 1 Wall Street.  He was working at Hughes, Hubbard and Reed (laughter).  So, he's had a, a good career, good career, good, a lot of success, you know, at least in fiscal and professional terms.  And he has three children, two--one set of twins who are nineteen, and he has one son who is, in fact, my only grandson, who is now four years old, Adriano (ph.).  So, I'm blessed with six grandchildren, one grandson (laughter).  I would hope that he could have another, but I'm not sure he will.

Speaker 1: Tell me about the history of this area here, Highland Beach [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Highland Beach.
Speaker 1: It's significant, the place we're at right now.
Speaker 2: Oh, right, yeah.  Well, it was a place [cough], sorry, respite from, you know, for the summer months for some fairly affluent blacks in the late 1900s, early twentieth century.  In fact, it was founded in 1893 by Charles Douglass, who's the son of Frederick Douglass [American social reformer].  And, in fact, Douglass built a, was building a house, in fact, the house neighboring my house at the time, but unfortunately, before his construction was completed, he passed.  It's now the Douglass, Frederick Douglass Museum and contains many, you know, artifacts and, from his life and from the community, as well as very often they feature, you know, other blacks who've made special, special contributions.  And so, it's a, as I said, it was founded in 1893, but it became a municipality in 1923 and being a municipality, we have an elected mayor who is William Sanders and several commissioners, and what, you know, we pay taxes to the town, and, you know, responsible for the maintenance and operation of the town, you know, as a--but it only, (laughter), the town only has about 60 or 70 households.  Actually, if you go, the last street to my right is Chesapeake Avenue which is another commun--another community and known as Venice Beach, and it borders on what is known as Oyster Harbor.  And it's only a one-block community (laughter).  On the, you know, on the creek side, on the Oyster creek side or Oyster Harbor side, it has houses tempered with piers and docks and so on.  And then on the other side, it has houses with a nice water view.  And so we collaborate (laughter).  Right now, there's some controversy about some matters, but the point is, you know, generally we tend to collaborate and providing social activities for residents of the beach and their friends and guests.  Every two years we have a major picnic with about six or 700 people from the Washington metropolitan area come to that affair.  And normally, we have a fourth of July parade and, you know, some Christmas celebrations and things that, you know, give us some sense of community.  But the greatest sense of community stems from the fact that, you know, one, it was founded by a Douglass, and two, you know, a lot of distinguished leaders have visited the community over the years and, in fact, a lot even live in the community at this time.  Yeah, so I guess the most distinct person, distinctive person at this time might be, what's his name, Bill Hunter, who is the executive director of MBA.  He only is here though, you know, as a summer home.  He's not here regularly whereas, for example, myself, I stay here most of the year, yeah.  So it's a very exciting and very attractive community.
Speaker 1: And I think it's a little museum in the Frederick Douglass house, right, which is next door to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, there is a--yeah, right, I'm sorry.  I should have emphasized that more, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I just wanted to point that out.  And so this is a historic place, analogous to the Ink Well and Martha's Vineyard and some other--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --black Idlewilds, some other black enclaves around the country.
Story_ID: 626359
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) As a kind, concerned and considerate person (laughter), who's, well, you know, genuine and wants people to do well, to, you know, to prove their status in life.  I mean that's what I'm excited by.  And, you know, I think I've given most of my life to that, quote, "cause".  But in a broad sense, not necessarily in the, you know--I can't even think of the term right now.  But, but that's how I'd like to be remembered, fair and just individual (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, hopefully, a successful parent (laughter).  That's always a challenge.
Story_ID: 626360
Speaker 1: Okay, sir, tell us about this photograph we're looking at here.
Speaker 2: That's contemplation (laughter).
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: Sometimes known as a nap.
Speaker 1: So was that while you were a student?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Were you a student then?
Speaker 2: No, no, that was, I was on the faculty.  That probably was in the early '70s [1970s] or mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: This was at my retirement in 2002.  That's a former dean of engineering, Percy Pierre [also a HistoryMaker], remember I was telling you the person who was significant to my way of seeing life, and Jim Johnson.  This is the gentleman you'll be seeing when you leave here, the fellow on the right.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's two thousand and--
Speaker 1: That's 2002.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's probably, what 1940-what, '42 [1942] or '43 [1943].  That's what I would imagine.  Those were my neighborhood friends.  That's Mildred Lancaster.  That was John Byrd and David Byrd.  That was my mother [Inez Landers].
Speaker 2: In your house or--
Speaker 1: In my house over on 9th Street Northeast, yeah, I'm pretty sure of that.  Yeah, that was a long time ago, wow.
Speaker 2: Okay, can we put it up so we can see it in the camera?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, Larry, you have your pen.  Can you point people.  He was naming people about--which one was your mother?
Speaker 1: That as my mother--.
Speaker 2: Right there, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then that was Mildred Lancaster.  That's myself, I think right here.  That was John and David Byrd there, and now, I can't account for the other two people, yeah.
Story_ID: 626361
Speaker 1: And what was this a picture of, sir?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was the homeless shelter competition.  I was introducing design in the beginning of engineering students curriculum at Howard.  That was one of the so-called "homeless shelters" (laughter) I was using--
Speaker 1: Homeless people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, homeless people for homeless shelters.
Speaker 1: That was me relaxing in Martha's Vineyard with some friends and relatives.  I don't know what year that was.  But--
Speaker 2: That was, oh, that was, I believe at the Charter Day celebration.  That's, by the way, on the far left is Don Coles who's been the provost at Howard, at one point, but used to be my head of the department of systems and computer science.  That was Charles Kidd.  He was president of, of York College up in Queens, New York for a number of years, but also at Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University [FAMU, Tallahassee, Florida].  That's myself, and that's, well, that's Charles, Charles Kidd.  That's the guy who was the president of York College.  Move over, that's me.  Next to me is Clarice Walker, one of your awardees or recognees (ph.) and then George Walker, her husband, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's another homeless shelter.
Speaker 2: That was, oh, that was at my granddaughter's graduation from the University for Peace in--
Speaker 1: No, daddy, that's FAMU.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.  That is, I'm sorry.  I didn't look at that closely.  Yeah, that's when we, when she--now, this is when she graduated though, isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, from FAMU.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, from FAMU.  That was in Jacksonville, Florida, and that plague is on my grandfather's church or what was his church, Simpson Memorial Church.  And those are my granddaughters, twin granddaughters, that you met earlier here.
Speaker 1: And your daughter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And Monique, yeah.  And then--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my sister-in-law and her daughter [who is now a physician].
Story_ID: 626362
Speaker 1: That's my ex-wife, and that was at my son's second wedding.  He's been married three times.
Speaker 2: Second wedding.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was one of my students.  We were working on that plane I was talking about.  I wanna bring that plane out.  I want you to take a picture of it.  (Laughter) I'm proud of my airplane (laughter) and which we, that student and I built together, by the way.  But I just--
Speaker 2: That was the 1972 Urban Vehicle entry.  That was my son and daughter, I think, yeah.  Isn't that you, Minnie.  I think so.  No, this wasn't the solar car.  This was, it was a car, that was a Renault Dauphine we converted to run on natural gas.
Speaker 1: This is a Renault.  I know this is a Renault.
Speaker 2: Renault, yeah, right.  This is the same car.  That was in the back of a U-Haul-It truck.  We were carrying it to Detroit for the competition.
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh, that is me.
Speaker 2: I told you that was you. Sure is.
Speaker 1: All right, so did you talk about this one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's Mark and his first wife.  That's when he graduated from Stanford and earned a law degree.
Speaker 1: And so did she.
Speaker 2: Yeah, both of 'em earned law degrees, right.
Speaker 1: That was a mechanical engineering faculty at a luncheon a few years ago.  I was (unclear).  I still go to lunch with them sometimes.
Speaker 2: Black dog.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, that was a, a couple of my students, in fact, I held a retreat for our alumni organization several years ago at this house--no, yes and no.  I'm trying to--oh, boy, I can't remember her name right now.  I know both of them.  They're faculty, the husband and wife, briefly.  They have a child together.  Maybe they spent too much time at the retreat (laughter).
Speaker 2: That was my son and quote "ex".  I forget what this, oh, that was his second marriage, yeah, second marriage.  That was in Beverly Hills at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California.
Speaker 1: That was the solar car that Pamela Burris was instrumental in designing.
Speaker 2: I remember seeing that on television.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was myself, counseling some young men and women.  Actually, they live in this neighborhood, about engineering and flight.
Speaker 2: That's my family picture for now at least.
Speaker 1: That's your retirement.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm saying.  It was still, that's my son, Mark, my daughter, her daughters and me.
Speaker 1: So that must be Mark's wife?
Speaker 2: No, that's--
Speaker 1: Which one, in the middle.
Speaker 2: --her daughter.  Those three are her daughters.
Speaker 1: And that's me.
Speaker 2: Right, I see you in the middle.  What's her name?
Speaker 1: My big girl, Danielle.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then Violet and Lilly.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, because we need to get the names.
Speaker 1: Well, that was used as a substitute for my chart--pictures of my Charter Day Recognition picture.  Unfortunately, I can't remember that gentleman's name.  He was the vice president of institution advancement at the time.  But that was actually at my fiftieth reunion.  But we used that for the Charter Day (laughter) recognition picture which I couldn't--
Speaker 2: That was also at the 50th reunion.  The reason I'm being given all the plagues is we raised 50, about $120,000 for the occasion.  So they thought they'd picture me a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's my father's grandfather, wife and siblings.  That's my father right here.
Speaker 2: He's the one that moved when the picture was taken.
Speaker 1: You got a blur?
Speaker 2: That's my mother's family and 'Ripley Believe it or Not' grandfather.
Speaker 1: So he's standing in the right?
Speaker 2: Barber right here, and then this was my uncle who was also in physics at Howard with my father.  He actually achieved a lot of, he was in big administrative positions in government.  And that was the pilot. Okay, what are their names?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was, this is Harry-- Horace was the pilot.
Speaker 2: Hold it, this is, Horace is the pilot.  This is John.  And this is also Harry.  This is Harry, Harry, Sr., Horace, John--
Speaker 1: I need to see that camera.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's do that--
Speaker 1: This isn't for us.  This is for people watching.
Speaker 2: I got you.
Speaker 1: So let's start over here.  Who's that?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's John.
Speaker 1: John Landers?
Speaker 2: Yes, John Landers.  That's Gladys Landers.  That's Harry Landers.  That is Horace Landers.  That is Cora Landers, Cora Landers, yes.  That is, oh, Corrine Landers (laughter).  That's a shame.  That's Ora Landers.  That is Harry Landers--
Speaker 1: Harry, Jr.
Speaker 2: Harry, Jr., and that's my mother, Inez Landers.  That's Ora Landers.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the--
Speaker 2: --is Cora Landers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so we got them all.
Speaker 2: It took me a while 'cause I had forgotten, for a while forgot Corrine (laughter).  That's actually Debbie mother.
Speaker 1: Debbie's grandmother.
Speaker 2: Debbie's grandmother, right.
Speaker 1: That's when I pledge fraternity back in the fall of '55' [1955].  That was my pledge line, Kappa Alpha Psi (laughter).  You see me over in the corner.
Speaker 2: Which corner?
Speaker 1: In the left corner, right, this is me right here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's, well, you can get the year off of there.  That was '55' [1955].
Speaker 2: This picture was done, well, it's in here somewhere.  This is a meeting with the Xerox representative in 1980, yeah.  I was with Will Kenney who was a low-level Xerox official back then, one of my--he actually graduated a year after I graduated from Howard.  But he's presenting a $10,000 check.  That always made me happy.
Speaker 1: That was me when I first began my career.  I don't know when that was, probably in the early '60s [1960s].  That's what I suspect 'cause I didn't have a beard then.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the date's on there too.
Speaker 1: This is 1976?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably, it's '76 [1976], right.  Now, what picture was I thinking about?
Speaker 1: We have to cover this because this is interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought it was interesting to cover too, right.
Speaker 1: [Off-camera conversation; photograph of Lucius Walker]
