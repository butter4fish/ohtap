Speaker 1: Did she come from a large family?
Speaker 2: Very large family.  There were thirteen children and raised primarily in the South and, and probably, I think there were four--three boys and the rest girls, three or four boys, and the rest girls.

Speaker 1: Approximately when were they born and where?
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh, I'm not sure I know that.
Speaker 1: The early 1900s?
Speaker 2: I would say--well, let's, let's, let me, let me think about this for a minute.  See, my mom is seventy-four, so yeah, I would, I would say that's probably about right.  And they were born, they, they probably were born in Alabama.
Story_ID: 610699
Speaker 1: Did your mom [Thelma Roberson Arnold] tell you any stories about her childhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and actually, I had an opportunity to see and experience some of her childhood.  I grew up in Seattle, Washington, but my mother would have us go down to Florence, Alabama, which is a small little town down south.  And we would go down there in the summers, and we would take a Greyhound bus down there from Seattle.  And so I got a chance to, to know my grandmother [Callie Roberson] a, a bit before she passed.  And I got a chance to, even as a young child, to see what it was like to live in the, the South, which was very, very different from where I was living in the Pacific Northwest.
Speaker 1: Totally different.  And what, and what did your mom tell you about her childhood?  Did she--I mean was it a tough life?  Did she grow up in a rural area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was fairly rural, and, and there were a lot of kids.  So my grandfather [Robert Roberson (ph.)] had been married before, so I think he had a couple of children before then and, and then my grandmother, and they had, you know, thirteen kids.  And so they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: My, I think my grandfather did, you know, kind of more manual work.  And, and my grandmother took care of--she was more of like a midwife type individual, and, and a lot of people in the town knew her.  And, and she'd been around for a very long time and I think in some way maybe took care of other people's kids and, and primarily not African American kids.  And so she was fairly well known.
Speaker 1: Did your mom ever tell you how her mother developed that skill?
Speaker 2: No.  I can't say that, that, that we really talked much about that.  I--you know, my, my grandmother passed relatively young.  I mean she was early seventies.  You know, she had, had diabetes.  She, she had, had a leg amputated, so she, she had some, some, some challenges.  And, and I probably was a teenager, early teens, you know, maybe even twelve or so around that time.  And so--
Speaker 1: Did your mom tell you any other stories about the Deep South?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--she--we'd--she did tell me a lot of stories of the Deep South, and, and I had an opportunity to witness some of that myself.  I remember a couple of incidents as a, a young child, again, taking the bus down with my two brothers [Dirk Mayberry and Brett Mayberry] down to Florence and stopping at a rest place where there was like a kitchen luncheonette kind of place.  And my mother had given me some money, and, and I had gone to the, to the restroom.  And, and even in, you know, in those days, you know--this was probably early '60s [1960s], you know--there were still colored only signs there, which I'd never seen in, in Seattle.  I didn't really understand that, you know, totally.  But I remember getting finished early from going to the restroom, and, and I decided to go sit up on one of the luncheonettes because my mother had given me a little money.  And I thought maybe I could get something, a soda or something like that.  And I remember my mother coming by and grabbing me with such fierce strength and, and hauling me back to the bus and, and being very upset with me and saying, "Don't ever do that again."  And I didn't know what I had done.  But you know, you weren't allowed to sit at the, those luncheonette counters then.
Speaker 1: So that was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your mom grew up in the, the '30s [1930s], the '40s [1940s], and the '50s [1950s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was it even more extreme for her, did she say?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she--is there a story you can recall?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't, I, I can't tell you, you know, specific stories.  I'm sure she, you know, endured things really every day because, again, they, they--it was a large family, not a lot of money at all, you know, basically living in the, you know, Deep South, you know, Florence, Alabama, very small town, and, you know, not a lot of education.  So, you know, a lot of the things that, that I experienced were probably--pale in comparison to what she experienced every day.  But again, back when she was coming up there, there was just a lot of segregation, so you know, a lot of what they experience, they experienced in their own communities.  They weren't--there wasn't a lot of, you know, in the South especially, there definitely wasn't a lot of integrating of, of your day, day to day lives.  So some of the things she may have not have of experienced directly, because they really didn't go outside their own community.
Story_ID: 610700
Speaker 1: Has she told you about, or perhaps you knew them personally, your great-grandparents on your mother's [Thelma Roberson Arnold] side?
Speaker 2: You now, just very vaguely, you know.  My great-grandmother was still alive for a short time when, when I was a very young child.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about her?  What did she do for a living?  What kind of person?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time that, you know, she was pretty elderly, you know.  And, and the only thing that I remember is that the, the one ritual that, that, that I got to experience with her as a very young child was to watch soap operas with her (laughter), back in--when I was a very young child.  That was, that was a big deal.  You know, she would invite you to sit down and actually watch a, watch a soap opera with her.  And I have one incident that I remember.  One day she had given me some money to go across the street to get some soda.  There was a big--like a grocery story.
Speaker 1: In Alabama?
Speaker 2: In Alabama.  And I remember going over there to get the, the soda.  And I was a--I don't remember what age I was, but I was pretty young.  And I went and picked up what she told me to pick up.  And you know, you know, the rule was you pick it up; you get it; and you get back home.  You, you don't, don't, don't dawdle, okay.  That, that was, that was, you know, a big deal.  And I went over there, and as I was waiting to try to pay and, and, and you know, get back to where I was supposed to be, people walked in front of me; they walked behind me.  It was just I was invisible.  And no one would take my money.  And finally, there was, you know, I, I got very frustrated and started to cry and, and put back what I had, and you know, ran home.  And when I got back, my great-grandmother said to me, you know, "You didn't bring back what you were supposed to."  And I, I was trying to explain to her that, you know, that no one would take my money.  And interesting enough, she understood immediately what had happened.  And she grabbed me up, really, you know, and drug me back across the street.  And I thought I was gonna get the biggest whupping I'd ever got in my life, you know.  And as it turned out, what I, what I found out is that she was very well known in that part of the town.  Well, when she walked in, they treated her very different, you know, and because she was, you know, somewhat, you know, known (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Respected--
Speaker 2: --respected for, for the life that, you know, that she was, that she was in.  And--
Speaker 1: And that was in the '60s [1960s] as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  And, and, and, but she was much older obviously.  And you know, they were basically apologizing and saying well, we didn't realize this was your granddaughter, okay.  And, but that was the only reason that they were gonna treat me differently.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: You would have been the exception to the rule--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --because of her.
Speaker 2: I would have been an exception.  And, and it was, it was, it, it, it--I remember it to this day because I, I remember walking out of there and, and feeling, you know, so empowered, you know, that here she could come and these people wouldn't even, you know, talk to me.  All of a sudden they were talking to me and being very nice and, and the whole bit.  And, and it was a, a lesson that I took with me.
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Story_ID: 610701
Speaker 1: Wanna find out a little bit about your father and his family.  Tell me your father's name.
Speaker 2: Donald Mayberry.
Speaker 1: When was he born and where?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Kansas, and he was born in probably 1930, around 1930.
Speaker 1: What do you know about his family?
Speaker 2: Well, I--my grandfather on my father's side lived 'til he was about in his nineties, and so I, I got to know him quite a bit.  And, and as a young child, we lived in Kansas.  So he was a minister, and--
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Denver Mayberry.
Speaker 1: And he was born around--?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, let's see.  When he--he died when--oh, my gosh--had to be before then, you know, 1900s I would think, I mean, you know, right, 1900, early 1900s (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Around the turn of the century.
Speaker 2: Around the same--yeah, 'cause he's, he lived a long life.
Speaker 1: And he was a minister?
Speaker 2: He was a minister, Baptist minister.
Speaker 1: Well respected?
Speaker 2: Well respected.  He also was a barber, and, and interesting enough, he, he actually had a, a little barbershop in a office building in downtown Wichita [Kansas].  And, and when he had that barbershop, he, you know, got a chance to meet all of the, you know, I guess important people in, at that time.  And he actually cut hair until he was well into his late eighties.  I used to laugh and tell him, you, you know, I'd say, "Boy, I wouldn't let you cut my hair."  But, you know, he was still cutting hair up until his, you know, late eighties.  And he, he really, you know, retired I think.  You know, I don't know exactly the year, but he was well in his eighties when he retired.
Speaker 1: What about your paternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: My dad's parents were divorced, and so my grandmother lived in a, another small town called Coffeyville, Kansas.  And so, and, and her name was Beatrice, and her--Beatrice Keith [Beatrice Jones Keith].  And my--I, I always had three grandfathers, because by the time that I was born my grandmother had remarried to my grandfather, Warren Keith, and they were married for, you know, fifty-something years.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  And his first name is Warren?
Speaker 2: Warren, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And spell the last name.
Speaker 2: K-E-I-T-H, T-H.  So I always had, you know, three grandfathers.  I didn't know my, my maternal grandfather [Robert Roberson (ph.)] that well because he was, he was quite a bit older and died not that, you know, not that long after I became, you know, came into the world.
Speaker 1: What do you know about Beatrice and Warren in terms of their profession and--?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my grandmother was, what I remember, she was pretty much a homemaker.  My grandfather--but she, but she was a seamstress, and she used to make me these beautiful clothes.  I had the, the prettiest little, you know, kids' clothes, you know, I mean the kind that you don't see today, where, you know, it's got lace all around the edges and you know, you know, buttons that are just, you know, meticulous and that kind of thing, and so she used to, to, to sew quite a bit.  I don't remember a profession for her.  But my grandfather, there was a, a--Coffeyville, Kansas, is a very small little town, and he worked at one of the mills.
Speaker 1: Did your father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One of the plants there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did your father have siblings?
Speaker 1: No.  My, my father was an only child.  He had--I think my grandmother ended up having another child who had died as a, a baby, so he was raised as an only child.
Speaker 2: Did he tell you stories about growing up in Kansas?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he, you know, he did.  My, my dad passed at a very young age.  He passed in his early fifties.  And, and so, but he had spent a great deal of time living in Kansas.  And, and, and I think, you know, in a positive way, he, he was a product of a divorced family, but he always had lots of love from both, both areas, 'cause he had a, a stepfather, my, who was my grandfather, who I think became a, a surrogate dad to him, and then he still had his biological father, so.  And Kansas was very different than, than, you know, we spent a, a little time there.  We lived there as, as a young child.  But Kansas was, from the, my memories of it, was fairly segregated.  And so, you know, the blacks lived in one area, and, and whites lived in other areas.  And so there wasn't, I, I would say it wasn't a lot of, of mixing going on there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And was this Wichita?
Speaker 1: Wichita, yeah.  So my dad kind of shuttled between Wichita and, and Coffeyville.  But I think he, he actually spent most of his time in Coffeyville 'cause that's where my grandmother lived.
Story_ID: 610702
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your early childhood.  We got some of the stories about the summer.  But what's your earliest childhood memories?  You said you were born in Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 2: I was born in Seattle, um-hm.  And I was, I'm the middle child, and I have an older brother and a younger brother.  And--
Speaker 1: What are their names?
Speaker 2: My older brother's name is Dirk [Dirk Mayberry], D-I-R-K.  And my younger brother's name is Brett [Brett Mayberry], B-R-E-T-T.  And they--you know, we grew up--again, Seattle probably has about 7 percent of a population is African American, so it's very, very different than Chicago [Illinois], which I live now.  My parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry]--my dad was--my dad ended up coming to Seattle after he got out of the [U.S.] Army, and he actually was a student at University of Chica- University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] where he met my mom who was also a student.  And they ended up getting married and, and unfortunately not finishing school and, and, but setting up a life in, in Seattle.
Speaker 1: When did they get married?
Speaker 2: Oh, they got married--let's see here--well, it would be fifty-three years ago, so (laughter), so it would have been, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your dad spent time in the [U.S.] military.  Did he go abroad?  Did he serve in any wars?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he, he did go abroad, and, but I think he actually spent some time over in Hawaii, and I think that's how he ended up in Seattle, from what I remember.
Story_ID: 610703
Speaker 1: So what's your earliest childhood memory?  Tell me about your house and your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: My, well, my earliest childhood memory was we, you know, we--I, I was born in Seattle [Washington], but we actually left Seattle, and we ended up coming back to Kansas.  So my, so my earliest childhood memory really was spending time with my grandparents down in Coffeyville [Kansas].  And I, I lived with them for a little bit and--
Speaker 1: How old were you when you moved to Kansas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, probably three or four.  Yeah, so that was my earliest.  And I, and I remember, you know, it being a very happy time.  My--I was totally spoiled, being the only girl.  And, and I remember my [paternal] grandmother [Beatrice Jones Keith] buying me these, you know, really cute little boots that I was not supposed to get wet, and I remember going and getting them wet and my grandfather [Mayberry McKissack's step-grandfather, Warren Keith] trying to dry them before she got home, you know.  And that was--you know, he--that was always kind of the relationship, you know, that we had, is that he would, he would always try to protect me.  She was kind of more of the disciplinarian, and, and he was, you know, he was a little more easygoing, so.  And I think I tried to use that to my advantage as much as I could.
Story_ID: 610704
Speaker 1: Where did you guys live?  Tell--describe the situation in Coffeyville [Kansas].
Speaker 2: Well, Coffeyville, again, and it to this day, it hasn't changed much.  Coffeyville is right over the Tulsa [Oklahoma] line and you know, really small town.  I'm not sure what the population is, but it's, it's, it's really like a, kind of a throwback to what you might see on some of the, you know, the, like the Mayberry TV show ['The Andy Griffith Show'].  It's like a, it's like a little town like that, and it really is, you know, like that, and not that much different today.
Speaker 1: Was there a large minority population?
Speaker 2: I think so, relative to the total population, but, again, very segregated; you know, blacks lived in one area, and whites lived in another area.  So--and not much interaction.  As I mentioned before, my grandfather [Mayberry McKissack's paternal step-grandfather, Warren Keith] worked at the largest plant.  It was a, a paint plant.  And, and I, I don't remember the name, but it's one of the major paint companies today, and they have a large facility there.  And I think he, he worked and lived there, you know (clears throat)--I, I mean worked for the, the company for, you know, forty-some odd years 'til he retired or something, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you live in a neighborhood that was associated with the plant?  Was this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --for families?
Speaker 2: No, no.  It, this--you know, we, we--the houses were very small, you know.  Again, one of my childhood memories is that in Kansas, they had a lot of underground silos because of the, you know, the weather conditions.  And I remember having one in my grandmother's backyard, and I remember that I used to always hope that there was gonna be a tornado or something, because she always had a lot of treats down there, you know.  And you'd go in and you're actually underneath the ground.  And I thought as a child, I thought, boy, that, that's really an adventure, you know.  And so now as an adult I realize how, you know, serious that was to have those kind of weather conditions.  But that's probably one of the childhood memories I have, is, you know, hoping that there was a storm so we could go down to the silo and get all the treats.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like in a place like Kansas it was a lot about adventure and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was a, it was a fairly simple life, you know, again, small town, very much like what you would see on TV, you know, that Mayberry kind of town, just so happens to be my, my maiden name.  And no one locked their doors.  Everybody knew everybody, and everyone knew everybody's kids.  So, if you did something wrong--I mean from the time that I was there, I was known as Beatrice's granddaughter, and so if, if I did something wrong there were probably ten women, they weren't gonna wait for me to get home for my [paternal] grandmother [Beatrice Jones Keith] to, to discipline me; they were gonna discipline me, and lot of respect.  You know, we, we always said, "Yes, sir," and "No, ma'am," and you know.  I mean it, it just was--but lot of love, lot of people taking care of you.
Story_ID: 610705
Speaker 1: Again, because, because my [paternal] grandfather [Denver Mayberry] was a minister, we spent half our life in church as young kids, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, describe that experience.
Speaker 1: Well, for me it was a great experience.  I think my brothers [Dirk Mayberry and Brett Mayberry] would tell you something differently.  But I, I always enjoyed it, and so, you know, I liked going.  And I, and I loved--my [paternal] grandmother [Beatrice Jones Keith], as I said to you, would make these just beautiful little dresses, and I loved getting all dressed up in them and going and, and being part of the, the environment.  And I don't know if I was listening that much to the message, but I loved the, you know, the, the singing and, and just the, the, the relationships and things that were formed there.  I think being the, the, the grandchildren of the minister though, we, we had--we were in church old day.  So, you know, we'd go to church in the morning, and then, you know, they'd break, and then they'd, they'd have some kind of lunch, and we'd go back to church.  And so my grandfather would take us, and we would be there all day long.  And my brothers really just hated it.  They just, they wanted to go play.  They wanted to--you know, they, they, they really did not want to be in church all day.  And, and being the, the children, or grandchildren, of the minister, you had to be really good all the time.  I mean you couldn't, you couldn't do anything that was wrong because if you did, you were gonna be in trouble.
Story_ID: 610706
Speaker 1: Describe the sights and sounds of church, your [paternal] grandfather's [Denver Mayberry] church.
Speaker 2: Well, it was an, obviously a, a black church.  And so the sounds that I remember are first of all, it, it was very warm.  Everybody knew everybody, so you know, you, you came in, you made sure that you spoke.  Again, we were the, the, the minister's, you know, grandchildren so we had to be the, you know, kind of perfect little kids.  And so we didn't get a chance maybe to, to do some of the things that others--we had to sit.  You know, he wanted us to sit, and, and it was, it was hard to sit for, you know, such a long period of time.  Lots of you know, wonderful song and you know, really a, a very--as a child, I probably looked at it very differently, you know, because now I think about I would give anything to be able to see my grandfather actually preach a, a, a, a sermon.  But--
Speaker 1: Describe those, those sounds; you mentioned the, the song, and, and your grandmother--your grandfather's sermons; describe those sounds.
Speaker 2: Well, I think those sounds were, you know, they were fairly loud and, and, and, and on message, basically to give a message, to, to live a thought.  You know, I, as a child, I, I, I don't think I probably had the full appreciation.  I think I thought a lot about when was it gonna be over, you know, so we could, you know, take off our, our, our church clothes and be able to go and do what the other kids were doing.  But, but I also remember it as being a feeling like an extension of, of my home, you know, feeling that there were people always looking after me and, and making sure that I was doing the right thing but also if I got into trouble that there would also be people there to help me.  That's what I remember.
Speaker 1: So it was a loud church, a lot of stomping and clapping and--
Speaker 2: Not, not--I mean this was Wichita [Kansas] so not as much as you might--you know, now that I have been to other churches in, in, you know, Chicago [Illinois] and other places around the country and I, I really understand, you know, different types of ways to, to celebrate, I don't think it was, you know, as much as some of the others I've seen--but, but, but a lot of, a lot of music, in a sense, and, and, and sound and, and action and, and, and a lot of interaction with the, the congregation.  But I just remember it being long, you know, 'cause as I said, we were there all day.
Speaker 1: And then what happened on a, a Sunday afternoon when you'd come home?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't come home, because we would go to church and then they would have some type of meal at church and then you go back to church.
Speaker 1: Describe the meal, the, the food, the smells.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The, the, the foods were, you know, probably fairly typical, you know, high caloric food (laughter) in those days, you know, fried chicken, greens, macaroni and cheese, you know.  The, the women from the church would make the food, and, and there'd be lots of, you know, food, you know, just lined up, and you know, you would serve yourself.  And so, there was never, you know, there was never a lack, and there was always some kind of sweet punch or something like that, so.
Story_ID: 610707
Speaker 1: And then during the week you would, I imagine, play in the neighborhood and, and that kind of thing.  And you mentioned that the neighborhoods were segregated.  Can you describe, you know, the black neighborhood versus the white neighborhoods in town?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, to be honest with you, I can, I can describe it as an adult.  But as a child, I really didn't know any different, okay.  As a child, most of--until we moved to Seattle [Washington], and we actually moved into a neighborhood that was not an all-black neighborhood, I spent most of my earlier childhood living in neighborhoods that were all black.  So, for me, that, that did not seem to be a, an issue.  I mean--
Speaker 1: So take me around the neighborhood.  What, what was this neighborhood called?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember it, it necessarily having a name, but--
Speaker 1: What streets?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I think the, the, in Wichita [Kansas], the, the neighborhood, the street, I think it was Shadybrook [Street], was the, was the name of the street.  And, but as I said, you know, as a child, I, I didn't know anything differently, okay.
Speaker 1: Take me around the block.  Help me see this neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well, there, you know, there were, you know, modest houses.  These were not, you know, big, you know, houses.  These were modest houses.  These were all working people.  These were mainly families with children.  Again, because my [paternal] grandfather [Denver Mayberry] had been living in this area for such a long time, he was--and he had this barbershop and, and he was a minister, he was fairly well known and fairly well respected.  And so, and because he was involved in a number of those things, he always had people coming to the house and, and, and those kinds of things.  But we, we lived not that far from him, and so we, we saw him on a, you know, regular basis, and yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you take trips to the barbershop?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, we--
Speaker 1: What do you remember about the barbershop?
Speaker 2: You know what: it, it--I--my memories are that it was--I thought it was fun; I thought it was an adventure, you know, and, and I loved seeing him work.  My grandfather was not very tall.  He was a fairly short man, and so I used to, you know, I used to always like to see him kind of behind there and what he was doing.  But, but the thing that I really remember was all the relationships he had.  He had so many different relationships with, with so many different people, because he was handling a basic need, you know, whether--regardless of your race or your profession or, or whatever, everyone needs to get their hair cut, right?  So, it was interesting because I, probably me, it was one of the first times I actually saw so many different kinds of people, because you know, we just pretty much stayed in our own, you know, neighborhood and interacted with, you know, pretty much the same people.
Speaker 1: So, when you say so many different kinds of people, who did you see coming in and out?
Speaker 2: Well, because he--the, the barbershop was actually in an office building, so you know, it was primarily--you, you know, there weren't as many I would say people of color as there were other people that would come in there, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, white and other--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Like who else?
Speaker 2: Well, pretty much white, I mean, 'cause Wichita was not that diverse, especially--
Speaker 1: And what was, what kind of relationship did you see between your grandfather and his white patrons?
Speaker 2: You know, a very respectful relationship, okay, very respectful.  You know, my grandfather was a, a very proud man.  I mean he was--he stood his own and, and, and probably during the time, was--but he was also--he had a great personality, and he had a fabulous smile.  He had one of the, you know, warm--I, I remember, when I think of him, I think of his smile.  And so there was a, there was a very amicable, respectful relationship.  Now, you know, was obviously providing a service.  He's cutting hair, so you know, I mean it wasn't like he was, you know, he was doing something that maybe they thought was kind of their level.  But, but still, for what it was, he was, I think he was very well respected.
Speaker 1: Right, and this is in the late 1950s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's pretty progressive.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was pretty progressive, yeah.
Story_ID: 610708
Speaker 1: Any other early memories from Wichita [Kansas]?
Speaker 2: The only--I, I think the other memories are the holidays.  And, and you know, Wichita having snow and, and you know, Christmas and, and, and spending those kinds of, you know, times with my, both my parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] and my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Describe Christmas.
Speaker 2: Well, Christmas was always a lot of, of fun because on my dad's side, my dad was an only child, therefore, we were the only grandchildren.  So you can imagine that it was very different than on my mom's side where there were, you know, twelve, thirteen kids, and everyone, you know, had, you know, other families.  And so, you know, my, my grandparents [Callie Roberson and Robert Roberson (ph.)] on my mother's side, you know, I really didn't know that well because there were so many other kids, and we never lived down there.  But on my father's side, you know, I knew my grandparents very well, because a: I was--they were fortunate, and I was fortunate enough for them to live, you know, long lives sort of.  Both my mother's father and my father's father [Denver Mayberry] both lived into their nineties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So describe your favorite Christmas in Wichita.
Speaker 2: Well, my favorite Christmas probably was, all of them were my, my favorites 'cause I thought Christmas was fairly a big, a big deal, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there one memory that stands out?
Speaker 2: No.  It--you know, really, I had some really cute pictures that, of my brother and I and, and you know, me getting my favorite doll, and my, my brother getting something that he wanted.  And, and again, as I said, we, we were the only grandkids, so we got a lot of attention and love and probably were a little bit more indulged than, than, than others, you know, when in fact you have to spread that around a lot.
Story_ID: 610709
Speaker 1: You described that one situation in the barbershop where there was mutual respect between races.  Did you notice any dynamics within the black community where you lived in terms of hierarchy, social status (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of color or profession or education?
Speaker 2: Well, not so much in Wichita [Kansas].  You know, the, the professions that I--and again, a lot of this is reflection as an adult about what was happening when, you know, I was a small child.  I, I think I realize now that, you know, my [paternal] grandfather [Denver Mayberry], because he was a minister, because he, you know, had his own business really, you know, he had a lot of respect 'cause he had a lot of contacts.  And he lived a very long life.  And so if I looked at that and put it in, you know, today's world, I mean he was, he, he just had an infectious personality, and people were really drawn to him.  And in his own way, he was, you know, using his form of leadership, you know, to do the things that he, that, that he felt he needed to do.  But again, you know, the worlds were really separate.  I mean I really don't remember much of the two worlds coming together.  We lived in an all-black neighborhood.  We went to, you know--we, we socialized, if you will, with other black children.  I didn't have any, you know, friends who weren't black.  So there, there really wasn't much mixing.
Story_ID: 610710
Speaker 1: And when did you leave Kansas?
Speaker 2: We left when I was probably four or five.  And we, we, we stopped (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So in 1959 or 1960.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we stopped in Denver [Colorado] and, and stayed there for a short time and then came back to Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 1: So in Denver, tell me about your parents' [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] professions?
Speaker 2: Well, Denver, we weren't there for--we were there for a short time. My father worked for an--airlines, and, and he was doing some maintenance work for airlines.  And we stayed there for a while.  And, and I don't have a lot of memories of Denver other than the fact that it had great snow, and it was, and it was cold sometimes.  But other than that, we, we weren't there that long.
Speaker 1: And were your parents educated?
Speaker 2: My, both my parents started college [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington], which you know, now when I look back and think about them starting college back when they did, you know.  But neither one of them graduated from college.  They--my mother--they got married, my mother was nineteen, and eventually both of them dropped out of college.  My mother--my dad was a premed, and my mother was in nursing.  She was--and her, her uncle was actually one of the, the first black doctors in New York, and he was actually living in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Which uncle?
Speaker 2: This is my, my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Do you know his name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So your parents returned to Seattle in what year approximately?
Speaker 2: My parents returned--let's see--I was probably, you know, five or six years old when they, when they returned.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so 1961 or so.
Speaker 2: Right, '61 [1961], yeah; probably, that probably was about right (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 610711
Speaker 1: What are your first memories of Seattle [Washington] this time around?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we moved into an area in Seattle which is called the Central Area, and that area was a primarily black area.  I, we lived there for a while, very positive memories.  My, my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold], one of the things my mother did was she--the local newspaper had a program in the summer to teach kids how to swim.  And my mother, who at the time was not working outside the home.  My dad [Donald Mayberry] had a, had a maintenance business, and she helped him with this maintenance business.  And she would gather all the kids in the neighborhood and take them to each of the beaches around the, the city, and they would, you know, teach us how to swim.  And so I re- I remember that and, and--as being kind of a, a fun time because we got to be with all the kids, and, and my mom was kind of the chaperone for that.  So that's what I remember.  But we--eventually, my dad moved into real estate, and he was able to buy a house for us in a neighborhood that was not a black neighborhood.  It was primarily a white neighborhood.  We were the second black family to move in that neighborhood.  And we moved there when I was, I was in grade school because I, I ended up going to Dunlap Elementary School [Seattle, Washington].  And we stayed--
Speaker 1: What that name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hm?
Speaker 1: What was the name of this neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was called the Rainier Beach area [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: And so prior to that you lived in the Central District.  Do you remember that neighborhood?  That's the inner city.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, as a child, you know, it was, it, it--you know, I really didn't experience a lot of issues, what, you know.  I was, you know, I was young, and, and you know, what kids look for at those particular times are, are very different, you know.  You want to have friends.  You want to go to a great school, you know.  You know, I had--
Speaker 1: Was it an apartment?
Speaker 2: --all of that.
Speaker 1: Apartment--were they--
Speaker 2: No.  We actually had a, we had a house, but I don't think we owned it.  I think we were renting it.  And, but it was, you know, it was great.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, issues.  There was a family that lived across the street from us that had a lot of kids, and so, you know, I had people to--and a couple of the, the girls were my age, and so I had lots of people to play with.  And, and it was a, it was a great time.  I actually remember being somewhat disappointed when we had to move to this other area because we were kind of in the center of the city, and we moved out south, and this was an all-white area, and I had no friends.   And one of the things my mother would do is she would take me on the weekends, after we moved, and she'd bring me back to the local Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] that was in the neighborhood so that I could have some sense of, you know, where I had left and, and community because until I got, you know, I think integrated into the, the, the area out there and started to have friends, it could be kind of lonely for a, a, a young kid.
Story_ID: 610712
Speaker 1: So describe that, that transition, when you first arrived in the--it's Rainier Beach [Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Rainier Beach, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What--how were you received as the second black family in that neighborhood?  Do you remember the reaction?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We, you know, I think we--initially, there were some issues, you know, because, again, we were the second family.  There was another family that lived down the street, the, the Johnson [ph.] family, and we became--they had three girls, ended up having four girls in, in, total.  But they had three girls at the time, and so we immediately bonded with that family.  And, and when we went to school, my brother and I, I had my older brother [Dirk Mayberry].  My younger brother [Brett Mayberry] wasn't in school at the time.  There were probably, you know, half a dozen to a doz- maybe half a dozen kids of color.  So, now, the one thing about Seattle [Washington] that's very different is that Seattle has a very large Asian community.  So when you say people of color or minorities, you know, you have to make sure that you're really including.  If I say African American, that's a different story.  So there were maybe half a dozen or so African Americans, but there were a lot of kids who were Asian.  And so there, there, there was some, you know, tolerance if you will and some acceptance of people who were, you know, something other than white, but, but African American was a different story.
Speaker 1: Now, describe your elementary school experience.
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was a great school.  I mean, you know, one of the things that was great about the experience is that I did have a great education.  I, I had a public school education; I did not go to any kind of private school.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is Dunlap Elementary [Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 2: Dunlap Elementary, and it was, you know, a great school.  And over time, I, I really, I have to honestly say that I really did not experience a lot of issues as a young child.  I really started to experience more issues when I went to junior high [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington].  And at that time we were doing a lot of busing, and kids would be coming from the area where I used to live, okay, in the Central Area [Seattle, Washington], out to the schools that, that, that, that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was in.
Speaker 1: Well, let me find out about your elementary school experience even before we get to middle school.  Do you remember your favorite teachers and how you were treated by them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I don't really remember any real bad experiences.  The only experience that I remember that, that I didn't understand 'til much later is that my best friend was, was a white girl.  There, you know--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Neadra.
Speaker 1: Neadra?
Speaker 2: Nead- Neva, actually Neva, N-E-V-A.  And we were best friends for many, many years, but I never, ever went to her home.  And she would come to my home, but I, I was never allowed to go to her home.  And at the time, to be honest with you, I really didn't understand why.  And my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] understood.  Her dad was from the South.  Her mother was--knew about me and was fairly, you know, tolerant, but I was never allowed, I mean to this day, I was never allowed to come to her home.  And so, you know, there were those kinds of experiences, but, but you know, I didn't really understand them at the time.  I didn't understand why she could come to my home, and I could never go to her home.  And you know, I was never allowed to do some of those activities that you would do with your best friend and their families and those kinds of things.  So--
Speaker 1: With the other kids, did you participate in slumber parties and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, back then, you know, I think people were a lot more open about slumber parties.  I mean, you know, that was a kind of thing.  My, my dad [Donald Mayberry] was very strict, and so he didn't allow us--it didn't matter, you know, who the people were.  Unless we, he knew them, we didn't, we weren't allowed to go and, and do all those kinds of things.  So I never saw that as something that I was, you know, prevented from doing.  I saw it as just something that, you know, my dad wasn't gonna allow us to do.
Story_ID: 610713
Speaker 1: How were you processing all of this stuff?  Because you had moved, you know, back and forth from the Deep South in summers.  You lived in Kansas for a while; you live, lived in the Central District [Central Area] of Seattle [Washington] and then the suburbs.  How were you processing the transitions, particularly in Seattle?  Like, how did you--what were your coping mec- mechanisms?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in--as a young child, I, I was processing it, you know, really pretty well I think, because they were just all adventures to me.  You know, it was just something new.  And, and, and my, and my dad [Donald Mayberry], you know, was a great storyteller, so he, he, he always had a story, you know.  He, he, he tried to prepare us as much as possible, you know, this is something new that we're going to be doing together as a family.  And, and, and the other thing was is that for the first time we had our own home, you know, and, and he bought the home, you know.  And again, this was, you know, early '60s [1960s].  So, you know, we had this, you know, brand new spanking home that, you know, was a pretty nice home.  I mean in today's world, I mean, it wouldn't be the Taj Mahal [Agra, India] or anything, but it, but for us--I had my own room, and so there were a lot of benefits, you know.
Speaker 1: Was this a middle class, upper middle class neighborhood [Rainier Beach, Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't call it upper middle class.   I would--well, I think it was a middle class neighborhood.  Back in the day it probably was considered a, a pretty, a pretty nice neighborhood but not, you know, anything extraordinary.  But for, for, for me, back, you know, as a young to have your own room and, and you know, a two level house, and it was a, you know, a nice neighborhood, and, and good schools.  And, and, and I was a fairly outgoing, you know, child, so I made friends pretty easily.  And, and my school, elementary school time was really a, a, a pretty stress free kind of environment [at Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington], and partially because I didn't really understand what else was out there because my world was, was still very small.  I went from being in pretty much an all black world to then being the, the, the one or two black girl in an all white world.
Speaker 1: And, and part of that was because your father made a professional transition.  So he was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He had a maintenance company.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I know, you know, there were some manufacturing companies that had moved into the Seattle area, some of them connected to [U.S.] military and defense, that kind of thing.  What kind of maintenance was your dad doing initially?
Speaker 2: He, he--well, no, he really, basically what he did, he had a company that basically cleaned buildings.  And so he cleaned office buildings through his--you know, more of a janitorial kind of business.  And so that's really the business that he had for a very long time.  And my dad was a salesman.  You know, he was really, in my mind, a salesman.  And, and, he ended up getting his real estate license.  And, and really the reason we were able to get this house was because he had this real estate training.  So he was able to, you know, buy a house in, you know, a nontraditional area, you know, back in the day, and moved his family out there.  And, and I'm sure that--you know, I didn't talk to him a lot about this before he passed, but I'm sure he did it because he thought that this would provide a better life for us.
Story_ID: 610714
Speaker 1: And so, and, and it was sounds like your family was able to adjust rather quickly to this new neighborhood [Rainier Beach, Seattle, Washington].  Were you also excelling at school [Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was excelling at school.  I was a good student.  I was very, you know, active.  My brother [Dirk Mayberry] was as well.  My brother was, older brother, was an excellent student.  He was also into sports and was, you know, quite an athlete and all of that, so--and we're only a year apart.  So, you know, we, we really were accepted I think very well, at least my memories are.  I don't remember a lot of, you know, issues, you know.  I, you know, I don't remember a lot of problems.  Again, I didn't go much outside my world, okay.
Speaker 1: And your parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] never had to make trips to the school to make sure teachers were advancing you, putting you in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) proper group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Seattle [Washington] is a very different environment, and I, and again, I have so many friends, and we've talked about this, and they've had very, you know, different experiences.  But I had very good teachers, very supportive teachers.  You know, I think one of the reasons that that was the case: there were never that many of us, okay.  Again, you know, I had the same kids in school from the time I was in second or third grade until the time that I, you know, graduated.  It was the same kids.  You know, every once in a while there might be one other or what have you, but there was never really more than a dozen at any given time.  And so, you know, the only bad thing as you got older is that they had always paired you up with one guy, right, because he was the only other, you know, black student.  And that was your, you know, quote, unquote boyfriend, right, so you never had any selection or (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember--
Speaker 2: --or any--
Speaker 1: --those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, you never had that.  But, but to be honest with you, other than that, I mean, you know, really, I did not have any issues relative to that.
Story_ID: 610715
Speaker 1: And you mentioned you went on to middle school.  Maybe there were a few more challenges there.  Name your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --middle school?
Speaker 2: Rain--it was actually called Rainier Beach [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington].  It was a junior/senior high, and, and so it was a combination of seventh grade through twelfth grade.  And that was a very difficult time for me, I would probably say one of the most difficult times in my life.  All of a sudden, you know, I went from an environment where I was, you know, very much accepted; I went from, you know, being, you know, very involved in activities and having lots of friends to--they were doing busing during those years, and, and so a lot of the kids from the Central Area [Seattle, Washington] got bused into the sud- the south schools.  And I found myself, by the time I got into eighth grade, you know, I was president of the honor society and, or, or involved in the honor society, and, and, and, and was holding some office there, and you're doing lots of things.  And I didn't fit anywhere because the, the kids that were from my former school [Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington] all of the sudden realized I was black, okay.  'Cause I don't, I don't know if they really thought of me, you know--obviously, obviously they knew I was a different shade, and obviously my hair was different and that kind of thing, but I think I blended in pretty much, you know.  And then all of a sudden, when all of the kids came from the Central Area and were bused in there, they realized, oh, my god, she is, you know, black.  Well, the black kids who came from the Central Area said you know, she's not black enough; you know, I talk funny; or you know, you know--just it, it was just a very challenging time.  And so I went from being very, very social to really getting to a point where I didn't want to go to school, you know, because it was, you know, kids would beat me up, and, and it was just a, a very difficult time.  And I didn't fit anywhere, you know.  I didn't, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know if I was black enough.  I didn't know I was white enough, I mean.  You know, it just was, you know.  And the white kids didn't like me; the black kids didn't like me, and so--and, and the girls would beat me up all the time (laughter).  And, and they liked my brother [Dirk Mayberry] because he was an athlete, and he was very handsome.  And, and (laughter) so, you know, I think the boys can kind of, you know, handle that a little differently, because the girls like you no matter what, right?  So, so he--I've never talked to him a lot about this, but I think he had a little easier time because he was an athlete and all that.  But, but for me, that was probably the most painful part of my childhood, because I, I really, I can, I understand now when I see kids say that they get to a point they don't know where they fit, you know, because I really didn't know where I fit.  And, and I had never experienced not being liked by so many different people who I really felt that I hadn't, you know, done anything.  And at that time my parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] were also going through a divorce, so it was just a, it was a, a very difficult period.
Story_ID: 610716
Speaker 1: So you were getting pressure from both sides, the white kids and the black kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You described being beaten up.  Can you recall one of those incidents, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a lot of it would be the girls from the, the Central Area [Seattle, Washington] that had been bused out there would wait for me, you know, by my locker.  And, and you know, when I say beaten up, I mean not, you know, I'd never gotten beaten up badly; I mean, pushed or, or, but threatened to be beaten up.  And he, and you know, my brother, my older brother [Dirk Mayberry], would have to walk me home, or, or you know, my mom [Thelma Roberson Arnold] would have to come up or, or, or what have you.  But--
Speaker 1: Was there someone in particular like, was there, you know, a lead bully?
Speaker 2: You know, there were several.  You know, all of them hated me so it didn't matter (laughter), you know.  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you thought you were white or better.
Speaker 2: Well, they thought, okay.  And, and to be honest with you, I didn't think about it that much, because you know, from the time that I was probably second or third grade until I was in seventh grade [at Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington], that's all I knew, okay.  And so, but you know, they would say things like, you know, "You talk funny," and you know, "You think you're better than us."  And, and you know, they had, you know, pet names and you know, you know, kind of, you know--
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, they, they would, you know, they would just say things to you about, you know, you, you, you know, you think you're better than us and, and--
Speaker 1: They'd call you Oreo?
Speaker 2: And Oreo; that was, you know, and just, you know, and, and some things that, you know, that were probably nastier than that.  But I think as, as someone who's in junior high school [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington] and, and again, someone who really had a fairly easy grade school, elementary experience, very social, liked to be in a lo- lot of different things, you know, it made me pull away.  You know, I was, in eighth grade I was taking Russian.  You know, they had a Russian class in my junior high.  And, and you know, I, I always did things a little different, you know, so I was taking a Russian class.  And you know, they would say, you know, "Who do you think you are, a black girl taking Russian; black girls don't take Russian," you know.  And so, and so it was just a very painful time.  Those, those couple of years were very painful because--and again, my, my, my friends, my, that I had at that time who were white, they started to, to back away too because, all of a sudden, they weren't sure who I was, and, and, and again, they were just some difficult times going on in this school, 'cause the whole, whole busing program was not handled, you know, well at all.  So, they'd wait for me by my locker.  They threatened to beat me up.  They'd, you know, push me.  They called me names and, and just, you know, anything just to--and I wasn't, you know, a, a big girl.  I was just small, kind of petite, and, and so, you know, I probably was easily intimated at the time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the numbers?  I mean, how dramatically did the numbers of black students change?
Speaker 2: It changed pretty dramatically.  I mean, you know, again, you know, the, the, the people that--the people of color, especially African Americans at the school, were the same kids that were at my elementary school, so there're twelve of us (laughter), okay.  So, you know, the, there probably weren't more than a couple of dozen of us that were, were there that had been there, you know, previously.  And we were all kids who lived in the area, for the most part, so--
Speaker 1: And all of a sudden, how many--
Speaker 2: Twenty percent of the school or something like that.  I mean, it was a pretty big number.  And, and again, I think one of the issues is that, the kids that came from the inner city, they were bused out there.  So they were bused out there, and they were bused back, okay.  So, you know, you, you didn't have a lot of afterschool kinds of things where people could kind of get to know each other and everything.  And so they were just, you know, put in there and then put out there.  And again, just a, a very difficult time, and not knowing where you fit, and, and realizing that, okay, you, you probably are a little different, but certainly that doesn't make you any less black or what have you, but.
Story_ID: 610717
Speaker 1: How did you cope?  What were your coping mechanisms?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --join clubs?  Did you read books?
Speaker 2: No, my--
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: The way I coped was I withdrew; you know, I, I went into myself.  I, I, you know, I, I always was a, a, a, a huge reader and, and loved to read.  One of the things my dad [Donald Mayberry] used to do all the time is that, as I said, he was very strict and so we didn't chan- we didn't get to go out, like on a Friday night we had spelling bees.  And so, so I, I just went back to things that I could do by myself.  And--
Speaker 1: What books did you read?
Speaker 2: Oh, just any kind of books.  My mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold], you know, my mother would get books for me.  I mean, you know, I read Nancy Drew and all kinds of, you know, mystery books and--but I was always just interested in a lot of different things, and so anything that was popular out there at the time, you know--
Speaker 1: Were Judy Blume books big then?
Speaker 2: No, I, you know, I don't remember reading those.  But I, but I read a lot of--and you know, and I read different kinds of books.  So, I just kind of withdrew.  And for me, it really didn't get better until I--my mother actually.  I, I, I credit her with really saving my life, because I really, I don't know what would have happened.  I, I was very despondent as, you know, about that environment.  It was, it was not a, a learning environment.   It was a very hostile environment.  The, the, the, the administrators of the school [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington] could not control it.  It was--
Speaker 1: Did, did your family try to intervene in terms of the administration?
Speaker 2: My, yeah, my mother tried, but, but you know, the problem was is that you cannot be with your child all day.  And, and what eight, you know, eighth grader wants her mother coming up to walk her home, you know?
Speaker 1: What did the principal say?
Speaker 2: You know, they, they, I, I think they were at a loss what to do, you know.  They were being forced to take in these students, right.  So quite frankly, they didn't want them there any more than, than probably the students wanted to be there.  So they, they wanted--they were having to deal with it.  They weren't given a lot of training to be able to handle it.  I think that they felt it would, would die down, you know, you know, eventually.  But you know, I think that most people who, you know, grew up in the '60s [1960s], busing, you know, was not necessarily the answer.  It may have been a start at trying to integrate, but it really, for me, based on my experience, was not the answer, because the, the, the kids, you know, that came from the, the inner city felt as though that they weren't welcome out there.  And so, and the kids who were living there didn't want them there because they were changing their environment.  And so the kids that had left the inner city and moved out to those areas and were part of those communities, they didn't really identify.  And it was just a, as I said, it was it was just a very, very difficult time.  And--
Speaker 1: And you said you were despondent.  So describe what you would do in your quiet moments in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, I was despondent in the sense that I couldn't be what I wanted to be.  I mean, I mean I wanted to take Russian.  I mean I still took Russian.  But you know, I wanted to be on honor society, you know.  I wanted to be--I loved school.  You know, I've always loved school, I think.  And so, I wanted just to be who I wanted to be.  I, I, you know, I wasn't really focused on who was black and who was white and who was doing what and all that.  I just wanted to focus on being a kid and, and being a teenager and, and, and enjoying the things I wanted to do.  And so, when, when--I wasn't used to coming to school every day and having it be a battle, not knowing who's gonna be waiting for me at my locker, not knowing who's gonna try to beat me up before I go home, not knowing who's gonna yell and scream at me and push me and call me names.  I mean, that was the environment, you know, that, that I was, you know, dealing with.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it, was it scary?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  It was because, you know, I, I--and, and I didn't tell my parents a lot of it, but they knew, they knew that something was going 'cause my whole demeanor changed.  So I just, you know, withdrew as much as possible and just spent my time reading.  And you know, I had my own room remember, so I'd go to my room, and you know, I'd read magazines and you know, just, you know, find things that I could do, you know, by myself.  And when I--this was a junior/senior high, so I could have gone to school there from seventh grade to twelfth grade.
Story_ID: 610718
Speaker 1: And my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold], when I got into the ninth grade, I, I told her I was just very, very unhappy and that I did not want to go to senior high school there [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington], that I just did not feel that that was the right environment for me.  But back then, you know, they were--the busing and, and really, they were very rigid about guidelines of where you go to school.  I mean you couldn't just decide, well, I'm gonna go to school somewhere else.  You know, if you lived in that neighborhood, that's where you were supposed to go to school.  And there was a school that was kind of in the middle of the city, and it was called Franklin High School.  It's still there.  It's an historic school in, in Seattle [Washington].  And I, I met a friend who actually ended up being my best friend and still my best friend today.  And she was going to Franklin High School, and she told me about it.  And I thought, wow, that just sounds great.  And what was so great about it was that black kids were not the majority.  White kids were not the majority.  Asian kids were the majority, and the blacks and whites were pretty much equally balanced.  And I thought, wow, that would be a great environment, you know.  And--but I didn't live in the neighborhood.  And I had an aunt, my Aunt Mildred [ph.], one of my mother's sisters, which is one of the reasons my mother ended up in Seattle, is 'cause she had an older sister that lived there.  And my aunt lived in the neighborhood.  And I think it was probably the only time that I ever remember my mother doing anything dishonest.  But my mother finally agreed to put down that I was living with my aunt so that I could go to this high school and get out of my neighborhood.
Speaker 2: So you transitioned to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I transitioned--
Speaker 2: --Franklin High School.
Speaker 1: --to Franklin High School (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 610719
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you this, because there were a lot of events going on around this time race related.  So before you get to Franklin [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington] and around that transition from the elementary [Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington] to the middle school [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington], there is a situation involving Robert Reese [Robert L. Reese].  Were you aware of that situation?
Speaker 2: Aware but not involved.  Do you know what I mean?  Again, you know, pretty isolated, you know, you know, pretty isolated.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, this was the case of a black man who was--do you remember the story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was in a restaurant and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I guess there were some white undercover officers, and he was ultimately shot.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And ultimately, it was considered excusable homicide.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And so there was a lot of racial tension--
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a lot of--
Speaker 1: --around that issue.
Speaker 2: --tension, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the response either in your household--I mean you were relatively young--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but in terms of your parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] or friends and neighbors.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I re- you know, I remember--you know, obviously, I, I lived during a time when, when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, okay.  I mean Martin Luther King, what, forty years ago, so I, you know, I was ten, eleven years old, and so I remember when he died.  I remember when John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] died.  As a matter of fact, I believe the day that we moved to our home in, in Rainier Beach area [Seattle, Washington] was actually right--the day that John F. Kennedy died.  And I remember my, my mother and my father both having very, you know, sad reactions and, and just being, you know, very upset about it.  And of course, I was very young, you know, at that time, and so I don't think much, much of that really resonated with me.  It wasn't 'til I got a little bit older.  Again, growing up in Seattle [Washington] I think is, is very different because Seattle is unlike any other place I've ever lived.  I've lived New York [New York], in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], in California, and obviously Chicago [Illinois], but Seattle is its own world.  And there's isolation, you know, not only from, from a racial standpoint, but I think there's isolations from a geography standpoint.  It's just so far.  You know, the only way you go to Seattle is that you plan to go there.  You know you--or, or you're going to Alaska, and you're doing a stopover.  I mean it's not like you're gonna go through Seattle to go somewhere.  So, I think there's a sense of isolation, not all bad, but there's a sense of isolation.  And as a young black girl growing up in the '60s [1960s], you know, I didn't really understand the full value of that until I got involved with the busing situation, and then it became very clear to me.  I always knew I was black.  I had cousins and you know, we, we were--we would go back to the Central Area [Seattle, Washington] on a regular basis.  You know, my mother had friends there, my day, you know.  So it wasn't that I, you know, thought I was white.  I don't, I don't think I thought I was white, you know.  But I don't think I really understood what it was to be black during that time, what others blacks--and again, I'm, I'm stereotyping a little bit because I only know the ones that I, you know, was familiar with.  You know, when I was with my cousins or other people, they were, you know, seemed to be very accepting.  But when I got into this busing situation it was just very different.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 610720
Speaker 1: And around that time of the busing situation, you mentioned 1968 when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  A lot of turbulence going on in Seattle [Washington] at this time as well in 1968 at Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 2: Yes, at Franklin High School.
Speaker 1: So this could have been right before your transition (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --to Franklin High--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --School, when a black student was expelled because of a fight with a white student.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember hearing about that?
Speaker 2: I remember hearing about it.  But the thing that was different about Franklin--Franklin had its own issues because, again, it was right in the center.  It wasn't in what we called the Central Area [Seattle, Washington].  It was an area--but it was right in the center of the city.  So, and, and if you, if you drive now down on Rainier Beach or, or there's Rainier Beach Avenue [sic. Rainier Avenue] or what we used to call Empire Avenue [sic. Empire Way; Martin Luther King Jr. Way], you'll get to a certain point and you'll see this really majestic type building, beautiful, old, you know, architectural building, and that's Franklin High School.  So it sits right at the center, and you can see it in, as it intersects into all these different streets.  And, and, and in many ways that's what the school is about.  It's an intersection.  There are, you know, Asian kids; there are black kids; and there are white kids, and so they were having their own, you know, issues.  But the thing that was interesting there is that a lot of these kids who went to Franklin, they had been friends for years.  You know, they had gone to a school called Asa Mercer [Asa Mercer Middle School, Seattle, Washington], or they had gone to school in, at Madrona [Madrona School; Madrona Elementary School, Seattle, Washington] or whatever.  So they had known each other for, since they were kids, you know, the Asian kids, the black kids, and the white kids, so there were a lot of friendship and bonds there.  And they didn't have busing because they didn't need busing, because there were enough kids from the area.  So, I think those were the differences, you know, whereas busing, you're taking kids out of their environment, putting them into an environment that they don't know--
Speaker 1: Without a transitional process (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Without a transitional process.  The kids that are there don't want them; they don't want to be there, so it's a different situation.  So there was a lot going on there.  Franklin has been known for years as, you know, a school about change and a school where people voice their opinions and all of that.  But the--but I really didn't see Franklin as a place where people were doing that based on color.  They were doing that in a lot of cases I felt based on their opinions or based on their beliefs, not so much based on color.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like, I mean it's an ideal situation in terms of interracial relationships at Franklin because it was natural.  These kids grew up together, as you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --mentioned.  But I wonder if there was a problem with the administration sort of catching up with the times, 'cause it's black--apparent--according to news reports, the black kid was expelled, and the white kids were not after this fight.  And as you mentioned, that's an interesting context, they may have known each other for years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then two black girls were expelled or at least suspended because they wore their hair in Afros.  And so it sounds like it's an issue that may have centered around the administrators.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'm sure that, you know, the administrators come from all over.  So, again, you know, most of the administrators were not black, you know.  And so I'm sure that there was some training that could have been done, you know.  And, and again, these were, these were volatile times, okay.  But the students itself, the students themselves, they, they really--there, there was a, a camaraderie there, okay, and, and it really wasn't across racial lines, at least from my experience.  Again, I was coming from a very difficult situation that was absolutely across racial lines.  To be in a school where I'm not the only black kid that's in honor society, you know, other than, you know, my brother [Dirk Mayberry] or someone, you know, that to me may seem like a little thing--was a huge thing.
Story_ID: 610721
Speaker 1: So describe one of your first memories of your first year at Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I tell everyone, I probably lived my college years in high school, because I went from, you know, coming out of an environment where I had become, you know, somewhat despondent and really, you know, started to take back and, and, and, and not participate and to going into Franklin and realizing I could do whatever I wanted to do, okay.  I could be smart if I wanted to be smart.  I could be active if I wanted to be active.  I could have all kinds of friends.  And my, my best friend, who's a woman, Kim [ph.], who had grown up with all these kids, she had gone to Asa Mercer [Asa Mercer Middle School, Seattle, Washington].  She, you know, was very popular, and, and so I became her best friend, so I automatically became, you know, in the in crowd, if you will.  And I became popular because of association, not because I'd done anything.  So, it, it was just a totally different environment.  All of a sudden, my love for school and learning and all that came back.  I, I think my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold], you know, realized that it really, it was a difficult decision for her because she just really didn't believe in, in not telling the truth, you know, you know, and the fact that, to say that I was living with my [maternal] aunt when I wasn't living with my aunt, I mean it, it took a lot for her to, to make that choice.  And, and I think she realized it, it turned my life around.  So, I started school, had friends immediately because of my, my best friend that, who was, you know, had lived there all her life and knew all of the kids.  And immediately I started getting involved.  I ran for junior class president and won.  And, and of course my best friend was my campaign manager.  She knew everyone.  And so, you know, I immediately was involved in all the activities.  I was a cheerleader, you know.  So I, all, all in all, I got a chance to be me.  There, now there were issues that were going around I mean, you know, and I certainly were aware--I was much more aware of them.  And, and there were a lot of students in our class who were involved in, you know, different kinds of demonstrations and you know, starting to get politically active and all that.  But it was done in a very different way.  It was done in a very positive way.  I felt that the biggest change for me was that I could be who I was, whatever that was.  I, and I, and I had an environment that allowed me to do that, so it was a great time.
Story_ID: 610722
Speaker 1: And this, and you mentioned students who were involved in protests and that kind of thing, 'cause the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] were starting--
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, Black Panthers were--
Speaker 1: --to gain momentum.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--'cause I know at, at Washington University [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington], there was a group of students from there who--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who went to Franklin [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and tried to offer some influence.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the Black Panthers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, absolutely, absolutely.  There was a, a big movement.  And, and Franklin was often a target of the, you know, that kind of activity and people taking over the student, you know, forum and, and, and those kinds of things.  But you know, it was, it was all done--I mean when I think about it now, it was all done pretty lightweight compared to what we have today, you know.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that?
Speaker 2: I mean I, I, I remember people voicing their opinion, but I, but I re- but the problem that I think that I, that I remember is that it never seemed like it was exceptionally effective, and the reason I think is because the style in which it was done, you know.  It wasn't that, you know, the majority of the people were involved.  It was, you know, the people that were involved were always considered to be really militant or, or, or, or, you know, angry or, or those kinds of things.  So, I don't think it had--I think it had impact, and I think it--you know, maybe that was the only way that you could do it at that time.  But, but it, it--
Speaker 1: It was kind of marginal.
Speaker 2: It, it was kind of marginalized, to be honest with you.  And, and it never, it never got mass attraction, at least during my time there.  There wasn't mass attraction to getting people involved, but there was a movement there, absolutely a movement.
Speaker 1: Do you remember hearing about [HistoryMaker] Aaron Dixon and--
Speaker 2: Aaron Dixon and, and, and, and actually Aaron Dixon's--a woman he married went to my high school, and so, and so--
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: --you know--gosh, I don't--you know, I just remember her, you know, being, being there.  But I mean, there were, there were, there were lots of, you know, things happening there.  And, and in Seattle [Washington], that was a big movement, okay.  And, and I remember, you know, as I went further in high school, there were, there were some shootouts and, and people, you know, killed, and you know, there was a lot of unrest at that time.  But again, it was, it was considered more out of the mainstream.  And compared to what was happening in California and other places, it was probably pretty, pretty small.
Speaker 1: And what, what was your position during all this?  'Cause I know, you know, you were doing SGA [student government association] and honor society and things like that, so you, were you not really participating in this whole black power thing?
Speaker 2: I wasn't politically--
Speaker 1: Black power thing?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't politically active really at all.  I mean I, I was so happy to, you know, be back in an environment that allowed me to learn and an environment that allowed me to be who I was and discover who I was.  I was really focused on that.  I was involved in so many different things that I didn't have, you know, a lot of time to, to focus on that.  And to be honest with you, I wasn't at that particular time experiencing a lot of, you know, discomfort, you know.  Again, blacks were not the majority population at the school.  And so, you know, so I, I really didn't feel as though that we had a lot of issues.  Now, we had a, a sister school called Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], which is the other majority, you know, black school right in the inner city, and they're right in the, you know, the, the Central Area [Seattle, Washington].  And that was always kind of the more militant school, okay.  Matter of fact, a number of the Panthers actually went to Garfield, as well as, you know, noted people like [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones went to Garfield, you know, so.  So, it, it was a different, you know, it was a different environment for me, and I really didn't get, you know, caught up in that too much.
Story_ID: 610723
Speaker 1: You did mention that Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination, and you remember that.  Where were you when you heard about that?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly where I was.  I, I think I was probably--you know, I may have been at school.  But I remember, I remember my, my parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] being, you know, my mother crying.  I remember, you know, there, there just seemed to be so much sadness.  And people had so much hope.  And, and, and, and people felt that, you know, a lot of our dreams and things were just, had gone.  And I remember feeling very sad about that, even though I'm not sure I totally understood it.
Story_ID: 610724
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Franklin [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: What did you want to do next?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to go to college.  It was always assumed that I would go to college.  You know, I, I don't think I ever even gave any thought to the fact that that was not going to be part of my life.  And I did--I wanted to go away to college, but my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] was a single parent, and there wasn't any money put aside to go to college.  And so I got full scholarships at, at University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] and Seattle University [Seattle, Washington], which was a private Catholic university.  And so I accepted the scholarship at, at Seattle University and decided to go through college pretty quickly.  I, I finished in two and a half years, and I took classes at the University of Washington and at Seattle U and, and worked part time.  And it was really a business, you know.  It wasn't--I, I, I, I didn't have--I, I, I laugh a little bit.  My husband [Eric McKissack] had great college years, and, and I say that I really lived my college years in high school.  I had done all of those activities and you know, very social and involved in a lot of different things, and I just wanted to get my degree.
Story_ID: 610725
Speaker 1: And you mentioned also that your parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] divorced during those difficult years in middle school [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington].  And you mentioned that your mom was a single parent.  How did the divorce impact you?
Speaker 2: Well, it impacted my brothers [Dirk Mayberry and Brett Mayberry] and I a great deal, because when I was a, a young child, my mother didn't work outside the home.  She helped my father with his janitorial business, but she did not have a job outside the home.  Once she got divorced, my mother had to go to work.  And you know, she didn't have a college education.  So, it, it had a big impact.  You know, she taught me to cook at a very young age so that I could, you know, prepare meals for my brothers.  I, I, I don't think she did it just 'cause I was the, the, the, the only girl.  I think she did it 'cause she thought I would be the least one to burn the house up.  (Laughter) So, you know, my mother became a working mom with three kids, and you know, didn't see my father that much, you know, and not certainly on the reg- a regular basis.  And you know, those, you know, those were challenging, you know, times, as a child of, you know, divorced parents.  And, and, and money was tight, and, and so, you know, you, you made a lot of decisions based on what you could afford to do, not necessarily what you wanted to do.
Speaker 1: And where did your mother work?
Speaker 2: My mother worked for a grocery chain, which is still around today, Safeway [Safeway Inc.], which is a big grocery chain in the West Coast.  And she worked there for many, many years until she retired and worked her way up to, you know, a management position.  And, and, but again, you know, a management position in those days, you know, didn't make a lot of money.  And as, as things changed within that industry, they went from, you know, being open twenty-four hours and her having to work midnight shifts and you know, those kinds of things, so you know, it, it changed pretty dramatically.

Speaker 1: In 1977, around the time you were beginning college, there were a couple of statutes passed in Washington, anti-discrimination statutes in terms of real estate.  Now it sounds like your family was a little bit ahead of the curve, but did you notice black families moving to the suburbs in larger numbers in the late '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, there, there were definitely major changes there.  As a matter of fact, the, the house that I grew up in, we still own as our family.  My younger brother [Brett Mayberry] raised his family there, and that neighborhood [Rainier Beach, Seattle, Washington] is become almost totally black.  And obviously, forty-something years ago it was, you know, an all white neighborhood.  So you know, we, we have seen that throughout all the cities, and, and, and the same thing has been true for Seattle [Washington] as well.
Speaker 1: Was, was--were the communities able to adjust to those migration shifts?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in Seattle it was a little bit different, because I think that the, the shifts were more gradual.  The numbers weren't so big, okay, 'cause the numbers obviously aren't gonna be as big as some of the major cities, 'cause you know, you've got roughly about 7 percent African American.  And I think even today that that still is about the, the percentage in Seattle.  So, I, I think Seattle--again, as I said, I think Seattle is just a very different experience, because I think that the adjustments can be made a little bit differently, because they're not as, as major, and obviously you don't have the volume.  You don't have some of the, the, the things that you have in some of the bigger cities.
Story_ID: 610727
Speaker 1: So you start college at Seattle University [Seattle, Washington]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 1976.  What was, what were the first weeks--
Speaker 2: Well, actually--
Speaker 1: --months of college like?
Speaker 2: Actually, I started and I graduated from high school [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington] in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I graduated from college.
Speaker 1: You graduated in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So describe those two and a half years.
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was just a, it was a, it was a very busy time.  I, I, I was very focused; I was very driven.  You know, I, I didn't go to college for the, the collegiate experience.  I regret that na- today.  I definitely have encouraged my nieces and nephews to get that experience, 'cause I think it's a very important experience.  My husband [Eric McKissack] has very fond memories of his experience at, at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] doing that.  But--
Speaker 1: Did you, you went to school during the day?
Speaker 2: I went to school during the day and night, but I--for me, it was really about going to school.  I lived at home.  I, I got up in the morning; I went to school at Seattle U, took several classes.  I worked at a downtown department store from, let's say, twelve to five, and I took evening classes at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  And so, and I did it, you know, nonstop.  So I didn't take summers off, and that's how I, I finished early.  And so I missed that whole, you know, period of, of that collegiate experience that a lot of people have.  I, I, I had some of that I think in my high school years.  But I did not, didn't, didn't have that.  And one of the things that, that was important to me was that I, I had a lot of things that I wanted to do.  And one of the things I wanted to do was go live in Europe.  And so when I got out of college--and again, I, I don't know.  My mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] must have had, you know, this unbelievable foresight to--I can't believe that she actually allowed me to do it.  But when I got out of college, she allowed me to go over with a, a friend of mine, a woman that, that I had worked with at, at the department store.  And we went over, two young girls, over to Europe for several months and, and you know, had a rail pass, and, and went all throughout Europe traveling and, and you know, meeting people and getting different experiences.  And, you know, this was, you know, back in, you know, 1976, '77 [1977], and my mother was allowing me to do this.  And I'm, I'm so grateful that she did 'cause it was an unbelievable experience.
Speaker 1: What was your major in college?
Speaker 2: Political science.
Speaker 1: What were your hopes?
Speaker 2: I was gonna be an attorney.  At the time, I thought I would be--go to law school and, and had planned to go to law school.  And so the whole idea of getting Europe in before I started law school was, was all planned, very focused.  And when I got out of college, I immediately went to, to Europe, and it was part of my plan.  And I was gonna come back and go to law school, and, and things changed (laughter).
Speaker 1: And just quickly, did you excel academically in college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I, I was, I was always a pretty good student, you know.  Again, I liked school.  I always loved learning.  I--you know, the, the school, Seattle University, is a private Catholic university.  I'm not Catholic, but it just, it, it, it is somewhat of a school that's very kind of rigid and disciplined, and, and that worked well for me.  University of Washington, on the other hand, is a very large, you know, state university, a great school.  So there were two totally different environments.
Story_ID: 610728
Speaker 1: Do you remember the political--the difference in political environments from campus to campus?  I know at Seattle University [Seattle, Washington] there were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --anti-Vietnam War protests in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], you know, was like progressive black power, that kind of thing.  Did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --notice those movements?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there, there were some.  The, the problem is though that the, the, the real problem I think in both cases, both Seattle University and University of Washington, there weren't enough of us, you know, to really make a big difference.  You know, every once in a while you'd hear about a sit-in or something like that.  But you know, there weren't, there weren't masses; there weren't volumes.  I mean, you know, back when I was going to school, very few African Americans going to either one of those schools.
Speaker 1: But what about the white students at Seattle University and their activism?
Speaker 2: There was, there was a, a fair amount of activism, activism going on, because Seattle University is located also kind of in the center of the city, very old, historical school.  So there was some activism, but, but I wouldn't say that that dominated the, the school, you know, and the environment.  I think people used the location sometime because of where it was centered to, you know, have rallies and those kinds of things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Anti-ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: But I wasn't, you know, personally involved that much--
Speaker 1: You were focused.
Speaker 2: --in it because--
Speaker 1: Do you remember Father Willis Gaffney at all?
Speaker 2: Well, the name obviously, yes, yes, I do, yeah.
Story_ID: 610729
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers who had an impact on you at either Seattle University [Seattle, Washington] or Washington University?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'll be honest with you, I had very good teachers.  And I think one of the things that I enjoyed about going to both of those schools, 'cause I was going to the, both of the schools at the same time, and even though I got my degree from Seattle University, I had a lot of credits from University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  That was the only way to graduate early.  They were very different environments.  You know, you've got Seattle University, which is small, you know, again, religious based school, in the center of, of, of town, and, and then you've got the University of Washington, which is huge.  You know, very rarely are you gonna see the same people.  And so they were two very different environments.  And so, University of Washington would tend to have professors who were maybe a little more radical, you know.  And radical, I'm using that word really loosely, because it's not radical in the sense that there--
Speaker 1: Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Berkeley--but, but radical in the sense that, that they probably empowered you to exercise thought.  And you--Seattle University you were taught, okay.  And what I remember there is that it was a process, at least for me, based on my experience.  And that didn't take away from the professors or, or--in a lot of ways there were Jesuit professors.  And--but you were taught.  I mean you had to take some religious classes during that time, whether you were Catholic or not.  So it was a very different environment.  And so the, the, the courses I remember that I enjoyed the most were the ones that had a little bit more freedom of thought.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were lots of political science courses.  I loved political science, because, you know, really it, it was about interpreting, you know, different things that happened in life.  And, and then, I loved the debate classes where, you know, you got a chance to, to not only voice your opinion but then be able to back up your opinion, okay.  So those are the kinds of things that, that, you know, that I enjoyed quite a bit.
Speaker 1: What--you were so busy going to two schools and working.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you study?
Speaker 2: Again, very--I was very focused.  I didn't have a lot of personal time, you know.  I'd get up in the morning and go to school; then I'd go to work.  And I would study early in the morning; I would study, you know, late at night.  I also didn't have classes every day, so I think I had classes maybe--I, I had two or three days that were just nonstop, you know, from eight o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night, maybe an hour or two in between.  And then a couple of days I think I had maybe one class.  So I had to really put myself on a schedule to stay very, very focused.  But I, I was on--you know, I'm not really sure why I did that.  I'm not sure that--it's not something that I would really recommend.  But you know, I was on a, a mission to finish it and, and get done with it and move on to other things I wanted to do, and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 610730
Speaker 1: And one of those things was the trip to Europe.
Speaker 2: Europe, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: We, we went all over Europe.  We started in Germany, and, and we went London [England], I mean everywhere.  'Cause you know, at that time you could get a rail pass for a few hundred dollars and travel anywhere throughout the whole country.  And we were there for several, you know, many months, you know.  And it was just a, you know, a great experience.  And I, I really--to me that was, that was worth going through college in that kind of rapid pace.
Speaker 1: Tell me about an experience you had in, in Germany.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, you know, I think that the thing that was interesting during the time--again, this is, you know, '77 [1977], late '70s [1970s], and obviously I'm African American.  My, my traveling partner was Scandinavian.  So, you know, there's--and I don't know that this was in Germany.  This really was probably throughout Europe.  But at the time I had a pretty big Afro, and, but my hair was very soft.  And the thing that was always interesting is that the Europeans at the time would see her.  She had blond hair, and I had this Afro, and they always wanted to touch my hair.  And, and I think they thought my hair was gonna be brittle.  And when they came and they would, they would ask if they could touch my hair, and they'd touch it, and they'd realize it was so soft.  And they just got the biggest kick out of that (laughter).  And so, you know, and the thing was, see, you know, today if someone did that you would probably be offended or something.  But back then I, I really don't think they were doing it in an offensive way.  I think they were just curious.  You know, here are these two young girls, one white, one black, and you know, we're roaming all around Europe.  And you know, it wasn't a sight that they had seen, you know, a lot of, and they were just curious as to who we were and what we were doing and why we were there.  And we met so many wonderful people throughout our, our travels.  People were very--you know, we, we didn't have a lot of money.  I had saved a bunch of money since I had, was on full scholarship.  And so I had--when I graduated from college I didn't owe any money, and I had been working all through college.  So I'd taken my life's savings and gone over there, and, and we were trying to, you know, budget it so we could stay for a long period of time.  But we had great experiences.  We really did not have any real negative experiences during that time.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your favorite experience in Europe.
Speaker 2: I think my favorite experience was we spent a lot of time down in Sevilla [Seville, Spain], which is a university town, obviously in Spain.  And we, we got to a point there where we didn't have any money and were pretty low on money, and so we, you know, we got a little job teaching English, you know, for a short period of time.  And, and, and so you know, it, it was, it was about finding ways to survive, because--but, but not in a, in a, in a negative way.  It was just, it was just like an adventure.  And I think about it sometimes now, I, and I, I spend a lot of time going back to Europe.  It's one of my favorite things to do.  But it's very, very interesting to have that ex- first experience, which is to go to Europe and, and, and, and, and do it on a, a kind of a student budget, not have any, you know, fears.  Back then, I, I would tell you, I had no fears whatsoever about going anyplace or, or, or, or talking to people or--we'd get on a train, for example.  By the time we got off the train we'd have new friends, and we might stay at their place that night.  I mean it was that kind of environment.  We stayed at a lot of homes where people would actually registered their homes, and you could, you know, for very little money stay at a home, you know, a nice home and get a, you know, a nice shower and have, you know, a wonderful meal, and no one thought anything of that.  Whereas today, I would imagine that the, you know, people do less of those kinds of things.  So it was a very different time.
Speaker 1: Did you stay in any student hostels?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  We had--most of the time that's where--we never stayed at hotels.  We didn't have any money for hotels, you know, student hostels all the time.
Speaker 1: So you were meeting people from all over the world.
Speaker 2: All over the world.  I mean, you know, we were washing out clothes in, in, you know, where we could and, and getting, you know, mail wherever we could.  And, and, I mean it was a totally different experience.  But it was, it was really a life changing experience for me because I think what it did was, first of all, it was a great time for me to do it.  I hadn't made any commitments.  I had my degree [from Seattle University, Seattle, Washington]; I, I, I had a deferment.  I was gonna go--I was looking at several law schools.  You know, that was always the plan.  So basically, you know, I was free to experience whatever, you know, I needed to.  I came--one of the main reasons I came home, was that I got homesick.  After, you know, a while I got homesick, and I just wanted to see my mom [Thelma Roberson Arnold] and my brothers [Dirk Mayberry and Brett Mayberry] and my friends and, and, and, and you know, my, my, my, my dad [Donald Mayberry] and my family.  And, and as soon as I got home and had been home for, you know, just a few days, I was ready to go back, you know, 'cause I had, you know, I had seen them.  So now I just, you know--
Speaker 1: You want the excitement again.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was just a, it was a great experience.
Story_ID: 610731
Speaker 1: So when you did return, you had a desire to go to law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I had law school--I, I was gonna stay--I wanted to try to stay in Europe for a year if I could, and I didn't make it, you know, that long, and--or at least, you know, eight or nine months.  And, and so when I came back, I had some time between the time that law school would start.  And so I needed a job.  And a friend of mine, a childhood friend of mine, said to me that he was working at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], and he said, "You really ought to go down there; they're hiring people."  And I, I knew of IBM, but you know, I, I hadn't ever thought of that as a career for me.  But I went down there, and they hired me right away, and you know, I started working there.  And I had friends who were in sales.  And sales was something that I'd never thought about myself doing, even though I get--I realize now that many of the things we do are, are about selling ourselves or selling products, service, et cetera.  And I ended up, after being there for a short period of time, you know, wanting to go into sales.  And IBM did not have a lot of women at IBM at that time.  And in the Seattle [Washington] office they had only had one black female, and she was getting ready to be promoted.  She was older than me.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Her name was Alva Dickerson [ph.].  I, I will never forget her because she was kind of my first black woman role model.  And she, she was getting ready to get promoted, and I thought, here's my chance.  I went in to the branch manager and told him that I was--'cause I was working in an administrative capacity.  And, and I told him that I wanted to, you know, become, you know, one of their sales reps.  And, and he said, "Oh no; we've got a place for you, you know, here."  And I said, "No, but that's not really what I want to do."  And he kind of basically said you know, kind of go away.  So I, I did, and, and I, I worked, you know, talked to other people about what I should do and how I should reapproach it.  And, and finally, fast forward, I, I, I went back a couple of times, didn't get much encouragement.  And finally I went in and, and I said, once again, "I'd really like to enter your sales training program."  And he said, "No, Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Mayberry McKissack], we've got other plans for you."  And I said, "No, but you don't understand.  I have plans for myself.  And either you allow me to do that, or I'm gonna resign."  Because I, I already had a, a back, you know, (unclear) program with going to law school.  And he said well, now that you put it that way, I'm, you know, we'd be happy to have you in the program.  So I, I started in the program.  And you know, Seattle, again, as I said, different environment.  And so, and IBM was a very, very different environment because they did not have a lot of diversity at all, women particularly, and certainly people of color.  And I went to the training program as president of my.  And when, the day before I left to go to the training program, my manager pulled me aside, and he said, "Cheryl, I just wanna tell you," he said, "look, I know you're going off to Texas, and you're gonna go to the training program, but if things don't work out, don't worry.  I have a receptionist job for you when you come back."  And I remember--
Speaker 1: Who told this?
Speaker 2: This was my boss.
Speaker 1: Your boss.
Speaker 2: And I remember going home in tears, and my mom [Thelma Roberson Arnold] being really angry with me, and my mom telling me: "You go down there, and you do the best job that you can, and you don't let someone else determine what your destiny is."  And when I went down and became president of my class and when I came back, they give you a little welcome home party.  So he gave me a welcome home party, and he pulls me aside again and he says, "You know, I didn't really mean that; I just told you that 'cause I wanted you to work harder."
Speaker 1: A moment of inspiration.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was; it was a good lesson.
Speaker 1: So what position did you take on?
Speaker 2: I, I started out in their sales training program and then became a sales representative, selling products that they had.  And I spent two or three years doing that and got my first promotion.  And my first promotion allowed me to move down to the Bay Area, in San Francisco [California].  And I was doing a marketing staff function job there and spent many years in San Francisco in a variety of different sales, marketing, and then management jobs, and, and spent, eventually spent fourteen years with IBM over a var- wide variety of different cities.  I lived in San Francisco, and then I came to Chicago [Illinois] for the first time, and then I went to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and then I went to New York [New York], and then I went back to San Francisco, and then ultimately, after fourteen years, ended up in Chicago.
Story_ID: 610732
Speaker 1: What were your early impressions of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and corporate culture?  You had mentioned in Europe you had an Afro.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When did you get the Afro, and did you get rid of it once you entered the corporate environment?
Speaker 2: I had the Afro when I was in high school.  I had it actually when I was in high school, when I was at Franklin [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: So was that part of--did you have a militant moment, or was that a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  You know--
Speaker 1: --a style thing?
Speaker 2: --it was a style.  And, and, and also, again, as I said earlier, you know, the, the beauty of Franklin for me, I got to be who I wanted to be, you know, whatever I wanted to be.  And so, at that time, that's how I, you know, decided that I would express myself, so--
Speaker 1: So the year before you got to Franklin, two black girls with Afros were suspended.  But then you entered about a year later and nothing.
Speaker 2: No, no, I, I, I never had any issue, you know, had, never had any issue.  I think I had (cough), I think I had an Afro for most of my high school.  When you look at my high school graduation I have a big Afro, you know, and I kept it through most of college and, and when I, even when I started with IBM.  I didn't feel--at IBM, I did not really feel a need to, to change to, to fit the culture.  The--because I probably was pretty much, you know, like the culture that it represented.  I mean it is, it was about, I mean, men did not wear colored shirts.  I mean so the culture wasn't about black and white.  The culture was about, you know, men wear white shirts every day.  Men wear suits.  Women did not wear pants when, when I first started.  So those kinds of things didn't really bother me 'cause I didn't see them as a racial issue.  I saw them as a culture, a business cultural issue.  And, and I was really young, and so I was, you know, not opposed to, to, you know, indoctrinating myself into that, you know, to that culture.  I didn't find it, you know, that, you know, that rigid.  Now I, I had some experiences.  Again with Seattle [Washington] being, you know, a small percentage African American, my first territories were in all-white areas.  And I remember specifically one of my areas was right outside Seattle called--an area called Everett, Washington.  And I remember going up and trying to sell to a local newspaper there and the, the, the manager or the owner being very dismissive.  And the owner called back to, to my office and basically spoke to my branch manager, who, as it turned out in that particular time, was a black man.  And his name was Al Martin.  And he--the, the owner of this business, said, "You know, Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Mayberry McKissack] seems like a nice girl, but you know, I don't buy from, from them."  But he didn't realize that, that the branch manager happened to be African American.  And--
Speaker 1: And so what did the branch manager say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the branch manager said, "Well, you know, I'd like to come out and see you."  And so he went out and met with him.  And of course when he walked in, the, the, the gentleman just about fell on his chair was, of course, you know, apologizing, you know, one way and down the other.  So, you know, I had some experiences like that, but they, they were not every day experiences.  One of the reasons that I think I was able to avoid some of the experiences is because I worked for a company that was very well respected.  You know, IBM was the premium company, you know, for technology back in, in those days, and it still is in a, in a different fashion today.  And so having that IBM on your business card, just got you in the doors that, you know, if I were working for a smaller company, especially back during that time, would have never happened.
Speaker 1: What were you marketing?
Speaker 2: I started out started out marketing office products.  And so they had a number of different office products.  And then we also started marketing what was called office systems products, so these were getting more into system type products.  But you know, IBM sold typewriters during that time and, and supplies and all kinds of things like that.  And then they started selling more systems oriented projects--products, and so we were marketing primarily those type of products.
Story_ID: 610733
Speaker 1: In your--in the days in Seattle [Washington] in that capacity, are there, are there any other experiences that stand out, either in terms of the positive impact or the negative?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of the most positive impacts is, is that, you know, IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] probably has one of the best training programs of any company.  And so the ability to learn how to sell yourself, I got an opportunity to learn at a very, very young age.  And one of the things that they would do is that you would have to, before you could even go away to school, you would have to go around to all of the different managers and people within the office.  And you'd have like a little checklist, and you'd have to make presentations to all of them.  So I got, I got pretty good at making those presentations and being able to succinctly tell people what it is that I wanted, you know, what it was going to do for them, okay, and, and, and getting them to, to sign up and close the order.  So those were a very, you know, positive experience for me.  I had a great career at IBM.  I mean I, I, I spent--I was probably one of the few people--over the years I would talk to friends of mine, and, and they would have five or six jobs, but I only had one job, I mean working for one company.  But I had, you know, many, many jobs, because IBM would always be doing something new.  And I worked in three or four different divisions; I lived in five, four, four or five different cities, and so the experiences that I got were, were very positive experiences.
Story_ID: 610734
Speaker 1: Who were, you know, your bosses?  Who was the CEO of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], and then who were, you know, sort of the, the lower level bosses?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, back at the time when, when I was there, I mean, you know, I worked--and, and this is the good part and the bad part I think to some degree.  IBM has, has always been, obviously, an East Coast company.  I was way on the West and the Pacific Northwest, so we were pretty far removed from, you know, the, the, the, the Tom Watsons [Thomas J. Watson] and you know, the people that were really running, you know, you know, IBM, you know, during those days or, or whoever the, the top person was.  Now, as I got further up in my career and got promoted and ended up going to New York [New York], I worked for one of the presidents of one of the national distribution division, a gentleman by the name of Dave Thomas [David M. Thomas].  And, and so I got a chance to, to see--John Akers [John F. Akers] was running the company at that time, and I got a chance to go to Armonk [New York] and actually I was an aide to, to one of the presidents and got a chance to actually see how things, decisions were made in what we called the oval office, which was the big board room in Armonk.  And--but on a regional level, really, we, we were pretty far removed from that.  And the ma- you know, most of the people I had some very good experiences, and I had a couple of, of, of not so good experiences.  I had decided that I was going to get a graduate degree.  And when I came to Chicago [Illinois] the second time, I--
Speaker 1: Now wait.  Now what year is this?
Speaker 2: This was '86 [1986], '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, in that period, were there some highs and lows between, you know, 1977 and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there--
Speaker 1: --the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: --there were.  I, I think that, that the--a lot of it was during the, the timing, okay.  The, the timing that, that, that I went through those, you know, years, again, companies were just getting used to having blacks in those positions, you know.
Speaker 1: What about women?  Was, was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Women, women was a huge thing.  Again, when I, when I was in the Seattle [Washington] office, I was the only black woman in sales.  Sales was kind of the premium area, and black women weren't in sales, okay.  There was only, if I remember, one other woman, Caucasian woman.  And so, you know, you were always two and three and four, you know.  There weren't big numbers.  And so, just the whole, you know, women piece, you know, black--you know, the ethic piece came later, but just women.  IBM was a very male dominated, white male dominated organization.  That's what it was, you know, and--
Speaker 1: So help me see that.  How was that reflected in the culture?
Speaker 2: Well, it was reflected in, you know, women didn't wear pants, okay.  It was re- women always wore skirts.  You know, women wore the little white blouses and the little bows.  And you know, it was reflected very much in the management.  Very rarely would you have a, at least in the earlier days, you know, a, a female manager.  Again, all that has changed now, you know.  I have friends who I worked with who still are at IBM, and believe me, they're running things, and, and, and it's a very different environment, but--
Speaker 1: Was there like, you know, the country club, golf environment (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much.  You know, the things that were different were that a lot of the, the other associates there, they lived in the same neighborhoods; they socialized together.  Whereas a lot of the African Americans that were there, when, when it, when work was over, they went back to their own neigh- neighborhoods and their own friends, and they didn't socialize there.  So, they didn't have those kinds of relationships.  But we probably avoided some of that in Seattle, because again, Seattle was a, a, a different environment, and so there probably was a lot more intermingling in, in Seattle.  But when I moved to other places like California or when I came to Chicago or D.C. [Washington, D.C.], there seemed to be a lot more separate environments as opposed to environments that were all inclusive.
Story_ID: 610735
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] experience in New York [New York] and Chicago [Illinois].  How did those experience differ from the earlier experiences in Seattle [Washington]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, first of all, I was in a very competitive environment.  Seattle tends to be a lot more laid back.  People are, are not as outwardly competitive.  Now there're obviously some fantastic companies and businesses.  You've got Starbucks [Starbucks Corporation] and Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation] and all of those kinds of things, but, but the people, the style is very, very different.  For example, when I was in Chicago, I actually worked for an office in Michigan.  And I had decided that I wanted to go back and get my M.B.A.  And I thought living in Chicago, what perfect time to, to do that when you've got so many wonderful schools, both University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois] and Northwestern and you know, and I thought this would be a great opportunity.  And IBM had a program where they would actually sponsor, in the division I was in, two individuals per years, full tuition at their university of, of choice for their M.B.A.  And I, I didn't have a lot of female managers at IBM during my--throughout my career.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your managers over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I mean I had Al Martin, who I mentioned to you as one of my, one of my fondest memories.  I had--oh, gosh, I mean I had so many managers, you know, over the years.  You know, the ones that I tend to remember are probably the ones that made the biggest, you know, impact on me, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So who else made a big impact?
Speaker 2: Well, I had, I had another manager, and I, I won't give her name 'cause this story is, it made an impact, but maybe not so much in a positive way.  But, as I was saying, I didn't have a lot of female managers, but this particular time I did have a female manager.  And as a result of having this female manager, I, when I decided I wanted to go back to graduate school, and I wanted to try to get into this program that IBM offered, I, you know, went to my manager.  And I had done very well and made my, you know, objectives and all of that.  And, and I had read the document that said here is the qualifications you need to have, and I felt like I certainly had the qualifications to apply.  I knew it was very competitive.  And my manager got very upset with me and said you know, "I don't know, you know, who you think you are, you know, trying to go to this program.  I, I got my M.B.A., and I worked at night.  And, and you know, I had two children and you know, et cetera, et cetera, and I'm not, I have no intention of supporting you."  And that was a, a real wakeup call for me because, again, I had really been used to a very male dominated environment.  And here I had this female manager, and I'm, and I--and mistakenly I think I thought that perhaps I was gonna have more camaraderie because she was female.  And, and I don't think it really was racial.  I think it really was about the fact that she truly believed that, you know, you had to work, you know, twice as hard as a female to be successful with IBM.  And she wasn't--she had looked at the road that I was going and, and thought it was perhaps an easy road, and she, she just wasn't gonna support that.  So, so that taught me a good lesson about making sure that I've prepared myself.  I, I ended up going ahead and, and applying and getting accepted and, and going to Northwestern Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] and, and graduating from there in '89 [1989].  But it was a, it was a good lesson about making sure that, you know, you surround yourself with people that are, you know, that are positive and that you understand what help they can provide, what you need to do for, for that help, and also to prepare yourself in, in the case that they are unwilling to help you.
Story_ID: 610736
Speaker 1: And you had been climbing the ladder at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] over the years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you one of the few women who had achieved some--?
Speaker 2: During those days and, and certainly one of the few minority women.  There were very few of us in those days.  And, and, and again, you know, that still was a time where there weren't a lot of women in, in, at IBM, and so, but it was changing.  It was definitely changing, and it certainly changed over the, the years.  But it was, all in all, I would say that it was a, it was a good experience.  And there were, just in any environment, there were ups and downs.  But the, the, the, the lessons that I learned out of it were that, that I could compete, okay.  I had to work hard; in some cases I felt like I had to maybe work a little bit harder than, you know, than others.  I had disappointments along the way.
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my last jobs was a branch manager job, which I really wanted, you know, had worked very hard for.  And I had thought that there was a job available in Chicago [Illinois], and there was a job available in, in San Francisco [California].  And I really wanted the job in Chicago, 'cause at that time my, my boyfriend [Eric McKissack], who became my husband, was here.  And, and I'd always moved for IBM, always put my personal life, you know, on the backburner, and when the opportunity came up, I was sent back to San Francisco.  Now, I got the job and the position, but I had to move again.  And as a, a, a single, black female, it became challenging to establish any kind of long term relationship when you're moving every two to three years.  And, and so I was disappointed.  I was disappointed that the first time that I felt I had asked for my personal life to, to, to be considered, you know, it wasn't considered.  But it was a lesson, because companies are not necessarily put in business to consider your personal life, that, you know, you have to make that a priority and decide what opportunities and organizations you're gonna--are gonna be best suited to, to meet those objectives.  So it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so they wanted--
Speaker 2: --a good lesson.
Speaker 1: --you to move to--
Speaker 2: Back to San Francisco to be the western area branch manager, which I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how was, how was that position for you?
Speaker 2: Well, the position was great.  I mean the position itself was great.  It was certainly a great time for me to, you know, be responsible for, you know, at that time of a very, you know, big budget and lots of people and, and getting a chance to, you know, continue with my managerial skills and all those kinds of things.  But, but it wasn't a good time from a personal standpoint because I realized that at, at that time it was time for me to start putting my life together in some kind of balance, you know.  To this point, I had been just totally pretty much career focused, and it was, it was time for me to start thinking about what else I wanted to, to do.  And that was the primary reason that I decided to leave IBM, because I realized that, that the culture there was probably not gonna be conducive to me doing some of the things I wanted to do on a personal basis.  And, and so it was time to, to find a, a different type and environment.
Speaker 1: What year did you move back to Seattle [Washington] for this branch manager position?
Speaker 2: Move--well, the branch--
Speaker 1: I mean San Francisco--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --back to San Fran.
Speaker 2: Yeah, San Francisco, I, I left--let's see--that would have been probably in the '80s [1980s].  You know, I, I left, I left Chicago, and then I went back to, to San Francisco.  It was right before I left IBM.
Story_ID: 610737
Speaker 1: But this was after business school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Business school was in '89 [1989], so, so actually this was in the '90s [1990s].  Excuse me.  It was in the '90s [1990s] because earl- you know late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s] that I went back to--
Speaker 1: So how did it occur (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: --that, you know, you had this female boss who was resistant to the idea of you, you know, getting this M.B.A. when you wanted it?  How did it happen that you were able to make that move?
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, one of the things I've learned is that, you know, there are always gonna be obstacles, okay.  And, and this was a personal vendetta.  It, it really didn't have anything to do with me.  She had to, to work a certain way to, to get what she wanted, and she really felt that everyone should go down that path.  Well, what you learn is that everyone doesn't go down the same path, okay.  When she was coming up--she was older than I was--and when she was coming up they didn't have some of those opportunities.  So I had made my decision at that time that I was gonna get my M.B.A., and I was gonna get it whether I stayed with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] or whether I had to leave.  So it really, it wasn't a choice, you know, that, that it was either or.  And I, I found another environment within IBM that was very supportive, and, and they, they supported me in getting my M.B.A.  And I ended up staying with the company for several, you know, years after that and then again went in the early '90s [1990s] to, back to San Francisco to do the branch manager job.  But at that time, after fourteen years, I felt--I'd never worked anywhere else out of college.
Speaker 1: What year did you enter Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: And what was that experience?  Were you going to school in the day or at night?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was going through the executive M.B.A. program, so that was a, a program that worked pretty much Fridays and Saturdays, so all day Friday and, and, and Saturday.  And I believe it was a couple, maybe--I, I don't know if it was every week or every other week.  And it was a great program, because all the people that were in the, the, the school with you at the time were all professionals, and they all had jobs.  And, and you got a chance to, to, first of all, have some of the best professors in, I think in the, in the country.  And so the educational environment was really great.  But what was great for me is that I went back and got my M.B.A. after I had been in the working environment for many years.  So I probably had ten, eleven years of, of business and, and management experience.  And so, you know, learning about certain things and then having real experiences to apply it was a good environment for me.  And I think what's happening, and you know, I, I teach at, at Northwestern today, but I think what's happening today but with the schools, really requiring in a lot of cases for students to get some experience instead of just going straight through.  I think for me, again, it made my educational experience a lot richer, because I had situations and, and things to apply it to as opposed to just looking at it from a theoretical perspective.
Story_ID: 610738
Speaker 1: Did you know Jimmy Alexander--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]?  He probably went slightly after you.  What classes did you take at Kellogg?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you, you have a lot of the standard classes, you know, business classes, economics classes, some, you know, marketing classes, but you know, standard, you know.  There, there weren't--one of the things with this program, it was a two year program.  We took the exact same schedule that a full-time student would take.  So we didn't, we did--you weren't able to cut out any classes.  Because the, the, the time period was somewhat condensed, we--the one thing that the program perhaps didn't allow as much is a lot of electives and a lot of optional classes, because you had to take all the core classes.  But, you know, I was very interested in the, you know, management part, since that was what I was doing in my life, and I really focused on that.  But there were all of the traditional classes that you just had to take, you know, certainly all the economic and finance and, and business classes that, you know, were expected.
Speaker 1: Who were your favorite professors?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, you know, I, I, I, I can't say that I had a favorite professor.  I would say that I had favorite classes.  I loved--the classes I loved were the classes that allowed--you know, we used a lot of case studies, and so I loved classes where they were talking about real business issues, you know, where you had to solve it.  You know, you, you, you, you identified what the problem was and then you came up with ways to actually solve that problem.  And I found that was something that I really enjoyed.
Speaker 1: Which classes allowed you to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, some of the--you know, almost all of the classes had, almost of all of the classes had an element of that, okay.  There were, you know, classes from bus- all the business classes definitely allowed you to do that, where you were actually looking at corporations and how they handled problems, how they grew their business and those kinds of things.  So I really enjoyed, you know, those classes, you know.  Even some of the, the economic classes were--you know, I loved some of the, the econ classes because, you know, again, the problem solving piece was really what, what drew me to those classes.
Speaker 1: Was that--I mean I understand the executive M.B.A. program slightly different than if you're, you know, going during the week full time.  But were you active in an African American M.B.A. association?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't, and, and really just because I didn't really have the time.  I, I still was working full time during that period.  And about a year after I started the program--and again, IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] was paying for the program, and then a year after I started the program I got promoted again.  And I was, you know, moved to Washington, D.C.  So the last year of the program I actually commuted back, you know, for every class that I needed to take.  So my schedule was--and I was managing several states.
Speaker 1: What was your position in--
Speaker 2: I, I was managing as a, a sales manager of, for an office in Washington, D.C., and, but I had responsibility for several states.
Speaker 1: What states?
Speaker 2: North Carolina and, and, and all, all the surrounding--
Speaker 1: The Mid-Atlantic.
Speaker 2: --states, Mid-Atlantic.  And so, as a result of that, between traveling for the job, traveling to, to go to class, I didn't have a lot of time.
Story_ID: 610739
Speaker 1: And you were trying to maintain a relationship in Chicago [Illinois] at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yes, at that--yes.
Speaker 1: And this is with your now husband?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what's his name?
Speaker 2: Eric McKissack (cough).
Speaker 1: And how, how did that work for you, the balance?
Speaker 2: It was tough.  It was extremely tough.  He is very, you know, patient and very understanding, but it was extremely tough.  And I had to, you know, again stay very focused, but extremely tough.
Speaker 1: What were you experiencing internally during these IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] years and the M.B.A. years [at Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were climbing very rapidly through the corporate culture.  What was happening to you as a person?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was enjoying it, to be honest with you.  You know, I loved the environment.  You know, it was rigid and maybe a little more rigid than I would, you know, have, have preferred, because it had a lot of existing culture.  But, but I, I, I really, I was running up against ob- obstacles from time to time.  But I would say that, that a lot of my obstacles during that time were really more about IBM's culture between women and men and their culture as opposed to the racial segment of it, because there, there, there weren't that many, you know--wasn't that they had a huge number of African Americans.  Now, later on in my career, other companies, you know, like Xerox [Xerox Corporation], formed associations for black employees in order to make sure that they were getting promoted and, and having the right kind of tools and things.  IBM had a lot of informal groups like that, but I don't remember there being a, a IBM sanctioned group.  The, the Xerox actually had--it was sanctioned by management, and management, you know, actually promoted it.  So we didn't really have those kinds of things.  But what I was enjoying was the opportunity to live in all the different cities.  When, you know, people laugh about IBM and say I've been moved, but you know, that truly was the case.  I mean, it's changed a lot now.  You don't have to necessarily move all over the country, but you know, I moved five--four or five times, and, but it was always in a big city.  I, I, I requested that I move to a big city.  I didn't want to be in a small city as a, as a single African American female.  And so it was a, it was a good experience, lots of, lots of learnings.
Speaker 1: And I imagine many of these positions, a branch manager position you held in the Mid-Atlantic region, were lucrative (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --compared to other women of color--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: --at the company.
Speaker 2: --I, I mean IBM, you know, used to be kind of a joke.  You know, you'd, you'd come in and your boss would--you'd say, "Oh, gosh, I bought a new house," and he'd say, "That's really good because you've gotta work really hard."  And so, you know, I, I was fortunate enough to be able to buy a home at a very early age, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Where did you buy your--
Speaker 2: My first home--
Speaker 1: --first home?
Speaker 2: --was in, at Seattle [Washington] when I moved to the Lynnwood, Washington, area for my first assignment.  And it was cheaper to buy a home than it was to, to rent.  And so, you know, you know, you don't get rich working for IBM.  That's, it's not that kind of environment, unless you're running it at the top level, but, but you have a very comfortable, you know, lifestyle.  And, and I was young, and so, you know, I was able to do a lot of things.  You know, it afforded me a lot of opportunities.
Story_ID: 610740
Speaker 1: What were some of the shifts in technology at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] during your tenure there?
Speaker 2: Well, probably the biggest shift in technology at IBM, and I be- had an opportunity to be a part of it, I think that's one of the reasons I stayed at IBM for fourteen years is because they did have--there was always change.  Change is something I've always liked, and there was always change.  And that was when IBM brought out PCs, personal computers.  And I worked in that de- that division that brought out the personal computers.  And they actually--my first assignment to Chicago [Illinois] was to run one of the personal computer stores right up here off of Michigan Avenue, Michigan and Erie [Street].  And so I, I ran that store, the IBM personal computer store.  And you know, if you think in terms of computers today, I mean it, you know, they've changed our lives.  But IBM was very much at the forefront of, and of, of those products as well as I would say on the small systems side, having what used to be the power in a mainframe but in a small business system that could be used for small businesses.  So those were two of the I think key areas of change that, that IBM was very instrumental in, in doing.
Speaker 1: What intrigued you about marketing these high tech products?
Speaker 2: Well, what, I think what intrigued me is, is, first of all, that all the people that you get a chance to meet, the different companies.  You know, as I said, having an IBM business card got you into a lot of doors, okay--
Speaker 1: What doors?
Speaker 2: --you know.  I mean any door, any company, you know.
Speaker 1: Give me some examples.
Speaker 2: Well, any major company that you could think about, okay.  Almost all of those companies had some IBM products.  Most of them started with typewriters, okay.  So the, the ability to, to go into almost any corporation.  IBM branched out many years later into segments and, and, and all of that--but you know, to, to have the ability to, to go in there, make presentations, convince people that they needed the products and services, and then be able to execute those, you know, those plans, because you know, you'd sell them products, but then, you know, a lot of cases you had to then go and, and develop the plan.
Speaker 1: So give me an example of one of your biggest clients.
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, geez, there's so many clients, you know, so many clients.  It's really hard to, to pinpoint, you know, I think one client.  But I, I, I think--
Speaker 1: Just to give us a sense, like people who, who haven't had access to that world, the high tech world.  And, and, and as you mentioned, IBM is at the pinnacle at this time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think I, I saw a lot more of that in my later years when in, at companies like U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation], where you really had a chance to, to, to be involved with that.  But you know, you know, almost any clon- any corporation you could imagine, big or small, had some dealing with, with, with IBM.  Now, I was in a lot of different areas with IBM, so in some cases, you know, we might be selling directly to corporations.  In some cases we were selling through, you know, other organizations.  In some cases, like when I was in the personal computer area, we were actually selling to end users.  So that was a, it, it was a really interesting situation because you've got IBM, who, you know, people know for big mainframes, but you're actually selling personal computers to individuals in a retail environment.  And that was all packaged, you know, in IBM.
Story_ID: 610741
Speaker 1: So you were doing this commute between D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and Chicago [Illinois], and ultimately you got your M.B.A.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did you do after you got the M.B.A.?  Did that change the landscape at all?
Speaker 2: I didn't get the landscape, because I, I felt as though that it would really assist me with moving ahead with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  I really felt that I had already had eleven years of experience with IBM.  I'd had several manager positions.  I really felt that I, IBM was not a place that promoted that you had to have an M.B.A. in order to move ahead.  I mean, they really promoted that you had to have experience.  So I, I never thought of the M.B.A. as really a tool that was going to help me within IBM because I had already been there.  What I did though was I thought about the M.B.A.  You know, I'd worked--the only place I'd ever worked out of undergrad was at IBM.  And I, I didn't see myself, as time grew on, that I would be at IBM until I retired.  And so the M.B.A. was really about having other options, you know, getting more education and more--learning more things in order to be able to have other options for things I might want to do in the, in the, the future.  And a lot of those things were entrepreneurial in nature that I was interested in.  And, and so I started to start thinking about pursuing that.  And even when I was at IBM, I made--I, I started a business with a co-IBMer.  And it was our first business, a, a chain of retail stores that sold and rented evening wear for women called One Moment in Time [Chicago, Illinois].  And, and when I left IBM, I, I actually went into that business full time for a period of time.
Speaker 1: So when you left IBM, where, where were living at that time?
Speaker 2: I was in San Francisco [California], and I moved back to Chicago.  And we had opened a store in Michigan and--in Birmingham, Michigan, and then we had opened a store in Chicago, downtown Chicago on Delaware Street.
Speaker 1: And how did you decide to go in this particular business?  You were renting formalwear.
Speaker 2: To, to men and women--well, to women, excuse me, not to men, formalwear to, to women.  And actually, I have to say it was my partner who I had met at IBM, she was also--we were--had very similar career paths.  She had gone back to Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  I had gone to, to Northwestern [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].  And, and because there were so few African American women, we'd go to different management conferences and events and we'd always be one of the two there, and we got to be very good friends.
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: Her name, Bonita Coleman Stewart.  And so she, it was actually she had heard about the idea.  It was an idea that had been started in Europe.  And there had been a British woman [Joanna Doniger] who had brought the idea to New York [New York] and had a, a store there called One Night Stand, I think it was called.  And, and so we thought that this might be an interesting idea, and we were eventually originally gonna be a franchise.  And so we, we went to meet her in New York.  And after meeting her and after talking to her, you know, we had this Harvard M.B.A. and this, you know, Northwestern M.B.A., and of course we probably thought we knew more than we really knew, and we, we walked out of there and said why should we give her a cut of our business?  We'll just, you know, we'll just start one ourselves.  So we ended up starting a similar kind of business, first off starting in Michigan, 'cause that's where my partner lived at the time, and then in Chicago.
Story_ID: 610742
Speaker 1: So tell me about the early days of this business [One Moment in Time].
Speaker 2: Well, the, the business was a very interesting business.  It was extremely entrepreneurial.  It really kind of started my taste for, for the entrepreneurial path, which, you know, I, I, I really--it's kind of interesting, spending all that time in Corporate America and then going into a very entrepreneurial environment.  Retail is a very tough business.  We [Mayberry McKissack and Bonita Coleman Stewart] found that just because we happened to love clothes and happened to love to buy them, we don't necessarily need to start a business doing that.  So it was, it was, I would say, a real learning experience.  The business was--the first store was very successful, which was in Michigan [Birmingham, Michigan].  And I think we made a lot of entrepreneurial, you know, mistakes thinking that we could duplicate it.  We moved very fast.  We opened another store in Chicago [Illinois], and then we ended up doing a franchise store in San Francisco [California], and so, the early days were, were, were tough.  We put our own money in the business.  We did get some funding later, but, but primarily the business was started with our, our money that we had both received from IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  We both left IBM.  But we loved it.  We absolutely loved it, and it, it was just a business that, that, that it's time had not come.  Interesting enough, I just read a few, a few months ago that the same kind of business that we were doing is now being done online.  And so women can rent purses, and, and they're gonna expand; they're supposedly in the future gonna expand to evening wear and things like that.  But now they can do purses and, and other kinds of things.  And so some of the issues we had with, you know, the costs and, and expense really are avoided now in that online model.  So--
Speaker 1: What year did you start this company?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see here; let's see.  This was probably in '91 [1991], probably '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: What year did you open the Chicago store?
Speaker 2: Chicago was open a coup- probably '92 [1992].  We opened, we opened one store, and a year later we opened another.  We were moving very, very fast, yeah.
Speaker 1: How long would you say this is?
Speaker 2: But it, the, the period of the time that we were involved in it was probably four to five years.  Now, I didn't work full time in the store until I left IBM.  But it was, it was, it was very interesting, very interesting.

Story_ID: 610745
Speaker 1: So I want to start out by having you talk about your--let's start with your father and what you know about his background and his growing up, his name first.
Speaker 2: Donald Mayberry.  And he grew up--he's--was born and raised in Kansas and--Wichita, Kansas, grew up there.  And ended up going into the [U.S.] Armed Forces, and found his way to Seattle, Washington, after getting out of the Armed Forces, and started college at the University of Washington, where he met my mom [Thelma Roberson Arnold].  And they got married and had three children.
Speaker 1: So you know anything about his, his growing up?  Do you remember any stories?  Was he a talkative person?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was an only child, grew up in Illinois actually, and had a sister who died as a, a young child.  I think she was about five, so he ended up being raised as an only child.  He always had a very entrepreneurial spirit about him, and I, I sometimes think that that's where I got some of my interest in it.  He always believed in working extremely hard.  He felt that if you worked hard enough, you could do anything you wanted to do.  And he really talked about that a lot as, as we grew up.  And, and he always wanted us to be the very best of what we could be.  So one of the things that he would do is on Friday nights we would have spelling bees.  He thought it was really important that African Americans knew how to spell.  He said that was one of the things that, you know, he believed held us back, is 'cause we didn't know how to spell and, and couldn't talk succinctly about our ideas and thoughts.  And so he thought it was very important that we knew how to do that.  So I think both my older brother [Dirk Mayberry] and I are pretty good spellers (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he talk about growing up in Wichita?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Wichita was a very--fairly segregated area.  Blacks lived in one area.  Whites lived in another area.  And it was pretty much that way, you know, I think throughout his life.  My dad died when he was in his fifties, so, and he's been gone over twenty years, so he would be just about in his eighties if he were living.  And so, you know, obviously that's, at the time when he was growing up, it was a very different environment.  And my grandfather, his, his father [Denver Mayberry], was a minister.  So he was a minister's child, and, and that always has its own, you know, challenges, to, to be able to fit in, and, and you know, you spend a lot of time in church, and religious beliefs and those kinds of things.  But my grandfather also had this work ethic, I mean always had two or three jobs, you know.  He was a barber; he was a minister; he was, you know, he, you know, he cleaned buildings.  I mean he always had all these different jobs, and, and that was the way he raised his family.  But my grandfather and my grandmother [Beatrice Jones Keith] divorced, and my grandfather [Mayberry McKissack's step-grandfather, Warren Keith] ended up moving down to a small town in Kansas called Coffeyville, Kansas.  And that's where he really spent a lot of his childhood.  But he went back and forth from Wichita to Coffeyville, Kansas, which was just right over the border and--Tulsa [Oklahoma] border, so.
Story_ID: 610746
Speaker 1: How far back do you think you know does your father's [Donald Mayberry] family know their history?  Do you know that?
Speaker 2: I think that when my grandmother [Beatrice Jones Keith]--both of my grandparents on both sides are, are deceased now.  But my grandmother on my father's side lived until she was in her nineties.  And she actually knew quite a bit of her history, you know, mainly through stories, you know, stories that were told, you know, throughout the family.  And we spent quite a bit of time with them when we were, were very young.  And so, you know, I would hear, you know, stories about, you know, things that had happened and, and what have you.  On my mother's [Thelma Roberson Arnold] side (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was that, were those, was that family, was it a Kansas history, or was it a so--
Speaker 2: It was a Kansas history, pretty much a Kansas, a Missouri, Kansas history.  And, and, and their experiences were very different than my mother's side, 'cause my mother's side was a southern history.  My grandfather [Robert Roberson (ph.)] was from Alabama.  My grandmother [Callie Roberson] was from Florida and then ended up in Alabama.  And they spent most of their life in a small town in Alabama, Florence, Alabama, and had thirteen kids.  And, and so they had a very different history, I think a very different experience than what my, what my dad had.  You know, I think there weren't--you know, there were a lot more, you know, African Americans in the South than there were in the, the Midwest, and so, you know, his experience I think was very different.  So, for me it was really the, the contrast of the two experiences.  And, and I didn't have either of those because I grew up in the Pacific Northwest.  And when I would go down to--down south, we would go in the summers, down to Alabama, via the Greyhound bus.  And, and it, it was a very different experience because I was born in the mid--you know, 1955.  But by the time that I was, you know, eight or nine years old, you know, it was early '60s [1960s], and there was a lot going on if you think in terms of what was happening to our country.  And I can remember not understanding it, because I would see signs.  And we would stop at the little places with--that the bus would stop at, you know, for, you know, for refreshments and you know, and that kind of thing, and I'd see, you know, colored only signs.  I mean, those things were still there very much in the, in the early '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 610747
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about your mother's side of the family.  You--her name, can we start with her name?
Speaker 2: Thelma, Thelma Mayberry--
Speaker 1: Okay, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Arnold [Thelma Roberson Arnold].
Speaker 1: --but what was, what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Roberson.
Speaker 1: Roberson.
Speaker 2: Thelma Roberson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And talk about--did she talk about growing up much?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: What did she, what did--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she say?
Speaker 2: Well, she had a very different life, you know, first of all, a large family, thirteen kids, my [maternal] grandfather [Robert Roberson (ph.)] worked as a custodian, mother [Callie Roberson] worked as a cook for a doc, doctor, a family, a white family--not much money at all, very little money, and, and obviously had to go many, many different places with thirteen kids.  And so, she--I think they got some type of preferential treatment a little bit because my grandmother was very well known in the South and, and had done some midwife activities.  And so she had brought a lot of the people who were, you know, politically inclined, and some of them she had brought into the world, right.  So I think that she had, I think she had, you know, they got, they got some favoritisms, as you will, but, but a very--it was a pretty hard life.  I mean just, you know, trying to make ends meet.  And, and some of the things that obviously that we're talking about here today and things that we're doing today just weren't even thought of, you know, just weren't even a possibility.
Speaker 1: So your grandmother was a midwife in Florence [Alabama] then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she was, and a cook, yeah--
Speaker 1: And then she had--
Speaker 2: --domestic work.
Speaker 1: --thirteen kids herself--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had thirteen kids.
Speaker 1: --so she--now, did your mother talk about any of her memories of that time, I mean that you can sort of think of or like a story that you remember, you know, that she's told?
Speaker 2: When she was growing up?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The, the--you know, she didn't talk a lot about a lot of stories.  I think the, the main things that I remember, just the--there was kind of a contrast between where she was living, and then my grandmother had a brother and, and a sister, and they had moved to New York [New York], had migrated to New York.  And the, the brother became a doctor, and the, my great-aunt became a social worker.  And so, as the kids grew up, since there were so many of them, when they got into high school, then they went to New York to live with, with the aunt.  And that's how they were able to, to raise the kids, is to, you know, my, my great-aunt took, took in these kids, because her and my uncle never married, never had children.  And so they just, you know, took in her brothers and, and sisters.  So my mom ended up going to New York and living most of her teenage years in New York.  And this was, you know, right around the time--my mom was born in '34 [1934], so this was around the time when you had a lot of things going on in Harlem [New York, New York].  And there was a, a pretty prominent, you know, African American community located in--a lot of them lived in Queens [New York].  Even before Harlem, they lived in Queens.  And so my mom spent a lot of, of her, her teenage years in, in New York, in Queens growing up and being surrounded by people who were, you know, able to kind of get outside of the, the, some of the poverty issues and, and had gone on and gone to school and become, you know, as my uncle was.  I think he was one of the first, you know, physicians, and, and he lived 'til he was ninety years old.
Story_ID: 610748
Speaker 1: Now, your parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry], who are you most like, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what, you know, it's, it's really hard to say because since I didn't have an opportunity to really get to know my father as I got to--got older and became an adult, I think I have characteristics of both.  Obviously my mother is still living and, and you know, I, I'm a--I see her, you know, as often as I can.  And so I get a chance to see the, you know, us evolve, where I didn't really get that opportunity with my father because I was barely thirty before my father passed.  But I think that disposition I'm probably more like my mother, but I think a lot of the, the entrepreneurial traits that my father had certainly were passed on to me.  My mom is not an entrepreneur and has not, you know, that's not something that would probably is a big interest to her.  But I think I'm a combination.  But--and it would have been interesting I think to have seen over the years as I have evolved, it would have been interesting to see whether or not, you know, I was more like my father in some of those areas.  But you know, we, we had a short time really together, so.  You know, I, I think I still have a lot of unanswered questions about that.
Story_ID: 610749
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is living in Coffeyville, Kansas.  My parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] for a while were, were having some financial difficulties, and so I was sent to live with my grandparents in, in Kansas, in Coffeyville, Kansas, very small town, one of those towns where everybody knows everyone.  My [paternal] grandmother [Beatrice Jones Keith] had lived there for a good portion of her life, my grandmother and my, my step-grandfather [Warren Keith], who for me was always my grandfather.  I always had three grandfathers because by the time I was born, my grandmother had remarried and stayed married until, you know, 'til she passed.  So I always had, you know, a third grandfather.  And I thought that, quite frankly, everybody did and was surprised when I found out you really only had two, right.  But my earliest, I think, memory was that when I was in--at Kansas, I remember one day--my grandfather kind of spoiled me--at least that's what they say--and I remember him buying me these, you know, shiny yellow boots.  And, and I was told not to go get them--put them in the mud or whatever.  And I remember going out and putting them--doing exactly what I wasn't told to do and my grandfather just, you know, furiously trying to clean them up before my grandmother got home.  And--but I had very good memories of living down there.  So it was a small town, very easy living.  You know, I had two adoring, you know, grandparents who, you know, basically I think I got probably whatever I wanted.  And my grandmother was a, a seamstress, and she would make my clothes.  And she would make the most beautiful dresses with lace, you know, things that you don't see today because nobody spends that kind of time in, in that kind of detail.  And so those are my, my earliest memories, and I probably was maybe three or four.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother was very talented then.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How--I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you think about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, this is on--this, this is actually my dad's mother.
Speaker 1: Your dad, your dad?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what--and so your--
Speaker 2: My dad's mother.
Speaker 1: Right, and he--and so your dad's fa- wasn't he the minister that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was the--
Speaker 2: That was my dad's--
Speaker 1: --minister.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Of what, what, what faith?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist, okay.  So what age were you you think at that time that you say the earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Well, probably, you know, two, three, four, because those were the years when we lived in Kansas.  And we lived either in Wichita [Kansas]--Wichita primarily, and then I went to live with my grandmother and my grandfather down in Coffeyville.  So, but we lived in, in Wichita.  And my earliest memories were going to church all the time (laughter).  And, and we were the, you know, the, the kids of the pastor, so that meant you went to church in the morning; you went to church in the afternoon, you know.  And so my earliest memories were just spending--Sundays were, were church all day.  I mean, that was pretty much what it was.  And, and then both my, my grandparents on my, on my father's side were very involved in the community.  You know, they lived in--you know, my grandmother lived in the little town; my [paternal] grandfather [Denver Mayberry] lived in Wichita, but they were known.  They had lived there for so long, they knew everyone.  So, you know, my earliest memories were that we couldn't--it was really difficult to do something bad because, you know, before we got home, you know, he already knew about it, or she already knew about it.  So, you know, we always kind of had that little bit of a, of a microscope.
Story_ID: 610750
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you think of the church service, what--do, do any songs come back to you or any, any memories or si- I mean anything that--
Speaker 2: Well, we, we was a traditional, you know, Baptist church, you know, with, you know, traditional music, traditional, you know, types of preaching, I mean maybe quite a bit different than it is today.  I mean, today, you know, you, you get probably a lot more, you know, opinions and things whereas, you know, I think back then they really stuck more to kind of the, the, the scripture.  The scripture really guided the sermons and that kind of thing whereas today you, you know, you hear a lot of contemporary things.  And, and back then, you know, you really didn't hear a lot of contemporary things.  But as a small child, you know, you know, I'm not sure how much of that I really took in.  You know, we started out in Sunday school, and we ended up, you know, in the evening service or afternoon service, and so it was just, it was just all, you know, church.  And, and the, and the music was a, a huge part of it, but they weren't big choirs like they are today.  You know, today you just--the choirs are just magnificent.  You know, there might have been, you know, fifteen people, you know, and, and some could sing, and some couldn't, you know, but at that time you thought everyone could, right.  And so, but it always--my memories I think mostly was that it was a very family orientated activity.  And you know, when I say family, I mean very extended family.  So it wasn't just family, your family; it was, you know, the, the deacons, and it was, you know, all the people in the church.  And, and since you were the granddaughter of the, the pastor, everyone knew you, and everyone was your mom or your dad or whatever, and you obeyed everybody.
Speaker 1: So you're saying--so your grandfather's name was, say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Denver.
Speaker 1: Denver?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, Denver Mayberry.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Beatrice.
Speaker 1: Beatrice.  But Beatrice [Beatrice Jones Keith] got married--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to someone else.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And my other grandfather was Sonny [Warren Keith] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, (laughter) so he--okay.
Story_ID: 610751
Speaker 1: So you said you were there until age four?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, but you, you're the, you're the middle child, right?
Speaker 2: I'm the middle child, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you have two broth--
Speaker 2: Two brothers, older--
Speaker 1: Two broth--
Speaker 2: --and younger.
Speaker 1: Their names?
Speaker 2: My older brother is Dirk [Dirk Mayberry], and my younger brother is Brett [Brett Mayberry].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so they were living--were they all--what's the age difference?
Speaker 2: My older brother is about a year older, and my younger brother is about four and a half years younger.  And so when we were in Kansas, my younger brother wasn't born yet.  And he was born toward kind of the end of when we were living there before we moved to Seattle [Washington].  We were originally born, born in Seattle.  I was originally born in Seattle, but we left and went back to Kansas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then came back to Seattle.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold]--I mean, I understand how your father [Donald Mayberry] got there, but how did your mother?  That's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's really interesting.  My father was, as I said, in the, the [U.S.] Armed Forces and, and ended up being Hawaii, and stopped in Seattle on the way back, and ended up staying there.  My mother was in New York [New York], because she was living with my uncle and--my great-uncle--and, and his sister.  And, and she graduated from high school, and she--one of her sisters, one of her older sisters, had married someone who I think was in the Armed Forces as well, and they were living in Seattle.  And she actually came out to visit, and that's how she got to Seattle and ended up going to, also going to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  And that's where she met my dad.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about the difference between New York and Seattle, you know, in that way or not in those--?
Speaker 2: Well, New York, you know, I think for her it was very different because it was a very different time in the sense that, you know, Seattle was just so different than any place, you know, any place I've ever lived, and I've lived lots of different places.  And, and when she was in New York, I mean she was living in Queens, and it was a fairly black community, and, and most of her activities were centered around that.  And, and Seattle was very different, because even today only about 6 percent of the population is, is African American.  And back then I'm sure it was much smaller.  I don't know exactly what it was, but I'll bet it was probably even, you know, 2 or 3 percent maybe or, or maybe even less.  And so it was a very--and it was so far from New York, so it was almost like, you know, another end of the earth.  But I think for her it was, you know, it was an opportunity.  And my uncle, who was the physician, basically, he, you know, told all the girls that, you know, he wanted them to go to school.  And, but he wanted all of them to be nurses.  So she, she went, started out.  She didn't finish college, but she started out to be nurse and, and followed, you know, his, his direction.  She told me one, one time that what she really wanted to do was be a social worker, but he, he wasn't having that.  You either be nurse or that's it.
Speaker 1: Or that's it, right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, those were the choices.
Story_ID: 610752
Speaker 1: So you're saying you were in, in Wichita [Kansas] for, until you were age four and you moved?
Speaker 2: We were--probably at about five, you know, we ended up coming back to Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what is your memory of that, you know, coming back?  Where did you--I mean what is your memory of that, 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Coming back to Seattle?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I mean that would--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't have much of a memory when I was here the first time.
Speaker 1: Right, so you wouldn't have had.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: No, but I'm talking about coming--the--your--
Speaker 2: But, but coming back, Seattle was a very interesting experience.  And you look back at it now, but at the time it was really the only experience that I knew.  So, you know, living in Seattle, when we first moved back there, we lived in an area which people called the Central Area [Seattle, Washington], which was kind of in the center of town, and is where most of the people who were, you know, African American lived.  And so we lived there when we first came back.  And I went to a school that was primarily, you know, all, you know, all African American.  Seattle was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The name of the school?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Dunlap [Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: The Dunlap was actually--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --the other school that I went to.  This was the first school I went to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't go there very long, might have been Madrona [Madrona School; Madrona Elementary School, Seattle, Washington].  And so when I, my first experience coming back there, it was, we had more family.  We had no family in Seattle.  So when we first--you know, other than my aunt and, and her, her family.  And so when I left, you know, Kansas, we had lots of family there, you know, extended family or--and so coming back to Seattle at first was different just because that--there was that absence of a family.  And then I think the second thing was, after a while, we moved from what was known as the Central Area, and we moved to an area south and of the city, which at that time was basically all white.  We were the second African American family to, to live in, on that block and, and live in that area.
Speaker 1: Now that area was called what?
Speaker 2: Rainier Beach [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Rainier Beach that's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you moved to Rainier Beach you think?
Speaker 2: I was probably eight.
Story_ID: 610753
Speaker 1: Can you take me back to that time?  You can take me back to Central [Central Area, Seattle, Washington] however you want to do it.  But can you tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, the water, you know.  The water always reminds me of Seattle [Washington], you know, 'cause Seattle is basically surrounded by water.  And you know, it's--any, any time I'm traveling and if I don't see water for a few days, I mean that, that is definitely something that resonates with me.  And, and I think seafood.  I mean constantly, you know, seafood is very, very much a part of the diet, and, and, and, and so that reminds me of there.  Rain, I mean it, it rains a lot (laughter).  It's, you know, that cold kind of damp rain, but growing up I didn't see it as a problem.  I mean it was, it was really very comforting, you know.  And one of the things about Seattle that's wonderful is that people do not let the weather, the rain--you know, very much like people in Chicago [Illinois]--stop them from doing anything.  So activities weren't halted necessarily 'cause there was a little bit of rain.  But those are the things that probably come to mind the most.
Speaker 1: How about smells?  Those were all sights.
Speaker 2: I, you know, I, I think that the, the smell of the water.  I mean you can--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, the smell of the water, the pier.  You know, now thinking about Seattle, the, the Space Needle [Seattle, Washington], which, you know, came a little later, but you know, that Space Needle, which is still in Seattle, which is a reminder of the World's Fair [Century 21 Exposition, Seattle, Washington].  And, and whenever I see some of the shows that are filmed in Seattle, you know, they'll show pictures of the, the space scenes.  So those are thing.  The mountains, the mountains are, are some of the most beautiful, Mount Rainier.  Those are all things that I, I think about when I think of Seattle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sounds would be sounds of the water.  Any other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--
Speaker 1: --sounds?
Speaker 2: I think sounds of the water; I think just sounds of, of the environment out there.  I mean, you know, you, you hear things like the birds.  I mean it's, you know, it's a very nature--the air is much cleaner than it is a lot of other places.  And, and so you, you pay a lot more attention I think to those kind of sounds.  I, I didn't live in a, a, a big city part of, of Seattle, so you know, I, the, the sounds that I remember are, you know, much more peaceful type sounds and not like, you know, big city sounds like I experience every day here in Chicago.

Speaker 1: --to Seattle, I mean in a way, you know.
Speaker 2: People still don't think of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --black people going to Seattle (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, you know, he explained how, you know, during the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the war [World War II, WWII] and everything, you know, there were a lot of jobs--
Speaker 2: Well, you know Tacoma [Washington] is, is a, still a very big area, [U.S.] Armed Forces area, and, and lot of people get there--I think if you probably talked to most of the people in Seattle you'll find that most of them got there via some kind of military service--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --especially the men, you know.  And my mom [Thelma Roberson Arnold], really, if you think about it, it's a very strange chance that someone growing up in Florence, Alabama, of one of thirteen kids would end up, you know, in Seattle, Washington.  And she--and of all her sisters, she only had one sister that ended up in Seattle, and that's the one she decided to follow.  And I think I asked her one time why she did it, and she said it, because it was the furthest away from New York [New York] at the time (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: So she didn't like New York?
Speaker 2: No, well, I think that--
Speaker 1: Maybe the structure or--
Speaker 2: I think she just--you know, she was eighteen, so I think she just wanted an adventure.
Speaker 1: To go, to go--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --away and be--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on her own.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my, my, my great-uncle was really a, a parental figure for her.  So I think she just wanted to be on her own and go away, and she ended up in Seattle.  And she stayed there.  And so, you know, she moved there when she was, you know, eighteen, and my mother will be seventy-five in January, and so--
Speaker 1: Wow, a long time.
Speaker 2: --it was--you know, she stayed there most of her life, so.
Story_ID: 610755
Speaker 1: Now tell me about--is it Rayer Beach, the be--
Speaker 2: Rainier Beach [Seattle, Washington] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rain- Rainer Be- what is that, Rainer?
Speaker 2: Rainier.
Speaker 1: Rainier.  Oh, like Mount Rainier.
Speaker 2: Like Mount Rainier.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was that area like?  And do you remember much your parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] talking about the move before it happened?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We actually moved the week--
Speaker 1: Now what year?
Speaker 2: We moved the, the week that Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot, okay.  And I remember it; I, that I remember clearly.  And we were preparing to move to the house, and I remember images of, of Kennedy being shot.  Now, you know, I, I was very young at the time, but, but, but I still remember that because I remember the reaction that both my parents had, you know.  I mean they were, you know, tears and, and just, you know, disbelief, you know, that that had happened.  I didn't understand it.  You know, I was too young probably to understand it at the time.  But my dad was, was in real estate, and he--one of the things that he was, you know, a dream of his was to buy his family a house in a very nice area, you know, and it turned out to be an area that was at that time all white.  It's not anymore.  I mean this is, you know, obviously, you know, some forty some odd years later.  But at that time, it was, you know, pretty much an all-white area.  And you know, in Seattle [Washington], it's, it's just very different growing up as a, as a African American in Seattle, because you don't look at things the same way.  I mean, you know, when people go back there now and they look at it and they say wow, you know, it doesn't seem to be a lot black people there, or you know, the city seems so different than anything else, but that's all I knew.  I mean, you know, I had my experiences in Kansas, but really for most of my life that's all I knew, so it seemed very normal to me.  It didn't seem unusual to be one of two black families within, you know, several blocks.  You know, that just seemed, you know, normal.  When I went to grade school, which is at Dunlap [Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington], and end up going to junior high school at Rainier Beach [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington], you know, I was one of twelve blacks.  And that's just, you know, that was just the way it is.  Interesting enough, it hasn't changed that much.  My niece, you know, who graduated from high school four years ago, I think she had probably a dozen, you know, blacks in her school, so it really hasn't changed that much.
Story_ID: 610756
Speaker 1: So you went to Dunlap [Dunlap Elementary School, Seattle, Washington].  I want to know, were you always a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I always liked school, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were you as, like as a child?
Speaker 2: I was, you know--I think my mother would probably categorize me--she had two boys [Dirk Mayberry and Brett Mayberry], and so I was the middle child.  And, and I probably was the, the good child (laughter), you know, 'cause, maybe 'cause I was a girl, you know, in the sense that, you know, the boys, you know, were, were probably a little bit more challenging and, and, and probably were willing to take some risks that I wasn't, you know.  I wasn't very, you know, risk adverse; I was pretty risk adverse.  So I always loved school.  You know, I didn't get into any trouble.  I was a pretty, you know, pretty good kid, and got good grades, and worked hard, did what I was supposed to do.  I mean, you know, not, not, not too many difficulties.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first day of school?  Do you remember that?  Do--
Speaker 2: You know, I, I can't say I remember the first day, but I remember my time in school.  And my, my time in school was, was, until I got into junior high [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington], was, was a very pleasant time for me.  I mean, like I said, I mean I was, I was very much accepted, at least, you know, as much as I knew.  I had lots of friends.  You know, my, my best friend was Caucasian 'cause there, like I said, there were only twelve of us.  You got matched up with the only other, you know, African American guy in your class, and he was your boyfriend, if there was a boyfriend.  You know, he was your boyfriend all through school, and you didn't get any choice 'cause, you know.  And at that time it was no thought of you being matched up with someone who wasn't, you know, African American.  So, you know, but it was a pleasant experience.  Then, then, you know, I started to, to see certain things but didn't understand them at the time.  My best friend--
Speaker 1: What, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I was never--
Speaker 1: --what, what age?
Speaker 2: Eight, nine, or ten.  I was never able to go over her house.  Matter of fact, the whole time that we were best friends until I went into junior high school, I was never allowed to, to go to her house.  And you know, I--
Speaker 1: Was that on your parents' [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] side or her parents' side?
Speaker 2: No, that was her parents' side.  Her father just absolutely refused--he was from the South, and he, he absolutely refused to allow me to come to their home.  But her mother knew about me, and her mother accepted me, and, and knew we were friends.  But, but I never did go over to their home.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you have a favorite teacher?  Do you--
Speaker 2: You know what: I, I didn't really have a favorite teacher until I got into high school [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington].  And you know, I had several teachers.  I mean they, they--you know, our classes were small.  You know, there was a lot of focus placed on learning and you know, education.  And the class--the, the school was considered to be a very good school, so all of the teachers, really, in some ways, were your favorite.  You know, I had probably favorite subjects.  You know, I loved to read and, and, and, and at that time I loved, you know, history and social studies.  I think they called it social studies then.  I don't know what they call it now.  But, but those were things that were, that were of interest to me.
Speaker 1: Now did your brother, and your brother, was he a year ahead of you in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Year ahead of me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was he a good--he wasn't a good student?
Speaker 2: He was a great student.
Speaker 1: He was a great student.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, he was a straight A student, you know, without much work, without much effort.  It just came very easy to him.  He was a very, very bright student.
Speaker 1: Now was he a big brother to you in a way that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --he'd look out for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  And, and he was, I think, in younger years, he was that even if he didn't want to be, because that's what my father required, I mean to a point that I think at sometimes it became annoying because he couldn't go anywhere unless he took me along.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, at that time, you know, young boys don't want to take their little pesky sister along.  And I'm sure he felt that, you know, that I got in the way, you know, quite a bit.  But, but he definitely always looked out for me.
Story_ID: 610757
Speaker 1: Can you describe during your growing up any family holidays or outings or things that sort of stick out in your mind?  I don't know if it was--I mean did you--were you a member?  Did you go to the Baptist church, did--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we--I mean holidays for us were always important.  They weren't extravagant, because even though we had moved to this very nice neighborhood [Rainier Beach, Seattle, Washington] and very nice house, we didn't have a lot of money.  And, and so, and my parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] didn't really believe in a lot of, you know, extravagance, so.  But we always celebrated hosp- holidays.  My younger brother [Brett Mayberry] was born on Christmas Eve.  And so one of the things I remember, my mother does this to this day, is that she never allowed us to comingle those holidays.  You know, she always felt that, you know, that my brother had to have a separate day.  And so we'd always celebrate his birthday, and then we celebrated Christmas.  And, and Thanksgiving was always a, you know, a big holiday.  And, and even to this day, Thanksgiving was really my, my favorite holiday, 'cause it really wasn't about presents.  It really wasn't about any of that.  It really was just about, you know, lots of food, people getting together, you know.  And the memories I have are, you know, lots of laughter, lots of talking, and, and, and playing games.  We used to, you know, play a lot of games.  My dad didn't let us watch a lot of TV.  He didn't think that we should spend time doing that.  So, we, we, you know--I remember those (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of games?  What games were--
Speaker 2: You know, like Monopoly type games, you know, games where there was some, some intellectual, you know, thought, you know, you know, capabilities.  He always wanted us to, to, to develop that.  And, and you know, so we would, we would play, you know, games like that, you know, Scrabble type games, you know, where you had to think a little bit.
Story_ID: 610758
Speaker 1: So your high school--I mean, your junior high school, that's when you were in Raini- Rainier Beach [Seattle, Washington], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Rainier Beach was a junior/senior high school [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington], and so I did my junior high school there.  And then I transferred to what would be probably the equivalent of a magnet school today, which turned out to be Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington], which is kind of in the center of the city.
Speaker 1: Now you didn't like your junior/senior--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: You did, but you did very much like your, your--
Speaker 2: I loved, I liked my high school.
Speaker 1: Your high school.
Speaker 2: I didn't like my--I didn't like seventh through ninth grade.  Seventh through ninth grade was a very challenging time, because at that time they decided to start busing.  And so they would bus all of the black students from the middle of the, the city, the area that I lived, and they'd bus them out to the Rainier Valley [Seattle, Washington], what they would call Rainier Valley area, which was the school I was in.  And so, you know, that was a, that was a very confusing time because the, the, the black kids didn't like me.  And then the white kids said oh, my god, she's black.  And so (laughter), you, you didn't fit anywhere.  You didn't fit with the black kids.  You didn't fit with the white kids.  You just didn't fit, and it was just a, you know, a very confusing time, especially after spending all those years fitting in and feeling very comfortable.  And then all of a sudden, in your, you know, seventh, eighth grade--you know, I was a strange, you know, black kid that took Russian, you know, as a foreign language and was president of the honor society, and you know.  And who does that, you know?  You know, I mean just--so you just, so you, you just didn't fit, and so it was a very, very difficult time.  And you know, I think that if you talk to a lot of people about busing, you'd get a lot of different, you know, comments.  I mean the intentions may have been good, but the way that it end up, you know, way it was executed, I think that, you know, looking back at it now, you know, there probably were things that could have been, you know, done better.  But, you know, the, that's, those were the times.  And so I, I did not have a good experience at all because my whole world changed.  My, my older brother [Dirk Mayberry] was able to maneuver a bit more because he was a basketball player and very good looking basketball player, and you know, people kind of gave him a pass.  But, but it was a pretty, you know, pretty difficult time for me, got beat up on a regular basis by the girls.  And you know, it was just, just not a pleasant experience.
Speaker 1: Because they were, they were rougher, right?
Speaker 2: Well, and, and just, you know, I didn't fit; you know, I didn't fit, you know.  You know, I, I had been out of that, that culture for a long time, you know.  I mean I--my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] always took us back.  We always went back to the area, and I, you know, I went to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] and you know, went to, took different programs there.  But then I came home, and I lived in this other area and so, you know, were twelve, twelve students, the same--I knew the same, you know, ten to twelve students from the time I was seven or eight to the time I was thirteen or fourteen.  And so, there's just a comfort level, and you know, it's a different environment.  And then you get all of these kids who are coming out from a totally different area, and, and you're into different things.  You know, like I said, you know, I had taken up foreign language that nobody would even think about taking, and, and you seem strange.  You know, you seem strange, and, and it caused a lot of tension.  And I'm sure it was that way for other people as well.  But it was a, a, a very difficult time, and so I was thrilled when my mother decided that I could go to this school that was, you know, in the middle of the city.  And the, the thing that was so special about that was that this school, the majority of the population was Asian.  It wasn't black.  It wasn't white.  It was Asian.  And, and by the way, you know, there were a lot of kids who were on the honor roll.  There were a lot of kids who wanted to do weird things like take Russian or, or (laughter) do stuff like that.  And so, all of a sudden, I was able to, to find my, you know, a place for myself and find a place that, that it seemed like I fit.
Story_ID: 610759
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you said you were able--so your mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] really took the lead on getting you in a better place.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, I, I think she would probably say she took the lead at my insistence.  I mean she, she knew that I was very unhappy.  She knew that, you know, that I was getting to a point where I didn't really want to go to school, you know, and, and she could see that.  And I was fortunate.  This same [maternal] aunt that my mother had come to stay with was now living in the area, because at that time, if you didn't live in the area, you couldn't go to those schools.  You had to go in the school in the area that you lived or unless you were in some kind of busing program.  So because I lived in the Rainier Valley area [Seattle, Washington], I couldn't actually go to, to school in, in this other area.  But my aunt lived in this area, and my mom had to sign off that, that I lived there.  And it was I think a very difficult decision for her, because she, you know, she was concerned about that because that wasn't quite the truth, you know, I mean.  But, but I think when she saw that I was so unhappy living--going to school there [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington], and she thought it was the right thing to do.  And, and, and I think it probably literally changed my life.
Speaker 1: And so it was like you had, you were a fish that had found water--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I found--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --kids that looked like me that were interested in the same kinds of things, you know, that I was interested in.  I was able to be whatever I wanted to be.  I mean I came to a school [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington] where people had gone to school with each other, you know, previously.  And by the time I was a junior, I was junior class president, cheerleader, and involved in all kinds of activities, and you know, very much a part of the school, and, and you know, graduated, you know, really, you know, being--having great memories of it and, and really having it be a very, very positive experience.  I don't know what would have happened if I had been forced to stay in that other environment, because I often wonder if I would have taken a different turn because I was just so unhappy.
Speaker 1: Now, in, in high school, so you were, you said junior class president.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What other things were you involved with, Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Mayberry McKissack]?  Were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, probably--
Speaker 1: And you said cheerleader.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was probably involved in everything.  I was involved in, my mother would say, every activity going, I probably had, you know, some involvement in it.  You know, I was very involved in, in what you would call class politics, I guess, you know, the, the, the leadership programs.  I, I also worked part time and had a part time job and was very--
Speaker 1: Where were you work--where did you work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was working at a, a retail store.  And so, and I was the, one of the representatives.  They had fashion representatives for, for the school, and I was one of the fashion representatives.  So I, I was, you know, very involved in all kinds of activities.  I ran track.  And you know, just, it, it was the kind of experience that you would want I think someone to have during those, you know, high school years, kind of exploring and, and you know, finding what, what are the things you like to do.  And you know, I, I found that I loved to write, and so I was doing a lot of creative writing.  And so, it just, it just was an opportunity to really expand and explore all of that.
Story_ID: 610760
Speaker 1: Now, when did your parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] divorce?  What, what--
Speaker 2: I was in, I was--it was really around about the time that I was transferring over from junior high school to high school--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --you know.  And, and they were separated for a while and then divorced.  But it was right during that time, so that also, you know, I think added to, you know.
Speaker 1: Wait, were they separated at the time you moved, or were they, were they separating--
Speaker 2: I think they were separating at the time that I moved--
Speaker 1: At the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But not divorced?
Speaker 2: No, not divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was that hard?  I mean who was--I mean as, as a family unit?  Because it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very hard.
Speaker 1: --sounds to me that your father provided a lot of struct- structure.  And I, I may be--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, well, I, I think, I think it, my dad, what my dad did was he provided a lot of direction and, and certain goal setting and those kinds of things.  That's really what he was really good at.  He, he certainly was like most parents during that generation, and I think to some degree, parents always are like this in that you want your kids to live a better life than, than you lived.  You know, my, my dad ended up, you know, not finishing college [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington], and, and ended up, you know, having to do a lot of jobs that he didn't like, and, and really never founding--finding that professional success that, that he started out, you know, just because of, you know, financial reasons and family commitments and those kinds of things.  And so I think that he really provided a lot of that along with my mom.  And so, like most kids that go through, you know, divorce, you know, especially when there are financial challenges, you know, it's difficult, and then just to see your parents trying to, you know, deal with some of those challenges, of which my mom, you know, really ended up having to, to bear the brunt of that, 'cause she had three kids to raise.
Speaker 1: So she had, she hadn't worked--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --before, right?
Speaker 2: --she, no.  She had worked at, as helping--my dad had several businesses.  He had a couple of different, you know, custodial businesses and a real estate business. And she had helped him in his business, but she had not had a, an, a job outside of the home.
Speaker 1: So that was a big shock.
Speaker 2: It was a big shock 'cause she had to go back to work.
Speaker 1: So she worked where and--
Speaker 2: She worked at a, a grocery chain, Safeway [Safeway Inc.], which is still around today, and she worked there for twenty-five years.  She went back to work, and that's how she, you know, supported and raised her kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this--so this happens.  She takes a job around the time that you start going to Franklin [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. But this is a ha- no matter, even with the sadness of that, you--this is a great experience in high school in your--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in your grow--
Speaker 2: One of my best.
Speaker 1: Now where, where is your brother [Dirk Mayberry] at, and--
Speaker 2: He's at another school.  He, he left Rainier Beach [Rainier Beach Junior Senior High School; Rainier Beach High School, Seattle, Washington] and went to a school called Queen Anne [Queen Anne High School, Seattle, Washington], so.  And, and you know, there was a lot of flexibility of what schools athletes could go to, and so he was able to--he didn't have to live in the area.  He was recruited because of, you know, his, you know, athletic talents, and so he ended up going there.
Speaker 1: And your younger brother [Brett Mayberry], who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My younger brother ended up going to Rainier Beach for a while.  And I--and he may have transferred after that, but he, he ended up going there for a while.
Story_ID: 610761
Speaker 1: So what are you thinking about college at that point as you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was always thinking about college.  You know, that, that was really kind of drilled into me when I was very young, you know, that it was expected that we would, you know, get some type of, you know, education beyond high school education.  And so I, I was always planning on going to college and, and--not necessarily going away to college because, you know, financially did not have the money to do that--and ended up, ended up applying to different schools, getting accepted to a lot of different schools, but not having, you know, the money to go, and ended up going to school locally between Seattle University [Seattle, Washington] and University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] on full paid scholarships, so at the last minute, ended up doing that because it was free (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] didn't have, she didn't--
Speaker 2: She didn't have the money.
Speaker 1: She didn't have the--
Speaker 2: She was a single parent.  She didn't have the money.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what, what are you thinking you want to do?  And I, I'm also trying to figure out during this period who else is influencing you.  I mean who--was there anyone else that sort of came into your life that is influencing you and your decisions or major?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think, I think that, you know, I was always a very, very avid reader, you know.  Yeah, I remember my mom sometime would say, you know, "You, you need to come out of your room.  You know, you spend all your time in there just reading."  And so, you know, I was, you know, getting--reading everything I could get my hands on, different books and different, you know, any kind of articles, and, and, and so I always had a huge curiosity.  And I had several teachers who were very, very helpful to me when I was in high school [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington] who, you know, really provided a lot of that career counseling and career direction.  And I decided when I got out of high school that I was gonna be an attorney, and I majored in political science.  And so my initial objective was really to, to go into, to law.  And along the way I, I ended up changing my mind, but that was initially what I was going to do.
Speaker 1: And you, how did you decide between those two, two, you know, University of Washington and Seattle University (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) University.  I actually went to both.  I ended up finishing undergrad in two and a half years.  So I took courses at both of them, and that's why I was able to graduate in two and a half years.  And, and I went to both of them because they both offered me full paid scholarships, and they weren't that far from each other.  And so I would--you know, my typical schedule would be to get up in the morning, start class at eight, work--take classes until twelve, work from twelve to five [o'clock], and then take a night class at the University of Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now who were, who--are you still in touch with some of the people you went to, to college with?
Speaker 2: I'm morning in touch with people that I went to high school with, and I'm more in touch with people that I went to graduate school [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] with.  But college for me was very different.  And I think because of the fact that I had this high school experience, which was just a, really was probably the most instrumental experience in helping guide, you know, what I wanted to do.  And again, you know, going back to the fact that I'm at this high school where, you know, some of the, the, the smartest kids in the city go to this high school, and so you know, you really were driven to, to really excel, and, and do the best that you could do, and be the best that you could be 'cause, you know, you were kind of unusual if you weren't, because you know, that was kind of the norm.  So I think that really--being around that kind of environment really inspired me because it was just expected that you were going to achieve and succeed.  It wasn't expected that you were just gonna get by.  So I think those were--and everybody went to, you know--not everybody, but you know, probably 70 percent, 80 percent of the class went to college, you know.  So it was kind of assumed that--and certainly anyone who was involved in a lot of the activities that I were involved with.  We got exposed to all kinds of things and so, different people and you know, different groups that, that, you know, that had impacts on us, and so it was just assumed that you would do something else with your life.

Speaker 1: Now college itself though, you, were you go- how did you finish in two and a half years?  That's what I'm trying--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --to understand.
Speaker 2: --I, I went to two different colleges [Seattle University and University of Washington, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went straight through.  And I took, you know--
Speaker 1: When you, when you--
Speaker 2: --classes--
Speaker 1: --straight through, are you talking about--
Speaker 2: I mean summers--
Speaker 1: --year round?
Speaker 2: Yeah, year round, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now why was that a goal of yours?
Speaker 2: Well, because for me, you know, I had most of my social experiences in high school [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington], and so for me college wasn't about a social experience.  When I talk to friends of mine and, and, and even my husband [Eric McKissack], I mean college was a social experience as well as an academic experience.  For me it was a business.  You know it was about--you know and, and what I really wanted to do, which I thought at the time was to practice law, I wanted to get on to get, to doing it, and so I had to get college out of the way.  And so for me it was not about being involved in all the activities and you know, the, the really experience that, you know, I find that, you know, my nieces have, have had and my nephews have had, and, and, and quite frankly, I think very good experiences.  And I sometimes regret that I didn't take that time and have that experience.  But for me at that time, you know, I had this full paid scholarship.  I was working.  I wanted to get it, you know, behind me, and I wanted to get on to the other things that I wanted to do.  And I had this opportunity to attend the, both of these schools, and so I just decided to do it.  The other things was that I, I really had this interest in traveling.  And one of the things that I wanted to do was I wanted to travel in, in Europe.  And I had this idea that, that I didn't want to be behind my class.  And so I wanted to graduate early and then go spend a year in Europe, and so that's what I did.
Story_ID: 610763
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you spent a year.  Now where you did--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't stay a whole year, but you know.
Speaker 1: Now where did you, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I, I had a, a friend of mine and I who I had worked with, we traveled all around Europe.  You know, this was back in the day when you could by a rail pass for probably a few hundred dollars.  And she was Scandinavian.  Of course, you know, I was not, so we kind of looked like Mutt and Jeff going over there.  And I remember being in different parts of Europe and people--I had this huge Afro.  And I remember being in Europe and people coming up to me and wanting to touch my hair because it stood up, and they couldn't--they didn't understand.  And they thought it, they thought it was going to be very hard, and they were so surprised to find out that it was very soft.  But it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Now where did--how many countries did you go to?
Speaker 2: Oh, we went, I mean we went to probably at least ten different countries.  I mean we--you know, the, with a rail pass you could go just about everywhere.  And we would spend, some, some countries we'd spend, you know, just a few days in, and some we'd spend weeks in.  And you know, I often think now and I wonder, you know, what possessed my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold], who, as I said, was not what I would call a risk taker, to allow her to twenty-one year old daughter to go to Europe with a girlfriend and travel around.  But things were different then, you know.  And you know, we didn't have cell phones or that kind of stuff back then, you know, so.  But she allowed us to--allowed me to do that, and, and that's what I did.  And, and that was, you know, that's the kind of thing that, you know, I think being in Seattle [Washington], you, you know, that's not unusual for, for, you know, people to do.  You know, that, that, that was something that a lot of my friends were doing.  And they weren't doing it, you know, with, you know, lots of money.  They were doing it--you know, they'd save money, and then decided they wanted to kind of go see the world.  And, and it was, it was just a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Now what was your favorite, favorite country?  Did you have one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the time, my favorite country was Spain.  And the reason why that end up being my favorite country is because we were able to get a job over there.  We were broke; we, you know, and we, we ran out of money.  And we, we went to a little college town called Sevilla [Seville, Spain], and, and we were able to teach English there.  And, and food was cheap, and you know, you could, you could do bread and wine and, and you know, and it was, it was, it was a pretty, you know, good way to live.  So, that was my favorite.  I, I've since then--Italy is my favorite country, 'cause I've gone back, you know, many, many times.  But, but at the time Spain was really the, the country that I identified the most with.
Story_ID: 610764
Speaker 1: So you come back from Eur- so you leave at what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what, what month--
Speaker 2: I leave right--
Speaker 1: --do you leave?
Speaker 2: I leave right after I graduate [from Seattle University, Seattle, Washington] in--
Speaker 1: So, nine--June--
Speaker 2: --undergrad--
Speaker 1: --June.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, probably around that time, maybe been a few months later.  And I think we end up staying over there, you know, maybe six, seven months, you know, and, and literally came back because we both just got so homesick, you know.  And it was so funny, because we came back, and after we were back for, you know, probably a week, we wanted to go back.  But you know, there wasn't really an opportunity to do that.  And so--
Speaker 1: The friend you traveled with, what is her name?
Speaker 2: Oh god, Barbara [ph.], Barbara, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  And, and we didn't know each other very well.  That was a very interesting experience because--
Speaker 1: So you'd got along okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, we ended up--
Speaker 1: Traveling can break up--
Speaker 2: -actually--
Speaker 1: --friendship.
Speaker 2: Well, we--
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: We, when I say we didn't know each other, we worked together.  But working together at a retail store and, and then having to depend on someone in a foreign country is two totally different things.  I wasn't old enough to understand that and, and would never do that again.  But as it turned out, par- partway through the, the, the, the time, we actually had some, you know, differences in, you know, in the way that we wanted to live.  She was very much into communal living, and I was much more into knowing that, you know, when I woke up in the morning I wanted to know who was there, you know.  And this was, you know, this was backpacks and you know.  This wasn't hotels.  This was hostels and you know, I mean.  We were not living--you know, we were trying to live--they used to say live on, you know, ten dollars a day.  And we're trying to live on ten dollars a week or you know, something like that.  It was not, you know, high flying living.  It was really all about the experience.  And so somewhere during the, the trip, we split up.  Of course, I, I didn't tell my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] that until I got back because she would have, you know.  But I was over there, and I really wanted to experience it.  I had some friends from high school [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington] who were in the [U.S.] Air Force or--not Air Force, but in the [U.S.] Army, and they were stationed in Germany.  So I had some friends' parents who were in the Air--[U.S.] Armed Forces, and they were stationed somewhere throughout Europe, and I, you know, ended up having some friends or people I knew.  And so I ended up going off on my own and, and ended up meeting other people.  You know, I, I don't know that I would recommend that, you know, today, but back then, you know, I didn't really worry about my safety, you know.  I remember getting on trains and you know, I didn't have a lot of stuff, you know.  I mean now I wouldn't be able to even put my shoes in the bag that I carried, you know, at that time.  But I remember getting on plane--trains and just going to sleep.  And you know, when you woke up, you got off wherever you woke up, and you know different living (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 610765
Speaker 1: What did you learn about yourself as a person?  Because really, the way I understand your story, you spent summers in the South.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I don't remember you talking about, you know, going many other places.  And so, you know, though at that time period you're, you're look--you know, this is a whole--the different--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --cultures and things like that.  You're, you know, you said you worked in, in--was it Spain, or where did--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, in Spain.
Speaker 1: In Spain.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just wondering what you were, you know, what you're learning about yourself--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the world around you.
Speaker 2: As a, as a child, I didn't go a lot of other places outside of Seattle [Washington], I mean, and I think that, that is, is absolutely fundamentally a part of who I am and some of the things I wanted to do.  You know, we didn't have a lot of money, so we didn't travel, you know.  You know, as people grow up today, you know, what are we gonna do for Easter break?  Well, you know, we're gonna dye some Easter eggs, you know.  What, what are we gonna do for Easter break?  I mean, you know, it wasn't, you know, it wasn't like we were gonna take a trip, you know.  And any grips we took were, were, were car trips.  You know, we didn't take plane trips.  So by the time that I graduated from college [Seattle University, Seattle, Washington], I really hadn't been anywhere other than we'd lived for a brief period in Denver [Colorado], transitioning back to, to Seattle, and, and lived in Kansas, and, and then I had spent time in the summers down in Alabama.  That was it.  That was my, you know, whole world.  And so there was something in me at that time that said I want to go to, to Europe.  I--and, and one of the reasons I wanted to go to Europe is 'cause my, my dad [Donald Mayberry] had always said he wanted to go to Europe.  And this was something that, you know, he never got a chance to do, and he wanted to go.  And I think he was over there for a brief period maybe when he was in the [U.S. military] service, but he wanted to go back and really experience that.  And he used to talk about--you know, he, he had lots of stories and you know, dreams and you know, goals and that kind of thing, and so I wanted to, to go an experience that.  But what I learned about myself is, first of all, I'm pretty tenacious, you know.  When I set my mind that I want to do something, you know, I, I figure out a way to do it, even if obstacles come up along the way.  I mean, to be kind of--I don't know if I was halfway through the trip, or you know, it seemed to me it was earlier than that, and we found out that we really couldn't live together.  We just had different ideas about how we wanted to live and some of things that we wanted to do, you know.  And, and, but I wasn't willing to give up my trip to, to do that.  But I knew if I told my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] that she was no longer traveling with me, I would have to come home.  So you know, I, I, I found that also I just have a, a very strong intellectual curiosity about people.  I, you know, I have that today.  Probably one of my most favorite things today is to still travel, even with all the challenges that, that, that are, you know, are involved today.  But you know, I meet so many great people and, and learn about different cultures and learn about different ideas, and I think part of that is my Seattle upbringing, you know.  Seattle, you know, it's, it's very accepting of a lot of different cultures.  It--you know, and maybe because they don't have, you know, some of the issues that we have in bigger cities, 'cause you don't have as many people of, you know, of different cultures that are a majority.  And you've got a, a, they've had a minority population, Asian population, be the majority population for, for some time.  So, I think it's just a different makeup.
Story_ID: 610766
Speaker 1: Now, so you get back [from Europe], and you, so you're back around, really, the spring then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what do you do at this point?
Speaker 2: I, I start looking for work (laughter).  I had decided to--I was going to law school, and I applied to many law schools.  I'd been accepted at several, and, and I was waiting to, you know--had deferments and was going to go to law school.  But I, I needed to work.  I didn't have any money and didn't have any idea how I was gonna pay for law school.  And so I, I was out one evening and ran into a, a friend of mine, and he was working for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  And he said, "What are you doing?"  And I said, "I'm looking for a job."  And he said. "Well, you ought to go down to IBM.  They're hiring."  And I said, "Well, what would I do there, you know?"  And he said, "Doesn't matter.  They pay really well."  And so, I went down there, and they hired me.  And so I started--but my intention was only to work until (unclear) fall.  That was my intention initially.
Speaker 1: Now I wanna--this is 1976, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --seventy-five [1975], seventy--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --seventy-six [1976].  And just sort of in historical context, this is a time that blacks are really entering Corporate America.  The Urban League [National Urban League] is big.  I don't know if you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: OIC, I don't know if they had OIC, Opportunities international [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].  But--
Speaker 2: They had it, yes.
Speaker 1: --but, so this is really the time that you're, you're there.  So you're back in Seattle [Washington], right?
Speaker 2: Right, back in Seattle.
Speaker 1: And what are you aware, like you're a--are you aware of what is happening in Seattle period?  I mean are you just sort of working and you know, as a young person starting out on a job?  I'm just wondering if you're--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I, I was aware that I was being looked at differently when I went into jobs.  I, you know, I, you know, I think growing up in Seattle is just very different.  I think if I grew up in someplace like Chicago [Illinois], I would have been aware of being an African American person much, much earlier.  I think that came later for me in Seattle.  But when I, when I went to, to start work for IBM, this was a time, again, you know, '76 [1976], '77 [1977], where, you know, IBM didn't hire women or African Americans and, and certainly didn't hire African American women.  You know, that, you know, that was just--you just didn't see that.  And so when I went to, to, to work for them, they put me immediately in a administrative job.  And I realized, after very few months, that I really didn't like that, but I was doing very well, and they, they had a career set out for me, which was very different than what I thought.  But I wanted to be in sales because that's where everybody seemed to be having fun, and, and they were making all the money, but there was--there were no role models.  There was one African American woman [Alva Dickerson (ph.)], and that was the only African American woman they had in sales.  And, and they only had two women in total.  And basically, I was told that there, there could only be one African American woman at a time, and until this person, you know, left, I would not have a shot to, to do that.  As it turned out, she did end up getting promoted and then left, and, but they wouldn't hire me into the role, at first.  And I finally, after, you know, many conversations and different kinds of, you know, projects and persuasions, I was able to convince a branch manager to put me into sales.  But you know, for most of my career, corporate career--I spent fourteen years with IBM--until much later, I was the only one.  You know, I would be the only one, you know, black female, you know, at this particular class or only one in this or that.  And it wasn't 'til much later where, you know, you started to see women, and certainly black women, in, in corporate roles.  In Seattle, you know, I think just came, came about it a little bit later because of the, the population.
Story_ID: 610767
Speaker 1: Now also at this time, IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] is really a leader in the, in the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the corporate--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, it was--and they had--they were known for their training program, I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, known for their training program, yeah.  They had a, a, a six to eight month training program before you ever got a chance to do anything.  And so--
Speaker 1: So what would you do in that training program?
Speaker 2: Well, you would--first of all, you would--you learned how to, to talk to people.  They would, they would have something called the rotation.  And you would go and get, you know, three or four of the sales managers, and you would, you would do presentations.  And they would evaluate you, and, and you would just do that over and over and over until you got really good at it.  You would take classes.  You would, you know, you would learn.  Even though you'd never probably ever planned on programming, they would--you, you'd have a programming class so you just understood what it was like to do that and what some of your potential prospective clients might be doing.  So it was a, it was an excellent program.  I mean, I don't they do it today, because if you look in terms of, you know, economics and what have you.  But they invested so much in you before you ever gave anything back in return to them.  But, but that was part of the program.
Story_ID: 610768
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the product line?  What were you--was it--I mean 'cause you were selling--so you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --selling cop- was copiers the--
Speaker 2: Well, we were selling--at that time I don't think we were selling those.  I think we were selling typewriters.
Speaker 1: Type--oh, my--
Speaker 2: This is 1976.  This is typewriters.
Speaker 1: I don't know what I'm thinking.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  I don't think copier were until much later, you know.
Speaker 1: But the IBM Selectrics or--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --IBM Selectrics, yes.  So we were selling typewriters and supplies and, and, and those kinds of things.  And then later on we started selling, obviously, computers and, and, and, and you know, small computers as well as PC computers [personal computer] and you know.  And I actually was part of introducing, you know, PC computers as part of the IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] team.  But back then it was really more what they called office products.  And then they came out with products that were called office systems, and that's where they started to bridge, you know, some of the systems products with the office products.  So you had things called memory typewriters, which, you know, seems so antiquated now.  But back then, we thought they were pretty cool, you know.  It was a typewriter that actually had a memory, you know, that would capture your, your data, and you could save it and then play it back and make changes.  You know, this is, you know, back in the day.  So those are the kind of products that we were selling.
Speaker 1: And weren't you--you were known as Big Blue, right?
Speaker 2: Big Blue, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now why was that?  And who--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --was the--I just want to understand the structure, like were you doing--were you training, and you know, would you go to corporate headquarters in Armonk [New York] to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --train and--
Speaker 2: We wouldn't go--because I was in Seattle [Washington]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we were trained, you know, in California sometime, and we'd also train in Dallas [Texas] and we'd train in Atlanta [Georgia].  So typically those were kind of the training headquarters.
Speaker 1: And those were region, or were those the training headquarters--
Speaker 2: No, those were training headquarters for, you know, and most people didn't go to Armonk.  You know, that was later on where I actually did an assignment where I spent time up there.  But, but, really, you trained in, in, you know, the, the Dallas and, and Atlanta and maybe some in California because that was more regional.  But, but part of it was people used to always say that nobody ever got fired for buying IBM, okay.  And, and, and the whole point of that is that IBM would always make sure that the products would work.  Even if they didn't work in the beginning, they were gonna make sure--they always stood by their products.  So there was very little risks for you to make a choice and, and, and recommend IBM as part of your company.  And so, you know, we had that reputation.  And IBM I think still to, and to this day probably has some of that.  And it was just a very good, you know, experience.
Story_ID: 610769
Speaker 1: But it had, it had some challenges too.  Again, this is, you know, back when, you know, you just didn't see a lot of mentors.  And, and, and, and again, I was in Seattle [Washington].  So if I'd been in Chicago [Illinois] that might have been a very different situation.  But I was in Seattle, and you know, they didn't have that many people to choose from to begin with 'cause you only had, what, 5 percent of the population was African American.  So it wasn't like that, you know, everywhere you went, but they did, they did have quite a few African American men.  So I was the only female, and, and I ended up bond--
Speaker 2: In your office?
Speaker 1: In my office.  And I ended up bonding with a number of the guys who were there, who are still my friends today.  That's where I think I really started to, to make really long lasting friends, and they were very helpful to me.  You know, they would kind of, you know, teach me the tricks of the trade.  And, and you know, you know, "When you present to this person you should do this," and you know, "Make sure you know this," and you know, "Don't go if you don't, you know, have this," and "What you--."  But, but I had some, some, you know, kind of negative experiences too.  And I--you would go away to school, and this would be where you'd spend a month away or so.  And I had a, a manager at the time who, you know, was not the positive.  And a day before I went, was getting ready to go away to school, I had finished all my what you wanna call pre-exams and had done really well, top of my class the whole bit.  And he pulled me aside, and he said you know, "Look, I know you're going away for a month and just wanna let you know, if you don't do well, don't worry.  We have a job back for you.  We can, we can make you one of our, you know, receptionists."  And, and I was devastated, you know, 'cause here I had worked really hard and thought, you know, I was, you know, gonna go down there and be so successful.  And he basically told me that, you know, we don't think you, you know, are gonna make it.  And if you come back, we'll put you in a job that we don't think has a lot of value, not necessarily what I thought, but at the time, you know, said you know, we'll put you in a kind of a beginning, you know, receptionist type job.  And I remember going home and you know, to my mom [Thelma Roberson Arnold], and I was, you know, very upset about it.  And I remember her telling me, you know, "This is only the beginning.  You are gonna be told many, many times in your life that you can't do something.  If you want to do it, then you figure out (unclear) how to do it.  And you get up, and you pack your stuff.  And you're leaving tomorrow, and you go down there, and you, you know, just be the best that you can be."  And I did, and I ended up being president of my class, and came back, and went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of your training class?
Speaker 1: Of my training class--and came back and went into the office, and the same manager pulled me aside and said, "I just wanted you to know I just told you that because I knew it would make you work harder."  So you know, you learn.
Story_ID: 610770
Speaker 1: So now you went into sales how many years after starting?  You start in an administrative--
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: --position.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I didn't stay more than a few months.  Sales ended up being--you know, I went into there, you know, I don't know, six months maybe or so.  I didn't stay very long.  As it turned out--
Speaker 1: So then where did you go afterwards then, after--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You said you didn't stay in sales--
Speaker 2: I, no, I didn't stay in administrative position very long.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: So, and you know, maybe six, you know, six, eight months.  I'm not even sure if I stayed that long.  But I decided that sales was something I really wanted to do.  And you know, after being in Europe and, and taking all of my savings--'cause I had saved quite a bit of money working during college.  I mean I worked six hours a day, so not, not totally full time, but--and I was living at home, so I mean I didn't have a lot of expenses, and--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --I'd saved quite a bit of money, but I had blown all that money in Europe.  And so when I got back, you know, I, I really didn't have any money.  And, and I was always about making money.  (Laughter) I, I mean I, I mean I always wanted to have my own money.  My mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold], you know, would, would, would tell you that I had a lot of funny stories about, you know, just, you know, making sure that I had my own money.  I did not want someone else's money.  I wanted to make my own money.  And so when I started working, and you know, at that time IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] paid good money for, for that particular time, you know, and, and that was a lot of money.  And I, you know, and, and I really wanted to, you know, I started, wanted to do some things.  And I said well, you know, I'll just defer school another year, and I'll just work for a full year and just, you know, build up, you know, a cushion, and then I'll go to, to law school.  Well, it turned out that was fourteen years.  And I ended up staying at IBM fourteen years because I found that after the first year or so I really enjoyed it.  And even though I never had any intention of making that, you know, a career, I found that there were many things about it that I liked.  And, and I, I was fortunate enough to be, you know, pretty successful with it.  And so I decided to, you know, really start focusing more on a, a business career and ultimately going back to graduate school [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois], but--
Speaker 1: So, so what--tell me your progression.  So you start in administration, and then you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in sales--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in sales.  And then there were lots of different jobs in sales.  I, I, you know, over the years, you know, I, I, I--you sold for, you know, a few years, and then you'd get promoted.  And I got promoted to California and we went to San Francisco [California].  And, and then I started getting promoted every two or three years.  And I ended up living in Chicago [Illinois] the first time and, and then got promoted to Washington, D.C., and ran a, an area from there, and then got promoted again to New York [New York] and, and spent some time in New York, and then came back to Chicago, and then ended up as the western branch manager in, in San Francisco.  So, I, I ended up moving quite a bit, got a chance to see a lot of the, the U.S. both through my travels on the job as well as different positions, and ended up spending, you know, about fourteen years in both sales, marketing, and then sales management positions.
Speaker 1: So when you say you were moving around quite a bit, how many, like, you would get a promotion every what?
Speaker 2: Every couple of years.
Speaker 1: Every couple of years, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every couple of years.
Speaker 1: And that was the way--
Story_ID: 610771
Speaker 1: Now who, who was, who was senior, black in, in IBM [International Business Machines Corporation]?  No--
Speaker 2: Really at that time--
Speaker 1: No one?
Speaker 2: --you know, really no one.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: You know, now, as, as I--as the years went on, then there were, you know, many people who, you know, ended up.  When I finally got to Chicago [Illinois], there was a gentleman by the name of John Thompson [John W. Thompson] who ended up being a CEO of Symantec--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --very successful computer software, you know, software company.  And there were, you know, there were people, but there weren't a lot of role models at the time.  You know, I ended up having a few people but, but not really at the top, top levels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was, that was much later.
Speaker 1: Now anything, any involvement with National Black MBA [National Black MBA Association] or any--you know, Black Enterprise sort of being the magazine that people look at.  None, none of that much or--
Speaker 2: Not, not in the beginning (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Not in the beginning.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Those things all came more '80-ish [1980], you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, after you went to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean they, they really became much later.
Speaker 1: After you went to Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They really came later.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 610772
Speaker 1: What are you liking about it?  Is it because you're good at sales, or you like the interaction with people?  I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think what I liked the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You liked the money?
Speaker 2: I, I think I liked, first of all, I liked the sales.  I liked getting in front of people and being able to convince them of my position and, and, and being successful at it and then getting paid for being successful at that.  When I first started [at International Business Machines Corporation], you know, I liked the challenge of, of--I remember one of my first territories was a, a suburb of Seattle [Washington], an area called Everett, Washington.  And I actually had a--the branch manager [Al Martin] of the area that I worked in was, was African American, which was very unusual.  And he, he was a former football star who ended up, you know, going into a business career and was very well known on the area and, and very well thought of.  And I remember going out to make my call and the gentleman basically kind of being very patronizing to me, but you know.  And by the time I'd gotten back to the office, he had called and said you know, "I'm, I'm all for this equal opportunity stuff, but you know, you know, I just can't buy something from, you know, a black woman," you know.  And, and he's telling this to my branch manager, but he doesn't know my branch manager is black.  And so my branch manager says, "Well, you know, I'd like to come out and talk to you about that."  And he says, "Yeah, that'd be good."  So he goes out there and talks to him about it.  And you can imagine the surprise on his face when he, my branch manager walked in, and he had been saying all these things, you know: no, she's a nice girl, but you know, I just can't imagine I would, you know.  And so there were experiences like that, but, but you know, you were able to, to overcome those.  You were able to come up with solutions.  And, and you didn't turn all of them around, but you turned a lot of them around.  So I liked that part.  I liked, I eventually got into sales management and had lots of different sales management teams.  And so, I liked the, the, the whole idea of getting your team to be able to be successful and being a leader of that team and, and putting together plans.  I mean, I think I enjoyed that probably the most, you know, over a period of time, seeing people that I was able to mentor who became very, you know, very good at what they did.  And, and I liked the lifestyle.  I loved, I, I loved the, the movement.  Some people said, "God, I can't imagine you, you know, moving every couple of years."  But for me, you know, I was young, and I was in my, you know, twenties and, and so--
Speaker 1: You got expense account.
Speaker 2: And expense account and, and relocation every time you moved.  And you know, I always bought a house wherever I moved, and they, at that time--I think all of that's changed now--they'd buy your house when you moved, yeah, all those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was a very good experience and for the most part, most part, a positive one.  I mean, I think I dealt with many of the things that most people did during those, those times.  And that was that, you know, African Americans were just starting to get into Corporate America.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And we didn't have the role models.  And, and now it's very different, because if, if a young person, young African American person today wants to be successful, and they, they can find people to talk to.  And people are willing and open to talking to them and have experiences to share with them.  But back then, everyone was just trying to get to that place.  And so, I didn't have those role models, and, and I didn't even have the female role models.  And then I think it was hard for the, the African Americans that were there to reach back and pull someone up, because I think a lot of them were very much in fear of losing the position that they had; not everyone, but, but I did run into some of that experience because there were just so few.
Story_ID: 610773
Speaker 1: Now you, you said the first time--now what was the year you first came to Chicago [Illinois] that you were here?  And did you live--did you work out of One IBM Plaza [AMA Plaza, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I first came to Chicago, it must have been in '89 [1989], '88 [1988], '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988], '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and how long were you there then?
Speaker 2: I was--when I first came to Chicago, IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] had opened up--
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988], '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Let me think.
Speaker 1: Are you sure?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I've been--
Speaker 1: No, no
Speaker 2: Wait a minute.
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound right.
Speaker 2: No, wait a minute.  No, 'cause I've been in Chicago--
Speaker 1: It doesn't sound right.
Speaker 2: I've been in Chicago twenty years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --that does not sound--
Speaker 2: --so--
Speaker 1: --right.  So I was getting ready to say--
Speaker 2: Well, well--
Speaker 1: --maybe--
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987], probably '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987], really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've been in, in, yeah, two, yeah, 'cause I've been--it's about twenty years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so about '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's about '87 [1987], yeah, yeah, because you know what: I, I, I, I graduated from Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] in '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: But that's, but that, I thought that was your second--so what is the diff- what is the difference in time between your first and second time in Chicago year wise?
Speaker 2: Oh, but my first and second time in Chicago, okay.  My first time in Chicago was in the late '80s [1980s].  And then I left--I, I was in Chicago, but I stayed in Chicago.  I always had a prep--a home in Chicago, but I lived other places.  So then I left Chicago and moved to Washington, D.C., then I moved to New York, then I came back to Chicago, moved to San Francisco [California], and then came back to Chicago.
Speaker 1: But I'm trying to establish--you're saying in a two year--or this--
Speaker 2: No.  This is all--
Speaker 1: This is late '80s [1980s], early--
Speaker 2: Late '80s [1980s] all the way up but to, you know, early 2000.
Speaker 1: I feel like I've known you little longer than that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I was always here.  I had a home here, but I worked other places.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I actually was on the payroll.
Speaker 1: Now when did you meet Eric [Mayberry McKissack's husband, Eric McKissack] then?
Speaker 2: I met Eric right after I got here, not too long after I got here.
Speaker 1: In eighty--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and so I've, I've been in Chicago a little over twenty years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So that's when I first came here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So now, how--but you're working downtown.  That's what--
Speaker 2: I'm working downtown.  I'm working actually--I got recruited to come to Chicago the first time.  IBM had just gotten into the PC [personal computer] business.  And they had, at the time, had a, a bunch of stores called the IBM Product Centers.  And these were stores where they sold IBM PCs, very much like you might see at a Best Buy [Best Buy Co., Inc.] or something today.  But they there--and they had one--they had two in Chicago.  They had one down in the financial district, the Loop area [Chicago, Illinois], and then they had one off of Michigan Avenue and Erie [Street].  And so, I ran that product center, and that's how I initially got to Chicago.  And by the way, I had never been to Chicago before accepting the job.  And the way I accepted the job, I had two managers who were trying to both hire me.  One was trying to hire me for Dallas [Texas] and--I had three.  One was trying me for Dallas, one for Atlanta [Georgia], and one for Chicago.  And the manager that tried to hire me for Chicago sent me this beautiful packet of information with Michigan Avenue and all the lights and, and the snow.  Just and it was so beautiful, and I thought that's where I want to live.  But I had no idea about the weather or anything.
Story_ID: 610774
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now where were you living?
Speaker 2: I was living on St. Clair [Street] and Erie [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the Streeterville area [Chicago, Illinois], what they--oh no--
Speaker 2: Yeah--no--
Speaker 1: --no, street--
Speaker 2: --right off of Michigan Avenue.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but don't they call it Streeterville?
Speaker 2: I think they call it Streeterville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so that's where I worked, and, and I lived a block away.  And so, you know, but I met some key people, you know, Lyle Logan and people like that, who were, who were friends of other people I knew.  And I met them early on and, and you know, built a, I guess, a small little network.  It was not a big network, you know, my friend, you know, Beatrice [ph.], and, and Lyle and a few other people, and they all at the time were working for Continental Bank [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America].  And then--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: --probably, you know, a couple, you know, couple of years after I moved here, I ended up meeting Eric [Mayberry McKissack's husband, Eric McKissack].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So that would have been--are you saying then that's--I'm just--would that have been 1990 or 1989 or 1991?
Speaker 2: It was right before--it probably was '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 2: Probably was '88 [1988], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause--and, and then I met, I met Eric.  And you know, I've known Eric twenty-three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, so I met him, and, and he, he was--even though he hadn't been here that long, he'd been here--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a few years, 'cause he was working at Continental Bank.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, but he knew lots of people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, he had done the whole eastern thing--
Speaker 2: He had done that; that's right--
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: --and he knew lots of people, yes.
Speaker 1: So, when you--so, wait, so you work, you're working here, but you're living all these other places--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you, and you keep--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --your home here.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it's a typical corporate life in a way.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And now are you--what makes you decided to go to Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]?  What, at what--that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was toward the end of my career with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  I was--this was in '87 [1987], okay, and had been with IBM at that time for about ten, eleven years.  And I decided, I had always decided that I wanted to get a graduate degree.  When I, de- decided that I was not going to pursue being an attorney, I'd always said I was gonna go to graduate school.  And when I found myself in Chicago [Illinois], I thought, you know, how many times in life do you have an opportunity to live in a place like Chicago, where you have two major--I mean you have lots of schools, lots of really good schools.  But you have two major universities, you know, Northwestern and, and University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois].  And I thought, you know what: I know I want to get a graduate degree in business, 'cause I had decided that, you know, that was definitely the career that I was gonna pursue.  And I knew that I also was interested in being an entrepreneur, and I wanted to have that business degree.  And so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity, you know, for me to do so.
Speaker 1: And so how did that process--were you--how did that process happen?  You--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the process for me was a little different in the sense that I started out talking to my managers at IBM.  I was a mid-level manager, and, and, and I was actually working in Detroit [Michigan] at the time (laughter).  I was living in Chicago--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --but I worked in Detroit.  And I remember, you know, talking to them and telling them that, you know, I would take a leave, 'cause I wasn't--you know, I didn't necessarily want to leave IBM, but I did want to get my degree while I was in Chicago.  And I found out about a program that IBM had.  And this was a program--I don't think they do it anymore, but at the time, they would sponsor two IBMers a year to go to graduate school.  And you had to go through an, you know, pretty rigorous application.  And you know, this is on the basis you get accepted to schools and all that.  So you do all of that, and then you put your application in.  And you compete against, you know, whoever else in the company--and so I did that and was able to secure one of those slots.  And at the time, I had applied to both University of Chicago and Northwestern.  I'd gotten into both of them and was going to University of Chicago.  And I ended up going to the welcoming reception and met some people who said, "You know, your personality, I think you'd be better suited at Northwestern."  And I, I hadn't--I had forgotten to send in my cancellation at Northwestern and went up to their reception and just really felt that that was, was home for me, from an academic standpoint, and decided I would go to their executive M.B.A. program.  And that's what I did, and I was fortunate enough that IBM sponsored it.
Story_ID: 610775
Speaker 1: So now, how did the executive M.B.A. program work then?
Speaker 2: The program that we had, it was a two year program.  It was the same program that the full-time students--you know, you took the same classes.  The only difference in the classes were that you didn't, you didn't get as many electives, because you, you know, the, the, the timeframe was condensed.  It was two years.  But you would fly in every other week, and you would have class all day Friday and Saturday.
Speaker 1: So you were still working and going to sc- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was still working.  I worked--
Speaker 1: --'cause--so you worked--you never--
Speaker 2: I worked, I worked (unclear) all the way through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you learn in that ex- I can't even imagine you at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Graduate School of Business; University of Chicago, Booth School of Business, Chicago, Illinois], as a school.  Though I know that, you know, people say it's a good, you know, a good school.  But the, the thing about Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] is it's known for its, its marketing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  And, and so what--how--did it supplement your education in real ways do you think, the, the M.B.A. program?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--you know, the thing about for me was that I was already pretty established.  You know, I had had, you know, ten years of experience.  I'd had management experience.  You know, my career path was pretty much in play.  So I didn't do it on the basis that I was gonna come back and get, you know, some big promotion with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  That wasn't my intention.  My intention really was to do it because I, I had pretty much made up my mind that IBM was the only job I'd ever had.  I'd never had another job out of school.  I started working for IBM when I came back from Europe, and I worked for them straight through.  So most of my friends had five or six jobs by then.  And so, for me, it was, what if I decide I don't want to work at IBM, you know?  Have I positioned myself, you know, the best that I can to do other things?  And I didn't think I had.  I thought that having that M.B.A. from a top school would be very important.  And the reason I had looked originally at University of Chicago is that I thought that--I'd had a lot of marketing, and I had, you know, had a lot of those type of classes, and I thought, you know, perhaps University of Chicago, which had more of a finance and, and, and, you know, type of reputation, would be a good balance.  As it turned out, you know, I really think that, that Kellogg was the better fit for me, even though I think University of Chicago is a, you know, a fabulous school.  And, and, but I think for me Kellogg was better.  And for me what happened was that IBM took care of the, the cost, which is very expensive and was forty some thousand dollars a year or something.  And I think now it's, you know, well over fifty thousand dollars a year, so it was a very expensive program.  But I, I continued to work during the, the time.  And after my first year, I got promoted again, to Washington, D.C.  And so IBM flew me back every week to, to, to finish the program.  So it was, it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Now, so you finish after those two years so that you finish in, it would be 19--
Speaker 2: Eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 1: --eight, '89 [1989], okay.  And then you're, you still work for IBM for the--
Speaker 2: I still work for them.
Speaker 1: --for an additional two years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I, I--
Speaker 1: But are you set- have you settled in Chicago [Illinois] at that point?  Are--
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm, I'm back in Chicago, but then I get promoted to go to New York [New York].  And I go to New York for a year and I work, and then I come back.  And then I go to San Francisco [California] for another year, and then I come back and I leave IBM--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after fourteen years.
Story_ID: 610776
Speaker 1: So what made you decide to leave IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] then?
Speaker 2: IBM was going through a lot of--
Speaker 1: Changes.
Speaker 2: --of changes, lot of changes.
Speaker 1: Why?  Explain what had happened.
Speaker 2: Well, it, it, first of all, IBM had a, a very--I wouldn't say a--maybe I, I would call it a practice or a process.  They, they typically hired from within.  They didn't hire a lot of people from outside.  They didn't lay people off.  I don't think, to my know- never had laid anyone off.  So they had some, some employment practices that were very different than what was happening in the industry.  And they, too, were, were having some of the strains of just, you know, should we consolidate the business?  Should we focus on all these different product areas?  What, what really is the, the key things that we want to do and all of those kinds of things?  So, I, I was managing the western area, and, and, and it was challenging, because we were having to do things as managers that I'd never had to do before, you know, lay people off and those kinds of things, which might sound silly in today's economy.  But back then, we didn't lay people off.  You know, you just moved them to someplace else; you just found jobs for them.  But we were actually having to do some of those things.  And for me, it was really was about the fact that I had decided that I really wanted to live in one place.  I had moved, you know, multiple times.  And IBM was still very much in a I've been moved philosophy.  And they were talking to me about going up to Upstate New York as kind of my next, you know, career path, and that wasn't something that, that was really of, of interest to me.  And by that time, I had, had, had met my future husband [Eric McKissack] and decided that I really wanted to go back to Chicago [Illinois].  And I'd also at that time gotten into my first entrepreneurial business, and I had opened a, a chain of retail stores [One Moment in Time] along with another former IBM colleague [Bonita Coleman Stewart].
Story_ID: 610777
Speaker 1: Can you talk, just for those who would be looking at this, like, when you started--I just want to get some sense of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  You know, when you started, you said it was the time of the typewriter.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But you're skipping the whole period, and I'm trying to understand where IBM owned, literally owned, the PC [personal computer].  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, that, that was when I came to Chicago [Illinois].  When I fa- when I first came to Chicago, some twenty-three years ago, IBM was, had just really gotten into the PC business, you know.  I mean it was a pretty, you know, a pretty big undertaking, 'cause, you know, these were, these were the original PCs, when, you know, they were big and clunky, and cost a lot of money, and had so limited storage space that, you know, I mean, you, you wouldn't even think about what, what we have today.  So, this was--but IBM was a leader in that, in that business for a long period of time.  But over, over time periods, you know, IBM ran into difficulties in that business, ultimately having to sell that business off because it just wasn't profitable for them.  And, and other companies were able to come in as the technology matured and make those products in a much more profitable venture.
Speaker 1: When you talk about other companies, Dell [Dell Inc.], what were the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dell and, and, and even people like Compaq [Compaq Computer Corporation].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you know, and the, the, the technology matured, and it--and, and because they were able to do some things that IBM was not doing at the time, some offshore manufacturing and things like that, they were able to, you know, produce those.  And, and companies like Dell came in and, and, and started to customize them.  So, you know, you'd go into a store and you'd say I want to buy a PC, and, and the PC--they would tell you what the PC had.  Well, Dell came up with a very, you know, at, at that time, a fairly innovative approach which says, you know, "You tell us what you want.  You tell us how much memory you want to have, and you tell us what kind of printer you'd like to have, you know, and, and we'll build it for you and then ship it to you."  And, and you, you know, and you can get exactly what you want.  So, you know, those were just some of the evolutions that were happening in the, in the computer, you know, business.
Story_ID: 610778
Speaker 1: Now in the corporate culture, I wanna--you know, 'cause you had--I don't think you referenced this, but there is known the Xerox seven.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, they were known, you know, as--I mean you had Barry Rand, you know--
Speaker 2: Barry Rand, right.
Speaker 1: --and others who had come along, and they had created this culture within Xerox [Xerox Corporation] that I'm, I'm told is legendary that helped--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --bring other people, you know, oth- other young blacks--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, up the fold.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you, at the same time, you're saying that that culture really didn't exist within IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].
Speaker 2: Not really at IBM.  I mean the, the culture existed in the sense as, as I matured in the business.  There were many people that reached out to help me, okay.  I had many mentors, and some of them were African American.  But it was more on a one on one basis; it was an individual basis.  I had other ma- mentors, lots of mentors who were not African American, so they, they were a combination.  I did not have many female mentors at all.  There weren't that many females, and, and, and even the ones that were there at the time, it just, you know, I didn't have that kind of mentorship.  But, but we didn't have the same culture that Xerox had.  I knew many people at Xerox in that time.  Xerox had their own African American association that was sanctioned by the company.  We did not have that at IBM.
Speaker 1: That's the Xerox seven, or no--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: --or they had a--
Speaker 2: --it, it was Barry Rand and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was the, really the leader of it.  And--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and, and, and they would actually have meetings and talk about issues and those kinds of things.  That was not the culture we had at IBM.
Speaker 1: Do you think that was the beginning of what we know now as affinity groups?
Speaker 2: I think so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --absolutely.  I mean we'd be a social networking group today, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.  That's--
Speaker 2: I mean it would be an actual--but IBM really didn't endorse that, you know.  IBM had a, a, a culture that was talked about called respect for the individual.  That was kind of their slogan.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And, and they had something called open door, which if you felt that by any, you know, way that you were not treated properly and, and you could what, do what they would call open door, which means you could take, take the process up and, and, and basically be evaluated.  Now there were, there were prices to be paid for that, and so you had to be very careful if you wanted to do that.  It had to be something of value and something that meant something to you because, you know, you weren't always guaranteed that you were gonna win.  And even though, you know, everyone felt as though there were not gonna be any repercussions, you know, it's very much the way things are even today, is that if you tie--decide to take a stance, you just need to make sure that you're comfortable with that because there may be some, you know, some downsides as a result of it.
Story_ID: 610779
Speaker 1: So now when you--so you leave IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], and you have this entrepreneurial urge.  How had that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --been--well, actually you were doing entrepreneurial--
Speaker 2: I was already doing it, yeah.
Speaker 1: --doing it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what (cough)--it was you and Bonita [Bonita Coleman Stewart], right--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --Bonita, Bonita's last name?
Speaker 2: Coleman, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stewart now.
Speaker 1: And what, what--how long had you, you know, thought about what you wanted to do?  And I think we need to look at the timeframe that you were doing the business in, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we had started the business [One Moment in Time]--let's see.  If I, I left IBM--we had had the business for maybe just a couple of years prior to, to--
Speaker 1: So then it's--
Speaker 2: --leaving IBM.
Speaker 1: --nineteen eighty-nine [1989].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Just, Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Mayberry McKissack], I'm like, you are darting all over the place.  You're, you know, you, you're living.  You have a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --home here.  You, you know, I don't know where--
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: --you would have been, in New York [New York] or San Francisco [California].
Speaker 2: Well, I was living--I first met Bonita when--I believe I first met her when I was in Chicago [Illinois] the first time.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But one of the reasons, Bonita and I never lived in the same city.  Bonita always lived in Michigan at the time.  But Bonita was one of the few African American women that was in management that was in my division.  And so, even though I didn't know Bonita, people would always tell me about her and, and vice versa; she would hear about me.  And, and we end up going to a couple of different management classes.  And, and again, you got to put it back in the timeframe.  There just weren't that many African Americans, and certainly African American women.  So when you saw two African American women, around the same age, you know, you, you had a tendency to be drawn to each other because of some of your experiences.  So we met at a, one of the management, you know, training programs and ended up just, you know, being friends and, and getting to know each other over the years.  And the first business--we did two business together, and the first business that we did together was actually her idea.  And it was her idea in the sense that we had both spent some time in Europe, and there was a concept for women to rent evening wear, very similar to a man's tuxedo business.  And a woman [Joanna Doniger] in, in Europe had brought the concept back here to the states.  And she had a store on Madison Avenue in New York called One Night Stand.  And it was basically women's rental evening wear.  And Bonita and I both heard about the concept, but it was really Bonita who decided to pursue it.  And she called me up, and she said, "I'm gonna do this."  She said, "Are you in?"  And I said, "I'm in."  And so, but we were both still working full time, both at IBM.  And so our first store we opened was in Michigan, in Birmingham, Michigan, which is where Bonita lived.  And then we ended up opening one here downtown, off of Delaware [Place] in Chicago, and then ended up opening one, our final one in San Francisco [California], which we--was a franchise.
Story_ID: 610780
Speaker 1: The first one [One Moment in Time, Birmingham, Michigan] you said did really well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, first one did very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and like most entrepreneurs, when something does really well really fast, what do you say?  Let's expand, you know; let's, you know, let's open a second one, you know, not thinking about, you know, we've got all the costs, you know.  When I say very well, we were doing very well, but I don't think we were quite profitable, you know.  But very shortly, maybe a year or two years after opening the first one, we opened the second one, here--which was here in Chicago [Illinois].  And that, and, and that one did okay, but the problem was that the cost structure was totally different.  You know, we had, you know, a beautiful store down here on Delaware [Place] and State [Street], right a block from the Four Seasons [Four Seasons Hotel Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and you know, very high rent district, and, and you know, lots of overhead.  And so we were supporting both of those stores, and we were both still working at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And so, you know, we, we really initially had not planned on leaving our jobs to do this.  It, it was really just to have--to diversify.  You know, we had both made some money working for IBM and both, you know, had been there for a fairly long time.  Bonita [Bonita Coleman Stewart] had gone back to business school at Harvard [Harvard Business School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I'd gone back to, at Northwestern [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].  But we both I think had gotten to a point where we had said we weren't sure we wanted to do this for the rest of our lives, not because it, it wasn't a good company, but just because it was the only thing we really had done pretty much out of, you know, undergraduate.  And, and so we, we both had this kind of, you know, we were always on the phone coming up with these ideas: well, what if we do this?  What if we do that?  And, and when she came up with this women's retail rental idea, I thought we could be the (unclear) of, you know, women's rental.
Speaker 1: So what were annual revenues or receipts do you think, or--
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I mean I, I, I'm not even sure I remember back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, the business was a, a, you, you know, it was, it was a fairly low margin business because--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --if you think in terms: we were renting gowns for let's say a hundred dollars.  And, and so, and, and then you had to take all your costs out of that, you know, the cleaning and the repair, all of those kinds of things.  And we had, you know, very high, you know, overhead, 'cause we bought these gowns in New York [New York], and, and then we would rent them.  So it was, it was really all about mass, you know, rentals, if you will.  But the, the good news about that business was that we learned a lot.  We learned a lot about it because it was, it, it was our first entree into, you know, an entrepreneurial business.  We learned about raising of money.  We, we learned about, you know, having employees.  We, you know, we learned about, you know, having a sound business idea.  And the reason the business did not, you know, achieve the kinds of things that we had hoped is because we really didn't understand in the beginning that even though we patterned it after the men's tuxedo business, the men's tuxedo business works because the mote--the, the majority of it is the same.  Women, you know--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: --women are very different in the way that they select evening gowns and the way that men select tuxedos.  If I asked you if you went to a black tie event, and, and I asked you what the guys had on, you'd tell me a tuxedo.  And I'd say, "What kind of tuxedo?"  And you'd say, "A black tuxedo."  But if I asked you, you know, that same event what did the women have on, you'd tell me that someone had a red dress on or someone had a beaded dress on or et cetera.  And so it was a very different business proposition for women than it was for me.  And it's kind of funny because now some, you know, almost, you know, many, many, many years later, the business has actually come back, and it's become very successful.  There's a business called Bag, Borrow, and Steal, and it really in--and headquartered here in Chicago, but it's all done on the Internet now.  And so all the, the overhead and cost structure that we had to, to deal with, you don't have to deal with anymore.  And, and it's become very, very successful.
Speaker 1: Now, you then, after that, and you try to franchise.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --part.  And then that was, didn't work.
Speaker 2: Well, the, the problem with franchising, we did, we had one franchise business, and, and they opened in, downtown San Francisco [California].  And, but, but the problem with the franchising--again, this is all about understanding your business motto--and what we learned is that the reason why franchises work, I mean if you are a McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] franchisee, it, one it's worked, it works, is because if I go into almost any McDonald's worldwide, the French fries are the same (laughter).  The hamburgers are the same, you know.  There, you know, there is a template, and everyone follows that template, and it doesn't change.  Well, when you're talking about women, and you're talking about clothing, and you're talking about living in different parts of the country, everything changes.  If I'm in San Francisco, I don't wear the same thing that someone wears in Chicago.  I certainly don't wear the same thing someone wears in, in New York or D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  Your, your, your choice of fabrics are probably a lot different.  You know, you'll see women in Chicago wearing a lot more velvet.  Well, they don't do that as much--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in, in San Francisco, you know, people wearing sleeveless or not sleeveless and those kinds of things.  So, one of the things if you're going to franchisee the business, you, you know, you, you have to have a template that doesn't change.  The reason why it works is because everyone does it the same.
Speaker 1: The same.
Speaker 2: And there's a, you know, there's synergy cost and all those kinds of things.  Well, we couldn't, we couldn't achieve those synergy costs because we couldn't go and buy five dresses all the same and then put them in all three different states, because the women wanted something different depending on where they lived.
Story_ID: 610781
Speaker 1: So what happened to U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] then?  How did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, is that we were, we [Mayberry McKissack and Bonita Coleman Stewart]--I--we had both left IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].
Speaker 1: IBM.
Speaker 2: And we were both working in the business [One Moment in Time] full time.  And we really had come to the conclusion that for us, we had objectives about what we wanted to do.  And we--it was very clear to us that for us to meet the objectives that we wanted to do, instead of having three stores, we would need a hundred.  You know, literally, we would need to have stores in just about every state, you know, in order to be able to, to get the economies and scales to achieve the kind of objectives that we have.  And we found that something my mother [Thelma Roberson Arnold] told me very early on, that, you know, just because you like clothes and, and, and like fashion, doesn't mean you own--need to own a retail store.  And so we, we, you know, we found that out and decided, actually decided pretty much at the same time that we wanted to both get back into, to business.  We--it was a great, you know, opportunity, and we were able to sell off, you know, the assets of the business, but we decided that it wasn't something that we probably wanted to do long term.  And right about that time, right before that, a good friend of mine here in Chicago [Illinois] was talking to a, a search firm, a friend of hers who was heading up a search firm.  And they were looking for someone with a strong sales management background to, to work in this very entrepreneurial high, high, you know, growth entrepreneurial company here in Chicago called U.S. Robotics, which was really responsible for modem technology with the PC [personal computer] environment.  But, but really what was prompting this business and made it just go crazy was the, was the advent of the Internet.  And so she called me, 'cause, you know, I think I had been out with her a few weeks before and probably was commiserating about, you know, all of my, you know, money that I had earned at IBM was now, you know, being poured into this entrepreneurial business and, and how I wanted to, you know, get back to making money again.  And so she said to me, she said to me, you know, "Would you ever be interested in doing that?"  And I said, "Oh, I don't think so," but, but I, I, I, I had a little bit of interest.  And I went home and, and actually--I wasn't married at the time, but my, my husband [Eric McKissack], who was my boyfriend at the time, told him about it.  And he says, "Well, you might want to think about that.  You know, that sounds like something would be right up your alley," and so I went up and, and interviewed with them.  And, and the reason why I decided to do it is because it was really the perfect merger of, of what I wanted to do in my life.  It was very entrepreneurial, had huge growth, was back in my core business, which was technology, and they were, they had lots of plans and ideas of new, creative things that they wanted to do.  And I could use all of the, the training and skills and experience that I had, both from my entrepreneurial background and my corporate background, and apply those to some new ideas that, that were very exciting.  And so that's why I decided to do it.
Speaker 1: What was the company you found, though?  What was the U.S. Robotics you found when you joined it?  How large was it?
Speaker 2: Well, U.S. Robotics when, when I joined it was about $80 million sales.  Five years later, when it was sold to 3Com [3Com Corporation], it was about $2.2 billion in sales.  And it was sold for just a little bit over 7 billion.  It was one of the largest technology sales, company sales at that time in the industry.
Story_ID: 610782
Speaker 1: I want to talk about U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] so because that, you went out there, and how did you know that the opportunity was right?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I wanna be honest and tell you that I really didn't.  I--when I first went out there, it was kind of interesting.  I interviewed with lots of the people, including the founder, Casey Cowell and the executive vice president, Jon Zakin [Jonathan Zakin].  And they kept having me come back to interview.  And--
Speaker 1: When you say kept, kept come--
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, I interviewed for several weeks.  And I became very frustrated because at, at one point, I, it was really about getting the offer.  You know, you know, that, that's that sales competitive spirit in me.  I didn't even know if I was gonna accept it.  I just wanted them to make the offer, and they weren't making the offer.  And I remember telling my husband [Eric McKissack], you know, at the time, I, I said you know, "This is very frustrating to me."  And he was the one who actually encouraged me.  He said, "I think there's something there," you know.  We did kind of what we call this Ben Franklin [Benjamin Franklin] where, you know, you kind of list all the things on one side that you like and then all the things that you don't.  But really, the, the motivation was I wanted them to offer me the job, because I felt I was overqualified for the job, and I didn't quite understand why I wasn't getting the job.  Well, as it turned out, the, the executive recruiter had been really focusing on my corporate background, my IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] background, sales manager background, all of those kinds of things.  So that's what I had focused on in my ray- my resume.  And I really said very little about my entrepreneurial experience, 'cause I had run a company [One Moment in Time] and, and, and even though we didn't have the company any longer, I had learned a lot from that company.  And--but I didn't think they were interested in that.  So after several interviews, I finally went out with, with a gentleman who would end up being my boss.  And I said to him, you know, "Look, you know, what, what is this all about?  I'm just, you know, I'm getting a little frustrated here.  I think I'm more than qualified for the job, but I don't seem to be getting the offer, and I'm just a little concerned about it."  And he said to me, you know, "We, we, we really like you.  You've interviewed with everyone.  Nobody can find anything wrong, but we just wish you had worked somewhere else other than IBM."  And he said, "You know, our culture was very entrepreneurial.  We're a high growth company.  We just went public.  We're trying to grow this thing and make it the leader of the industry, and we're just concerned that someone with your background, that's used to a lot of structure, is going to get very frustrated, because we're kind of all over the place.  That's why we have this tremendous growth."  And I said to him, I said, "Well, you know, I, I'm very entrepreneurial," you know.  And he said, "Well, gee, this resume doesn't say that, you know.  There's nothing on here that really tells me about, you know, your entrepreneurial experience."  And so I said to him, I said, "Give me, you know, twenty-four hours, and, and I want to tell you a little bit about my entrepreneurial experience.  And then after that, if you feel that I'm, you know, right for the job, great, and if not, we'll shake hands and go on our way."  And so that night I, I went home and actually laid out my, in detail, my entrepreneurial experience, and they hired me the next day.
Speaker 1: So you laid it out in what, in a PowerPoint presentation?
Speaker 2: No, just, I think at that time it really was more of just kind of a, a diagram resume format to say, you know, here I'd started this company; here's what I learned from this company; here is what I think I can take what I learned from this company and apply it to your business; here's why--you know, it was really selling myself as to why I would be the best person to basically head up this, you know, group.  They were bringing on a new division, and you know, I would be the best person to head that up.  And you know, sales was the, the core of the business, and so, and, and I was--you know, they had maybe one African American in the whole company, and they had no females.  And so, you know, having an African American woman come in there and, and, and run the core of their business, you know, probably was, you know, they had to get more comfortable with that.  And I don't think it had anything to do with, with, with race as much as it was that, you know, just the combination of race, experience, and all of that.  They just needed to feel as though that I was gonna be able to be effective.
Story_ID: 610783
Speaker 1: So what was the company you found that you came onto, you know, came in?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who, who was there?  You, you were part--were you part of the core--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --leadership team?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there, there were, there--I was core; I was part of the ten top corporative executives of the company.  And the founder, Casey Cowell, was, was very much running the company.  And, but it was, it was a company that had been around for almost fifteen years and had been successful.  But from--and it manufactured their own products.  But from a manufacturing standpoint, it wasn't, it wasn't huge success, you know.  I mean it was, you know, they had, you know, done a nice job and manufacture own products, but you know, this is a company that had been around, you know, fourteen, fifteen years.  So here is this company now that has these products, you know, modem products, that you can put inside, you know, computers that allowed people to basically use this new thing called the Internet.  This was new back then.  You know, people weren't using the Internet.  And one of the things that was starting to happen, and this is one of the reasons why I think that they were looking for someone like myself, is that there was something back in the day called remote access.  And this is gonna sound very strange to people today who are so used to getting wireless anywhere.  But back in the day, if you worked for a corporation and you were traveling, you had no way to connect into their system and their network while you were traveling.  So, U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] decided to expand bon- beyond their product line and come up with a, a product that would allow corporations to have people work remotely, have people work from home, or when they were traveling, look like they were actually in the office using the network.  I mean, that sounds, you know, revolutionary back then, but today, you know, obviously it's not.  And so that was a really why they were looking for someone like myself to come in and head up that organization and be able to expand beyond the, the consumer products they had, 'cause most of the products they had at that time were sold in, you know, Best Buy [Best Buy Co., Inc.], you know, type stores.  And they were looking to get into a corporate environment and actually sell higher margin products and take advantage of this Internet and also take advantage of the fact that they were a public company.
Speaker 1: Can I ask, so what is Casey Cowell's background and how had he--you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was the reason --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was the motivation to start the company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Casey Cowell and a group of fellow students were University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] engineering students.  And they came up with this whole idea of, of using DSPs [digital signal processing] to--
Speaker 1: DSPs are what?
Speaker 2: DSPs basically are really kind of the brains, if you will, of, of modem technology, you know, the, the interconnectivity of it.  And they started the business as students at the University of Chicago and, and had run the business, as I said, for, you know, fourteen, fifteen years with, with a, you know, fair amount of success but really didn't, you know, jump into the really huge success until they were able to take this, you know, these base products and, and really put them, combine them with Internet technology and then be able to take them into corporate environments and then be able to take them into large networks.
Speaker 1: So is that what your charge was?  What was--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --your charge?
Speaker 2: --that was my charge.  That was my charge, yeah.
Speaker 1: Your charge was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get the corporate clients?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, we just, we when, we started, the company had just gone public.  So our charge was to make sales, lots of sales.  We were a public company, so that meant--
Speaker 1: Now what--
Speaker 2: --every quarter--
Speaker 1: Why had they had--why had they chosen to go public?  Do you know that?  I know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They, they had--they saw an opportunity.  They saw an opportunity because of the Internet.  And when they saw this opportunity, they, you know, they, they needed to raise capital, and they decided that going public was the, you know, the best way to do it.  And they were able to raise a lot of capital and be able to take that money and put it into, you know, research and development and bring out these new products.  And so it was, you know, perfect opportunity to, to make that kind of expansion.  And at the time when I started, they were not the leader in their industry, in modem technology.  There was another company called Hayes [Hayes Microcomputer Products].  And Hayes was out of Atlanta, Georgia, and they were actually the leader.  And they were about $150 million in, in, in revenue, and, and U.S. Robotics was about half of that.  And over the years, U.S. Robotics ended up being the leader, and as we said previously, end up, you know, selling the company for a little bit over 7 billion.
Story_ID: 610784
Speaker 1: Now what--so was there a sales staff when you came on?  And did you have to retool it, or what did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a, there was a sales staff, but again, it was a very home grown sales force.  They, they, they really didn't have any what I would call professional sales or sales management people.  And most of the people had worked for the company maybe had been in another department ended up in sales.  But they really felt they need--and there were some good people there.  I mean, you know, they were very young.  But they, they really needed to be able to, first of all, recruit people at a very, very different level.  You know, our competitors at the time were companies like Cisco [Cisco Systems, Inc.].  And so, you know, Cisco, you know, is still a leader in, in that business.  But those were the people that we were, you know, competing with, and so we had to have people that were gonna be on par with, with, with, with those kinds of organizations, and we didn't have that.
Speaker 1: So how did you go about doing what you did there in terms--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it, it, it was, and to be honest with you, you know, it, it was something that I had really done before.  I, you know, I had run very large organizations, sales organizations, with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  I, you know, I was very, you know, familiar with how to do that.  I had had all that IBM training.  I, I knew, you know, the whole idea of forecasting, the whole ability to, to, to put sales plans in place, the whole ability to evaluate your customer and understand, you know, your customer's needs.  Those were all things that I had done, you know, with IBM.  So the combination of that IBM experience and then my entrepreneurial experience, which, you know, really is about, you know, growth and, and how do you take things from something, you know, relatively small.  And even though the company was $80 million, it still was relatively small in the scheme of things, and we were trying to be, you know, a multibillion dollar company.  And so the combination of having those experiences really helped me start to put a plan in place, putting people in place, motivating the people, building, you know, great relationships.  And one of the things I was able to do initially, was based on my past IBM experience: a lot of the executives who were in the PC [personal computer] business that I had participated in with IBM were now customers of U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] in the modem experience.  And so I was able to call those people up at level high level, CEO levels, and say, "Let me tell you what I'm doing now, and this is gonna be a fantastic product, and we're, you know, we're gonna be doing all these things.  And oh, by the way, you know, can I come over and see are you interested?"  And I don't think any of them told me no.
Story_ID: 610785
Speaker 1: So that is what contributed largely to the growth?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that what contributed largely to the growth was really seizing the opportunity, you know.  There were some very smart people, you know, like Casey [Casey Cowell] and Jon Zakin [Jonathan Zakin] and John McCartney, people like that who really were kind of the, the, the brains, if you will, of the organization.  And being able to execute, you know, see people like myself, and there are many other people they brought in too, 'cause then they started to look at--you know, they needed a different type of manager and, and executive to run the company [U.S. Robotics Corporation].  The company was growing very, very fast.  They needed people who had had experience with that kind of growth.  They need people who had already managed, you know, multimillion dollar organizations.  We had an objective that they wanted the company to be $500 million by 1995.  And at that time--
Speaker 1: And you joined in 1992.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the company was, you know, 89 mil- --
Speaker 1: Eighty--
Speaker 2: --then, okay.  So, you know, they wanted that kind of growth.  Well, when they first told that to the existing team, they were like, "Oh, my god, you know; what, what are these folks smoking?  You know, this is, you know--it took us fourteen years to get here."  Well, someone like myself, I had already run a business that was, you know, larger than the goal that they had, 'cause that was a small goal in a, in a, in an IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] type arena.  So I think they wanted people that weren't going to be scared off about that and that people would say, you know, "I could do that," I mean, even though I will tell you, I was, I was, you know, I, I wasn't scared off by the number, but I was a little bit scared off by that time.  I was like, could we have a few more years to do that?  But, but we did it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you did it.
Speaker 2: And we, and we--
Speaker 1: So how did you do it?
Speaker 2: --way beyond, you know, really, first of all, hiring the right people.
Speaker 1: So how--what--that's what I'm just wondering.  So you source people, how large was your staff when you started?  Was there any staff?  And then how large--
Speaker 2: No.  There were--I took some of the people from the existing staff, and then I supplemented them.  You know, one of the things--
Speaker 1: How many people?
Speaker 2: Of the existing staff?  Oh, maybe half a dozen.
Speaker 1: How many did you supplement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean we built an organization.  I think at the end we probably had, I mean we had hundreds of people, you know, but the main thing was getting the key people in place.  And the first thing I did was I went and took some people from IBM.  I took a, a few that had worked for me in the past and brought them over.  I brought some other people that I knew from other people references and brought them over.  And we just built a team, and it was a, it was just an outstanding team I mean.  And they were, everyone was energized.  Everyone was excited.  Everyone knew the objectives.  Everyone knew what they had to do.  And oh, by the way, we all had stock options to incent us to try to do what we could do because we were all gonna benefit if in fact the company did well.
Story_ID: 610786
Speaker 1: The question I have for you though, Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Mayberry McKissack], is that you, you know, when you were at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], you did talk about, you know, female managers, and that was hard.  There weren't many, you know, minorities to speak of.  You didn't really have ment- well, you, you said you really hadn't had female mentors (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but I had male--
Speaker 1: You had male mentors.
Speaker 2: --mentors, both African American and non-African American.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, here you go on in an entrepreneurial environment [at U.S. Robotics Corporation].  You said there weren't--you--there was one other woman besides yourself.  Is that a barrier, or do you just--it's fine with the guys 'cause you were used to working with guys, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That, you know, at that point in my life, I was in my, you know, early thirties, and to be honest with you, you know, it didn't bother me one bit, okay.  My criteria was different.  My criteria at that point in time was I wanted the best people out there, and I wanted them to be smart people.  And I brought in a number of minorities into the company.  That was very important to me.  But they had to meet the criteria.  I didn't bring them in 'cause they were minorities.  I brought them in 'cause they were smart, creative people who could help us meet our objectives, and oh, by the way, they happened to be, you know, minorities.  So, you know, I was given carte blanche to hire whoever I felt, you know, were the best people, because at the end of the day, I was held accountable for the numbers, you know.  Even if someone else was making them, I was--the buck stopped with me.  I was vice president of the Americas; I was responsible for that.  And so, you know, they didn't care who I brought in.  They didn't care, you know, what the makeup was.  They just wanted us to be successful.  But at that point in time, I, I probably didn't look for that as much.  I looked for mentors for myself, and those were people like Jon Zakin [Jonathan Zakin] and Casey Cowell and, and, and people who, you know, really evaluated me based on, you know, what I could do.  I, I never felt for one moment they were evaluating me based on anything other than that.
Story_ID: 610787
Speaker 1: Now the, the question though I, I still have is that you--now was, were their regional offices with--did you have regional offices with U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not, not in the beginning.
Speaker 1: So, so that was--
Speaker 2: But we did eventually.
Speaker 1: --not a--okay then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we ultimately did have, you know, offices around, 'round the country.  But initially, we--most of--everything was here in Chicago [Illinois].  And then we did have offices not only around the country but then international as well.
Speaker 1: Do you think that helped in some respects?  I'm just saying at the beginning, because you're ramping up very quickly.  Everything was centralized.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it did help.  You know, it was a family environment; I mean it was really a family environment, I mean, you know.  I mean I remember stories, you know, where--you know, I, I happened to, to like to cook, and that's something that's real important to me, and, and it's a way for me to relax.  And, and even though I had the money to go out and buy them gifts for Christmas, I would make them baskets.  And I would make them all of these home baked goods, I mean, beautiful baskets with all these home baked goods.  And I'd, and I'd--they--at that time, we did have people living in different places, so I had managers in New York [New York] and all around the country.  And I would send--and these were, you know, top line managers.  They were people who had worked at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and, and, and Xerox [Xerox Corporation] and Digital [Digital Equipment Corporation] and all kinds of companies, and Cisco [Cisco Systems, Inc.], and were senior, you know, senior level sales and marketing executives.  And, but I would bake these things, and when they would first get them, they thought that I had gone out and bought them.  And when they found out that I actually had baked them, they were so surprised.  By the way, my whole team was men, okay, and they were so surprised, not because of the fact that they found out that I actually could, could cook, but they were just amazed that I would take the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and it was a lot of time.  And I would, you know, turn my whole kitchen into this production line.  And I did it for several years, because it was just so important to build that, that, that community.  And, and I think that was really the reason that we were so successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You mean the building of the community.
Speaker 2: The building of the community and getting, you know, like minded people, like minded in the sense that, you know, that, that everyone had the objectives in mind, and then being led by such an incredible, you know, top executive team, the, the founder [Casey Cowell] and, and the two really key principals [Jonathan Zakin and John McCartney], that all shared the same objectives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were the--what do you think besides the right people were the key and the right team?  Team and people are the same--were the key things with succ- you know, for the company's success?  And was there ever any period in those five years that the growth, the, you know the, the growth was scary, I mean that it felt like we really can't--you know, we're gone--I mean we can sell, but are they gonna be able to manufacture, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Well, I, I think that the--when you're doing that kind of growth, you know, going from roughly 80 million to, you know several billion, I mean, that's got to be scary, okay, but--and there are certainly more times when, you know--but we, we just found, you know, ways to do it.  There really--I don't think anybody ever thought that the, the, the alternative was a choice, you know.  You know, we, we, we knew we had to do that, and we knew that's what was expected, and we figured out ways to do it.  You know, I'm not sure that we, you know, did it every day to the level that we wanted, and there certainly were time periods when you were a little bit concerned.  But, but you, you, you know, you kept coming up with different things.  And the company itself really evolved.  I mean we, we bought companies like Palm [Palm Corporation] and, and brought out the first device like that, you know, the first--
Speaker 1: PDA [personal digital assistant].
Speaker 2: --ma- the first major--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, PDA.  And so the company was constantly, you know, looking for other ways to expand.  So they were helping us a great deal.  It wasn't us just, you know, you know, trying to do it when--in a vacuum.  You know, we had lots of support and lots of help.  So--but it was scary.  But the real key was that, you know, we, we had the right people; we had the right product; we were in the right time.  You know, timing is very, very critical.  And at this particular point in time, people were, were crazy for these kind of products.  These products were revolutionizing the way that people were running their, their, their companies and their organizations, increasing their productivity by being able to have people dial in from home and, and look like they were sitting at their desk.  You know, these were, you know, very different times.  And so it was all of those things coming together.  I don't think it was any one, one thing, and it wasn't any one person, but it was, it was a combination of all of that coming together.
Story_ID: 610788
Speaker 1: Now what was an average day like for you? 'Cause you talked about--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, I think during the break, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your date at, at midnight.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and, and there was no really average days.  It was chaos most of the time.  An average day though was starting very early.  We--
Speaker 1: You were living in the city [Chicago, Illinois], but this--
Speaker 2: Lived in the city, but we were--
Speaker 1: --the office [of U.S. Robotics Corporation] was--
Speaker 2: --we were in Skokie [Illinois].  Average day was getting to work, you know, as early as possible.
Speaker 1: What time?
Speaker 2: You know, probably, you know, before, before 7:30, and again, you know, with, with traveling, and you know, a series of meetings.  There may be customer meetings.  They may be internal meetings.  We manufactured our own products, so we had manufacturing right there.  So my meetings were with other heads of the group, so you know, the VP of engineering or the group--VP of manufacturing.  I was constantly meeting with all of those people, because it was, imp- you know, it wasn't just about selling it.  You know, we had to sell it, and then we had to executive it, and then we had to get it out to the client, and, and then the client had to be satisfied.  So you had to have good relationships with all of those keys heads in order to make that, you know, happen--very long days, could be seven days a week, many late nights, midnight.  I mean it was, it was a grueling schedule.  I, I can remember I'd recently had gotten married.  And I was--my husband's [Eric McKissack] company would have these different events.  And I'd be the only wife coming in there (laughter) late, you know, harried from being on the freeway for two hours.  And you know, and everyone else had been, you know, very nicely getting themselves together, and I probably looked like I don't know what coming in there, you know, and to the point my husband finally said, "You know what?  Why don't you just wait until after, you know, they, they kind of do the preliminaries, and kind of show up in the middle?  I think it would be better that way."  So I was out of control.
Story_ID: 610789
Speaker 1: Now, your sales staff was originally--was mainly here in Chicago [Illinois], and then you started.  When did the, when in that five year period were you establishing national operations in--
Speaker 2: We, we start--
Speaker 1: --international--
Speaker 2: --I think we started in, you know, pretty much a year after.  You know, it, it, it came pretty quickly, because that was one of the plans, is that we needed people, you know, across the country.  So we, we needed a western division [of U.S. Robotics Corporation], and you know, we needed a eastern division.  And that was part of my, you know, charter, was to put all those things into place, and so that became very, very quickly.  And I don't think that we would have been able to have the success that we had if we had not had that, that kind of infrastructure.
Speaker 1: So how did you then get, you know, become larger than hart- what, did you say it was Harvey's?
Speaker 2: No, at the time--
Speaker 1: No, was--Hay--
Speaker 2: --we--there was an--hm?
Speaker 1: Zhu [Zhu Sun]?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Was it Haynes?  Hayes [Hayes Microcomputer Products].
Speaker 2: Hay--Hane- Hayes.
Speaker 1: Hay- Hayes.
Speaker 2: Hayes.
Speaker 1: Hayes.
Speaker 2: Yet, oh, oh, I'm sorry.  You're talking about that, Hayes.  Wa- we became larger then pretty quickly because we--one of the things is that, we had a excellent distribution system.  And we fig- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That you had built up.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, they, they had really built that before I got there, because that was really kind of the core of their business.  And then they just expanded it.  And so, they had programs set up with all of these distributors, companies like Ingram Micro and Tech Data [Tech Data Corporation] and people like that.  And so, all the top distributors were selling their products.  And so, and then, and then one of the ways that we were able to really start to grow is we start bringing out other products and you know, making some acquisitions of, of other companies, and, and you know, all the things that you do in order to have that kind of growth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And really, a lot of focus around that time also, the Internet, it was just, it was--
Speaker 2: It was just, yeah.
Speaker 1: --blowing out of control.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was.  And, and again, you know, I said this before, but you know, in, in any kind of technology business, and in business just as a whole, timing is, is one of your key elements of success.  You can have a lot of great ideas and bring them out at the wrong time, and quite frankly, it may or may not work.  But, you know, when all of it comes together and you have the right product--now you can, you can have the timing and not have the product, and, and you can be in, you know, trouble that way also.  But when you have the product to build on, and you've got the timing to go along with it, and then you've got the demand and interest, you know, I mean those are really all the combinations I think that what makes for a successful business and, and especially in that environment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 610790
Speaker 1: So at that--the five year--now, when was it, when did you know you were gonna be sold or, or purchased, or was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were you looking for suitors 'cause--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, really didn't--we were doing very well.  The stock was, you know, at its, you know, height.  I mean it, it was--it wasn't one of those situations where we had started to get into, you know, trouble.  And quite frankly, I was very surprised that the company was sold and, and very disappointed.  I remember Casey Cowell, the founder, calling me the night before to tell me that, you know, we were gonna announce a sale.  And you know, it had to be very hush-hush because it was, you know, we're a public company, and you know, you know.  The insider trading kinds of things you talk about now, I mean, you know, we didn't, you really didn't have those, but you did have certain rules that you had to follow.  And so, only the, you know, maybe top, you know, maybe three to five executives were really involved in it.  And, and, and actually that was a smart move, because you really need to keep the other people focused on, on making sure of the business.  But, but Casey looked at some of the, the future trends.  I mean this was a, you know, a guy who had, you know, founded the business twenty years ago.  And so, you know, he was now, you know, forty, forty-one years old and had been doing this business all his life.  And so, even though it was five years where we had this explosive growth, he had been doing the business for almost twenty years.  And he, he had a, just an uncanny ability to look out to the future, and he saw a lot of things happening, some of the consolidation that was happening.  He saw some of the, the, the things relative to price increases and, and impacts on, on, on profits and those kinds of things.  And he felt that the company had achieved what they needed to achieve and would be better suited by being part of a larger entity.  And, and there was a company, 3Com [3Com Corporation], who--out of California--that was interested in purchasing U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] and for a lot of money.  And Casey, you know, and the, and the, a couple of the other key executives felt, and I'm sure the board--you know, we had a board obviously as a public company--and the board and, and the executive management team felt that this was the time.  And I think a lot of people there were, were disappointed, because we were on this roll, and you know, you think it can last forever, and, and a lot of people wanted to stay independent.  But I think that they made the right decision in hindsight.
Speaker 1: Right, because the bubble ended too.
Speaker 2: The bubble ended.
Speaker 1: The bubble ended.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  We got out, but the bubble ended.  And so, but at the time, I was very disappointed.  I was very--matter of fact, I told Casey so.  I said, "We're on a roll.  Why would we stop now?"  You know, I mean, we weren't having, you know, really any problems.  You know, people, today when you hear about, you know, companies, most of them are filing bankruptcy the next--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --day.  Well, we weren't anywhere close to that.  We had, you know, plenty of money.  We could do another stock offering.  I mean we had all kinds of options.  But you know, Casey, I think was a lot wiser than some of us who were, you know, kind of, you know, in the moment.  And he was able to see beyond that and really decided that, you know what, it--this is the time.  And he was right.
Story_ID: 610791
Speaker 1: What I wanna know is that, so you had this experience with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  What--I mean and you talk about the brilliance of, of, you know, Casey Cowell.
Speaker 2: U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation], yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: No, Ca- ca--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you said the experience with IBM but U.S. Robotics.
Speaker 1: No, I meant IBM, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But I'm saying, when you look, you, you talked about him as, you know, sort of a visionary and you know, having this pulse.  Did that teach you about, you know, being a good leader or a good--even more about managing--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  Here's what Casey did the best, and there's one thing that I think I've always tried to do, and I, I certainly did it at U.S. Robotics, and I think I was very successful doing it.  Casey believe you hire the best people, and then you get out of the way and let them do what they do.  That's what he always believed.  And so--and, and I think that that's very, very true today.  I think it helps you both in a corporate experience but certainly in an entrepreneurial experience.  I mean get the very best people that you can, and then let them do what they do really well.  That doesn't mean you're not involved in any way, but, you know, you don't try to micromanage everything that they do.  And that's what he did, and that's why I think the company was successful.  He did that at every level.  Now, you know, you might have gone through some stuff to get there, but once you got there, I mean, it, it was yours.  Now you owned it.  And when that meant when you owned it, you were totally accountable.  So don't tell me that you had twenty people, you know, working for you who were responsible.  The buck stopped with you, and you had to take ownership of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you said you had to get through, go through some things to get there, what do you mean by that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean you had to go through the process, you know.  So, and, and, and for me, also because when I first started at U.S. Robotics, I hadn't had a lot of jobs.  I'd worked for IBM--
Speaker 1: All right, that's--
Speaker 2: --for fourteen years; I had a, a, a brief entrepreneurial experience; and then I had U.S. Robotics.  So I was used to a lot of structure, and that was one of the things they were concerned about, is that maybe I have just a little too much structure.  And so I had to get used to the fact that, you know, when I called a meeting, people might not show up.  If they were doing something else that they thought was going to help the company and move--and solve a customer's problem, they were gonna do that before they came to my meeting.  Well, at IBM you would never have that.  You know, if you called a meeting, they were gonna be there.  So there was that culture shift that I definitely had to, to, to get into, and, and it took a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now what did you learn about yourself though?  Is there anything that you learned about yourself from that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think first thing I learned about is that I love growth, you know, environments.  This, this was a, you know, it's just one of the most, you know, you know, fun things that, that I love to do.  And, and, and you know, it's a different environment, you know.  You know, we used to talk a lot about, you know, there are different places that you could be in your life.  You know, you could be a hunter, or you could be, you know, you can be a maintainer, you know, or you could be in a growth en- .  And I like, I like the growth part because it's, it's fun; it's challenging; it's innovative.  I, I also think that--I really felt that the, the big--one of the biggest lessons is that I like a piece of both of the worlds that I had been into.  I liked the entrepreneurial piece.  I liked the corporate piece.  But putting them together, fusing them together in the environment like U.S. Robotics was fascinating.  But at the end of the day, it taught me that for the time period that I was at in my life, and, and really for where I've been, you know, since then, is that the entrepreneurial environment is, is, is probably more to my liking for what I am today.  However, what I found is that there's still a piece of me that likes that corporate environment.  And so the way I, I've managed that in my life today is that I work in an entrepreneurial environment, but I sit on corporate boards.  And so I get a chance to have the best of both worlds, or I teach at, you know, a university [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].  And so I get a chance to, to, to have these corporate environments, which I like, but I also get a chance on a day to day basis to have that entrepreneurial experience.  And that's probably I think one of the biggest lessons, is that for me, I always thought it would be either/or, either corporate or either entrepreneurial, and I find for me that it's really both.
Story_ID: 610792
Speaker 1: Now when you--when he--so he [Casey Cowell] calls you and tells you that, you know, the night before, that the, the company is going to sell, or the sale is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --gonna be announced--
Speaker 2: It's gonna be announced; it was done.
Speaker 1: --the next day.  It was done.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, it had to be approved by the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the boards.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But yeah, it was done for all--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --practical purposes.
Speaker 1: So what does that become then at that point?  You're managing ex- you know, concerns of your staff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: And what is the time between its announced and the time you leave?
Speaker 2: Probably six months.  I mean, I mean, basically--maybe, maybe a little shorter than that.  I, I don't really quite remember at the time.  But, really my concern at that time was--I didn't have a financial concern 'cause it was a good, that was a good day actually (laughter) all stock options vested; I mean I was a pretty happy camper, so that wasn't an issue.  But I did have an issue for my people.  You know, my, some of my staff didn't have the kind of options I had, so you know, for them, they still needed to work.  And so one of the first concerns was do we want to stay with the new company?  The new company was, you know, courting, you know, a lot of my folks as well as, you know, asking me what my interests were.  And you know, I was going out to California and spending some time with them and trying to see if there was a fit for me.  And, and so, really, the first few months were really all about managing the transition and trying to find, you know, the right places for my people, but--and then also trying to decide what I wanted to do.  And at the end of the day, you know, 3Com [3Com Corporation] was a great company, but you know, they were headquartered in California.  I had already done the California corporate thing.  I was married [to Eric McKissack], and, and did--I, I didn't want to do the discover America program, is what I call when you fly all over America.  And I, I just decided that, you know, Chicago [Illinois] was my home at this point and that I wanted to stay here and do something, and so I decided that I would leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you leave.  And you're really at this point, it allows you to sort of discover yourself again though--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --because you were, you know, you had this really--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, busy, hectic--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --schedule.
Speaker 2: I mean I had for twenty years--
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --seven [1997], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had ever since I, you know, graduated from, you know, high school [Franklin High School, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Worked.
Speaker 2: You know, worked, and nonstop, never, never a day, you know, I mean, you know, literally that I didn't have a, a job.  And so, you know, here I am, in my early forties, and all of a sudden I no longer have to work.  I, you know, have made more money than I ever thought existed, and, and--but I don't have anybody that wants to go out and play, 'cause all my friends are working (laughter).  And so, it was kind of a tough, you know--it may not sound too tough, but it was really tough, because I didn't know what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.  And, and so I took a little bit of time off, but I should have taken more, but I ended up getting back into another entrepreneurial business.
Speaker 1: A company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But then, was that two years later though that you--
Speaker 1: No.  It was--
Speaker 2: Just a year?
Speaker 1: About six months later.
Speaker 2: You know, oh, my goodness.
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, maybe not even six months.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a, a few months after I left, I, I ended up going back into another technology company that actually a couple of the founders of U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] were--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --investors in.  And they called me and said, "Look, you gotta go help this guy do the same thing you helped us do."  And--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --and so, that, that was a little different story, but the, but the, but the, the point of it really is, is that, you know, you, when you get out of something like that, you gotta give yourself time to really figure out what the next step is.  And I jumped into something probably a little, a little quick, with the idea that I could duplicate what I had done at U.S. Robotics, not financially; I didn't care about that as much.  I wanted to duplicate the experience.  I wanted to duplicate the people, the camaraderie, the success, the, you know, the, the, all the things that I enjoyed, and so I brought a lot of my U.S. Robotics people over to the company.
Speaker 2: So that was Open Port Technology [Open Port Technology, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Open Port Technology.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about that company?
Story_ID: 610793
Speaker 1: But I wanted, before you do that, just one thing.  I wanna sort of establish that you also, Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Mayberry McKissack], were sort of in a rarified space, mainly because there's a lot of emphasis here in, you know, in Chicago [Illinois] in terms of, you know, the Internet and dot, you know, the whole dotcom thing.  And there were no blacks, really.  I mean there were other black people around the country, you know, are women, but there weren't a lot of women predominantly placed in any of these companies.
Speaker 2: No.  In, in, in the Midwest, because I had a West Coast background, you know, I started really in, you know, technology in the West Coast.  And--but the Midwest was still very much in, in kind of its entry level stage.  And there were not a lot of black women at all, some black men, but definitely no black women.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and certainly not, I think, women who, black women, who had been able in their, you know, early forties, to work for a company that had this phenomenal growth period and, and, and get out and live to tell about it, (laughter) you know, I mean, you know.  So that was kind of a unique--and, and, and by the way, you know, really hadn't planned on it.  I mean I, I thought I would work for them for, who knows, you know.  I had worked for one company [International Business Machines Corporation] for fourteen years.  I thought I could do another fourteen.  So, you know, the, the, the time period was very quick, the five years [at U.S. Robotics Corporation].  It was a very intense five years, but it was a very rare experience.  And, and for me, I think one of the things, as I look back on it now, it would have been nice to have had some mentors, some people who had gone through that experience, because literally I didn't know what to expect after that.  You know, you think if you leave something like that and financially you don't have an issue, everything else would, you know, be answered for you.  But really it, it, it wasn't answered at all.  It, it really just opened itself up to all kinds of other questions.  Okay, so now what do you do with it?  Okay, what do you do with the rest of your life?  Okay, you know, what kind of difference do you want to, to make?  What kind of environment do you want to, to be in?  And oh, by the way, you have options, and you have choices, and, and, and so how do you make the best decisions?  And I really didn't have people I could talk to 'cause there weren't a lot of people that I knew that had, that were in that environment--
Speaker 1: That had even experienced it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, as I said most of my friends, you know, were still working.  They weren't--they couldn't go out to play.
Story_ID: 610794
Speaker 1: So now, Open Port Technology [Open Port Technology, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], tell, tell us about that company (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Open Port--
Speaker 1: It was, it was also a--wasn't it a startup?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a startup, but it had been around for about seven years, and it was a venture backed company.  And they had funding from a lot of very large venture companies, bank capital, Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation], you know, number of companies.
Speaker 1: Who was the founder of that then?
Speaker 2: Randy Storch was the founder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was an IP messaging software based company.  They were making--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --without getting too technical, but they were making an IP messaging product that basically was used for telecom, the telecom industry.  And our clients were--
Speaker 1: For, for people who don't understand what that means--
Speaker 2: Well, like for--
Speaker 1: --what is IP messaging.
Speaker 2: --example--for example, in the telecom industry, our clients were people like Cable and Wireless [Cable and Wireless Communications, Inc.] or people like WorldCom [MCI Inc.] or people like Quest [Quest Software].  So those were the telecom industries.  And this IP software product was--would allow you to communicate and do all kinds of, you know, IP faxing and all kinds of things to help large telecom companies communicate.  And so it was an international business and--
Speaker 1: Does IP stand for Internet Protocol?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, Internet Protocol, okay.
Speaker 2: And, and so it was a, it was a very ambitious, you know, product.  And it was, had been in development.  They had developed it from scratch.  And it had been in development for some time.  They'd gotten a lot of funding.  And again, this was kind of during the Internet boom, if you will, some great engineers and, and good people.  And it was an international business, and that was one of the things that, that interests me.  I was general manager worldwide.  And we opened up an office in Hong Kong, and, and had an office in Paris [France], and, and, and I had people all over the world.  And, and that was really a, a great experience from that standpoint, just, you know, the other cultures and you know, doing business and all those different cultures with all those different telecom companies.  'Cause each, you know, country, if you're in, in France, you have French telecom; and you, if you're in Germany, you've got another, you know; if you're in--but they all have their, you know, their own telecom companies, and they all have their own protocols, and they all have their own products.  And so, it was a very interesting experience.
Speaker 1: So what was not interesting about it?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it--you know, the, I think the lesson learned there is that it's very difficult to duplicate things in life, okay.
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: That was a lesson learned there, okay.  The, the, the company was a totally different company.  The product was a totally different product.  The people were totally different.  The timing was different.  You know, you could go on and on.
Speaker 1: Well, it was also venture backed too, so that may--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and the environment was different, okay.  We were, we were not a public company.  We were a venture backed company.  And so, what was different about it was that you can't duplicate success if the elements in, in most cases are different.  And all the elements in this were different.  The only thing that was the same is that it was in the technology world.  But all the elements were--we were dealing with international countries, you know.  They all have their own rules.  They all have their own work--I mean simple things like hiring people.  I mean I had--my, my European people got six weeks' vacation--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --state, you know, country mandated, okay.  Well, that was really a problem with my U.S. based people, who got two, you know, and you know, just managing those kinds of things, so really, really good experience but different time, different product, you know, not as well thought out as the U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] experience.  And unfortunately, after about three years, that company--you know what happened with telecoms and just in general, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It went under, right?
Speaker 2: They, they, a lot of them went under, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 610795
Speaker 1: But did, did Open--wasn't Open Port [Open Port Technology, Inc.] based down- were you based downtown [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Downtown.
Speaker 1: Right, I remember--
Speaker 2: 676 St. Clair [Street].
Speaker 1: I think I remember--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so they, the--and because they were venture backed, what happens a lot with VC [venture capital] companies is they have a number of companies in their portfolio.  And so, when in fact, you know, things turn, they will look at those companies, and they'll make a judgment and say, "Well, you know what: we got ten companies; we're only gonna keep three.  You know, company A looks like it's good chance of success; company B, maybe not so much; company C--so guess what, you know, even though, you know, they may be decent companies, we're gonna, you know, take our losses on, you know, one and, and hope to, to be, you know, successful with the others."  So they got kind of caught up in that.  They got caught up in all the changes and the telecom industry that were happening.  And, and the company eventually, the, the venture companies decided that, to let the company go away.
Speaker 1: Well, the changes in the telecom industry had to do, do a lot with some consolidation.  Also, the telephone companies were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a lot of industry issues--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that, that, that had happened.
Speaker 1: Can you discuss some of those?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it, it really was.  I mean there were lots of different things that were happening.  Consolidation was a, a big piece and deregulation.  So deregulation was probably one of the biggest issues that were happening.  And, and, but that wasn't really our issue as much, you know.  I think our issues were that we were a very small company trying to sell to international companies, you know, with--we probably had 110 people, including engineers, manufact- you know, everyone, trying to sell internationally, which is, which is a big challenge because you've got to have an infrastructure to go deal with every country, and every country deals differently.  And, and again, being venture backed, you know, you've got to show a certain, you know, amount of success, and you've got to, you know, meet the objectives.  So it was a combination of, of things, timing, industry, product probably in the sense of, you know, the product changed quite a bit and, and being able to get the product developed.  We were developing a product, and, and we were trying to develop a product that, you know, could be customized for all these different, you know, telecom companies and, and so just lots of, lots of different challenges.  But really, the issue and the lesson learned was that if you go into something different, you have to go into it on its own merits.  You can't go into it with the idea that you can take previous success and duplicate it doing the same things you did before.  And that really was the, the lesson learned--good experience but, but, but truly that in my opinion was the, the lesson that, that I should take out of it.
Story_ID: 610796
Speaker 1: So then you, you go right into--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to Nia [Nia Enterprises, LLC, Chicago, Illinois].  Now--
Speaker 2: I actually, I actually started that a year before I left Open Port [Open Port Technology, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  I had decided after a couple of years at Open Port that this was probably not gonna be where I wanted to stay.  You know, that, that was one of the good, good things I think after being in business for a long period of time.  You know, I, I, I did see signs, you know, that okay, this probably isn't exactly what I thought it was gonna be.  And I went to the CEO at the time and, and the founder [Randy Storch] and said to him that I, that I didn't think this was gonna be the right place for me.  But we were trying to take the company public.  And he had asked me if I would try to stay on 'til we could get the company public.  And, and, and I felt an obligation because I had a lot of people from U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation] there that worked for me.  And so, but I told him that I had this, this idea.  And I told him it was not a competitive idea.  And I told him a little bit about it, this whole idea of doing research online for ethnic communities.  And, and of course, he didn't understand what that was about and said you know, whatever, you know.  And I said you know, "I'm not gonna do it on your time, but, but, you know, I'll stay to try to help, you know, get the company public and, and you know, make a transition.  But I want to start researching this idea that I have 'cause I think this is what I'm gonna do." I'd decided that I don't want to go work for another company.  I want to be an entrepreneur again.  But this time I want to do something different.  I want to do something that really can have an impact on my community, something I'd never done, because I've been in technology all my career, and most of the technology I was in was pretty much a, a non-ethnic business.  I didn't have ethnic customers.  I didn't have, you know, products that were really sold into ethnic markets.  And so, you know, I'd really just got into a point in my life where I wanted to do something that I thought might have a, a, a bigger impact.
Speaker 1: And so, so talk about Nia.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was he agreed.  He said okay.  As long as you continue to do what we need you to do, you can start it.  So I started it.  And the way I started it, I was fortunate enough to find an individual who was, had worked for one of the largest consulting firms and--McKinsey [McKinsey and Company].  And he had--was a Rhodes scholar, was a MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate, and, and end up meeting him through my husband [Eric McKissack]. He was younger than my husband but, but affiliated through MIT.  And he was kind of going through a period in his life where he was looking to do something else.  And so he said he would do some research for me to see if this idea had any merit.  Would companies be willing to do research online?  And again, the Internet was still, you know, in its infancy stages.  And the whole idea of doing research online for anyone was something new, because at that time, about less than 5 percent of research was done online.  Today, you know, over 35 percent is done online and they expect over the next few years over 50 or 60 percent will be done online.  But back then it was a, a very small percentage.  And even less was being done online with ethnic communities because African Americans and other minorities were not online at that time.  This is 2000--
Speaker 1: That's right.  We're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) okay.
Speaker 1: --the digital divide.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, so they weren't online.  So, the whole idea, the concept of, that you would get, you know, primarily at this time African American communities to open up and, and do research online seemed like something that was a little, you know, farfetched.  But anyway, we did the research, and, and I decided that, you know, I wanted to, to do this, and so we decided to launch NiaOnline [niaonline.com].
Story_ID: 610797
Speaker 1: And what we decided to do was that we would, we would take--first of all, we'd build a community.  This was back before Facebook [Facebook, Inc.] and all of these other kinds of things.  And, and we wanted to take the African American people that were online and bring them together.  And, and our primary focus was African American women.  We wanted to have African American women kind of be our, our gateway, if you will, into the African American family.  And so we, we started out by building a, a community site where we would provide them information that would help them with their families.  And after a period of time, we would then go to them and ask them if they'd like to be a part of our consumer advisory panel.  And the whole objective was to build this, build the largest consumer advisory panel, which we did, where we could have easy access to get into the minds and insights of African American families, and be able to provide that information in a research format to corporations so that they would have better information in the products that they were putting into our communities.  And we were especially interested in areas like healthcare, because we ultimately wrote a book on, on choosing health and wellness.  And the book was really all about African Americans really choosing to live healthier lives because we found out that we index at the top levels of every major disease, you know, you name it.  Whether it's cancer or heart disease, African Americans lead the chart in every one of those disease and, and primarily African American women, and men also.  So we, we could see by that there was this really--you know, a lot of disparities in the healthcare.  So our thought was, well, you know, if corporations could have a better understanding of what African Americans thought they needed in these areas, they could put some of these things into products, or have us be involved more in the testing phases before it gets into, you know, your local, you know, drugstore, 'cause by that time it's a little late.  And as we did some of our research, we found that African Americans had, had some, you know, had some issues with research.  You know, they, they still--you know, even though some of them had an experience, that they had heard stories about the, you know, Tuskegee days [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male] and you know, being used kind of as guinea pigs or whatever, and they just, they didn't have a, a trust level as to what were you gonna do with that information?  How are you gonna use it?  How is it gonna impact our community?  How is it gonna better my life or the life of my family?  And so we found that we had to, to build this whole what we call trusted dialogue first before they would give up the information.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now what were the steps along the way?  Because I remember you starting--really, you wanted to be--look at Essence and being, you know, somewhere--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --not, not at--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --Essence online?
Speaker 1: No, because Essence wasn't--Essence didn't have an online--
Speaker 2: They were thinking--
Speaker 1: --at that time.
Speaker 2: --about an on--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but they didn't want you to start.  Was that it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they, they--well, no, they, they--we, we just--they were print, and they were definitely print, and, and that was their business.  And, but they were gonna get into the online business.  And we met early on with one of the founders.  He had actually summoned us to New York [New York] to meet with him, with the idea that we might be able to do something together.  But, you know, that just didn't work out because of what our objectives were and, and what, you know, he expressed as their objectives.  But, but their primary business was always, you know, to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to do print.  And certainly they've expanded and evolved into online now, because, you know, that's just the way of the world.  I mean you, you can't--
Speaker 2: That's right. That's right.
Speaker 1: --really have a business today without having an online component.  But, but our focus really was to build the community first, get people comfortable that we were gonna offer them something of value, and then once they were comfortable, ask them if they would be a part of our, our panel so that we could do this research on a, on a regular basis.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was really kind of it.
Speaker 2: So--
Story_ID: 610798
Speaker 1: Because it's eight years since you've been doing that, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Going on nine.  And so talk about--because you've, you know, you've passed the critical--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --time period.  Often there's that five year time period when it comes to businesses.  And they have been, you know, lots of things that have happened that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, we had the dotcom bust.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: We had--
Speaker 2: Well, keep, keep in mind--
Speaker 1: You have also minor- you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --talking about minorities, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--the, the business has evolved, and, and we've, we've--you know, again, when you, when you start a company, you never know what's gonna happen, okay.  We started the company [Nia Enterprises, LLC, Chicago, Illinois], and right after we started the company we had 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  So that was the first, you know, thing that we had to deal with, is that all of a sudden, you know, budgets just went out the window.  You remember.  People were just--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, not doing anything, you know.  It just, you know, this, they were just really--fear had just taken over, I think, people.  So that was kind of the first issue.  And then, then the second issue is that my partner--
Speaker 1: Bonit--
Speaker 2: --the same partner I'd had--
Speaker 1: Bonita [Bonita Coleman Stewart].
Speaker 2: --with the first business [One Moment in Time], decided to go back to Corporate America.  And so that happened early in the business.  So, you know, we've had, you know, a number of things that, that we--you know, that you have to, you know, transcend.  And then I think the dotcom bust, you know, mo- a lot of companies that started with me are no longer here.  And so we've had to evolve our business as well.  And so today our business really, you know, is, has several components to it.  It has, first of all, the research component.  It's still a very big component.  And we're getting ready to even change that in the sense that, in 2009, we'll take part of our research component, and we'll totally automate and put it online.  So, we're building a research library.  So, for example, we'll do a series of questions every month, and we'll put them online.  And if you are a advertising company, and you're doing a new business pitch, and you want to know something about what women feel about the automotive industry because maybe you have an automotive account, you'll be able to go onto one of our sites and look up what kind of research and questions are out there about automotive.  And right there online, sign up that you want the answers to the question, and pay for it, and within, you know, twenty-four hours have a report delivered to you.  So, you know, you, you have to keep evolving because the, the needs change.  Most of the work we do today is custom, you know, research.  I mean we do it for companies like L'Oreal [L'Oreal S.A.] and people like that.  And, and the problem is, is that, you know, we don't know what's gonna happen in 2009--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --and so we have to have, you know, products that are gonna fit into the environment that we've had today.  When we started out our first client was DaimlerChrysler [FCA US LLC].  We had a three year multimillion dollar contract with DaimlerChrysler.  Well, you know, today DaimlerChrysler probably is not the, the company that you'd have that kind of arrangement with, not because they're not a good company, but because they're having their own struggles.  So, you know, we've had, we've had to adapt.  And so what we do today primarily, we have, we have our--continue to have our research and several different, you know, products that offer in our research.  We continue to--we've expanded our research to the Hispanic market as well as and are doing, you know, projects in that market.  We have our online, NiaOnline [niaonline.com].  And we, you know, we've added things like, you know, blogs, because that's the way people want to communicate today.  We've built an online library. So the seven years of original content that we developed, we have the largest online original content for African American women.  And we've built that into a library so people can come on and search on different topics and look and see all the past articles that we have and information that we have.  So that's currently on that.  And then we have something that would--that's a daily offering, where we give a series of lifestyle tips based on topics that our audiences told us are important to them.  And that can be everything from, you know, whether it's about hair or fashion or whether it's about, you know, health.  We have something called nurture beauty, which is about health and wellness.  So, you know, it's really a combination of both media properties, online media properties, and online research, and that's really our focus today.  And, and you really have to do that in order to be able I think to, to stay and be relevant to the audience.  And, and we'll, we'll do other things as we go, you know, forward.  But it's really to, to continue to be a focus for African American women and their families and doing work obviously in the Hispanic areas that relates to research.  But during the election, for example, we, we started a, a, a, a news blog just to talk about the election.  You know, people wanted to talk about it.  They wanted to, you know, hear what was going on.
Story_ID: 610799
Speaker 1: I'm gonna veer away from the business a little bit.  And when did you--what--you, your first corporate board was what?
Speaker 2: Deluxe Corporation.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you are on, is it--
Speaker 2: I'm on two corporate boards.
Speaker 1: Two corporate boards now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: One is in Florida, right?  Do you go to--
Speaker 2: No.  One, one is in Minneapolis [Minnesota], and one is in, here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how--do you start serving on those, what, 2004?  No--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've been on--no.  I've been on Deluxe since 2000.
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how has that whole experience been--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for you?  Because that's another place that people want--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get of a certain--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --you know, 'cause it, it comes with pay.  You know--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.	Yep.
Speaker 1: --you go to meetings.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a different type of lifestyle.  There are people that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --now sometime that's what they do.  They serve on boards after--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --they leave Corporate America.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, it--let me tell you this, this, it's been a great experience for me.  And it's not something that I started out to do.  I, I speak all over the country about getting on corporate boards.  It is, it is one of the hottest topics that everybody wants to, to talk about.  And one of the reasons they want to talk about it is 'cause African American women and men are still very unrepresented on these boards.  When you look at the percent of the population of African American men and women--excuse me; I got something in my eye.  I gotta stop for a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's okay.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, the reason that people are so interested in corporate boards is because African Americans, both men and women, are still very underrepresented in corporate boards.  And when you look at the percent, the, the percentage that we represent of a population, you know, 13, 14 percent, and yet we only represent anywhere from 3 to 5 percent on corporate boards.  And so, we still have a long way to go to, to making that happen.  With the--what happened for me, when I was at Open Port Technology [Open Port Technology, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], one of my technology companies that I worked for, one of the gentlemen who was on our board, okay, who was one of our investors and on our board, came to me and said, "Have you ever thought about sitting on a corporate board?"  And I said, you know, "I really haven't," you know.  I mean I was, you know, I was in my early forties at the time, and I thought you had to be really old to sit on corporate boards, I have to be honest with you.  And you know, and I, I didn't see a lot of African American women sitting on boards.  I'm not even sure I knew anyone personally that was sitting on a board, and so it wasn't something that I had as an objective.  But I really had a lot of respect for this individual, and he was very successful.  And he said you know, "I sit on several boards, and you know, you know, I would love to put your name in as a recommendation.  I don't know if you'll get selected.  You have to go through a process, but would you be interested?"  And so as a result of that, I end up speaking to him more and about it, getting--you know, doing some research and background.  And I thought, you know what, this could be really interesting.  And for me, what was so interesting about it was that there was an opportunity for me, being that I had this corporate background, and I loved a lot of things about my corporate background.  I didn't want to go back in Corporate America.  I still don't want to go back into Corporate America.  But I found that my experiences, I love to, to, to talk about strategic issues relative to the corporation, and, and you know, marketing sales initiatives, and understanding, you know, the profitability and, and, and, and financial aspects of the business.  And so where do you, where do you learn all of that?  And, and as an entrepreneurial, I found that I was somewhat isolated, because if you think about it, as an entrepreneur, other people work for you.  And so, you know, I found that one of the things that was really lacking for me was, was this, you know, in this entrepreneurial company, all--most of the people worked for me.  And so I didn't have as much of that intellectual, you know, curiosity as I would like from other people.  And I thought, well, this might be an interesting way to do that.  And so, I was fortunate that, you know, he submitted my name, and I went through the process.  It was a--you know, they had a search firm, and you know, I had to be interviewed and you know, all kinds of different things.  And I was selected to, to be on the board, and I've been on that board for almost nine years.  And, and I chair the corporate governance committee and that board and, and, and am involved in, you know, the audit committee and a number of other things.  I've since gotten on another corporate board about four or five years ago, a bank board.  And that's been--
Speaker 1: The name of the bank?
Speaker 2: Private Bank [The PrivateBank and Trust Company; CIBC Bank USA].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And it's just been a phenomenal experience because it's a different industry.
Story_ID: 610800
Speaker 1: And what I find exciting about it, now that, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm no longer with a company--I have my own company [Nia Enterprises, LLC, Chicago, Illinois]--again, the same things are true.  You know, I get a chance to use my experiences.  I get a chance to sit in a room with really smart, creative people and talk about ideas to help a company be better at what they do and perform, you know, my fiduciary responsibilities to shareholder, which is really what you do as a board director.  And I, I think that the challenge is that it's not that there are not qualified African Americans out there that can sit on these boards.  Most of us don't get the entry into--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --the boardroom.  And, and that's--you know, people ask me all the time, how do you do it?  And I tell them the first thing that you do, do an exceptional job at what you're doing today.  You don't know when you're gonna get discovered.  But one thing about boards is you can't apply to be on a board.  It's not like getting a job.  You have to be recommended; you have to be referred.  And typically, one of the best ways to get a referral is from someone who's already sitting on the board, because that person already knows what it takes to be on that board, and they're looking for people that they think have those kind of characteristics to be successful.  But it's, it's been a great experience.  And I, I've been asked to be on other boards.  After you've been, you're on a couple of them, then you have to get a little bit more careful about timing because, you know, you can't, you can't accept all of them, and you shouldn't accept all of them.  And you've gotta balance it with other things that you're doing.  But it's, but it's a great experience.
Speaker 2: It is, yeah.  Tell me, what--you say that it's a great experience.  I know you're part of a--you know, it is this rare--this is another rarified space, you know.  And it's like a private club--
Speaker 1: It is, yeah.
Speaker 2: --in, in, in a lot of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, in some ways, yeah.
Speaker 2: --respects.  There has been increasing scrutiny, you know, of--I mean in liability, you know.  And so, what in that--what did--what I want to understand, though, is the sort of, the life trajectory, you know, what this sort of represents.  You know, you said that it's a nice balance for you.  And I know, you know, the audit committee is, you know, at--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --with boards.  That's a very important committee--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to be, you know, part of.  And there, and, and the things is a lot of times when blacks were first--or women--you know, they didn't get those type of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 2: --committee assignments.
Story_ID: 610801
Speaker 1: So my question though is: what--where--what is next for you, in some respects, and what does this represent?  Because what we have not touched upon is really your philanthropic and sort of civic involvement that became very predominant I think after you left--
Speaker 2: U.S. Robotics [U.S. Robotics Corporation].
Speaker 1: Yeah, U.S. Robotics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I've, I've, I've always been involved, to some degree.  I sat on my first civic board, you know, you know, sixteen years ago, maybe--no, probably eighteen years ago was my first civic board.  And I stayed on that board up until a couple of years ago.  And it was a technology board.
Speaker 1: Was that IT Resource?
Speaker 2: IT Resources [IT Resources, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Resources, right.
Speaker 2: And I, I sat on that board for--
Speaker 1: Which is a technology.  They actually--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --helped us at the beginning.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I sat on that board for about sixteen years.  So I've always had, you know, some interest in giving back.  And I think that really was just based on my parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry], you know, that even though they, you know, didn't go to college initially and all of that, you know, they always, you know, you know, were, were very clear about the fact that you need to always reach back and help somebody and because somebody helped you get where you are at.  And so I've always had an interest in doing that.  And sometimes being in some of the technology companies that I was, I just didn't have the, the time, with my travels and all of those kinds of things.  So I said to myself that, when I stopped, you know, doing that--and that was one of the reasons that I wanted to be an entrepreneur, 'cause I wanted to have a little more control over my time and what I, you know, what I spend my time on.  And, and what I do now is I, I really look at what I do as a platform.  And so included in that platform are, you know, certainly what I do with Nia [Nia Enterprises, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] and, and, and the work that I do there, which, which I, I still enjoy and want to continue to evolve that.  But it also is the work that I do, both with my civic boards, you know, one of University of Chicago hospital board [University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois], and, and a foundation board, the Donnelley Foundation board [Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelley Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], and you know.  So that is very important to me as well, and then my, my, my corporate boards, which give me that balance between the work that I do as an entrepreneur but also my experience in, in Corporate America.  And then you can find other ways to give back.  I'm an adjunct professor at Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] in, in their M.B.A. entrepreneurial program.  And, and in many ways that's giving back too, 'cause I get a chance to share my experiences, not only with students at Kellogg, but I get to take it beyond that.  Last weekend, for example, I taught forty students at the Urban League [Chicago Urban League, Chicago, Illinois], forty entrepreneurs who were looking to take their businesses to another level and grow.  And that's the second year that I've been teaching that class.  And so, there are lots of different ways you can do that.  So I look at, you know, what's next for me is that, taking the platform that I had today and you know, I may substitute some things; I may add some things to it, but continuing to find ways for me to continue to grow, and then take that growth and experience and learning I have and figure out ways to be able to give back.
Story_ID: 610802
Speaker 1: Now why did you want to do Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois]?  Why did you want to teach and at the--you know, you're actually teaching at the school that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --attended.
Speaker 2: At my alma mater, yeah.  You know, I, I wanted to teach primarily--Steven Rogers, who is, is one of the distinguished professors and also one of the chairs up there at Kellogg and is, you know, have been successful, you know, doing so many things and, and for a very long time there, came to me with the idea of developing this class for their entrepreneurial program.  And I wanted to do it, because the class was all about entrepreneurial selling, skills, and strategies.  And one of the reasons I wanted to do it is 'cause when I was in, at school, Kellogg has been known as a marketing school and is one of the premier marketing school, if not the premier marketing school in the country.  But the fact of the matter is, is that, everybody needs to know how to sell.  And it doesn't matter whether you want to sell as a profession, but if you're an entrepreneur, you need to know how to sell 'cause you're gonna be selling, whether it's your banker or whether it's your, you know, selling to get people to join your company or whatever.  And I felt that it was a skill that, that, that--and, and Steven felt the same way and, and Kellogg did as well, that it was a skill that had not been developed, and, and there were not a lot of class offerings out there.  And they had done some research, and one of the things that their postgraduates told them of the M.B.A. program was that that was the one skill that they wished they had learned a bit more when they were in the M.B.A. program, because it was something they found that they had to, to use almost immediately.  And so I felt that it was something that had not been done, needed to be done, and with my background and experience, it, you know, it would be a good opportunity for me to do it.
Speaker 1: So you started a class from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --a, a course from scratch.
Speaker 2: --developed a class from scratch, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what is the name of the class?
Speaker 2: It's called Entrepreneurial Selling, Skills and Strategies.  And it's in the M.B.A., the full-time M.B.A. program at Kellogg.
Speaker 1: So what were the challenges with that, you know, 'cause academia--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is different.
Speaker 2: It's very different, and there were challenges, and there, and there still are challenges to some degree.  I think the challenge is, first of all, to put together the right kind of plan that is going to be interesting and going to be of value to your students and to put it together, you know, in a way that meets the requirements and academic structure of the institution.  And, and that, that it, that can be a challenge, and especially to someone who, like myself, who was very used to speaking, you know, speaking engagements, public speaking.  I've done that, you know, for years.  But it's very different to do public speaking and then to teach a class under academic standards--those are two different things--and being able to understand how to do that, then do it, be successful doing it, get the right feedback from your students, and then figure out how to keep the class fresh.  You gotta keep changing it.  I don't mean changing the basic concepts but changing--you know, if you--for example, next year I am sure that I will be tweaking this class.  I already did a couple weeks when I was teaching the Urban League entrepreneurs [Chicago Urban League, Chicago, Illinois].  I thought that I really needed to put a section in there about downturn strategies.  What kind of strategies can you use in a downturn market if you're an entrepreneur trying to sell your product?  'Cause that's what they want to talk about today, because today, selling is very different than three months ago.  So you know, that's the one thing that you've gotta do.  You gotta keep your, your, your, your class fresh.  I think it's, you know, it's--in 2009 I think it would be crazy to not adapt your class or talk about what's happening in the economy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that, those are the challenges.
Story_ID: 610803
Speaker 1: I'm gonna move to sort of a philosophical section.  But with you--if you were starting out today, and there's someone, you know, is, wants to go into business who has your same sort of background, what would you advise them?
Speaker 2: They want to go into business or be an entrepreneur or--
Speaker 1: Right, go into, they want to go into the area of business.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What would you tell them?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the first thing I, I would tell them that, is that, especially if you're asking me today, which is 2009, I would say if it's possible, try to get some experience, maybe on someone else's dime, okay.  And, and again, you know, it's a very broad question because it depends on the industry; it depends on the--
Speaker 1: But I'm saying--
Speaker 2: --type of business.
Speaker 1: --they think they're oriented towards business.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would say get, get some experience if you can.  Now, when I say doing it on someone else's dime that doesn't mean using someone else; it means figuring out what your value is; figure out what value you can give to that entity, company, et cetera.  And then, you know, getting value back for yourself that'll, first and foremost, give you some more information to decide if that's really what you want to do before you, you know, perhaps go out and put your own money up as an entrepreneur or try to bring other people along, you know, to be a part of your business.  And there are lots of different resources out there that you can do that.  I mean, and some of them are, you know, cost money, and some of them, you know, do not.  But I would also, you know, say find five people that you really respect, you know.  These can be people you know or people that you don't, and write to them or call them and see if you can't sit down and really get, you know, as much of an understanding as possible about what, what did they use in order to be successful?  What do they think is critical to being successful in business today?  'Cause I think being successful going forward today is different than what it took for me in 2000, you know.  And if I had to do it today, I would do it a little bit differently.  So I think you have to do your own research, whether it's getting people--I, I would get some people who know you and some people who don't know you.  The people who know you, you know, get people who, who will really tell you the real deal, you know.  Sometimes you don't see yourself the way other people see you.
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: You think you have strengths that other people don't see.  And, and it may, may be the case; it may not be the case that it's true, but, but you've got to figure out ways to, you know, to get it out there if that, if in fact that's the area you're gonna be into.  So I, I would, I would just, first of all, say do your own research.  This is not the timing I think to go out and do something, you know, kind of haphazardly or, or throw a bunch of money at something without, you know, doing some basic kind of, you know, tackling and, to see whether or not the idea is the right idea, and it's the right time, and you're the right person to execute it.
Speaker 1: So you're basically advising people now not to do as much entrepreneurial things, because--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --it's--is that--
Speaker 2: I'm not, no, I'm not advising them--as I said, it's a very, you know, generic--
Speaker 1: Is it, is--
Speaker 2: --because I, I don't know what the business is.  What I'm--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --saying is, is that I'm advising them to be a little more cautious, okay.  There was a time when, you know, the, the money was, first of all, out there.  You could, you could get funding, you know, a little more easily than you can now.  You could get, you know, people.  You could, you know, you could do a lot of things.  I'm saying I, I, what I'm advising is that I think you've got to pay attention to what's happening to the economy right now.  And I don't think anyone believe that, that our economy is necessarily gonna turn around tomorrow, so I, I think that it's prudent for you, if you're going to get into an entrepreneurial venture, that you make sure you do your research to, to really try as much as possible to understand: is this the right time to do it?  Or, more importantly, even if it's the right time, do I need to tweak the business a certain way in order to make it the right time?  And I'm saying that if in fact you're unsure about all of those things, then go get some experience, you know, with someone else that will allow you to answer some of those questions before you decide to, to get out there.  But I think when, when it's all said and done, if you wanna do it, you know, you'll make the, you, you make the opportunity happen, and you go ahead and, and do that.  I wouldn't say wait three or five years, 'cause there's never a perfect time.  But I'm just saying I think you really do have to pay attention to what's going on.  People who are entrepreneurs today, they're paying attention to that themselves.  They're looking at their businesses and figuring out: how do I tweak my business so that a year from now I'm still in business when, you know we know that, that times are gonna be challenging.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And, and I think that, you know, anybody who's a entrepreneur and wants to stay an entrepreneur has got to reinvent themselves, if you will.  That doesn't mean change your whole business but, but doing as I've said with my research business [Nia Enterprises, LLC, Chicago, Illinois], is that, you know, waiting for those big projects, you know, customized projects, may be a little far and between in the, the, the next year.  So having another type of offering that, you know, allows you to go out to the masses, who may have X budgets to spend on that but don't have the budgets to do a customize, may make more sense in this environment.
Story_ID: 610804
Speaker 1: With Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], Barack, Barack's--I have to ask you this question.  It's that we don't usually ask this question.   But you're a friend of Barack, FOB, we should call (laughter).  What do you--this is an exciting time for all of us.  And I'm just wondering what you see as the opportunities, you know, as we head into 2009 and beyond, and what you think his election represents.
Speaker 2: Well, I had an opportunity to speak at Kellogg [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] right after the election and talk about--was on a panel with a group of people talking about what this election mean.  And, and I think the election means many, many things.  I mean I think first of all, I think it shows what, what can be done when you believe, okay.  I, I remember being at the Hyatt when, the night that Barack, couple of years ago, announced his candidacy and, and room was, was full of, of people.  And, and I remember talking to people around the country about it in the early on, and a lot of people, even African Americans, some said god, I just, I think it's great, you know, but I, I just, I'm not sure that it can happen.  But, but I think it really shows what you can do when you put together a program.  You have a, a credible candidate, you know, with all of his talents and skills, and you get people to join together who believe in that and go out and make it happen.  I also think what it shows is what you can do when you take advantage of technology and be able to run a campaign very differently than it's ever been run before, really understanding what's relevant with the coun- the country today.  So I, I, I think it means so many different--there's so many lessons learned.  But I think the major lesson is that anything's possible if you believe in it, and then you can put together the right program and execute.  Now, with all that being said, I think we also have to understand that this is probably one of the most challenging times in certainly my life's history, and, and, and, and maybe even my, my mother's [Thelma Roberson Arnold] life history, you know, in the sense of where we are from an economic standpoint, where we are from the standpoint of, you know, world security, where we are from a standpoint of, of global issues that we have to deal with, you know, domestic issues at home.  I mean it's, it's a very challenging time, but I'm pretty confident that, you know, Barack and the team of people that, you know, that he's put together, of which some--many of them that you and I know, you know, I think they, they will figure it out and you know, make the best, you know, choices available.  But I don't, I don't think it's gonna be easy.  I think it's gonna be very, very challenging.
Story_ID: 610805
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?  You know, some people say even the election of Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], you know, we can just throw away all the past and you know, that it's a new day.  Some people say, you know, that their racism is, you know, sort of dead.  And so I'm just wondering, you know, because here you grow up, you know, when I listen to you, you grow up in a, a place that was not typically African American, not urban.
Speaker 2: Right, right that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean in an urban but not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --African American urban.  It's a place that also elected a black mayor [HistoryMaker Norman Rice]--
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You definitely grow up in a black household--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so it's not like you had--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the suburban--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, I'm not sort of black--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --experience.  And so I ask the question.  You've been very, very active in, you know, black causes.  And so I'm just--I ask that question, you know, with all those things that are represented.
Speaker 2: First, first of all, I don't think that, you know, as wonderful as it is, and as historic as it is, and, and as, as enthusiastic as I am about the election of President-elect Obama, whatever was there before has not changed, and it's not gonna go away tomorrow just because of that election.  You know, if there were, you know, prejudice and racism and, and equities and all of things, the, those are still there.  What I do think though has changed, is that people have an awareness.  And, and, and to get an opportunity to see something different than maybe what they believed before, maybe what they were exposed to before--and I think that's not only true with Barack, but I think that's true with Michelle [Michelle Obama], you know.  And because my business [Nia Enterprises, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] is focused so much on--
Speaker 1: On women.
Speaker 2: --black women and their families, I mean I am--and Michelle I probably know, you know, better than I even do Barack, in the sense of, you know, being on panels with her and, and, and you know, having a chance to know her over these years in the business circles.  But I think that there is, you know, there has been this whole issue of image of black women for a long, long time.  There are people who look at Michelle, and they see a black woman that they've never seen before.  Now you and I have seen this because we, we know people like Michelle.  There are a lot of people like Michelle out there, you know, very talented, capable, you know, black women, but a lot of people don't have that image.  And so, I think the combination that, that, that President-elect Obama and Michelle have of a black family, they don't have that image, you know, you know.  And so, you know, we're changing some of these images out there.  What is the black family today?  What is the black woman today?  Or, you know, what are black--you know, who are the black children of today?  You know, I mean I think we're, we're, we're just opening up images to people that they haven't seen before.
Story_ID: 610806
Speaker 1: And I, and I'll end and just tell you one little story that was kind of interesting to me.  You know, I sit on some corporate boards, and, and some of my colleagues, my board colleagues, are staunch Republicans and you know, had no intention of voting for, for Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  And we would have very spirited discussions, you know, throughout the election period of why I was so adamant that, you know, Barack was gonna win and, and, and, and should win and, and why they should think about supporting him.  And, and one of my board members said to me before the election, said, "I want you to know that I wrote a check."  And I said, "What do you mean, wrote a check?"  And said, "I wrote a check for your" he says, "your guy, Barack."  Okay.  And I said, "Well, I don't know if he's my guy, but I wouldn't put it that way but certainly my, my candidate of choice."  And I said, I said, "Have you switched?  I mean are you, you know?"  And he said, "Oh, absolutely not."  He said, "But I wrote the check."  I said, "Well, I gotta ask the question.  Why'd you write the check?"  He said, "I have children," and he said, "I have young adult children who--," he said, "I have not--you know, with all the prodding and you know, encouragement, I have not been able to get them to get up, do something on their own, use their own money, get involved, volunteer."  He said, "And this man has been able to do that."
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And he said, "Even if I don't personally sus- sus- you know, subscribe to his, you know, polit- politics and, and his way of thinking," he said, "I have tremendous respect for any individual that can, you know, motivate and encourage and inspire my children to take action and get involved and be a part of the solution, whatever that is."  And he said, "For that, I will write a check."  That's the kind of change I think that we have made.  And, and while he's not gonna necessarily change his whole ideology, and he has every right not to do so, I think that all--that, that we got past that idea that a black man could, could not do something these things--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and a, and a black man who didn't have a, you know, upbringing that, that was without lots of, you know, heartache and, and issues and challenges and what have you.  And hope if nothing else, it'll remove some of the, the, the thoughts that we as African Americans have that if we don't have the right, you know, you know, home life, or we don't have a two parent household, or we--you know, whatever it is, that we can't, you know, achieve.  Because when I see some of our young kids--and, and my niece, for example, and you know, the night that Barack accepted the, the, the, the nomin- well, actually accepted the, the--he had, he had won, she called me at, you know, one o'clock in the morning crying on the phone saying, "He won! He won!"  I mean she was so excited, and she's thirteen, you know.  And I think that that's the kind of change that I think you'll see.  But, but I think we've got a long way to go, and, and I hope that people don't think that it's gonna change overnight.  But I do think that we will create a different kind of awareness, different kind of image.  I think he's, he's really trying to, to, to run a different kind of political infrastructure which, by the way, I think is extremely difficult, because I think it's been run a different way for way too long.  But I, I, I think we're going in the right path.  And I don't--the future is, is yet to be seen, but I think we're going in the right path.
Story_ID: 610807
Speaker 1: Given your comments just now, the, this--and remember I said that the average age in our collection is mid-seventies.  So we haven't done a lot of you guys.  What do you think the legacy of our generation is?
Speaker 2: I, I, you know, I really think that our legacy is that for most of us, or a lot of us I will say, we're the first generation to go to college and go to grad school and, you know, have the professions that we have.  I mean, and again, that's not to say that we don't have any of that in our community.  But for a lot of us--I know in my family I'm the first one to finish college, the first one to, you know, get a graduate degree.  And so I think, you know, our legacy is a little bit different, in the sense that we've got to make sure that we bring as many people as we can, you know, behind us.  One of the things that I heard someone recently say, and, and you were talking about their accomplishments, and, and this gentleman said he had I think eight siblings.  And he said that the biggest accomplishment is that every one of the siblings had gone to school, okay, you know.  And for me, you know, that's a kind of thing I think about.  When I think about my nieces and nephews, I mean I want to, you know, if I can, help them, you know, achieve what they want to achieve, and, and make sure that all of them go to school, that it's not a, you know, it's not a, a second thought, that it's a absolute, you know, requirement that they get the best training they can for whatever field or skill that they're interested in.  And, and I think that, that, you know, when our parents were coming up, they'd always wanted a better life than what they had.  So if they didn't go to school, they wanted us to go to school.  They wanted us to have better jobs.  They wanted to have--us to have better opportunities.  I think that we've lost a little bit, that one of the things I see sometimes with our generation, and I see, you know, kids from people in our generation, is sometimes the kids are doing less than what the parents are doing, okay, which is a total reverse than what you and I came up with, you know.  You know, we always strive to--whatever our parents did, even if they did go to college, you know, we wanted to do something, you know, even greater than that or make more of a contribution.  And, and, and I think we've, we've backtracked a bit.  And I think we've gotta make sure that we continue to move it forward, and there, there are many ways to do that.  I mean we've gotta make sure that we don't get left behind in technology.  We don't get left behind in math and science, and that we continue to, to, to move forward to make sure that the generations behind us really do have a better world, not just lifestyle, but a better world and leave a better world than, than, than where we are today.  And I think that we still have a lot of challenges with that.

Speaker 1: How many though, no, seriously?
Speaker 2: Well, we, you know, we, we've been very fortunate because we, we love our nieces and nephews and godchildren, and, and because we don't have, you know, biological children of our own, we've been in a position to open our home and be able to do some things.  And, and they're just, they're wonderful people.  I mean they're wonderful young people, really trying to, you know, find their own way and, and make some kind of contribution.  And I think that's part of the legacy too, is that everybody here needs to think about their life as to what contribution they can make.  And it's different for everybody, but you know, whatever we can do to help them get there I mean.  I think the, the other thing that's, that's great is that when my parents [Thelma Roberson Arnold and Donald Mayberry] were coming up, they didn't have a lot of mentors and people they could talk to and people that could help them.  And now, you know, we're in a position, this generation that you and I are in.  While I'm always pleased when someone says well, you know, you--you know, when I joined my first board people said, "Well, you're, you're the young--," and I thought, gosh, you know, I'm feeling old, and now I'm the youngest person, you know, on the board.  And, and, but on the other hand, I think that, I think we've really got to make sure that this next generation behind us doesn't lose their way.  And we have to use all the resources we have to help them, you know, because they're gonna have challenges that we didn't have.  When I graduated from college [Seattle University, Seattle, Washington], if, you know, if you had a skillset and were in a particular area, you could--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --get a job, you know.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: Young people today, twenty-two, twenty-three, coming out with great degrees, you know, can't find jobs--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --or people who want to get in investment businet- business, and it's in shambles.  I mean Wall Street was the gene--dream job, and, and now--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --there are no jobs on Wall Street.  So it's a very, very different environment for a lot of, I think, very young, talented individuals, and especially minority individuals.  But the goodness that we have that, that perhaps, you know, we didn't have when we were coming is that we now have connections; we now have mentors; we now have people that, that we've helped or have helped us; and we can use those resources and those networks to help, you know, people behind us.  And I think that's what we're really gonna have to focus on.

Speaker 1: And Eric [Eric McKissack], you had--now how--you guys have been married how many years?
Speaker 2: Twelve years.
Speaker 1: Twelve years.  Oh, but god, it seems longer.  I think of you as--I mean it does.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Twelve years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can't believe that.
Speaker 2: Going on thirteen, about twelve.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.  I'm sorry I'm lost.  Okay, so, what has made a good marriage for you, because he is really like a life partner--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I, I think, you know, it's so funny--
Speaker 1: You're one of our power couples here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'll, I'll tell you, it's kind of funny.  My niece and I were actually talking about this just in general.  And I think one of the thing is that we're opposites in the sense that, you know, I might be more of a type A personality, and he's just very even keeled and, and you know, really accepts life as it come and, but, but very talented and successful in his own right.  And I think the balance of those two personality types has worked very well for us.  I think the--what really makes a successful marriage for us, and I think it's different for everybody, is that first and foremost, we're best friends.  You know, we talk about everything.  He's supportive of what I'm doing, and I'm supportive of what he's doing.  And you know, I always know that no matter what I do, whether I'm successful or not, or whether I make mistakes or not, that there is gonna be someone in my corner, and I can come and talk to him about it, and he's gonna be helpful to, you know, providing maybe some ideas and solutions of how I can improve it or make it better.  And that, that's what's worked for us.  And, and again, you know, it's, it's really that communication, that, you know, making sure that you're, you're talking about whatever it is that you ha- you have on your mind and, and being there as a support system.  You know, that's what make, makes it work for us.  But as I said, it's different for everybody.
Speaker 1: You have a favorite Eric story?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, that I can tell (laughter)?
Speaker 1: For posterity's sake.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know that I have a, you know, a favorite Eric story.  I have a lot of Eric stories.  But I guess, I guess my favorite story, or one of my favorite stories, is when he asked me to marry him.  And we were in Hawaii, and we were having breakfast.  And he asked me to marry him, and I was so surprised I said--I got up.  I didn't say yes or anything, and I went and said, "I think I'm gonna go take a shower."  And I didn't say anything about it for two weeks (laughter).  And then, he finally said, "So what are you gonna do?"  (Laughter) And I said, "Well, yeah, yeah, I think we'll do this."  So it's just, you know, it's just kind of a funny story about how we, we dated for so long, and then when he finally did ask me to marry him, I, I, I must have been in shock or something, and I didn't respond immediately.  So I guess that's one of my favorite stories.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That sounds like a, that sounds like a favorite Cheryl [HistoryMaker Cheryl Mayberry McKissack] story though in a way.  You didn't respond for two weeks (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: So, but--
Speaker 1: Last--
Speaker 2: --we had a lot of good times.

Speaker 1: Last but not least, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I think I want my legacy to be that, you know, I tried to improve the life of somebody else, you know, along the way.  I mean, you know, I think without that, I mean, you know, what's it all for?  I mean so many of us, you know, do a lot of different things.  And, and, and I think the one thing that's so great today: you could find so many ways to do it; you don't have to do it one way.  It's not about sitting on one board or, or one group or working with one, you know, organization.  You can find all kinds of different ways to give something back.  And if you've been blessed, certainly as blessed as I have been, and had an opportunity to do what you love to do, make money doing it, and get--and find new opportunities, I, I think, I think it, you know, it absolutely is a requirement that you figure out a way to help somebody else get there.  And, and if I do that and, and, and be able to be of some support and help to my family, I think I've had a pretty good life.
