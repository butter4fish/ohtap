Story_ID: 350921
Speaker 1: So now we're gonna start in talking about your family history.  So let's start with your mother.  I know that your mother has gone on to a better place and I'm very sorry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She died recently, just before Christmas, so it was very difficult time for us.  I was very close to my mother.
Speaker 1: Tell me her name, and spell it for me, please?
Speaker 2: Her name was Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson.  First name E-U-R-E-A L-E-E, Hubbard her maiden name, H-U-B-B-A-R-D, J-O-H-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Hooks, Texas, which is Bowie County [Texas] near Texarkana.
Speaker 1: And where was she raised?
Speaker 2: In the same community.  She went to elementary school in Hooks and high school in Texarkana and De Kalb [Texas], and then she went to college at Texas College in Tyler [Texas].  I think it's Tyler (laughter), east Texas.
Speaker 1: Did she have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: She had five siblings, and we called them the big six.  There were three boys and three girls in her family that survived.  There were, I think, two children that died soon after birth.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me their names?
Speaker 2: The oldest brother was John Smith Hubbard, Jr. [John Hubbard, Jr.] named for the grandfather [John Hubbard, Sr.], and then there was Iola Brown [Iola Hubbard Brown] who I'm named for, and Gus Hubbard and my mother, Eurea Lee, and then Norman Hubbard and the last was Geneva Bizzell [Geneva Hubbard Bizzell].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, my grandfather was di- my grandfather died before I was born, my grandmother died when I was four or five.  I have only one recollection of her and that was being in the car with her while my mom was out Christmas shopping, and I wanted to look inside a package that my mother had brought back to the car, and I was attempting to peek in and my grandmother was in the front seat, while I was in the back, and as I tried to peek into the present that she'd bought, my grandmother threatened to hit me with her cane (laughter).  I don't think she really would have done it but that's the only memory I have of her, and then I remember seeing her after she was dead.  She died in Los Angeles [California], and it was unusual in that the mortuary placed the dead bodies on beds with satin comforters over them, like they were asleep, rather than putting them in a coffin, which is more traditional.  And I just remember walking into the room, seeing her in the bed and thinking how much alive she looked.  And that's really the only recollections I have of my grandmother.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Smithie Garland Hubbard, and she grew up in the Garland community, which is near De Kalb, and there're still lots and lots of Garlands there who were all relatives of course.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year she was born?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I don't know about the year that my grandmother or my grandfather were born.
Speaker 1: Do you know how old she was when she died?
Speaker 2: I believe she was in her mid-sixties when she died.  My grandfather, on the other hand, died I know at age fifty-six from diabetes and, so, he went very early in life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could we--I'm not sure whether I asked you your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother--no, you didn't.  She was born September 13, 1909 and died December 13, 2005, which was ninety-six years and four months to the day.
Story_ID: 350922
Speaker 1: Now, on your father's side, tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Horace Johnson, H-O-R-A-C-E, Johnson, and he had only one brother, Roy Johnson, and a sister who died at a very early age.  And that is about all that I know about my father's side of the family.  He grew up with an evil stepmother I heard about, but I don't know anything more about my father's side of the family.  I grew up knowing only my mother's  [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] side.  My father was killed when I was very young in an accident, and there were not very many family members, just my father had the one brother, as I said, and he had only one child.  So there's very little family on my father's side.
Speaker 1: What was his date of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born May 19th, I think it was 1894, 1896.  So he was considerably older than my mother.  Both my parents were relatively old when we were born (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you don't know about the grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No.  I know that my grandmother on my father's side died when he was a small child and he was raised as I said by an evil stepmother, but that's about it.
Story_ID: 350923
Speaker 1: So we'll move on to you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you were born where again?
Speaker 2: Texarkana, which is a city that is--half of the city is in Texas, half is in Arkansas.  The hospital where I was born happened to be on the Arkansas side.  They have since moved it to the Texas side, which makes a lot of people very happy because, you know, it's a big deal to be a native Texan.  So I like to say that I was, I was born as close to Texas as I could possibly get (laughter) without being born in the state.
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory as a child?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest memory was moving from Arkansas to Arizona, where I was raised.  I don't have much of a memory of that, I was about four years old at the time and I have this vague memory, and I'm not sure if it's a memory as much as it is having heard the stories over and over as I was growing up.  But I have this memory of us living in one of my mother's [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] rental properties while my father [Horace Johnson] had left Arkansas and gone out supposedly to buy property in Southern California, where my mother's two sisters [Iola Hubbard Brown and Geneva Hubbard Bizzell] lived.  She had decided that she didn't want to raise her children in the Jim Crow South, as she said, segregated conditions.  So, she had given my father an ultimatum.  The children and I are moving to California with--to be near my sisters and, if you want us, you'll come too (laughter).  And so my father sold everything that the family had.  He was a farmer and a rancher, he sold all of his property and went off to California to buy more land and start over out there.  Well, he got sidetracked in Tucson, Arizona where his only brother [Roy Johnson] lived and we ended up there.  But that's digressing a little bit.  I remember us staying--I don't remember the house that we lived in, in Arkansas but I have this vague recollection of living in the rental property that my mother owned and a boy from across the street coming over, and we had a sofa that was either leather or vinyl, and it was green.  I remember that very clearly 'cause we had the sofa after we moved to Arizona.  And he took a little hatchet and cut the arm of the sofa, and I was so upset about that.  I remember chasing after him and beating the heck out of him.  So that--I was very aggressive as a little girl and my father wanted boys.  He ended up with three girls, so we were kind of rough and tumble, and kind of tomboyish you might say.  So, it was nothing unusual for us to beat up boys (laughter).
Story_ID: 350924
Speaker 1: You talked about your mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] and father [Horace Johnson] having children later on in life.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about how they met, and what your mother did before she met your father, and how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, my mom went to college [Texas College, Tyler, Texas] first of all, which was highly unusual for someone of her age, and, and, at that time.  And once she was out of college she moved back home with her parents [Smithie Garland Hubbard and John Hubbard, Sr.], and she was the apple of her father's eye.  He absolutely adored her because she looked like him and had his coloring opposed to the other children, and he spoiled her something awful.  He bought her a new car every other year that she stayed at home.  And she didn't do much of anything except just enjoy life.  And my father being a rancher, my grandfather was also a rancher and a farmer, my father came over to buy cattle, I think, from my grandfather and he--my grandfather thought a lot of him and wanted him to meet his daughter.  I think he was kind of getting ready to unload her anyway.  And they met and my father was about fifteen years her senior, fell in love.  He had been married before, had two children by a previous marriage but was divorced, and they got married and for a time traveled throughout the United States, Mexico, Canada, all over.  They were married for about twelve years before they had any children.  In fact, everyone had given up hope that they'd ever have children.  And they would take my first cousins every summer and give them kind of, you know, special attention and what have you.  There were two or three of them that they would take home with them every summer.  And then finally, after twelve years or so, my mother was already well into her mid-thirties, she had her first child [Smithie Johnson Dunn].  And then I came along and my mother's oldest sister [Iola Hubbard Brown] who was there at the time that I was born, and never had children of her own said, "Okay, why don't you give me this second one.  I mean, you know, you were so lucky to have two and I've had none, won't you give me this baby?"  And she said, "I can't give you my child but I will let you name her."  So she named me for herself.  And so, then my youngest sister came along.  My father said, "Well, I want a boy," and she--turned out he, you know, ended up with three girls.  And the doctor told my mother she was getting so much older that she couldn't have any more children, so he said, "Well, I'm naming the kid for myself."  And she said, "You can't name the girl Horace."  So they named her Horacetene [Horacetene Johnson Shults].  And his brother [Roy Johnson], who only had one child, said, "Well, since there aren't gonna be any boys I want my name in there too."  And his name was Roy.  My mother's best friend was Lucille, and she was diabetic and didn't have any children.  So my poor sister ended up with the name Horacetene Leroy Lucille Johnson (laughter).  Poor girl (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before we go any further--
Story_ID: 350925
Speaker 1: I'd like to step back just a little bit since we're talking about your [maternal] grandfather [John Hubbard, Sr.] owning cattle and land, let's talk some about that because, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, yeah, that's unusual.
Speaker 1: Back in those days, you know, and your grandfather or father [Horace Johnson].
Speaker 2: Both, both.
Speaker 1: Were both, okay.
Speaker 2: Landowners and highly thought of in the community, highly regarded and that sort of thing.  I think the landownership came in large part from the fact that both my grandf- my mother's--both my mother's grandfathers were half-white.  And they had inherited some property through their families, and it was passed on down the line.  And I think that's where the ownership came from, but my grandfather was a large property owner and so was my father.  They were more or less the tenant farmer, farmer owners, you know.  People worked for them rather than--so it was unusual for a black circumstance.  At my mother's memorial service, for example, a woman got up at the end of the memorial service and she was telling us, you know, your grandfather was a rich man.  And, she said, when she was a child she was the only crippled child in the community and one day my grandfather and Mr. John Hawkins, who was like one of the big white landowners in the community, both came riding up on a horse, and I think, she said they each gave her father five hundred dollars, which must have been a lot of money in that time.  And my grandfather was kind of on par with this other big landowner, and everyone regarded him, in fact, they called him Mr. Johnny for--and my oldest uncle [John Hubbard, Jr.] who was named for his father, Junior, was called Mr. Little Johnny.  And, it was, it was interesting because on my grandmother's [Smithie Garland Hubbard] side, the family was so well known that an entire area of her community is known as the Garland community, the Garland settlement.  And they, they own a good deal of land in that as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father, how he came about his, I'm not sure.  But, he was, you know, in between my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] and my grandfather in age but turned out to be a wealthy landowner as well.  And was regarded, again, very highly.  In fact, my parents--one of the interesting things that I've always found fascinating is that--excuse me--my parents were allowed to do things that other blacks weren't allowed to do in their community of Foreman, Arkansas.  For example, my mother could go to the local gas station and use the restroom.  Other black people couldn't do that.  And my father, you know, was able to go to the bank, get loans, and do things that a lot of other folks didn't do.  He bought my mother a new car every year.  She had a mink coat.  She had fox stoles, she had mink stoles. And, in fact, we used to--my--having three children my mother thought was ideal because you don't want to have one and have something happen to it.  Your life would be devastated.  You have two, something happens to one, you leave the other one alone in the world.  So you have three, that way, you know, you cover all your bases.
Story_ID: 350926
Speaker 1: Well, we tortured my younger sister when she was growing up.  She was always the odd man out, you know, because the two older girls were, we were as thick as thieves.  And, I think we did permanent damage to that poor child.  But I remember, after we moved to Arizona, my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] would leave us once in a while home alone.  We would literally chase my sister through the house.  One of us would get the fox stole, there were two fox with the heads and the eyes still on.  One of us would get that and the other would get--it was six mink and they had the little heads and the eyes still on them, false eyes of course.  And we'd get those and we'd chase her through the house.  We'd chase her, and chase her (laughter), and chase her, and 'til this day, she cannot stand for an animal's eyes to be close to her.  It drives her crazy.  She just doesn't like animals' eyes (laughter).
Speaker 2: What are your sisters' names?
Speaker 1: My oldest sister is Smithie Eurea Lee Johnson Dunn--Barrow-Dunn [Smithie Johnson Dunn].  She's named for my grandmother [Smithie Garland Hubbard] and my mother.  And, of course my--I told you the story of my sis- youngest sister Horacetene Leroy Lucille Johnson [Horacetene Johnson Shults], and I'm Iola Vivian Johnson [HistoryMaker Iola Johnson].  All named for family members.
Speaker 2: What's the age difference between siblings?
Speaker 1: There is about two years between me and my oldest sister and about three years between me and the youngest child.
Story_ID: 350927
Speaker 1: So now, where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I started elementary school [Miles Elementary School; Miles Exploratory Learning Center, Tucson, Arizona] in Tucson, Arizona where we moved to, where my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] said she thought she'd die if she thought she had to live, you know.  My father [Horace Johnson] stuck us in Tucson, Arizona, which they had visited some years before, and it was a dusty little nothing town near the Mexican border.  And my mother thought she just--she couldn't believe my father went out there, plopped down all his money, bought a house, bought some land, and then came back for us.  And when he told her what he'd done, she was just devastated.  But she went along and we ended up living there, oddly enough, on 13th Street.  And I never thought of it as being unlucky because my mother was born on the 13th, and I never thought growing up on 13th Street, never thought anything about it.  It was just where I lived.  And, you know, I knew a lot of people are superstitious about the 13th but never occurred to me when I was growing up that it might be unlucky.  Although, my mother did die on the 13th as well, and I've started feeling a little (laughter) different about the 13th now and the number thirteen.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood in which you lived?
Speaker 2: We moved into a predominantly white neighborhood, oddly enough, in Tucson.  In fact, we were the only blacks on the block at the time that we moved in.  Over the years, a number of other black families started to move in and, of course, the whites started to move out.  It was like, "Oh ho, black people on the block, we gotta go," you know, property values are going to--straight to hell or what have you.  Went to a predominantly white elementary school, started elementary school in an integrated environment.  I guess integration always works on a small scale, didn't have any--didn't recognize any racial problems.  And I think it was kind of unfortunate my mother never told us about racism, and I didn't know what it was, didn't know that it existed.  And, oddly enough, didn't see color differences.  If you're not told about it, you don't recognize it.  I never realized that I was brown and other people were white or yellow, or whatever.  I knew that--I'm sure I recognized that there were some differences because there were Asians, there were Mexicans, there were whites, there were, you know, a variety of people in my school but I never thought anything about it.  And, in the long term, I think that was unfortunate because growing up when--my reaction to racism many times, because I didn't know what racism was, I took it personally and thought there was something wrong with me.  And that I was somehow deficient or I was doing something wrong, or what have you.  That was the down side of not knowing what racism was.  And when I finally figured it out it was like, oh, okay, so it's not me after all.  It's people and their problems.
Speaker 1: Were all of your teachers white as well?
Speaker 2: All of them.  I didn't--well, I had--with one exception, one Mexican teacher in fifth grade I think it was.  And he tried to teach us a little Spanish but at the time, and there were a number of Hispanic students or Mexican students in my school, but--speaking Spanish was strictly forbidden in our schools and frowned upon, you know.  And they wanted everyone to learn English and to speak English at home as much as possible, and that sort of thing.  But, basically, all my teachers were white except the one.
Speaker 1: The Hispanic students, or Mexican students, were they from well-to-do families as well?
Speaker 2: I would say better than average, or at least average families, there weren't any really poor Mexican families in our school system.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that you remember, that stand out in your mind in your elementary years?
Speaker 2: My first grade teacher.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Saunders [ph.].  And I remember she was special because she paid attention to each and every one of us.  And as we got ready to leave, I think it was every Friday, we had to line up and give her a kiss.  (Laughter) I remember her very well.  I also remember the first day in her class.  I couldn't believe that my mother was taking me to this strange place and just leaving me.  And they were having a square dance at the time that we arrived at school, and they told me I had to go dance with a boy.  And I was like, aw, this can't be happening.  And I remember my mom standing over at the door by the--with the teacher, and I remember looking at her in some distress, what are you doing to me, why am I--why do I have to stay here, and why do I have to dance with this boy?  But it was--it all worked out.  (Laughter) My mother was also very involved in school activities, and she was always involved in the voting process, and served as, you know, an election observer during voting and that sort of thing, and was involved in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association].  And, when there was a school carnival, she was involved in that.  And just, you know, very, very involved.
Story_ID: 350928
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  Surprisingly.  I probably would have been a much better student had it not been for racism.  And I say that because I know that there some instances where I was not given the kind of credit that I deserved.  And one incident in particular stands out in my mind.  I had written a paper and failed to put my name on the paper, and the teacher in handing out the papers after they were graded went on and on and on about how wonderful this paper was, and he ranted and raved, and he thought it belonged to a classmate of mine by the name of Carlotta Dunn [Carlotta Dunn Flores].  And he said, "Carlotta did such a fabulous job writing this paper."  Well, it turned out it was my paper.  And I got an A on that paper, and I'd never gotten an A from this teacher before.  And I don't know how many other times that happened, when it didn't come to light, but that one incident stood out in my mind.  And the one thing that kept me going was that my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] always said, "You have to be twice as good as everybody else in order just to survive."  And I kept that in the back a my mind, and I worked really, really hard, and did very well despite some of the obstacles.
Speaker 1: So you were a good student, but what type of child were you?  Were you--now you and your sister [Smithie Johnson Dunn] were very mischievous, chasing your other sister [Horacetene Johnson Shults] around (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chasing her around.  That was about the worst that we did, actually.  My younger sister, the one that was chased all the time was really the one who got into more mischief than anybody else.  Her and one of her little friends actually--we had, we lived on a street [in Tucson, Arizona] where the city bus went through, they actually threw a rock and broke the bus window one time (laughter), and then ran straight home.  And, of course, the bus driver followed them right to the house and they were busted.  But we, generally, were very, we were very good kids.  My sister and--all three of us for the most part, well behaved.  We--my mother liked to say, when we were very young and she would take us to church, that all she had to do was give us that certain look and we straightened up.  And there was no funny business.  We were just very respectful and we did get our share of spankings or whippings as we called them.  And there were oleander bushes in our backyard, and you had to go out and get your own switch.  And if you didn't get one that was large enough, you had to go get another one.  And that was always a long (laughter) walk to that wall of oleanders to pick up your switch and come back, and she didn't mind laying it on you a little bit.  And my father [Horace Johnson] had lots of leather straps in the garage because of course he was, you know, involved in ranching and he'd make a lot of his own equipment.  And so there was lots of leather straps around the house all the time.  But my mother preferred the oleander switches (laughter).
Speaker 1: What type of things did you get a spanking for, or a whipping?
Speaker 2: A whipping.  Fighting.
Speaker 1: With each other?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother, she didn't allow us to fight. That was just a no-no in our family.  You weren't allowed to say bad words or anything really negative to your siblings, and usually it was, it was something very minor.  We didn't, we didn't get into a lot of trouble.
Story_ID: 360952
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your behavior as a child, very well-mannered.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] used to take you to church and just give you that look.  What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: We went to a Baptist church.  My mother was raised in the Baptist church, my father [Horace Johnson]--excuse me--for all practical purposes, I guess was an agnostic.  Did not believe in organized religion, and after my father died in 1956, when I was still a very young child killed in an--he was killed in an accident, my mother kind of withdrew from society and from the world, and from us to a large extent.  And she stopped taking us to church and started sending us to the First Assembly of God [Tucson, Arizona], which was up on the corner from our house.  Well, we didn't particularly like some of the rules and regulations of the Assembly of God, and she'd give us a church offering every Sunday, and rather than going to church, we would go to the corner drugstore (laughter) and buy candy.  And a friend of my mother's caught us sitting on the sidewalk down the street from the church one Sunday, went home and told her what we were doing.  And after that she required us to bring home our church program every Sunday to prove that we'd actually gone to Sunday school, so that put--that kind of nipped it in the bud.  But, by the time we were in junior high school [Mansfeld Junior High School; Mansfeld Middle School, Tucson, Arizona], the First Assembly of God had too many restrictions for us.  You couldn't wear lipstick, you couldn't dance, you couldn't do virtually anything, and they started having socials at the school.  And we decided, you know, everybody else is dancing, everybody's wearing makeup or they're having fun, there's something wrong here.  And we rebelled and stopped going to church, and did very--had very little formal church involvement after that.
Story_ID: 360953
Speaker 1: So what were your extracurricular activities outside of school?  Did you like to read?
Speaker 2: I loved to read and I loved to write.  And I guess that's why I became a journalist.  The other thing that I enjoyed doing was spending time in the outdoors.  Growing up in southern Arizona meant that you spent--you could spend 365 days a year out of doors and never have to wear a jacket or anything like that for the most part.  I loved camping and camping out, hiking.  My mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] liked to fish, but I, on the other hand, wasn't much of a fisherperson so we had a travel trailer and we'd go fishing.  I'd spend my time (laughter) in the trailer.  And, or just you know kind of hanging out on the lakebed or something, bank.  And, the other things that I enjoyed doing were playing tennis.  I was an avid tennis player growing up.  In fact, our elementary school [Miles Elementary School; Miles Exploratory Learning Center, Tucson, Arizona] taught us tennis, which was kind of not the norm I guess at the time.  And I always enjoyed playing tennis, and probably spent more time on the tennis court than anywhere else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember the first thing that you wrote?  Did you keep a journal?
Speaker 2: No, but I do remember something that I was very proud of.  We went--our school would take us on field trips to museums and the symphony, and I--that's where, where I got my appreciation of, of symphony music.  And I remember going to the natural museum of history at the University of Arizona [University of Arizona Museum of Natural History, Tucson, Arizona] while I was still in elementary school, and coming back and writing a paper about the experience, and having the principal at my elementary post it in the hallway.  And I was just so pleased that I guess I started enjoying writing at that point and have enjoyed it since then.
Speaker 1: So you think at that point is when you knew or did you just have an idea, or is it something that you wanted to do to be a journalist, at that point?
Speaker 2: I didn't want--I never really wanted to be a journalist.  That's, that's the odd thing.  I wanted to study English.  And I wanted to be a short story writer, and I took a journalism course as part of an English literature minor that I had in college [University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona] and realized, well, there's a problem feeding yourself until you're published and established.  I could actually work as a journalist and feed myself and do some writing on the side.  And so I took some other journalism courses and ultimately ended up with a degree in newspaper journalism and political science because I've always been a political junkie too.  And started working right out of college in television because the newspapers weren't hiring, and my major professor at college said, "Why don't you try a television station."  And I was hired on my ability to write, and wrote most of the newscasts for the ten o'clock newscasts for the news director, who was also our local anchor at the station.  And he liked my writing so much that I was able to break down barriers for women.  I was the first woman hired at a television station in--at this particular television station, the NBC affiliate, KVOA-TV in Tucson [Arizona].  And, at five o'clock when all the secretaries went home, all the women went home.  And they didn't have--they'd never had a woman in the building after dark, and my news director liked my writing so much that he wanted me to be there to write for him, for the ten o'clock news.  So I was able to break down a gender barrier because he liked my writing.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's great.  We're gonna go back.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).

Speaker 1: Tell me about the holidays at your house, Christmas, Easter, or whatever holidays you celebrated with your family?
Speaker 2: Holidays were always wonderful at our house.  Christmas I remember probably more than any other holiday.  And, we, we'd get up first thing Christmas morning, open our presents and then run outside--we'd always get new clothes of course, run outside to show off our new clothes to our friends and show off our Christmas presents, and that sort of thing.  And then it was back in the house, and my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] always made a big turkey for Christmas as well as, as Thanksgiving and she'd always put her finger--she'd stuff the turkey and then put a little of the dressing on the outside of the turkey, and then she'd put her handprint there and bake it, and once it was baked her handprint would still be there.  So that was--and everybody wanted a piece of the handprint when the turkey was--and the dressing were finally cooked.  So that was, that was neat.

Speaker 1: You're gonna graduate from elementary school, what was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Miles Elementary School [Miles Exploratory Learning Center, Tucson, Arizona].
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you go from elementary school to a middle school?
Speaker 2: Junior--we called it junior high school.  Mansfeld Junior High [Mansfeld Junior High School; Mansfeld Middle School, Tucson, Arizona].
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: That's in Tucson [Arizona] as well, and only maybe a mile from my elementary school.  And then I graduated from Tucson High School [Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, Arizona], which was maybe a half mile from my junior high school.  And then I went on to the University of Arizona [Tucson, Arizona], which was across the street from my high school.  So I started elementary, graduated from college within about a four-mile radius.  And there was no question about where I was going to college or any of that.  My mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] started driving us by the main gate at the University of Arizona when we were little kids, and she told us, "Someday you're gonna march through that gate.  You're gonna graduate from that school," and sure enough.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your junior high years?
Speaker 2: My junior high years were awkward years.  I was trying to find my way, and I had my first real experience with my first real black friend, girlfriend.  And she had moved to Tucson from somewhere in Nebraska.  And my mother didn't particularly like her family (laughter) to say the least.  And maybe for good reason because we ended up cutting school a couple times and getting caught.  And they decided that our punishment would be to walk around the campus and pick up all the paper and litter on the campus.  My mother wasn't going for that either, you know, they wanted us to pick it up with our hands.  And she said, "No way my child's gonna do that."  She went to the school, protested, and I think they ended up giving us a stick to pick it up with or something, but we did have to serve our punishment.  But that was my first experience with a black friend.  And it was also my first experience learning about race and race issues in this country.  Up until that time, you know, we would study in junior high slavery and its impact on the country.  But somehow it was, you know, a very one-sided look at slavery.  And once I got into high school, was exposed to more African American people.  And they thought me and my sisters [Smithie Johnson Dunn and Horacetene Johnson Shults] were so weird because we danced like they did on 'American Bandstand.'  And that's how we learned to dance watching 'American Bandstand.'  So we'd hop around, you know, and do our dances and everybody thought that we talked weird, we danced weird, we were just different.  And so we didn't quite fit in.  And it was difficult in those years in high school trying to find your blackness and feeling, you know, very much a part of these people but they were kind of rejecting you in a sense.  Wasn't a problem with the boys (laughter), they loved us but with the girls it was a whole different story.
Story_ID: 360956
Speaker 1: So in junior high school [Mansfeld Junior High School; Mansfeld Middle School, Tucson, Arizona], what was the racial makeup of your high school?
Speaker 2: Of the high school or junior high?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, junior high school?
Speaker 2: There were probably no more than maybe ten of us who were black, if that many, in junior high.  I don't remember the number of kids in junior high but one, two, three--there were probably four of us in my class and maybe four in the, the next class ahead me or something like that, but just very few.  And only one black girl as I'm saying--the only black children that I had ever been exposed to were male.  There were in elementary school [Miles Elementary School; Miles Exploratory Learning Center, Tucson, Arizona], there were three other black students, I think, in my grade.  They were all boys, I was the only black girl.  And then, as other black families started to move into our neighborhood, some of them had girls who were close--there were one or two other girls who were close to me in age.  And, we always got along fine, and there was never an issue of whether you were black enough or, you know, how you led your life or anything like that never came up until we got to high school, and then we were considered different.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in junior high school who took a special interest, like your first grade teacher?
Speaker 2: No.  I just remember one teacher, I think, that anyone who went through her class probably remembers Mrs. Aboud [ph.], and she would always rub her chest (laughter). She had this enormous chest and she'd always--and she was just a nasty, nasty lady.  And she'd always find something to criticize you about or something to--something negative to say to you.  And I just remember her being a--she was a history teacher and she was just a very negative influence.  And, there were no positives, there were no positives.  There was one black teacher at my junior high school, and he was very fair and none of us knew for sure that he was black.  And I think he was probably passing at the time, and never gave it away that he was black.  And I see him now when I go back home to Tucson [Arizona] because his wife is a member of The Links [The Links, Incorporated] organization with my sister, and, you know, I look at him at and sometimes I just want to say, "Why didn't you tell us. You know, in junior high, that you were one of us.  Why didn't you relate to us," you know, or whatever.  But, we were never quite sure.  We kind of thought maybe, but you couldn't tell by looking and he never gave any indication one way or the other.
Story_ID: 360957
Speaker 1: So now we're going on to high school [Tucson High School; Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, Arizona], what year is it?
Speaker 2: I don't remember what year I went to high school.  Early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you go back to '64 [1964], '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964], yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you go to high school in the ninth grade or the, I mean--?
Speaker 2: Tenth--ninth grade, ninth grade.
Speaker 1: So '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you remember when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: What were you doing then?
Speaker 2: I was going to a classmate's funeral that day.  A girl had been killed in an automobile accident, and we were on our way to her funeral, which was the first time a schoolmate had died.  So we were already traumatized by that, and I remember on the way hearing on the radio that the president had been assassinated.  And just being wiped out at that point.  It was one of the worst days of my life.  I, of course, like everybody else--and as I said, I was always--I was a really weird child.  I loved politics.  When I was very, very young, the national political conventions use to be covered gavel to gavel.  I don't know if you remember that.  I'd sit there and watch those national conventions, and I was really interested in what was taking place.  So, I was very politically aware.  And I knew that Kennedy was good for black people, and when I found out that he'd been assassinated, I was just, I was completely ripped apart.  I remember it very well, riding in the car and hearing it on the radio.
Speaker 1: What was the atmosphere in your home about this--your mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] and father [Horace Johnson]?
Speaker 2: My father was already dead by then.  My mother was, of course, very hurt, very devastated and I know that we watched television continuously from the time that it happened until the final burial.
Speaker 1: Well, on that hand too, if we go on to the early--well, we're still in the '60s [1960s], '65 [1965], '66 [1966], and now the styles have changed (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your style, since you were saying that 'American Bandstand' was where you learned how to dance.  Did you wear an afro?  Tell me what's going on here?
Speaker 2: Oh, the afro movement was something special.  I have--excuse me--relatively, straight hair and it was long, and I would wet it, and tease it, and then take bobby pins and squish it together until I had an afro.  And it would look great in the beginning, but as it dried it would grow thicker and thicker and thicker (laughter).  And my sisters [Smithie Johnson Dunn and Horacetene Johnson Shults] and I all did the same thing.  We tried to do the afro thing and we would spend a lot of time out in Southern California in the summer with my mother's two sisters [Iola Hubbard Brown and Geneva Hubbard Bizzell], and, of course, you know, we'd learn about the--all the California type things, and--we were too--we were also into kind of the hippie thing.  We, you know, wore the hippie clothing and the hippie shoes, and the hippie jewelry, and all of that stuff.  So, yeah, we were very much children of the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 360958
Speaker 1: So, now, in high school [Tucson High School; Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, Arizona], are you now beginning to think, what am I gonna do when I go to college?  I know--or you already know what college you're going to.
Speaker 2: Right. (Laughter) No question about it.
Speaker 1: So now are you thinking about what you want to do in life?
Speaker 2: I really was not too clear on what I wanted to do in life.  Things were just starting to change.  The Civil Rights Movement was just taking hold in the country.  Opportunities were just starting to open up for African Americans, and I wasn't sure, you know, what was out there for me or what I could do with my life.  I knew I didn't want to teach or, you know, do something that was considered, you know, woman's work.  I just never felt that I wanted to do the traditional thing and play the traditional role of wife and mother and staying at home.  That, somehow, just never fit with me.  I didn't learn how to cook, for example, because I always assumed that there would be someone to cook for me.  (Laughter) I grew up not knowing how to cook.  And when I went out on my own, it was like this rude awakening.  I have to cook?  Okay, what do I do now?  You know, and it was a learning process for me.  And I went back, of course, and learned and now consider myself quite an accomplished woman in the kitchen (laughter).  But, I never--I always felt that somehow--I told my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] when I was fairly young, I think--I think I feel like my name should be in lights.  I think that, you know, I'm destined to be a singing star.  And that's probably what I wanted to do most, there was just one problem.  I couldn't carry a tune (laughter).  My mother wanted to be a singer when she was young and she had a wonderful singing voice.  But her parents [Smithie Garland Hubbard and John Hubbard, Sr.] thought it was not, you know, appropriate for a young woman--a cultured young woman to go out and become a singer, which was to crude I guess, or something at the time.  But, I always wanted --I kind of envisioned myself being one of these lounge singers, you know.  I've watched these women on television with the long, flowing gowns and they'd be singing with the microphone.  And, you know, and if I'd had a choice in life that's probably what I would have been.  And I felt like, you know, I wanted to see my name in lights and I just thought I was gonna be this nightclub singer.  But, I didn't really know what I was gonna do with my life after I couldn't sing.  I went to college with the idea that, well, we'll just see what happens.  But I knew I had to go to college and wanted to go, and things kind of fell into place from there.
Speaker 1: What were you doing when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?  Do you remember that day as well?
Speaker 2: I do, I remember it very well.  I was working at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] as a floater, and I was working in the candy department, and an African American friend of mine came over and said, "Martin Luther King has been assassinated."  And I dropped everything and just kind of stood there and looked at him, and said, "You're kidding."  This can't really be happening, you know--'cause I was a, you know, John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] fan, a Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] fan, you know, Martin Luther King.  And I just thought, what's happening to the world.  How could anybody kill a holy man and a man of peace, and what is wrong with this country.  And it just--I'll never forget that night.
Story_ID: 360959
Speaker 1: So now we're in high school, and you're still playing tennis?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm, and studying modern dance (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so now you're dancing.  Tell me about your dancing.
Speaker 2: Right.  My dancing was not--didn't go very well.  I was never elegant and coordinated enough to do dancing.  I did study modern dance for a while but then gave it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about football games and cheerleading?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think I went to more than one or two football games in high school.  I don't remember ever going to a basketball game.  Sports were not a big part of our lives.  My mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] was one of these people who was overly protective.  We never went to movies as children growing up either.  She didn't allow us to go on bus field trips because she was afraid something would happen and we'd be injured or killed in a bus accident.  She only let us go on field trips when we could walk or she would participate as, you know, a parent, and drive us and other students.  So, we had a very restricted, or restrictive upbringing I guess.  And didn't go to football games and basketball games or things like that.
Speaker 1: Did you go to your prom?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  I went to two proms as a matter of fact.   And this last year my mother wanted to be cremated when she died just before Christmas, and we took her ashes back to Arizona and she wanted to be scattered from one of her favorite mountain lookouts overlooking Tucson [Arizona] in the valley, and ran into my prom date when I was back home.  And it was really, really special, you know, seeing him and, and getting caught up and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Tell me, tell me about the prom night?
Speaker 2: Well, there were two proms and on one--the prom night I guess that I remember best, you know, I got all dressed up and fancy outfit and my prom date picked me up, and we went to the prom and then went to dinner afterwards at this fancy restaurant, and went to an after-party at someone's house that had a pool, and people got pushed in the pool, you know, and things like that.  And my second prom was with the rich boy in school.  His mother bought--sent me very nice perfume as my gift for, you know, the prom night.  And he told me--I'll never forget, he called me an iceberg that night because I didn't want to kiss and make out (laughter) and that sort of thing.  He said, "You know, you're an iceberg."  And I thought, well, phooey on you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were your dates black or white?
Speaker 2: Black.  Yeah.  I never dated white oddly enough, and while I was college I went to, I think, a movie with one white guy who was in one of my classes and went out with another white guy, you know, to have drinks or something like that.  But never really got involved with interracial dating, although, a lot of other people did.
Speaker 1: So now we're in high sch- we're getting ready to graduate from high school.  The name of the high school one more time?
Speaker 2: Tucson High [Tucson High School; Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, Arizona].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers or anyone who was an influence there, 'cause we know in junior high school [Mansfeld Junior High School; Mansfeld Middle School, Tucson, Arizona] we just had that negative teacher.
Speaker 2: None in high school either.
Speaker 1: Nobody?
Speaker 2: Nobody.  Nobody.
Speaker 1: What about your guidance counselor?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: How did you decide what classes you would take in college?
Speaker 2: You were on your own.  Yeah, just got there and did it on my own.
Speaker 1: So outside of school then, who are your influences?
Speaker 2: Mostly, my mother.  We didn't have other family in Tucson.  My father's brother [Roy Johnson] was deceased by that time, who was the only relative that we had there.  And the only real influence I had in my life that I can look back on was my mother.
Story_ID: 360960
Speaker 1: So now you go off to college and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Not really go off to college, I was still living at home (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Still, okay.
Speaker 2: Living at home with mommy [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson], yes.  I started college and, actually, the first year I worked and went to school at night rather than going to college full time [at the University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona].  And, I'd take two classes at night and work full time during the day.
Speaker 1: Where did you work?
Speaker 2: I worked for the telephone company as--and again, one of those jobs that kind of broke the color barrier.  I was a--one of the--I'm trying to remember the title now, one of the special representatives that talk to people on the phone--service representative I think they called it.  And it was a job that black people didn't hold back then, and it was considered, you know, a plum job.  And I worked there for the, I worked--first, I worked as a stenographer because my mother had asked that we all study stenography in high school so that we could get a job once we got out.  So I knew how to type, I took typing and stenography, which was, you know, the big thing back then.  And, so I started out as a stenographer in the general manager's office, and then they decided they wanted to give me the plum job of service representative, which was something no other black person had ever had.  And it was considered a really good job.  And after about a year and a half there, I decided okay, I really want to go back to school full-time and I remember my mother saying, "You can't quit a job like that."  I mean, that's really a good job.  But I had a supervisor that gave me holy hell every day (laughter).  And I'd just about had enough of this and I thought, you know, I could stay here and work in this good job, and maybe make a little progress but have to put up with this kind of crap for the rest of my life, I don't think so.  So I quit the job, went back to school and, you know, was working at different jobs.  Started at the accounting department on campus and one job after another, and then in the summer, I would go and get various jobs.  I worked for the U.S attorney's office one summer as a stenographer, and another summer I got a bank job and I was--as a bank teller and I was the worst teller ever.  I could not get it.  I mean there are some people--both my sisters [Smithie Johnson Dunn and Horacetene Johnson Shults] ended up in banking and were very good at it.  My oldest sister became a bank vice president.  The other sister became a supervisor.  I couldn't even be a teller (laughter).  Couldn't do it, just didn't work with my, my brain.  So, thank goodness it was only a summer job.
Story_ID: 347306
Speaker 1: We were talking about the different jobs that you had while you were going to school part-time [at the University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona] and you mentioned that you were working for the telephone company and you had this plum job, but the supervisor just gave you a bad time.  Tell me some of the things that were going on that just--you just had enough and had to leave?
Speaker 2: She basically would monitor all my calls, and I could never do anything right.  Everything I did she criticized.  She--there was something wrong with the way I filled out the paperwork, I said the wrong thing to the person, had the wrong reaction.  It was just like, you can't do anything right, and I'm gonna make your life as miserable as I can in this job.  You may be the first one--they may have given you this job but I'm not gonna make it easy for you.
Speaker 1: So you really feel that it was because of race that she (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it--I think she resented the fact that they had finally decided to hire an African American.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was that one of the first times that you experienced racism?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Still not really recognizing it for what it was necessarily, just realizing that I don't want to live like this for the rest of my life.  And I don't want to make a career out of this job if I have to deal with people who are going to treat me this way for the rest of my life.  I can go to college, do something else where I don't have to take this.  And sent me right back on the right road, otherwise, I might have decided to stay and keep that plum job.
Story_ID: 347307
Speaker 1: So now you're in college [University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona] full-time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what type of classes are you taking?
Speaker 2: I was taking English literature and foreign languages, and then as part of my English literature courses I took a journalism class and enjoyed it, realized that it was a way to make a living and keep myself afloat until I could get some of my works published and--wanted to be a short story writer.  And realized that, you know, you gotta get yourself known and get your name out there and write something first before you can make a living as a writer.  So I ended up with a degree in newspaper journalism and political science.  I'd always been interested in current events and politics in particular.  I grew up, you know, in the Barry Goldwater era in Arizona.  And I grew up in Tucson [Arizona], which is Pima County [Arizona], the only Democratic stronghold in the entire state.  Everything else was Republican.  So, I was, you know, very affected by that.  Morris Udall [Morris K. Udall] was my local congressman and my hero (laughter).  His brother [Stewart Udall] was secretary of the interior.  So, you know, I followed all of that and was very politically minded all of my life for whatever reason.  As I said, I was one of those odd children who would watch the national political conventions gavel to gavel.  Sit there and just watch 'em.  My sisters'd [Smithie Johnson Dunn and Horacetene Johnson Shults] be outside playing or whatever.  I remember my oldest sister loved Elvis Presley and, you know, the Three Stooges and things like that, but I always thought it was stupid.  I don't want to watch the Three Stooges hit each other over the head with a hammer and make funny noises.  And never--I was never into comedy and, you know, funny, crazy humor and that sort of thing.  I was always more serious minded.
Speaker 1: So what kind of books did you read?
Speaker 2: Most of the books that I read were probably about politics (laughter). Oddly enough, I loved--I've always loved politics.  And once I moved to the State of Texas, it was like walking into history because I had read everything there was to read about LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], John Tower, people like that.  And then I'm, I, you know, I meet John Tower.  And we actually became friends, a Republican no less.  But when I first came to Texas, the--one of the press club functions was a fundraiser where they put on a skit, and they said, "We're going to have the United States Senator play Superman and you're gonna be Lois Lane."  And I was like, yeah, sure.  A senator is gonna wear a cape and tights, I gotta see this.  So I was Lois Lane to John--Senator John Tower's Superman.  And he actually showed up in tights and a cape.  And it made Time and Newsweek, and you could see me in the background going (laughter).  A picture of him leaping off the stage with this cape flying behind him.  And he became one of my best interviews ever, and I was on vacation when I heard that his plane [Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 2311] had crashed and he and his daughter [Marian Tower] were killed.  And I had decided, you know, there was, there was a time when John Tower was being considered for secretary of defense, and I said, "I'm gonna be his press secretary."  (Laughter) I'd made up my mind I was gonna get that job.  Didn't happen.
Speaker 1: Did you work on any campaigns?
Speaker 2: No, never did, because as a journalist I had to remain neutral and couldn't ac- couldn't get actively involved.
Speaker 1: But even in college?
Speaker 2: No, I never did.  I was--I do remember, though, in college being the only person sitting in a political science class wearing a Democratic button, when everybody else had on Republican buttons including the teacher (laughter).
Story_ID: 347308
Speaker 1: We talked about there weren't any influences up until this point.  So now we're in college [University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona] and this is where you find someone who inspires you?
Speaker 2: Right.  I took my first black studies class from a fellow who was not much older than I was and had--he'd gone to law school and graduated and was practicing law, a black man.  His name was Rubin Salter [Rubin Salter, Jr.] and he's an attorney still practicing in my hometown of Tucson [Arizona].  And took a black studies class from him, and that was probably a real turning point for me in my life, because he explained black history to me for the first time.  And I remember saying, you know, "If there's any question between me getting and A and a B in this class, would you give me an A, I could sure use an A."  And I got an A in the class.  I don't know if I deserved it or if he just gave me a break, but excuse me, it was the first time that I felt that I could relate to an instructor, and the first time that I felt, you know, he really, really taught me something.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that he brought to light for you?
Speaker 2: The real reason for the Civil War, for example, that it had nothing to do with the humanitarian spirit of the white man, that it was purely economic. That was probably the most incredible thing that I learned in that course, because, you know, we'd always been taught that, well, [President] Abraham Lincoln decided to free the slaves and it was the good, kind-hearted white people who decided to free your people.  And being the only black in class most of the time, it was always looking at me, saying your people.  And, you know, he told it as it really was.  And that was a real awakening for me.
Speaker 1: So did you find any black friends in college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, who were they?
Speaker 2: I met a lot of people from the outside who were--who had not necessarily grown up there in Tucson, as well as some other girls who had gone to school with me, who were also a little different.  (Laughter) So we ended up, you know, kind of hanging out together and are still friends 'til this day.
Speaker 1: And what do they do today?
Speaker 2: Let's see, couple of them are teachers and a principal, and one of them, unfortunately, was killed in an automobile accident.  She was also a principal.  One of them, let's see, went on to law school and is a lawyer practicing with the attorney general's office in the State of Arizona.  And the others are, you know, housewives and bankers, and just whatever.
Speaker 1: Did you pledge any fraternity--sorority, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Sorority.  No, we didn't have any black sororities. The--I was asked to pledge both the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] and Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] but they only had graduate chapters, and at the time, the whole notion of Greek didn't sit well with me because I was, you know, again, into the politics and civil rights and more of that--more serious-minded.  That was not something that really resonated with me.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Civil Rights Movement, were you involved in any of that at all?  Was there any local (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanted to be a Freedom Rider.  I wanted to get on a bus and go, and my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] said, "Are you crazy?  You're too little.  Number one, you're too young, and you're not going to the South and get yourself killed."  But I used to watch the Civil Rights Movement as it was unfolding on television, and I wanted to go and be a part of it.  I was willing to stand up and be hosed or let the dogs chase me or whatever.  But I just thought it would be important for another body to be there.  I wanted to, you know, be there and be a part of it.  I don't know what I would have done but I felt very strongly about it that I wanted to be there and be a part of it.
Story_ID: 347309
Speaker 1: You're getting ready to graduate from college [University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me what's going on in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I started looking for a job, and the only jobs that were forthcoming were for very conservative newspapers in places like Springfield, Illinois or someplace like that, you know, and decided I really didn't want to do that.  And my major professor in journalism suggested that I try a television station, and I did and was hired on my writing ability.  And I didn't want to leave home at the time because I was very close to my mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson], and I had a young niece who I was crazy about and she was a little, little one who, you know, needed some guidance and direction and that sort of thing.  And--so I didn't want to leave home, so I ended up working for a television station and breaking down some barriers as I said for women and minorities, being the first woman and the first black hired by a television station in Tucson [Arizona].  And worked there for about three years and then I was discovered.  A man called one day and said, "I'm a seventy-three-year-old man.  I'm not trying to be funny or anything but how would you like to work in Dallas [Texas]?"  And I thought, no, never thought about it.  You know, to me Dallas was still the city where Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated.  And, you know, people still thought of it in those terms.  And he said, "Well, I think you should really look into this.  I think you'd be great in Dallas."  And, I wasn't particularly interested, but he mentioned my name to the folks at the ABC affiliate [WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas], which is locally owned in Dallas/Fort Worth [Texas] and they also own The Dallas Morning News and other newspapers and businesses.  And they flew me down.  And the first time I came down, I was not terribly impressed and they offered me a--I think a job doing the noon news as an anchor.  And I was doing weekend news in Tucson, and didn't particularly like what I saw in Dallas so I turned the job down.  About a year and a half later, they came back and asked me to come to work for them again.  And at this point, I was about ready to leave.  I wanted--I'd done everything and learned everything there was to learn in a small training market like Tucson.  So, I was ready to, you know, spread my wings and I was thinking seriously about moving out to San Diego [California], which is my--one of my favorite cities in the whole country.  And, so I came down and this time I ran into a couple people that had made the transition from local television station to the network.  And I thought, ah ha, this could be a real stepping stone for me.  And my ambition at that point was to become a national correspondent for one of the networks, and I wanted to work somewhere in South America drinking tall cool ones every day and filing an occasional report. (Laughter) I just, you know, could envision myself working in South America.  Why?  I'm not quite sure at this point.
Story_ID: 347310
Speaker 1: Anyway, I took the job and I remember the police information officer in Tucson [Arizona] saying to me when he found out that I was coming to Dallas [Texas], "You know that's where they shoot presidents, don't you?"  This was in 1973.  And, oddly enough, I came to work for the television station on the anniversary of my father's [Horace Johnson] birthday, and I didn't realize that until several years later, May 19, 1973.  And I started as the weekend co-anchor [at WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas] and reporting three days during the week.  And then eventually worked my way up to the six and ten o'clock Monday through Friday anchor job, and became the highest paid local anchor, and the most popular woman in Dallas according to D Magazine, the Dallas magazine.  It was a rough ride, an interesting ride.  But again, being the first at anything does have its drawbacks and there is a price to be paid for that.  A lot of negatives involved with being the first African American and the first woman anchor in a market the size of Dallas/Fort Worth [Texas].
Speaker 2: Were there other women in news?
Speaker 1: As reporters, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) Reporters only.  Okay.  In other markets, did you see any other blacks in other markets?
Speaker 1: No, I'd never seen a black woman on television.  I think I was one of the first in the country, and definitely the first in Texas.
Speaker 2: Why do you think you were so popular as an anchor?
Speaker 1: Well, one of the things that a lot of people said to me, especially older people, was that they could understand every word I said, that my voice was so clear and my diction so distinct that they--and, you know.  I, once in a while, will be sitting at home today and I'll listen to an anchor person or somebody do a tease, and I don't understand a word they've said, for example.  But people always said that they could clearly understand me even with their back turned to the television, they could understand every word.  And older people, especially, liked that.  And it was interesting--I think the fact that maybe I wasn't as threatening maybe as a woman if I'd been wearing, you know, an afro, maybe if I'd had darker skin, maybe if I talked a little more ethnic.  Who knows?  All of those things that I didn't have were maybe not as threatening to the white viewers as they would have otherwise been.  That's my only explanation.  The one thing that I am proud of is the fact that I think my being on television and my being so popular did a lot for race relations in Dallas/Fort Worth.  People don't talk about that and don't come out and say it, but I think it really made a major difference.
Speaker 2: And then tell me why you think that, or how?
Speaker 1: People were willing for the first time in many cases to accept a black person into their home on television, for example, and all of a sudden.  Okay, well, maybe black people aren't so terrible after all.  There's Iola [HistoryMaker Iola Johnson], she's on TV.  We like her.  Maybe we shouldn't be so racist or so, whatever.  I never encountered any racial hostility or animosity as a black anchorwoman.  People--and it used to surprise me, to be perfectly honest with you.  I would go out to interview older whites and they would, you know, "We love you Iola," and they would welcome me into their homes.  And I'm like, I'm sure you didn't feel this way ten years ago, twenty years ago, that sort of thing.  And it always, it always surprised me how well and warmly I was received by these people who obviously had at some point in their lives probably harbored a lot of racist views, and, you know, who knows what they've done.  And I was always a little surprised by that.
Story_ID: 347311
Speaker 1: You said there were some drawbacks and some things that were negative being the first woman, first black.  What were some of the things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You had to fight for everything.  Nothing came easy.  Again, you were under incredible scrutiny all the time.  And it was just a very difficult time because I was breaking down two barriers at once, black and gender.  And the men were not real comfortable with the idea of a--having a woman as an equal, and then a black.  They had to get use to these things at one time.  But I always said to all those that I worked with, you know, "I didn't come to Texas to be treated like a woman or a nigger."  And, you know, you're gonna treat me equally.  And I just--I had this notion that I was as good as, or better than these folks that I was working with or I wouldn't have the job.  And I think that showed, and maybe it was that confidence that I had, that helped with the acceptance and the popularity as well because I felt that if they could find a white woman who could do the job as well as I did and appeal to people as much as I did, they'd have her there rather than me.  And I didn't take a backseat to men that I worked with, and I insisted that my name be given equal play with theirs.  And in the opening shots for the newscast if he's--if you're gonna show him first at six, you show me first at ten.  If you're gonna show his name first one time, you put mine first the next time.  I fought for all those things, and I had to fight for all those things because the tendency was, we're gonna give the male top billing.  We're gonna give the male the most prominent stories and the most prominent positions.  So I had to fight for the right, and in the process fighting for the rights of other women as well, at the time that I started, as I said the television station [WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas] was owned by the folks who also owned the newspaper [The Dallas Morning News], they didn't have a maternity policy for women.  So those of us--those women at the newspaper and at the television station decided, this is not right.  We went out and fought a battle for maternity leaves.  There were also rules in our news department that girl reporters were not sent out on hard stories.  They didn't want to send a woman to cover a story at the county jail, for example, because you got all these mean, nasty guys locked up in jail.  We had to fight for the right for a woman to go out and cover stories at the county jail or other places that were non-traditional for women.  So all those battles were tough, and it was a constant battle.  Nothing was given to you, nothing came easy.  You had to fight for every, everything.  And just to be considered an equal and for equality.
Speaker 1: What about salary wise, did you have to fight to make sure that your salary?
Speaker 2: I led the charge (laughter).  In fact, the guys that I worked with used to say, and I was dumb enough to go put my head on the chopping block, you know, and they'd always say, well, you know Iola [HistoryMaker Iola Johnson] if you, if you go out there, and if we give you this raise--I'd go into the GM [general manager] and say, "Look, I want X number of dollars in my new contract."  And I had a lawyer which nobody else had, who read my contracts and worked on my behalf.  I met him doing a story with him one day and decided we'd work together.  And he eventually ended up representing other people in the media as well.  But I would always go in and demand the pay that I felt I deserved.  And my co-workers, white men, would say, "Yeah, go for it because if you get the raise, we do too."  And of course when I'd go in and ask for the raise, they'd say, "Well, if we give you more money we have to give them more money too."  And I'd say, "Fine.  I don't care if you pay everybody more, just give me what I'm asking for."  And I did, I became the highest paid local anchor in the Dallas/Fort Worth [Texas] market.  And was until I left the position.
Speaker 1: And you were there how long?
Speaker 2: Thirteen years, almost thirteen years.
Story_ID: 347312
Speaker 1: What made you decide to leave?
Speaker 2: I wanted to look, I wanted--I didn't want to look back and say, I should have, I wish I had, I could have, and all of that so I decided to take a calculated risk and leave the job [anchor at WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas] and start my own business, something I always wanted to do.  And I say now that it was a calculated risk that turned out to be a gross miscalculation.  (Laughter) Because the business was a dismal failure, and--
Speaker 1: What type of business was it?
Speaker 2: I started a clothing boutique and a beauty salon in one, it was one-stop shopping kind of thing.  Something that I'd always wanted to do and I couldn't do it working full-time so I thought, well, I'll take a year off, I'll start this business.  I had my sister, youngest sister [Horacetene Johnson Shults] working with me, the one that we tortured so when she was a child.  And I thought I'll turn it over to her, and then I'll go back to television and all will be well.  Well, I found out once I left it was like, how dare her have the audacity to quit us and leave the industry.  There must be something wrong with her.  There must be a--there must be something wrong.  And I got blackballed.  Couldn't find another jo- nobody would hire me in television, with this incredible track record that I had.  And I went to work for a radio station, and after a short period of time one of the former competitors of mine in the Dallas/Fort Worth [Texas] area hired me in St. Louis [Missouri] and I worked there for one year.  It was the worst year of my life (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why was it the worst year?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong.  I had someone break in on me when I was home alone.  I was attacked on the highway one night driving home late at night.  It was the most unfriendly environment I'd ever experienced in my life.  Blacks and whites made no effort to get along.  It was common knowledge that the races didn't mix, that they didn't get along and who cared.  Nobody cared, nobody tried, nobody wanted to get along.  And, I finally told them, "I don't want to be here anymore.  I don't want to do this anymore," and I left.
Story_ID: 347313
Speaker 1: So you came back to Texas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Came back to Texas, and--came back over, over the holidays, Christmas holidays.  And the truck that was bringing our furniture back didn't have enough room to bring the cars so we had to drive.  And I remember crossing the Red River from Oklahoma into Texas and saying, "Ah ha!  I'm glad to be back."  It was wonderful to be back, back in the Lone Star State.  And I had planned to get married, settle down, have fat babies, not work anymore.  And this was just before Christmas, and in January just before I'd planned to get married, my fiance died.  Heart attack, thirty-six years old.  That sent my life into a tailspin.  I didn't do anything for couple of years, and then finally the radio station [KKDA Radio, Grand Prairie, Texas] called again and said, "We're forming a new news department.  We want you and a guy named Shaun Rabb to start a news department for us on our AM station."  And we did, and I've been there ever since.  And--
Speaker 1: This was what year?
Speaker 2: I think it had to be 1990.  And then my former co-anchor [Tracy Rowlett] at the television station in Dallas [Texas] left the ABC affiliate [WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas] after twenty years or so and was hired by the new CBS affiliate [KTVT-TV, Fort Worth, Texas], and they paid him a million dollars a year to move.  And I thought, I gotta call him and just say, hey.  And I called him and said, "I just wanted to see what it's like to talk to a million-dollar man." (Laughter) And he said, "You know what, when I signed my contract I told them I wanted you to come back."  And I was like, get outta here.  I had never thought about, you know, really going back into television.  I mean, I had wanted to, and kind of, you know, the idea was in the back of my mind but I didn't think it was going to happen.  And eventually I did go back to work for the CBS station with him.  And they were reticent about the whole thing but he had said, you know, he was very emphatic that he wanted me to come back.  We started doing a four o'clock newscast, which was destined to fail from the beginning.  It was up against 'Oprah' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], number one, and number two, they did nothing to distinguish it from the other newscasts.  It was just kind of a rehash, and it was an hour long.  It was like feeding the monster every day.  There was nothing to look forward to, and I actually got tired of doing it after a time.  And, eventually, the woman who was doing the six o'clock news left and I started doing the six o'clock news for a short period with my old co-anchor.  They never promoted us, they never did anything, and then they brought in a new team from South Beach, Miami [Florida].  And the guy decided that he wanted to do things another way, and he wanted to go with young Hispanic women.  And they took me off the air.
Story_ID: 350938
Speaker 1: We were talking about the new people coming in and changing everything around.  But you were talking about the fact that you had worked with an anchor--
Speaker 2: Tracy Rowlett.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who is a primary anchor at the CBS 11 [KTVT-TV] station in Dallas/Fort Worth [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me what happens now, they bring in the new people and what happens?
Speaker 2: It was very odd because they decided to take me off the air at a time when all the research showed that I was their most popular anchor, second only to Tracy Rowlett, who had been there for a couple of years.  And I was a relatively, you know, relative newcomer.  The woman that they decided to go with barely showed up in the research.  I mean, I outdistanced her by so far that it was not even funny.  I mean, she was barely a blip in the research and I was at the top.  I bested all the women who had been there for a number of years and I had just come onboard.  My popularity was soaring.  They decided to take me off the air, and I seriously considered suing for wrongful termination because I believe it was age and race discrimination.  My friend Bill Wright had a lot to do with talking me out of doing it.  And they decided to keep me on doing a weekly show, 'Positively Texas,' and I was never full-time in the first place.  And they, they just refused to give me a full-time job and insisted that I stay on at the radio station, and do this hour-long show every day.  I was driving approximately a hundred miles a day, working early mornings from six to nine at the radio station, coming home trying to take a nap in the middle of the day, and then driving all the way to Fort Worth from Dallas in the afternoon to do the newscast.  And I was still part-time at the television station.  And when they took me off the air, they decided to let me do this--they had already had me doing this weekly show, which was a community affairs program.  And they decided to let me keep doing that show out of their, the goodness of their hearts and they'd pay me the same money that I was making going five days a week.  And I'm still doing that now two years later.  I think it took a terrible toll on me.  First of all, I ended up sick and in the hospital, I think from stress in large part, not totally because of what happened at the television station.  I had an unruly child who was driving me crazy at the time as well.  But, anyway, I ended up hospitalized and have been sick for the last couple of years, and, in part, because of what happened at the television station.
Story_ID: 350939
Speaker 1: We're talking about children, and we left off where you said that your fiance was--had died (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Died.
Speaker 1: So did you ever marry?
Speaker 2: No, I've never married, but I like to say that I have seven children but I birthed none.  I was very instrumental in raising three nieces and a great nephew [Lonnie Charles Williams III], and then I have three horses.  So I figure anytime you feed them, you take care of their housing and their medical needs, and all of that, they're your kids.  So I like to say I have seven kids.  And I--two are grown and gone, the other two are in college or one's about--the boy's about to be in college.  And I've just been, you know, parent to them for the most part.  So I'm very pleased with my children.
Speaker 1: You mentioned horses?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you're a lover of horses (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I love horses.  My father [Horace Johnson] and my [maternal] grandfather [John Hubbard, Sr.] were both farmers and ranchers.  I grew up with a horse.  In fact, a horse was my babysitter when I was teeny-tiny.  My mom [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson] said that we, we lived in, in a ranch-style house, and it was fenced in to keep the cattle and everything away from the house.  And they would put me on my horse--I had my own horse named Tony when I was two.  They'd put me on Tony and literally tie me in the saddle so I wouldn't fall off, and I would just ride around in circles in the yard until I wet my pants or something, and that's the only time I'd get off.  And, growing up in southern Arizona we rode horseback all the time with my dad when we were little.  He was good friends with the Indian [Native American] chief at the reservation.  We'd go out there and ride horses.  My mother rode until she was probably in her late sixties.  I mean, she'd get on my uncle's stud horse and she was, you know, she'd tear out.  And, so I grew up riding and loving horses, and I still have them.  I have a herniated disc and some bulging discs in my back now, probably too many falls off horses and motorcycles, which my sisters [Smithie Johnson Dunn and Horacetene Johnson Shults] and I like to ride.  But, I don't ride anymore because of that.
Story_ID: 350940
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you one more thing about your childhood.  I know we're going forward (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jumping around--
Speaker 1: --but, your mother [Eurea Lee Hubbard Johnson], was she a homemaker, because there was some mention about barbeque, about a Johnson barbeque?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother owned a restaurant for a time, it was called Johnson's.  And it turned out in the end to be a place she served barbeque and they said the best hamburgers in Tucson [Arizona].  And a lot of the teenagers would come there in the evening and kind of hang out, and she would make sure that they stayed in line and they all respected her.  And, you know, if a fight broke out or something like that and she stepped in, they would say, okay.  And everything would calm down.  And, 'til this day, in fact, Johnson's, a picture of Johnson's is in the historical archives for the museum in Tucs- well, the history museum in Tucson.  There's a picture of our restaurant, or my mom's restaurant.  After my father [Horace Johnson] was killed in his accident, my mother ended up closing the place and selling it.
Speaker 1: One other thing I'm interested in knowing is about cotton.  Now, your mother could pick 350 pounds of cotton (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pounds of cotton, and she did it not because she had to, because she wanted to, 'cause--I guess that's where I got the notion of, you know challenging the boys to do anything.  She would challenge her brothers [John Hubbard, Jr. and Gus Hubbard] and cousins, and all the men in the family to see who could pick the most cotton on her father's [John Hubbard, Sr.] farm, and she was just proud of the fact that she could out-pick the guys.  And, you know, did it because she wanted to (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was very interesting because I didn't know there were, there was cotton where she grew up.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  They raised--in fact, my grandfather raised cotton.  And my father also raised cotton once we got to Arizona. In fact, we lived in Pima County [Arizona], you know, you've heard of Pima cotton.  And my father raised cotton and, you know, horses and cattle.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 350941
Speaker 1: So, now, when you look over your life, what is the one thing that stands out the most?
Speaker 2: The one thing that stands out the most.  That's a very difficult question to answer.  I've had so many highs and lows, peaks and valleys.  It's hard to say, I've had a very interesting life and a very unusual life.  It's very difficult for me to say that there's any one thing that stands out any more than the others.  I guess being the first, you know, is probably the thing that stands out.  That's the thing that I'm best known for, the first woman, the first black on television in the Dallas/Fort Worth [Texas] area and maybe the State of Texas and one of the first in the country.  So I guess there's--if there's anything that stands out that would be it.  Just being a first.
Speaker 1: How do you want people to remember you?
Speaker 2: Most of all as a kind and generous, good person, a person who believed in sharing and who cared a great deal about her fellow man.
Story_ID: 350942
Speaker 1: If a student decides that they want to become a journalist or an anchorwoman, what would be some of the things you would say to them?  What advice would you give?
Speaker 2: Make sure you have a tough skin.  It's a very competitive business and, anymore, it's a business not based necessarily on one's ability and training but it's becoming more showy, more Hollywood if you will.  Just because you've gone to school, have the right credentials, doesn't mean a great deal anymore because they're hiring people who are former actresses, models, things like that to anchor newscasts these days, people who have virtually no training in journalism.  So you've gotta have a thick skin number one, 'cause there're a lot of--there're gonna be a lot of noes and a lot of negatives associated with trying to get into the business.  And there's not much that's fair about it, and it's one of the few jobs where you can do a good job and still get fired.  Which is crazy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, do you have any final thoughts?
Speaker 2: I guess if I had to say one thing to the world in general is that life ain't fair, it's what you make it, and you take every day one day at a time, and make the very best of it.
Speaker 1: We really appreciate you taking the time.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
Speaker 1: Because we know that you're a busy lady, but it's so important this project and for you to understand that, and give us your time, we really, really appreciate it.  And we thank you so very much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I appreciate what you're doing.  My pleasure.
Story_ID: 350943
Speaker 1: I think the most important story that I ever did--I'm one of those crusading journalists who's always trying to do good.  Not interested in investigative, hard-hitting stuff necessarily, but in doing good for mankind.  I heard about the famine and the war on the Horn of Africa, and nobody was paying attention to it.  This was in Ethiopia and Somalia where thousands of refugees were dying every day, and this was back in 1980.  And I went to my boss and said, "Why don't we do something on this.  The national news is not paying attention to it, nobody else is doing anything on it," and along with a photographer and a producer I went to East Africa, and was able to focus attention on the situation there.  And that story ended up making the national news, and helped to focus attention on a terrible problem at the time in Somalia and Ethiopia.  So I like to think that, you know, that was probably the most important thing that I did in my career as a journalist.  And probably the thing that I'm proudest of.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
