Speaker 1: I'm going to start by asking just a few People magazine-ish type questions.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Chili (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Oh gee, what is this?
Speaker 1: Tan.
Speaker 2: Tan, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In that family, earth tones.
Speaker 1: All right.  And vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Barbados, we loved.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?  Would you tell us what that is, if you do have one?
Speaker 2: Don't.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And if it comes to you, then you can just tell us at that particular point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 531347
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your mother.  What is, what was her name?  And if you remember, when was she born and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Mother was born in Girard, Kansas.  Her name was Julia Banks [Julia Banks King].  And I don't think--we haven't visited Girard, so I can't tell you much about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was a housewife, took care of the family and the home and the children.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories that she might have told you about her growing up days in Girard?
Speaker 2: It's interesting that we did not hear a lot about that kind of thing in my younger days.  For some reason our elders didn't talk freely about their own history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What type of person was your mother?  Just tell us something about her personality, and how you remember her from when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, she was a beautiful lady.  She was warm, caring, very industrious, and she never complained, even when she had good reason to.  You just didn't hear complaints from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she tell you any stories about your grandparents, about her parents or her grandparents or great-grandparents, or sisters and brothers?  Or--
Speaker 2: Only that her mother [Mary Banks] was from China.  And they told us her name, her Chinese name, and that she came from Mississippi to Weir, Kansas; where in Mississippi, we never learned that.
Story_ID: 531348
Speaker 1: Now, tell us something about your father [Delutha King, Sr.]; his name, his date of birth, and the location of his birth, where he was born.
Speaker 2: He was born in Paris, Missouri.  And his name was the same, mine is the same as his.  And in his younger days, he worked as a coalminer in Weir, Kansas.  That was a coalmining location at that time--but--later in the years.  And he went to Lincoln University in Missouri [Lincoln Institute; Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] for two years and then he had to leave, because he was married and had children.  But in later years, he attended a theological seminary and entered the ministry.  And he was in the C.M.E. church, so they moved him about a good bit in his early years.  But he finally settled in Columbia, Missouri where he built his own church.  And he was a very hardworking man all his life, all that I knew about him.
Speaker 1: Now, he built his own church.  What's the name of the church that he (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Russell Chapel C.M.E. Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Columbia, Missouri.
Speaker 1: And for those who might know what C.M.E. stands for, would you--?
Speaker 2: Colored Methodist Episcopal [Christian Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they're an offshoot of the--are they an offshoot of the African Methodist Episcopal church?  Or--
Speaker 2: (Shrugs shoulders).
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm not (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I can't help you there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what type of person do you remember your father as being?  He was industrious, and he was definitely, like you stated, the hard worker?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And he went to school, you know, and became a minister?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But what type of person is he?  What type of personality did he have, as you remember him?
Speaker 2: Well, he was steady.
Speaker 1: When you say steady--
Speaker 2: Meaning that his, he was even-tempered--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as far as that goes.  And I remember good times with him.  In Kansas City [Missouri], we used to have a ritual on Friday evening when we would get together as a family and enjoy some home life togetherness and family time.  On a regular basis we did that.
Speaker 1: And would this be with like extended family or just the immediate family?
Speaker 2: Usually the immediate family on Fridays, but the extended family was around quite a lot.  My mother [Julia Banks King] used to, she was a fabulous cook, and all the family would gather on the weekends usually for dinner at our home.
Speaker 1: And this was?
Speaker 2: All of her brothers and sisters and cousins.
Speaker 1: And then your father's side too would come?
Speaker 2: There were very few of his family around, in Kansas City especially.
Story_ID: 531349
Speaker 1: Did he [King's father, Delutha King, Sr.] tell you any stories about when he was growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, he did.  There was a cousin that he grew up with, and the two of them used to do things together.  As a matter of fact, they started a business, a carwash business way back in the '20s [1920s] in Weir, Kansas.  And they both were quite industrious.
Speaker 1: So, they started a--what type of carwash business was this?  I mean did they just do friends' cars, or did they extend it to other people in the community?
Speaker 2: I don't know all the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Anybody who would actually just pay to have their car washed, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's what I gather from it.  I don't know the particulars of it, but the fact that they got together and started any kind of business in those days was remarkable, I thought.
Speaker 1: That is true.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he was very committed to the church.  We used to, you know, we used to stay in church.  It was Sunday school in the morning; church service; back in the evening for the young people's program; and Wednesday night prayer meeting.  We were there all the time; it seemed that way anyway.
Speaker 1: So, how was it growing up being a minister's son?  (Laughter) I know you stayed in church, but was he strict?
Speaker 2: Sort of, sort of.  Yeah, there were things that we did not do that some of the other children did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had a chance--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.
Speaker 1: --to actually do?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531350
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Julia Banks King]--you said that your mother's parents--tell us about them.  Tell us if you remember the names of your grandparents, you know, your mother's parents.
Speaker 2: Her name was Mary Banks, my grandmother was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And some more--just give us a little information about her that you remember (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, oh, I remember her well, because she was around when I was younger and at home.  And she used to live just half a block away from us, and we were back and forth at her house.  And whenever my mother had somewhere to go or to be, she would--we didn't call it babysitting then, but she would look after us until they got back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was a tiny lady, and very quiet, didn't talk a lot.  But she was, her presence was felt and known when she was on the scene.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she used to take my sister [Veatrice King Gray] and me to these series at a movie theater every Friday.  That was our together time (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You know, they had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what did you all see?
Speaker 2: They had a series.  Oh, gee, I don't remember.  The cowboys--and I don't even think we saw Buck Rogers, but that was popular then.  But she was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Now, what were the theaters like?  Because this is--
Speaker 2: They were segregated.  And there were only two, I believe, and we would spend time at one or the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you say she was Chinese?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: She was born in America, or was she born in China?
Speaker 2: She was born in China, is what I gathered.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, okay. And she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her father was a merchant in China, and somehow he came to this country.  I never knew him, never say him; I just heard about him.
Speaker 1: Now did she have a Chinese name?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: You say she did?
Speaker 2: She did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Gow Tow Lee Su [ph.].
Speaker 1: Gow Tow Lee Su.  Did that have a meaning to it?  Did they ever talk about the meaning of that name?
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about that, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandfather, her husband, what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was James Banks.  And I never saw him, never met him, don't know anything about him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did she ever talk about how they met or--?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever talk about how they met?  And--
Speaker 2: In those days--
Speaker 1: They just didn't talk (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't talk about it.  They didn't talk to anybody about it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did she keep a lot of her customs alive when she was around you and your sister?  You know, did she teach you any of the customs from her country?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't recall any of that.
Speaker 1: She spoke fluent English?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not with an accent?  Just--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I didn't detect it at that time.
Speaker 1: At that time, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wasn't conscious of it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you know if her family came over possibly with the--what was it, the railroads?  I think a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from China came over with the railroads.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.  As a matter of fact, in Weir [Kansas], a number of people were brought in.  Blacks were brought in at one time, I recall hearing about this, to break a strike in the coalmines in Weir.  And it created an interesting time of life in Weir, a small place, in that there were a few disruptions from the usual daily life.  But that's all the history that I heard about.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And Weir is in what part of Kansas, right?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Is that north or south?  I'm not familiar with Weir (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was south of Kansas City [Missouri].
Story_ID: 531351
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your father's mother and father [Fred King].
Speaker 2: My father's mother passed on, and his father remarried.  So, he has a number of half-brothers and sisters.  And I understand that she was Indian [Native American], Cherokee.  And I don't know much about her life or what she did, or much about that sort of thing.  Because again, they just didn't talk about it.  And as a matter of fact, it was well into my teens before I even learned about her.  My father's father was a principal of the school.  There was a one room school in Weir [Kansas], and at one time he was the principal of that school.  And my father's sister was one of the teachers in the school in Weir, Kansas.
Speaker 1: So, your father [Delutha King, Sr.] was probably learning to read at an early age?  And did he attend that school?  He probably did, right, since it was the only--?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't recall whether he went to school in Weir.  I suspect he may have, yeah.  But he never talked about attending that school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Oh, I do--now it's coming back to me.  He graduated from the high school in Weir.  And the elementary school was segregated, and the high school was integrated.  This is back in the 1920s (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, that's, that's different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a very peculiar situation in that, in that community.
Speaker 1: Now that is different, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Story_ID: 531352
Speaker 1: Do you remember if your, if any of your grandparents talked about like what life or early life was like for them, just in general?  Like your mother's mother [Mary Banks], did any stories filter down as to, you know, if they had land either in Kansas--and if they had farms or, you know, just, you know, how life was for them--how they made their living and how their ancestors might have made their living?  Did they make it off the land?  How did they do it?
Speaker 2: My grandparents in Weir [Kansas] had a farm.  And I recall that--I left Weir.  I was five years old as I recall, but my sister [Veatrice King Gray] and I used to go back there every summer to spend the summer.  And I remember there were always a lot of workers who would come, and my grandmother would get up and prepare breakfast for them.  And breakfast at that time was a dinner meal today, you know, biscuits and heavy meats and all of that; vegetables and so forth.  And this is four and five o'clock in the morning, because the fellows would go out to work in the fields.  I remember that kind of activity around the house.  So, apparently farming was their livelihood at that time.
Story_ID: 531353
Speaker 1: Did any of them work in the coalmines, since you talked about the coal disruption around then?  I don't know if it was riot, but you said it was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a riot.  And there was a strike by the workers, the miners whose jobs were in jeopardy.  And the strike was broken by trainloads of mostly blacks being brought in from Birmingham [Alabama], as I recall, to work the mines.  And this created friction in the community, and some very disturbing activity around there.
Speaker 1: So this was during the '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say disturbing activity, what kind of activities?  Were there shoot 'em ups? Were there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: And hangings, I heard about one that occurred right near the post office where we used to go to pick up the mail.
Speaker 1: So did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And not just heard about it, but there was a centennial publication put out about Weir [Kansas] when it reached its hundredth year.  And in it this was recorded, the fact that this had taken place in downtown Weir.
Speaker 1: So this was an ugly occasion?
Speaker 2: Very ugly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean very ugly.
Speaker 2: Very ugly, yes.
Speaker 1: So, the Klan came in to run the blacks out of town who had come up from the South to work in the coalmines?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  That's, that's the story.
Speaker 1: So they were successful?  Did the blacks fight back?  Did the--?
Speaker 2: I don't know how that was dealt with, but it was, there were some bad days.
Speaker 1: And there were--Kansas was kind of known for a lot of hangings, if I remember, even up to, what, like the '40s [1940s]?  And I'm trying to think.  The '50s [1950s]?  Or somewhere around in there I think Kansas was still doing a lot of lynching.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was really, really, really, bad.  Did they talk any about slavery or whether some of your ancestors had been enslaved or not?
Speaker 2: They didn't talk about it.
Speaker 1: They didn't talk about--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --any of that?
Speaker 2: Not where we could hear it.  You know, in those days kids were to be seen and not heard (laughter).  You were asked out of the room, or they'd get you out of the picture somehow so.
Story_ID: 531354
Speaker 1: Well, did they do a lot of quilting?  Or did they, did the women do quilting?
Speaker 2: Women did quilting.  I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they--did they do it out of attending to, well, a lot of the chores that were around the house, like, well, of course the cooking and the cleaning?  Did they do a lot of canning?  Or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, a lot of canning and feeding the livestock.  I remember the chickens, because we got to feed them, my sister [Veatrice King Gray] and I.  And--
Speaker 1: Did they have cattle, or pigs, or horses (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pigs, pigs.  I don't remember cattle.
Speaker 1: Did you all have any--did your ancestors do any hog killing time or chicken killing time?  Or (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I remember, just peripherally, that the neighbors would get together and go to somebody's house to do that sort of thing.  I didn't witness it though.
Story_ID: 531355
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up [in Weir, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: I remember--I couldn't have been more than four, because it was before we left for Kansas City [Missouri]--that I was riding a tricycle backed up against the house.  And there were concrete blocks, and some of them had sharp edges on the foundation.  And I fell back and cracked my head on that, and I thought I was bleeding to death.  But my grandmother took me in the house and put some warm water on it, and then she did something with some cobwebs to stop the bleeding (laughter).  And the bleeding stopped, and I remember that.  That's my, I think that's about the earliest memory as far back as I can go.
Speaker 1: And this was your mother's mother [Mary Banks]?
Speaker 2: This was my father's [Delutha King, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Your father's mother?
Speaker 2: --stepmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, your father's stepmother.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And that stopped the bleeding?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Story_ID: 531356
Speaker 1: What were holidays like when you were growing up, when you were a young child?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember a holiday, and I think that holiday was Juneteenth in Weir [Kansas].  And I was a little child at the time, so I don't have clear memories of it.  I just knew that there was a lot of excitement, and there were banners and a band in downtown Weir.  There was one main street, and they used to do something in middle of the street to have, to involve all of the children.  And that's about as much as I can remember from Weir.  And after that, it's Kansas City [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because Juneteenth actually started in Texas, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, it did.
Speaker 1: Because I know they tease Texans about being the last one to get the news that (laughter) they were free.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then it just started to just reverberate throughout the different states.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Juneteenth became that celebration.  I was surprised; I didn't know that they celebrated it in Weir.
Speaker 2: That's what I recall was the occasion.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it had started to spread then, June 19th (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531357
Speaker 1: What else do you remember about your early childhood life when you were growing up in Weir [Kansas], and then even when you moved to Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Well, in the visits back to Weir as we were growing up, I always remember those days fondly.  And they were lazy summer days, and there was no air-conditioning in those days.  And they used to close the house up, I know Mother [Julia Banks King] did in Kansas City in the morning, so that it would be cool in the afternoon, and that worked real well at that time.  I would go get the mail usually, and you had to walk about a mile to get it in Weir.  And that was my job, one of my jobs when I stayed in Weir over the summers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where was the, where was the mail delivered to?  Was it delivered to--?
Speaker 2: To a post office.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  And you'd go into the post office?
Speaker 2: You'd go into it, and everyone had a post office box.
Story_ID: 531358
Speaker 1: State the names of your siblings in the order of birth, with you included.  It was just, was it just you and your sister?
Speaker 2: Just the two of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her name?  What is her name?
Speaker 2: Veatrice [Veatrice King Gray].
Speaker 1: Would you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: V-E-A-T-R-I-C-E.
Speaker 1: Like Beatrice.
Speaker 2: V.
Speaker 1: But it was V.
Speaker 2: It was V.
Speaker 1: It was with a V, okay.
Speaker 2: It was V, yes.
Speaker 1: And was she the oldest or the youngest?
Speaker 2: The youngest.
Speaker 1: She was the youngest?
Speaker 2: A year younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did, what were some of the games that you played?  There were the two of you.  Did you play games?  How did you entertain yourself when you were around the home before going to, you know, regular school?
Speaker 2: Well, the kids in the neighborhood would get together at one place or the other.  And gee, I can't go far beyond hide and seek and cowboys and Indians [Native American] (laughter).  But just--there was a rock quarry in Weir [Kansas] where kids used to go to swim.  And years later the water was crystal clear, and you could see the bottom, see all the rocks.  And years after I left there, I learned how deep that water was.  I had no idea when we were jumping in, like, (laughter) you know, like there was no tomorrow.  But that thing was deep.  And I had a cousin who died just a couple of years ago who reminded me that she had--some of the kids had thrown her in, and she told me that I pulled her out and saved her (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, really?  (Laughter) You don't remember that?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that, but she remembered it.
Speaker 1: About how old were you?  Were you very young, or were you teenagers?  Or--
Speaker 2: Not a teenager yet, no.
Speaker 1: So you were like seven, eight, somewhere around in there?  Before thirteen, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe eight or nine, because I was swimming then.
Speaker 1: Did the children have permission of the parents to go swimming?  Or you all snuck off (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No (laughter).  The day was hot, so you'd get a group together and you'd go to the quarry.
Speaker 1: Now my brothers used to just--not do it in their--what do you call it?  Your skivvies.  But they'd sneak away from home and just strip down and just swim (laughter).
Speaker 2: We didn't do it in our skivvies (laughter).  We had some kind of, some kind of cover.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right, but that was, that was where you learned how to swim?
Speaker 2: It was part of our, part of our pastime.
Speaker 1: Do you know who actually started, who taught you how to swim?  Did somebody teach you, or were you just on your own?
Speaker 2: My father [Delutha King, Sr.] taught me to swim.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he took you down to the quarry to teach you how to swim?
Speaker 2: Well, when I would have been eight or nine, I would have been in Kansas City [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we used to go to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], and the family would go on the weekends, all of us.  And so, we learned to swim early.
Story_ID: 531359
Speaker 1: Tell us again, let's go back.  We talked a little bit about your grandmother [Mary Banks] on your mother's [Julia Banks King] side, who was Chinese (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and your grandmother on your father's [Delutha King, Sr.] side, who was Cherokee Indian [Native American].  You said you didn't actually remember any teasing or any kind of, you know, prejudices in the neighborhood, you know, regarding that ethnic mix.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you remember an ancestor--or you remember your father's--on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side.
Speaker 1: And tell us about that ancestor.
Speaker 2: His name was John King.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he lived in Paris, Missouri.
Speaker 1: And this was your father's--
Speaker 2: This is my father's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was reported to have been a very sturdy, stocky fellow who was very strong, and people knew him for his strength.  He would pick barrels up and hoist them over his head, to show off I guess.  But he had a house, a log cabin, where he lived in the center of Paris, Missouri.  And the story is that he owned an icehouse in those days.  And he would go to the lake in the summer, in the winter rather, and cut blocks of ice from the lake and take them to this house.  And he used burlap and straw to separate the blocks of ice, and stored them there until the weather got warm enough for people to need ice, and then he would sell the ice that he had collected in the winter.
Speaker 1: And you said he was American Indian (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: He was Cherokee?
Speaker 2: He was Cherokee, right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: He was Cherokee also?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And did he have--well, you wouldn't know that, but those pitchforks to actually--I mean well, they weren't pitchforks, but they were--
Speaker 2: Tongs?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I don't know how he--
Speaker 1: And you don't know how he delivered it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know how he delivered it.
Speaker 1: He had to have done it--
Speaker 2: He delivered it on his back.  I do remember him talking about that.
Speaker 1: Oh, not by wagon?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He did it on his back?
Speaker 2: Oh, he must have delivered it--there was some kind of device like a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that had wheels on it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But to the homes he would deliver it with his--he had some kind of rubbery shield for his shoulder.  And he would, you know, hold it up and carry it into the homes.  I remember hearing that.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because people did have ice boxes--
Speaker 2: They did have ice boxes.
Speaker 1: --in those days.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was, that was very interesting.
Story_ID: 531360
Speaker 1: So, your father [Delutha King, Sr.] moved the family to Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you were about how old then?
Speaker 2: I was five when we moved to Kansas City.
Speaker 1: Now, how was this, how was life different for you?  How did you feel about moving to Kansas City?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a much bigger place (laughter).  In Weir [Kansas], everybody knew everybody else.  And the population of Weir, when it was described at its zenith, when it had the most people it ever had, it had thirty-three hundred people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty big (laughter).
Speaker 2: So when we moved to Kansas City, this was an entirely different world.  And it was something to deal with, getting started in school there and learning your way around.  So, it was a new experience.
Story_ID: 531361
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of your childhood let's say that comes to mind in Weir [Kansas]?  Let's go back to Weir.  What are some of those that you remember from Weir?
Speaker 2: I was always fascinated by my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Banks] fixing breakfast early in the morning for all these people.  The house was lit up with the smell of the food, and biscuits, and the chicken, and things like that.  So that was, that was a sight to see.  And then we would go out and watch the guys working in the field, doing what they did out there.  So, that was enough to keep you interested.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you moved to Kansas City [Missouri], what were some of the sights and sounds and smells, since this was totally different from Weir?
Speaker 2: Well, would you believe I never thought about anything like that before (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Gee, the sights of course were all of the people, for one thing, and the size of the city.  I remember a park that we used to go to where the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] was located; we used to spend quite a lot of time there.  And baseball was played in that park.
Speaker 1: On the sandlot?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or was it field that was activated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a baseball diamond there.  And some of the black professional teams would pass through the city and they would play there.
Speaker 1: So, the Negro League (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Kansas City Monarchs, for one, is one, the only one that I remember, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you go to some of the games?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: I mean did your parents [Julia Banks King and Delutha King, Sr.] take you to some of the games (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we saw them.
Story_ID: 531362
Speaker 1: Now when you moved to Kansas City [Missouri], what neighborhood did you move into?  Tell us something about the neighborhood; the house you lived in, the people in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: When we first moved to Kansas City, we went to my mother's mother, Mary Banks' home.  She had moved ahead of us.  And I have very vague memories of the house, but I do remember the house.  It had a front porch to it, and I remember her there.  But beyond that, the next place we lived was on Brooklyn Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri, and that's where we lived until I left home years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were your neighbors like?  Did you play with the kids next door, down the--was it a block?  You know, or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --houses on each side of you?  Or, was there sparse housing?  How was--just describe the neighborhood for us.
Speaker 2: It was a very stable street, block.  Most of the people who were there had been there for some years.  Our next door neighbors, we knew them well and we played with their children.  I remember the people who lived on our left, the Burgins [Paul Burgin and Mary Burgin], the husband was a postal worker, and he had a battery shop.  And he invited me over when I was old enough to remember anything, to watch him do his--he would reclaim batteries, and he showed me how to do that.  So, I worked as his assistant.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say reclaim a battery, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Reclaiming car batteries.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: He was taking and replacing the plates, the lead plates that go in them, and the acid and all of this.  He would take old batteries and clean out these old plates and put new ones and fresh ones in if they needed it, and replace the acid and put the battery back together and sell it.
Speaker 1: So, he was refurbishing batteries?
Speaker 2: He was refurbishing batteries.  And he had a shop built in the back of his home for this purpose.  So, he was--when he wasn't at the post office, he was a businessman (laughter).
Speaker 1: He was an entrepreneur (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a busy fellow.
Speaker 1: About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, I'm guessing--when I got connected with him, I must have been maybe twelve or thirteen, something like that.
Speaker 1: So he paid you for your--
Speaker 2: Not at first, no.
Speaker 1: You were an apprentice?
Speaker 2: I was an apprentice.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And then you worked your way up to a salary?
Speaker 2: Oh, well--
Speaker 1: A little bit of a salary?
Speaker 2: It wasn't really a salary.  He'd just give me a couple of nickels every now and then (laughter).  He didn't want to spoil me, I guess.  But I enjoyed it, doing that.
Story_ID: 531363
Speaker 1: Who were some of your playmates?  Do you still keep in contact with some of them now?  Or do they, you all just went your separate ways after high school?
Speaker 2: Well, the Burgins [Paul Burgin and Mary Burgin] had a nephew, his name was Raspberry [James Raspberry], and we used to play together and talk together, and moved around the city [Kansas City, Missouri].  On the right, the family name was Davis, and they had all girls.  So, my sister [Veatrice King Gray] spent time with them, and they were back and forth over at our house.  And then were other children down the block who we spent time with.  And the guys and I would sometimes go to the park and toss some balls around, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Baseball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, softball.
Speaker 1: Softball?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did you all play softball games or just, you know, forming a team to play against another team?  Or was it just you all just throwing the balls back and forth to each other (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were just throwing the balls, practicing and getting ready for the teams.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you all did have competition then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not a lot of it, not a lot where we had a formal team together.  We would go to the ballpark together and maybe be chosen to play or not.  And that was the way that happened.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So, well, how would you--you would go to the baseball park.  And if you would--you would go to the park.  So if, if they--if some teams were playing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Teams would be forming.
Speaker 1: --and they needed some extra--
Speaker 2: Right.  If a team was being formed at the park, you may be selected to play, or you may not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a little bit different.  Because normally every little neighborhood kind of had their own little game, so that you could participate, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't have quite that many boys around (laughter).
Story_ID: 531364
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: W.W. Yates Elementary School [Kansas City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Now this was--did you walk to school, or how did you--
Speaker 2: Walked to school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers who influenced you?
Speaker 2: There was a teacher, her name was Miss Mayberry, who impressed me, and who I think was very encouraging of the students.
Speaker 1: About what grade was this?  I know it was elementary.  Was it like third or fourth?  Or was it--
Speaker 2: It must have been fourth, somewhere between fourth, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you?  Were you quiet?  Were you noisy?  Were you boisterous?  Rambunctious?
Speaker 2: I was not noisy, I was quiet (laughter).  But I do remember that the principal used to collect about half a dozen of us, and somewhere in the afternoon he taught us astronomy.
Speaker 1: That's different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And everybody didn't get to learn about that, you know.  But I thought that was, that was something I found very challenging and interesting.
Speaker 1: That is.  Now, how did he teach it?  Did he just teach it like outside under the stars or under the skies, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, this is during the school hours, during the school time.
Speaker 1: Was there a planetarium?  Did he create a planetarium?
Speaker 2: No, but he brought pictures and showed us the planets and their relationship to the earth, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  And what was a day like in school?  Was it--you know, did you have recesses?  How did a day in elementary school basically go?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, you're really reaching now (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, but did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're asking me to reach; I mean, memory-wise.  Well, we'd get there somewhere around eight in the morning after having walked from home, and we'd go to class.  And there was recess, I remember that.  And as a matter of fact, I might say there might have been two, one in the early part of the day and one in the afternoon.  But I'm sure of one recess, yeah.  And I don't recall anything unusual in the course of the day.
Speaker 1: Did you have planned activities?  I know you just played, but you just went outside?
Speaker 2: Oh, for recess?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, for recess.
Speaker 2: No planned activities.  We just went out and did whatever.
Speaker 1: And then you came back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some people say they had a big recess and a little recess.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Big recess lasted the longest, and little recess was the little short either, ten or fifteen minute--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --recesses.
Speaker 2: Now what were some of your interests then?  What were you interested in in elementary school?  Did you like penmanship, or reading?
Speaker 1: I wish I'd liked penmanship (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: My wife [Lois Weaver King] tells me nobody writes worse than I do.
Speaker 2: Well, that signifies that you're definitely a medical doctor (laughter).  So you can write the code, and nobody can read it but you and the pharmacist (laughter).  So you learned that early, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I learned that early (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, what were some of the subjects that you did like more than others in elementary school?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: And I know you had astronomy.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  I, I liked math classes, English.  Miss Mayberry taught English and grammar, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So where did you--okay, then after elementary--that was what?  From grades one through--or was it kindergarten?
Speaker 1: It was one through seven, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: One through seven?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And then what was that?  Middle school?
Speaker 1: Middle school was R.T. Coles middle school [R.T. Coles Vocational and Junior High School, Kansas City, Missouri].  And then Lincoln High School [Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], finished up.
Story_ID: 531365
Speaker 1: Did you have integrated schools?  Or did you go to school with any other nationalities?  Or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they were not--
Speaker 1: They were all black?
Speaker 2: They were not integrated; they were all black.
Speaker 1: And what about the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was all black.
Speaker 1: And when you were in Weir [Kansas], was it the same, all black neighborhoods or was it mixed?
Speaker 2: Weir was different.  Your neighbor could have been white.  Houses were pretty far apart, they weren't that close.  There was farmland, farmers, so there weren't proscribed areas that were either white or black.  It was pretty mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in Kansas City [Missouri], it was definitely all black?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely all black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've seen that, because it--I said that because it snows in Kansas City, some of the houses had two levels plus a basement.  But it seems like most houses had basements.  Did you all have any basements, or did you have two levels?  Or--
Speaker 2: We had two levels, and it wasn't a finished basement.  But the furnace was down there, so you could get to it.
Speaker 1: Was this a coal furnace, or radiator (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A coal furnace, coal.
Speaker 1: So you all had to buy coal and--
Speaker 2: Buy coal.
Speaker 1: --have it--did you have it delivered?  Or how did you get it to the house?
Speaker 2: They delivered it to the front of your house, and then my father [Delutha King, Sr.] had to--and I, when I learned to do it, would bring it into the house.
Speaker 1: And so you all had to pay for coal?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now did you all have electricity?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had electricity.
Speaker 1: And no gas, but the coal supplied all the heat?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting.  So, this coal heated the whole house?
Speaker 2: It did, yeah.
Speaker 1: And was the house--you said--was there a furnace in the basement?  Or how did--
Speaker 2: The furnace was in the basement.
Speaker 1: And you just--how was it carried through the rest of the house?
Speaker 2: Large pipes would carry the warm air throughout the house.
Speaker 1: And that kept the house warm?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it registers in all the rooms.
Speaker 1: Now was the house--was the coal, you know, the deposits of coal--did you have like black soot from using coal as a source of heat, or not?
Speaker 2: That was never a problem.
Speaker 1: Never a problem?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And it just came out through the chimney?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: It just seems like with coal--but in the furnace downstairs, that's where it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it would burn up in the furnace downstairs, yeah.
Speaker 1: I always wondered how those houses were heated in the wintertime, you know, in Kansas.
Story_ID: 531366
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have any problems with the coal--I mean with the cold, C-O-L-D?
Speaker 2: Any problems with the cold?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, like getting around as a child, you know, in the snow.  Were there any snowstorms or blizzards during the time you were growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right, in that part of the country snow was always a problem, but it was a part of life.  It was there, and you just dressed for it, and you'd get out and go.
Speaker 1: So what--when the car got stuck, how did people--how did they get the car from out of the, you know, stuck in the snow?
Speaker 2: We weren't paying attention to cars.  We didn't have one at that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, this was before the car.  So everybody was walking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, everybody walked that I knew.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so did they use wagons, or did somebody in the neighborhood have a wagon or any mode of transportation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember any wagons, except there was a guy who used to sell vegetables, and he had a wagon and a horse.  But others had--there was public transportation, streetcars to move about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had to pay to ride the streetcar?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About how much was that?
Speaker 2: Ten or fifteen cents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then there were passes that you could buy, weekly passes.  They weren't, I don't remember how much they were, but they were available.
Story_ID: 531367
Speaker 1: So, what did you and your sister [Veatrice King Gray] do for entertainment when you were at home?  Like in the evenings and on weekends when you couldn't get out and play with the other children, when it was past playing with the next door neighbors, did you all have any indoor activities that you all did?
Speaker 2: Gee, I know we did something.  We'd listen to the radio at times, and there were some games that I don't recall, card games that my uncles would teach us.
Speaker 1: Was this hearts or was it bid whist?  Or what kind of games did you play?  Spades?  It was a regular deck of playing cards, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You don't--
Speaker 2: Solitaire, blackjack (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, this is when you were in Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This was the days of when Kansas City was kind of like in it's heyday for musicians and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, right.  It was well-known for musicians like Count Basie, who spent a lot of time in Kansas City.  Duke Ellington came through, and many of the older bluesmen.  Kansas City was known for blues, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you living close to that section of town where blues was kind of at its peak?  You know, were you in the vicinity of where the artists (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we lived a little distance away from there.  We used to go down from time to time.
Story_ID: 531368
Speaker 1: In elementary school who were some of the teachers or in junior--I'm sorry, in middle school--at Coles [R.T. Coles Vocational and Junior High School, Kansas City, Missouri].  Who were some of the teachers that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Gee.
Speaker 1: And what are their names, even if it's just one or two (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I remember Mr. Lee [Percy H. Lee].  He taught woodworking; shop, they called it.  And I don't remember a lot of my teachers from middle school.
Speaker 1: See, it's amazing.  Shop was one of the--and woodworking, was one of the classes that used to be found in most of the schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was like very school had a shop or a woodworking class, and that's not the case anymore.  And it was part of the curriculum in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, it was.
Speaker 1: Was that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, what project did you do for shop class?
Speaker 2: I did a footstool, and I think we had it in the house (laughter).  We still have it?  And oh, gee, I remember using the legs, where we would turn wooden legs for tables and that sort of thing.  I sort of enjoyed that.  But I can't recall any of other projects that I might have done.
Speaker 1: Because you got a grade for shop--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --to show that you had actually--
Speaker 2: You had to complete the projects, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531369
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you moved on to high school [Lincoln High School; Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], did you say it was all white?  I mean, a mixed high school?
Speaker 2: No, it was not.  It was all black.
Speaker 1: All black?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, where did I get that, that it was an all-white high school?  Okay, well, how was, what was high school like?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, that was a good experience.  I'm thinking, I'm picturing our Latin teacher in my mind's eye, and I'm trying to come up with her name and I can't.
Speaker 1: So, you did have Latin as part of the curriculum?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I remember one of my favorite teachers was Mr. Bryant, Girard T. Bryant.  He taught social studies and history.  And--
Speaker 1: Was that because his name reminded you of your mother's [Julia Banks King] hometown (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Because she was born in Girard, Kansas (laughter).
Speaker 2: No.  I remember him because he, he was one who kind of--I wouldn't say pushed me along, but he urged me along to pursue school beyond high school.  And he told me--there used to be a scholarship that would come from, between our high school and one in Kansas City, Kansas.  They used to alternate that award, that scholarship award.
Speaker 1: So, a black school in Kansas and a black school in Missouri--
Speaker 2: Black schools, yeah.
Speaker 1: --would get it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Each also would get--
Speaker 2: And the year that he thought I was the eligible person for it, it went to Kansas that year (laughter).  So he told me, he told me about that; that I would have gotten it if it had been--
Speaker 1: If it had been that year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It wasn't your year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't my year.
Speaker 1: --your school year to get it.  Now, that's different.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I hope they don't have that now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It wasn't that much, but it was a scholarship nonetheless.
Speaker 1: So, did you all change classes?  I'm just trying to find out what was--tell us what high school--
Speaker 2: In high school we did change classes.  We'd go from one to the other when the bell rang.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have science classes?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, were you thinking of what you wanted to be when you graduated?  I know you were encouraged to seek college opportunities.  But were you thinking anything about who you wanted to be, or what profession you wanted at that particular time?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a hard time getting past medicine.  My mother used to, when she would talk to people at church, you know, people were always asking, "What's he going to be when he grows up?"  She would always say--never said anything else, "He's going to be a doctor, he's going to be a doctor."  (Laughter) So when you ask me if my mind was made up, (laughter) it was made up, all right.
Speaker 1: Yours wasn't, but hers was (laughter).
Speaker 2: Hers was.  She had no doubts in her mind, "He's going to be a doctor."
Speaker 1: Now, but how did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know anything else.  So, I wanted to be a doctor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I enjoyed the sciences.  And I did, I did well with the physiology and the botany and, you name it.  So later on when I went away to school [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas], that's the direction that I had charted.
Story_ID: 531370
Speaker 1: Tell us what you did during the summers.
Speaker 2: Well, once we got out of school in Kansas City [Missouri], my sister [Veatrice King Gray] and I would travel to Weir [Kansas], and school was still in session there.  They had about two, at least another two weeks to go, because their season was different than Kansas City.  And we would go to school every day and sit in class with the other kids until they got out.
Speaker 1: After you had finished school in Kansas City (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you went and took more school?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, all the kids were in school, and that's where everybody was (laughter).  So that's what we'd do.  So, we'd sit in the back of the room and listen and learn (laughter).  And then I loved to read, I always have.  And I was forever getting lost in the house, around the house with a book somewhere.  So, one real hot day, it was cooler under a little daybed that was in one of the early rooms in the house.  And I was under the bed (laughter) to keep cool while I read.  I remember that, because my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Banks] couldn't find me; she was looking for me.  Well, that's where she found me.
Speaker 1: And when she found you, what did she say?
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, now when she, when your grandmother found you after she couldn't find you--then she found you reading, what did she say?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, she didn't, she wasn't too hard on me.  She would get on my case for always reading.
Speaker 1: So what did you like to read?  What subjects actually intrigued you?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, this is after we would have moved to Kansas City, so I was reading 'Ivanhoe' [Sir Walter Scott].  And what else?  Books like that.
Speaker 1: Isn't that, isn't he the author that did something about the Indians [Native American]?  You got to get the inside outside to get the, it was something, and I think it was from 'Ivanhoe.'
Speaker 2: From 'Ivanhoe'?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it was like the older people used to call it wrong siders, and I always wondered what that was, wrong side outside.
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But it was something, and I think it was associated with him, you got to get the inside outside, or get the outside inside.  And I think he was the author of, you know, one of those--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --particular pieces.  And did you read any science books, or any other--cowboy books, or any westerns (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I read cowboys, yeah, uh-huh.  In the summer yeah, mostly casual reading.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Stories like that, the cowboys.
Speaker 1: And when you went back to Kansas City, you would read also?  Did you make trips to the library constantly?  Or, how did you get your reading materials?
Speaker 2: From the library mostly, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, was there a library in the neighborhood, or did you go to a school library?  How, how was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They had a--
Speaker 1: --library set up?
Speaker 2: They had a small library at the school, and you were able to carry some books home from there, especially at Lincoln [Lincoln High School; Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], at the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was a public library in the city that you could go to.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you read any Mark Twain?
Speaker 2: I read him, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now when you got into high school, what type of reading did you do?  I know you did a lot of subject matter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --reading.  But, for the materials that were outside of the classroom--?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.
Speaker 1: Or did it matter, just as long as you were reading (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Almost like that (laughter).  Yeah, the subjects and the book names don't come to me at the moment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh
Story_ID: 531371
Speaker 1: Did you have any part-time, like, little jobs to make a little extra money when you were growing up?  Or did you just read all the time (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I, I delivered papers, called the Kansas City Call [The Call], every Friday.  And that was, that was my first job, I believe.
Speaker 1: And about how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I must have been fourteen, at least fourteen by then.
Speaker 1: And how much were the papers selling for?
Speaker 2: Ten cents.
Speaker 1: So, how did you get your route?  How did you get your customers?
Speaker 2: Word of mouth.  The customers would tell other people, and I would sign them up and make the deliveries.  I had to get up at 4:00, 4:30 to get down to get your share of papers.
Speaker 1: And then you would roll them up down there?  Or you would just put them on your--you said you used your bike?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So how did you, how did you do that?  How was that done (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, most of my deliveries were right around in my neighborhood [in Kansas City, Missouri], so I didn't need a bike for that.  As a matter of fact, I didn't have a bike at that point when I was fourteen.  I had a small bike, you know, for younger kids.  But I didn't use it for that.
Speaker 1: And so what did you do with your paper route money?
Speaker 2: Well, gee, not a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Did you save it, or did you just use it for incidentals?  Or--
Speaker 2: For incidentals mostly, yeah.  It wasn't that big a payroll (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, ten cents went a long way then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Candy wasn't, I mean you could even buy, what, two for a penny candy then, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you share any with your sister [Veatrice King Gray]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 531372
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories to tell us about, you know, like some of the things that you and she [King's sister, Veatrice King Gray] might have gotten involved in, the two of you?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  Other than our trips to the movie house on Friday with our [maternal] grandmother [Mary Banks], we would walk to school together every day.  And I remember that when I started to school, she was a year younger than me, and she couldn't be enrolled because she wasn't old enough.  And oh, boy, (laughter).
Speaker 1: She didn't like that.
Speaker 2: She didn't like that at all.  But we used to do most things, a lot of things together.
Speaker 1: Because you were close in age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were almost like twins there, weren't you(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 531373
Speaker 1: Now after you--you were in high school [Lincoln High School; Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: In Kansas City, Kansas?
Speaker 2: Missouri.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Kansas City, Missouri.  They're right there together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They're like twin cities.
Speaker 2: Across the bridge.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The viaduct.
Speaker 1: It's almost, it's almost difficult to keep them apart.  Now, are you thinking about being a doctor at this particular time in high school?
Speaker 2: It was on my mind, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Are you serious about doing that, or is it because your mother [Julia Banks King] was saying that you--?
Speaker 2: Well, you had to, you had a choice of the kind of track that you wanted to take in high school.  And I took the one that included the sciences and the language and those things that would kind of prepare you for medicine if you were going in that direction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know which school you might have wanted to attend?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any idea about schools at the time, but I ended up going to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].  And when I was sixteen, I graduated from high school.  Oh, and before I graduated, I wanted a job, and my mother didn't want me to work.  She said, "Once you start working, you'll be working for the rest of your life."  So, she didn't want me to start, but I finally persuaded her to get me a bicycle so that I could take a job at a drugstore as a delivery boy.  And I finally did, eventually (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this was in high school?
Speaker 2: This was--
Speaker 1: About what grade?
Speaker 2: I was in high school.  I would leave high school and go to this job I had.
Speaker 1: And you delivered medications?  Or--
Speaker 2: I delivered packages, whatever they were.
Speaker 1: Oh, just whatever the--
Speaker 2: Whatever would be called for.
Speaker 1: --store had?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and were you--that was the twelfth grade?  Or--
Speaker 2: I know I was still doing it when I was in twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Well, this paid pretty good, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Then, it was a lot of money, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you decided that wouldn't be your full-time career, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, did you think your mother was right for not wanting you to take that job?
Speaker 2: She was absolutely right.  I should have listened to her (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, well, did you save some of your money for when you did decide to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I tried to do that (laughter).  That was the idea.
Story_ID: 531374
Speaker 1: You chose the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I really don't know how that--I don't remember how that decision was made.  But that's where I went, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixteen, and living in a predominantly African American society all my life through all the grades of school, and they took me to a fraternity house, Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and left me on the front porch of that with my little bag.
Speaker 1: Now, who did this?
Speaker 2: My parents [Julia Banks King and Delutha King, Sr.].  And I'd never been away from home before overnight (laughter).  And I got enrolled in school, and I don't remember how many hundreds of students there were at the time, but it was over five hundred, well over that.  And there were twenty-five black students.  Those were not some great days in my life.  The school was--I remember the fountain they used to call it, the student lounge it was supposed to have been, where there were booths scattered around the room.  There was one booth that was assigned to the black students.  And if there were more students than there were seats in that lounge, then you didn't have anywhere to sit.  And the atmosphere was just not comfortable for black folks at that university.  This includes the teachers, and professors, and the classrooms.  And there were some of those instructors who didn't mind letting you know.  They didn't come out and say, "Look, I don't like you because you're black," but they might as well have.  Because I still recall comparative anatomy, and I remember that guy was just unusually harsh in his statements, and I was the only person of color in the room.  And I don't say that you know, because I'm proud that I was, but it didn't need to be that way.  But that was the case.  And even with only one of me in the room, this guy didn't know how to be charitable.
Speaker 1: And that's, that's a difficult--most of the professors that I've seen who taught college comparative anatomy usually had a--I say they had a few problems anyway (laughter).
Speaker 2: Issues (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because I know I had a comparative anatomy instructor, and he was an alcoholic.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because what did they--you had--what animals did you study?
Speaker 2: Shark.
Speaker 1: The dolphin?
Speaker 2: Dolphin, yeah.
Speaker 1: Dolphin, shark.  And did you have other animals in there also that you had to--did you have to dissect other animals in that class?
Speaker 2: Well, I think somewhere along the way, early on, there may have been a frog.  But I think that was, that was--no, that was in, that was at Western Reserve [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio].  That's before--that's after--
Speaker 1: The University of Kansas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The University of Kansas, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, we had to do a dog.  We had to dissect a dog, and he had to be, he was in care.  We had to care for all these animals (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: I don't think he liked his job.  He might have wanted to be a medical doctor and he got stuck in--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: He just wasn't a pleasant person, yes.  But then to top it with being, you know, a racist or whatever, that was, you know, quite a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 531375
Speaker 1: Let me ask you.  Before you went to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], when you graduated from high school [Lincoln High School; Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, Kansas City, Missouri], did you have to take any standardized tests to--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, right, yeah.  I remember taking tests for that.
Speaker 1: What tests did you have to take then?  Because you graduated from high school in, what was that?  In 19--?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty [1940].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I graduated in the, in the, it must have been in the winter.
Speaker 1: Yes, either May or somewhere around in there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was June.
Speaker 1: It was June?
Speaker 2: It was June.
Speaker 1: And then school must have started--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --around the winter.
Speaker 2: And then I--because I went right into the University of Kansas that same fall, in September.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But did you have to take any of the tests that the students take now? Like the SAT or ACT?  Or were there other types of--?
Speaker 2: There was a test involved, but I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you graduated early though?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At sixteen, as opposed to eighteen?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was that because you were skipped ahead in grades?  Or was it because you started early, you know, started first grade early?  Or did you do advanced classes to graduate at sixteen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember skipping a class, but I went right on through.  And I don't remember starting early, because they wouldn't let you start if you weren't old enough, just like they wouldn't allow my sister [Veatrice King Gray] in.  So, if I did, I've just forgotten--
Speaker 1: So your birthday was in January, right?
Speaker 2: My birthday was in January.
Speaker 1: And maybe that might have been the reason, because school started in September.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you might have started early, maybe because you were five and turned six that year.  Because somewhere along the way in--and I'm not sure what year that would be--it happened there was a stipulation about if you were born before Labor Day or born before--you know, or after Labor Day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --then that determined when you would actually enter school.
Speaker 2: When you'd be allowed to enter, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And some children had to wait out the year--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and then start.  But maybe that wasn't the stipulation in--
Speaker 2: That may have been involved.  Because my sister's birthday was in April, and she was a year younger than me.  So, that could have had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, it might have been.
Story_ID: 531376
Speaker 1: Anyway, I felt like (laughter), I felt like a fish out of water [at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas].
Speaker 2: Then to be so young.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, why would they [King's parents, Julia Banks King and Delutha King, Sr.] drop you at the doors of Kappa Alpha Psi's fraternity house (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that's where we had arranged for me to go to live.  So, I lived at the Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] house.
Speaker 2: Oh, you didn't live in the dorm at the school?  That wasn't an option?
Speaker 1: That wasn't an option.  All the black students had to live out in the city somewhere.  There were no dorms.  There were no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the campus had a--
Speaker 1: There were no fraternity houses for blacks on the hill, not in those days.
Speaker 2: So, you had to live in the fraternity house?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But this was a black fraternity?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And they had a house on campus?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you eventually pledge Kappa?
Speaker 1: I pledged it that year (laughter).  That was one of the conditions of being allowed to have a room there (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Now, that's different.  Now, that is, that is most certainly different.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they, they were my mentors sort of.  Because they found--everybody in the house worked somewhere.  We worked--I waited tables at a sorority house up on the hill, Chi Omega [Chi Omega Sorority].  And the seniors, the older guys in the house, would help you find a job, because that's where your meals came from.
Speaker 2: Oh, you had to buy your own meals?
Speaker 1: Well, you ate at the--where you worked.  And everybody else was doing the same thing.
Speaker 2: So, when you say up on the hill, what does that refer to?
Speaker 1: Well, the geography of the school was that it was at the top of a hill.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And most of the activity took place up on the hill, as we referred to it then.
Speaker 2: So, when you say you worked for a sorority--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at the sorority house waiting tables?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Was this a black sorority house (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) White.
Speaker 2: This was a white sorority house?
Speaker 1: It was a white sorority house.
Speaker 2: Did the whites--did the black sororities, did they have any houses, like AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] or the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority]?
Speaker 1: Yes, there were--
Speaker 2: They had houses?
Speaker 1: There were houses for all of the fraternities and sororities.
Speaker 2: Now, were they on one side of the campus and the white ones were on another side?
Speaker 1: The white ones were up on the hill.  They had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, and--
Speaker 1: --locations around the, close to the university.  You know, they could walk to wherever they needed to go.
Speaker 2: So, the Kappa house was not on the college campus?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And neither was the AKA?
Speaker 1: Neither was the Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] house.
Speaker 2: And these were all, these were all--
Speaker 1: They were all--
Speaker 2: --off campus?
Speaker 1: Off campus, right.
Speaker 2: So, there were no places for blacks to stay on campus at this particular time?
Speaker 1: None.
Speaker 2: None?
Speaker 1: None.
Speaker 2: But there dormitories?
Speaker 1: Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  So, how did this make you feel?
Speaker 1: Well, as I said, I was sixteen and had never been away from home.  So, I didn't know anything about the work a day world, and less about the socialization of blacks and whites.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And there, we were dominated by whites.  So, it took some getting used to all of that environment, and it was somewhat traumatic.  But you asked what did I think about it?  I didn't think it was fair, but it was the way things were, and it was the whole society.  So, it was just--
Speaker 2: But this didn't deter you?
Speaker 1: No, I stayed with it until I felt the need to--you know how kids are.  They want to stay out of school a semester to earn money, to get clothes, and this and that and the other.  And that was my mistake (laughter).
Story_ID: 531377
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you did stay out of--?
Speaker 2: I did, yes.  I did, and when I made that decision, I was almost immediately called into the draft.  Because I didn't, I really wasn't aware that my--the reason I hadn't been called was because I was in college [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas].  So, that's when I went into the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--well, where did you work when you took the time off from school to get the money?
Speaker 2: I worked at a, at an Army supply place, you know, where they had a line--what do you call these lines where things roll along on the--
Speaker 1: Assembly line?
Speaker 2: Assembly line.  And that's what I did.
Speaker 1: What kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just loading the Army cans of food--
Speaker 1: Oh, for the soldiers, the ration?
Speaker 2: --in the boxes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That sort of thing.
Speaker 1: And so, your name came up with the draft?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  And they said, "I want to see you at such and such a place and at a certain time."  So, that's, that's when I went into the Army.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: Forty--
Speaker 1: How long had you been in college?
Speaker 2: I had been there a year, and I was going back for that second--I was going back at the end of the time when I was out, because it was February of '43 [1943] when I was drafted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had stayed one semester, from September--
Speaker 2: I must have stayed out longer than a semester, because I went from home into the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what did your mom [Julia Banks King] say?  How did she feel?
Speaker 2: Oh, she didn't, wasn't happy at all when I went away to school (laughter).  So, she was not a happy lady.
Speaker 1: And your dad [Delutha King, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Well, dads don't talk a lot, so, but I knew he was not pleased, although they wished me well.
Speaker 1: And what happened to that rule about the only son, or only one son, or whatever?  Like, if it was an only son, you didn't have to go off to war [World War II, WWII].  Was that--that wasn't in effect?
Speaker 2: That didn't--if it was in effect, it didn't work in my neighborhood.  (Laughter) All kinds of only sons went to the service in those days.
Story_ID: 531378
Speaker 1: So, you were drafted into the Army?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: The United States Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where were you shipped to?  Where were you to report to?
Speaker 2: I reported to--Fort Clark, Texas, was the destination.  And I'll never forget that train ride.  I was in uniform and had this duffel bag.  And when we--and I was on the train, and I was sitting in a car where there was a white family, a husband and wife and two children.  So, they had one of the children to slide over so that I could sit with them, have room to sit.  That was the only seat left in the car.  And we were going through, headed for Texas going through Arkansas, I believe it was.  Of all people, a black porter came up and whispered in my ear that, "There are some of your buddies in the next car, and I thought you might want to join them."  I said, "Oh, is that so?"  And I said, "Well, let me go see who's back there."  So I got up to go take a look, I excused myself.  The family that was sitting there and I were just having a great conversation.  We were enjoying ourselves, and this guy walks up.  So, as I turned to go through the end of the car to see what he was talking about, he was behind me with my duffle bag on his back.  (Laughter) He was moving me.
Speaker 1: You were sitting in the wrong car (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I got back, when I got back there, I saw all these people, all of them black.  And then he hung a dirty white--used to be a white sheet--over the certain part of the car where blacks were supposed to sit back there.  I tell you, that thing really floored me.
Speaker 1: Did he explain anything?
Speaker 2: Didn't explain a thing; didn't tell me a thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you went from first class to--
Speaker 2: To no class (laughter).  But anyway, we got to Fort Clark, Texas and that's where I had my basic training.  And Fort Clark was, well, this was the horse cavalry; the 2nd, yeah, the 2nd Cavalry Division.  And it was called the Dust Bowl, where all of the soldiers were located.  And it was called the Dust Bowl because you'd go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning and your eyelids had dust on them, and dust was all over everything.
Speaker 1: Was this in southern Texas?
Speaker 2: Southern Texas, right above the Mexican--
Speaker 1: The Mexican border?
Speaker 2: The Mexican border.
Speaker 1: The revenge of Santa Anna [Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna] (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You could walk--you could walk across the street and be in Mexico (laughter).
Story_ID: 531379
Speaker 1: They then classified people according to their record, I guess.  But I ended up in a headquarters outfit, which is a smaller group, about thirty-three men.  And it was in real good, slightly more commodious surroundings.
Speaker 2: Where was this?
Speaker 1: This was in Fort Clark [Texas].
Speaker 2: Oh, but they just moved you to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it was in the company.  The headquarters company always got the nicest stuff.  So I was able, lucky enough to be called to move up to the headquarters company.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We're going to pause here for a tape change.  Now, headquarters company, what does that mean?  Is that a higher rank?  Or--
Speaker 1: No, headquarters company is the administrative people.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: The typists, the secretaries, and the specialists.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact, that--
Speaker 2: Well, you said it was the horse cavalry?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the 2nd Cavalry Division.  That was the overall nomenclature.
Speaker 2: For it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For that group.
Speaker 2: So, did this division ride horses during--or did you take care of horses?  Why was--
Speaker 1: They did.  In the horse cavalry portion, they did.  They rode horses and they took care of horses.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But in the headquarters outfit, we had various kinds of special training.  And my job--well, first we went through six weeks of basic training, and everybody went through that together.  And then the various twenty-five mile hikes and then the fifty mile hike was--they were getting us ready to leave there and go to somewhere else.  That was all part of the training; everybody did that.  And while I was there I went to a school, several of us did, for cable splicing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Telephone and switchboard repair and operation.  And then later, another course was a cable splicing course.
Speaker 2: This was preparing you for when you went abroad?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But we, we stayed there for a certain period of time and then we went, we were moved to Camp Crowder, Missouri.
Speaker 2: Oh, so you moved back?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's where we were transferred into this heavy--the 43rd Signal Heavy Construction Battalion.
Story_ID: 531380
Speaker 1: My name is Evelyn Pounds, I'm the interviewer.  Scott Stearns is the videographer.  This is a continuation interview with Dr. King, [HistoryMaker] Dr. Delutha King, from February 17, 2006.  Would you please state your name?
Speaker 2: Delutha King.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Two, twenty-one, o-six [February 21, 2006].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: My home.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 531381
Speaker 1: Now, when we last talked, when we were talking, we had gotten to the point where you had been called into the [U.S.] military; I won't say drafted.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And just tell us about the first days of, you know, when you were getting all--what is it--when you were mustering in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a brand new experience, of course.  And leaving home was a traumatic event for my family.  And I went to the local recruiting office here in Kansas City [Missouri].  And when we were put on the train to go to our training area, basic training, which was Fort Clark, Texas, rode the train there and sat in a car with a family.  It happened to be a white family, a father and mother and two children, and they made room for me to sit with them.  That was the last seat in the car, a nice clean car, and sparkling; everything was.  And while sitting there chatting with them--we were having a great time together--this porter or someone came up and whispered in my ear that some of my colleagues, soldiers, were in the next car over.  He said, "I thought you might want to know they were there."  I said, "Well, let me go take a look."  I excused myself and went back in the car.  And I felt someone behind me as I went through the door; I held the door for them.  And it was this porter with my duffel bag on his shoulder (laughter).  And he took me back in this car.  And after I got seated, there were other people there, but I didn't see any soldiers.  And he put this dirty gray sheet across the, across the door, the aisle way there, separating all of these people from everybody else.  And that was a, that was a brand new experience for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From first class to no class.
Speaker 2: Exactly right.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you end up--this was what, around 1942, '43 [1943] about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: Forty-three [1943]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And well, how did you end up in the car, in the first-class car, in the car with the whites?
Speaker 2: I got on the car, and I just went--you know, you either went in one direction or the other.  And I just went that way, and a lot of people were going to the right.  And I saw a seat, and I took it.
Speaker 1: But didn't they have little markings, colored and white at that particular time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't have--not on the train they didn't have the markings.
Speaker 1: Blacks were just supposed to know where to go?
Speaker 2: That's, apparently that was it (laughter).
Speaker 1: But because you were so happy to go into the military, you just (laughter), you just decided you would just take the train ride, and just went in the direction you wanted to go in (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).  So we went to Fort Clark, Texas, and they called this location the Dust Bowl.  And all of us, all the troops were billeted in the Dust Bowl until the first or second day that we were there, when various people were separated out because of their skills, administrative skills, to go to headquarters and that sort of thing.  And I was fortunate to be included in that group that went to the headquarters group, because of the living conditions.
Story_ID: 531382
Speaker 1: How were the living conditions?
Speaker 2: Well, in the Dust Bowl you went to sleep, you went to bed, and when you woke up the next morning everything was covered with dust.  And that's why they called it the Dust Bowl.  Your sheets, your eyelids, your face, everywhere.
Speaker 1: Now, you weren't in tents, were you?
Speaker 2: No, we were in barracks.
Speaker 1: And dust still got in?
Speaker 2: Dust--well, there were no screens on the windows, and dust would just run freely through the buildings.
Speaker 1: And this was South Texas, down (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was around--
Speaker 1: Was it like around Laredo [Texas] or someplace like--?
Speaker 2: Near Tijuana [Mexico], near the Mexican border.
Speaker 1: That's the revenge of Santa Anna [Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after you were separated out, you went to--what division did you go to?
Speaker 2: The headquarters at 3rd Signal Troop, they called it.
Speaker 1: 3rd Signal Troop?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what does that mean?
Speaker 2: That was just the--
Speaker 1: That was just the name of it?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: No significance to that name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.  And did you stay in Fort Clark [Texas], or were you transferred out to--?
Speaker 2: Stayed in Fort Clark through basic training until we had--we did field trips and (unclear) out in the desert, in the forest (laughter).  And it was different places, to teach you how to get around through basic training.  And then from there we were transferred to Camp Crowder, Missouri, and that's where the specialty training took place.  And that's when the name of our outfit changed to the 43rd Signal Heavy Construction Battalion.  And the job of this outfit was to dig holes and plant telephone poles and string the wires that allowed communications to go forth in the field.  And then some of us, a few of us, were trained to do repair and installation work of telephones and switchboards, and to become switchboard operators.  And after that, we went into cable splicing.  And our jobs at Camp Crowder were to manage the switchboard around the clock.  And we had shifts to do that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Now, you were in Camp Crowder, but you were getting trained for when you went overseas?
Speaker 2: Exactly right, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you had like a makeshift area that you did all of these--I can't call them maneuvers--but where you learned how to do the cable splicing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and how to install the lines, et cetera?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: For when you went abroad, okay.  So how long did you all stay in Camp Crowder before shipped abroad?
Speaker 2: About eleven weeks, I believe it was.
Speaker 1: That's all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we had a tight schedule.  We had to learn to--you had to pass a test, the outfit did.  You had to build a line for a certain distance, and then tear it down.  And once you did that in a certain period of time, then they knew you were ready to go somewhere (laughter).  And our outfit set a record there by completing the building of the line, the construction of the line, and tearing it down.  Our outfit set a record.
Speaker 1: Now, how many were in your outfit?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee--
Speaker 1: Approximately?  Was it over twenty-five?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was over twenty-five men?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, these were all black men?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: And who were your officers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Officers were all white.
Story_ID: 531383
Speaker 1: All right.  So, what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, we went from--once we passed that test, then we went to, I believe it was Camp Shanks in New York, and that was the area where they got you ready to board the Queen Elizabeth [RMS Queen Elizabeth] to go overseas.
Speaker 1: Now, what other preparation did you need?  Or is that a secret (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, just to get there and get all of the troops together, because Queen E was quite large.  And of course a lot of people could be carried over, so we had to wait on various other troops to get there.
Speaker 1: Now, this was a military ship?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Then okay, so you board the Queen E?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what was life like on the Queen Elizabeth?
Speaker 2: We were in (laughter) deep in the belly of the ship.  It was crowded, it was hot.  It was hard to sleep, because of the temperature.  People were getting sick, you know, sea sickness was rampant.
Speaker 1: This was before air-conditioning?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Apparently, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how long was this ride?  Or how long was this boat trip?
Speaker 2: I think it took about five days.
Speaker 1: And what was your port?  Where were you all going to--?
Speaker 2: We landed in Scotland.  And I can't call the name of the port at the moment, but that's where we disembarked.  And then we stayed in England a short time, and then we were carried onto these amphibious landing boats, and we would drive our vehicles onto this apparatus. And we landed at Utah Beach [Normandy, France], which is where D-Day took place.  And of course there were a lot of remains of vehicles and shells and all of that, littering the beach.  And from there we would go inland to places where we would start building, constructing the telephone lines.
Story_ID: 531384
Speaker 1: Now how did you feel being away from home?  This was, I mean this was different than going to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].  I mean, you're on different shores now.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And I know you're trained, but how did you actually feel being in the [U.S.] Army and getting ready to start--well, you were getting ready to participate in a war.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  Well, I'm not sure I can recall how I felt.  It was--so much new and different was going on around us.  And we were absorbing all of that and the different cultures that we were passing through, and the difference in the weather.  For instance, one thing that I remember so vividly about France was the rain and the mud.  I mean, mud up to your boot tops.  And we were sleeping in pup tents at that time, which was a real grand experience.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of tent was that?
Speaker 2: Pup tents.  That's a small (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) P-U-P?
Speaker 2: P-U-P, yeah, we called them pup tents.  But they were small tents, just one man tents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were on the ground?
Speaker 2: On the ground, yeah.
Speaker 1: Not like the ones today that have the little floor there?
Speaker 2: I'm afraid not (laughter).  But we, we would find ways to make a floor with the straw and other things, whatever was available.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To soften it a little bit.
Speaker 1: And, okay, so you started setting up a line, like you had been trained to do?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you--I know you were setting up communications.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But was it just in that locale, or were you moving from location to location?
Speaker 2: We were moving from location to location.  We would build twenty-five miles at a stretch, and we would move our camp.  Our camp would be in this location, and the goal was to work until you reached twenty-five miles, the end of that line.  Then you would move your whole camp.  The whole troop--all the troops would move.  And our job as the telephone people was to set up a communications system at the camp from tent to tent, you know, as far as administration was concerned.  We would install the telephones and then run the wires to the various locations.  And then as the men would go out and do the construction, the lines had to be tested, and my partner and I would do that.  At the end of the completion of a line of a certain distance, we would test it to see that it was complete and intact.
Speaker 1: Well, what qualifications did you have to have in order to, you know, perform the duties that you all performed as it related to the communications?  Did you have to be electricians?  Did you have to have engineering backgrounds?  Or was everything just on the job training?
Speaker 2: We had classroom training for that before we went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That happened in Camp Crowder [Missouri].
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So did you all do wiretaps?  Is that--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, we didn't do wiretaps in those--
Speaker 1: You just wanted to make sure the signal was getting through.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 531385
Speaker 1: You didn't actually go back to any location, like where you started?  You just kept moving (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We kept moving.
Speaker 1: Every twenty-five miles?
Speaker 2: We kept moving.  Now in some parts of, around Bastogne [Belgium], for instance, the--where the Battle of the Bulge took place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had an experience there.  It was winter, it was cold; snow was on the ground.  And we had, our troops--our battalion had built a line across a certain area.  And some in some of those areas, we had to cross water.  The guys would have to take a boat and carry the equipment across that body of water, and then continue the line on the other side.  But in that area in Bastogne, we would run lines during the day, and we would go back to our camp at night and come back the next day and the lines had been cut.  The poles had been sawed off.  And so--
Speaker 1: This was the enemy coming in?
Speaker 2: That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Taking over?
Speaker 2: The Germans were coming in and doing that.  So, we would have to go back and rebuild those lines, rehabilitate them.  So, we had a few of those to happen.
Speaker 1: Well, did you guys have to combat with them when you went back to rebuild?  Or they--with the Germans--or did they just--did the Germans just disappear after they had (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They disappeared, we didn't see them.  But occasionally there were a few incidents of sharpshooters shooting at our men who were up on the poles.  So, they'd have to get down in a hurry.
Speaker 1: And you were one of the men that were up on the poles, weren't you?
Speaker 2: Well, that was part of the job, yeah.  The coldest day in my life, I mean the coldest thing that I remember was on the edge of a severe drop, several hundred feet.  And we had a pole right on the edge of that precipice.  And it was so cold that day that the team that I had, none of my men, wanted to go up there.  Because the further up you went, the harder the wind was blowing.  And the pole was doing one of these numbers, just waving back and forth (laughter).  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Plus, you were a sitting duck for the Germans.
Speaker 2: I'm in charge of the team, so I had to go up and do whatever needed to be done up there.  And I'll never forget that day.  I've never been so cold in all my life (laughter).  The pole was slippery with ice, and gee, it was--that was a day.
Speaker 1: But you still got it done?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got it done, yeah, you don't quit.
Speaker 1: You're still here, so the Germans didn't get you, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you had lookout men (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --in your battalion--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that were looking out for you, too.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531386
Speaker 1: You went all across Europe.  How did--you know, okay, so where was--when you left--125--what was it?  Twenty-five yards, twenty-five feet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, miles, twenty-five miles (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Twenty-five miles?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you went twenty-five miles.  So, how about--where did you--what was the starting point and what was the destination, if there's such thing as a destination in war?
Speaker 2: We started just beyond Utah Beach in France [Normandy, France], and we ended up in Germany, Bremen, Germany.  And we were going up and back and forth in a couple of areas there, retracing our steps and rebuilding or rehabilitating lines, and then continuing on until we got well up into Germany, northern Germany.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of terrain was that?  Because Germany is hilly.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: And mountainous.
Speaker 2: It is.  And as I said, there were bodies of water to cross, so we had to negotiate all of that.  Whatever we ran into, we had to manufacture a way to get around it, across it, or through it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long were you in the--you know, how long did you serve?
Speaker 2: Two and a half years, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what was the whole time like?  So, did you do communications all the while (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All the while.
Speaker 1: --you were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In the [U.S. military] service?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: We were in--well, there's a couple of places.  We were in Belgium at one point, Luxembourg, and we were billeted in a school.  And we were awakened one morning.  Around two o'clock in the morning, our master sergeant was calling and yelling to people to get up and get out, because the place was on fire.  So, we had to evacuate the school in the middle of the night.  That was exciting.  And then we had to move from there to another location, because the place was no longer habitable.
Speaker 1: And was this because the Germans had bombed the place, or was it because (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was an accidental fire, I think.  We were trying to keep warm and had improvised some stoves, and I think one of them got out of hand.
Story_ID: 531387
Speaker 1: Now, you had--all the while, what were you all eating?  I want to know what the life of a soldier was like (laughter).  If you were, you know, out on the battlefield with all this communications equipment, what all did you have with you?  I know you had your tent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --individual tents.  But what all did you have with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, you'd have--our food was K-rations out of the little cans.  And occasionally we would be located where we could start a fire and heat some things; heat some drinks, coffee and so forth.  But it was pretty--and when we got to a place where we had heat and water and that sort of thing, it was a grand day for us, (laughter) after having been in the field and not able to take baths and that sort of thing.  It was like heaven on earth, for a few minutes anyway.
Speaker 1: So, you must have missed home.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: What did you miss most about home?
Speaker 2: Food (laughter).  Mother's [Julia Banks King] cooking.
Speaker 1: And why would you miss your mother's cooking, more so than say some of the other men might have missed theirs?  Because it seems like you remember something about the way your mom did.  She was a--
Speaker 2: She was a--
Speaker 1: --good cook?
Speaker 2: She was a very good cook.  And as a matter of fact, she had restaurants in three locations at various times in Kansas City [Missouri] and Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: She had soul food restaurants?
Speaker 2: Soul food was her specialty (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, she didn't do all the cooking, I know.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: She had to have help, for three of them.
Speaker 2: She had some help.
Speaker 1: But she didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She didn't have three at one time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: There were three different locations for them.
Speaker 1: So she was an entrepreneur?
Speaker 2: She was an entrepreneur.  She was a hardworking lady, yeah.
Speaker 1: I would have had visions of mom's bread and everything else (laughter) in the field.  I think that's what would have gotten me through (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 531388
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to know.  You did do, you made some brave accomplishments when you were in the [U.S.] military, right?  I mean, what I say is you got medals?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And how many medals did you get, and what kind were they?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were four Bronze Stars [Bronze Star Medal] and one Good Conduct Medal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And why, what were the stars for?  What did you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were for the different locations in Europe that we had been to.
Speaker 1: So, tell us what the first one was like when you got your first Bronze Star.  What was it like?
Speaker 2: You know, I hardly remember receiving them.  They weren't given in a ceremony.  They were just passed out to us at different times, with no particular occasion around them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's always strange.
Speaker 2: Well, you're in a war [World War II, WWII] (laughter).  And, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you don't have time for ceremonies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you don't have those things.  You don't get them really until you are on your way out, on your way back home, as happened in our case.
Story_ID: 531389
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now when you reflected back, what was the most memorable experience that you had during the time that you served your country during the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing that always comes back is how cold I was up on top of that telephone pole (laughter).  And it was below zero.  Then we spent, our troop spent several months, seven or eight months, in one location for the first time in Schwanheim, Germany [Schwanheim, Frankfurt, Germany], a small community.  And the quarters were very commodious there; it used to be a mansion or something like that.  But yeah, it had heat and light and warmth, and all of those good things; and meals, hot cooked meals by our chefs.  And while there, we had enough time to become acquainted with the local printer, a German printer.  And we, our company put together a book, a 'History of the 43rd Signal Heavy Construction Battalion.'
Speaker 1: And not to go into too much detail about the book, but just an overall snapshot view of what the book was about?
Speaker 2: The book told of our travels through the various countries and a few of the incidents that occurred along the way.  We lost a couple of men, for instance, in an accident on the Autobahn.  One of the--the Autobahn was a brand new highway system in Germany.  And there was almost no traffic on it, so these three quarter ton trucks that some of the guys were driving just got away from them.  They just traveled so fast, there was no speed limit.  And one of them crashed and two men were killed, because the lumber and the telephone equipment fell on them, and they didn't survive it.
Story_ID: 531390
Speaker 1: Now, these were all, it was a fully all black regiment?  All-black battalion [43rd Signal Heavy Construction Battalion] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, except for the officers.
Speaker 1: Except for the officers?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, did the black soldiers drive--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --these vehicles?
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So did you all experience, while you were in Germany, did you experience any discrimination--race, class, or any type of discrimination that you can recall?
Speaker 2: I can recall only that I was surprised when we were in England, that white American soldiers created some problems for the black troops, and it was purely the result of racism.  They brought the concept of segregation from America to the foreign land, and we were there supposed to be fighting for the same cause.  And that was very distressing.
Speaker 1: But the locals themselves--
Speaker 2: The locals themselves were usually very congenial, especially throughout France and Belgium and Germany.  It depended on how the people felt.
Speaker 1: And the officers?  Were they--how were they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our officers?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, your officers.
Speaker 2: They were mostly, for the most part, they were fairly decent.
Story_ID: 531391
Speaker 1: We were talking about your particular unit [43rd Signal Heavy Construction Battalion], and whether or not you all had, like, hand-to-hand combat like some of the others.  Because you were sort of, not special, but you--communication was extremely important.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you had to be protected to keep the lines open for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did, yeah.
Speaker 1: --communication.
Speaker 2: And we carried rifles and live ammunition, and we posted guards while we slept at night in the field.  And on two occasions, we pulled up into a small German community, and nobody--we couldn't see a soul; nobody was on the street.  And we went into a couple of the homes and the food was still on the table, and cups of coffee was still warm.  These people had left in a hurry.  And we learned that there was a plan to bomb that little town, and that's why these people had left, and we didn't know about it.  But on the road, we saw all of the American servicemen going in the opposite direction, to us.  And we wondered why everybody was such in a rush.  Well, our officer had not gotten the communication that there was a problem in this town.  And we didn't need to be there, so we had to turn around and hightail it out of there.  And fortunately, we did that.
Speaker 1: You did get out in time?
Speaker 2: Yes we got out in time.  But I thought we might have to do some hand-to-hand that day (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is there anything that I might have missed that you can tell us about, you know, your experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, only that there was one incident that really stayed with me a long time.  I was selected as sort of an interpreter for our company, and I would go with the liaison officer.
Speaker 1: And this is German?  You were fluent in German?
Speaker 2: We were--well, I spoke German.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't fluent, but I was, I could make them understand me and I could understand them.
Speaker 1: But you were the interpreter for (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was the interpreter, since I was the only one in this company who did.  So, I was elected to go and make arrangements with the burgermeisters, the mayors of the villages, for our billets.  I'd go ahead to the next twenty-five mile point, and we would make those kinds of arrangements.  Well, we did this in France and--I'm sorry, we were in--this was in and around Bastogne [Belgium].  And we went up one day and ended up in this quaint beautiful village with boutiques all along the road; artwork, and just a lovely little village.  I went back the next day, and all of this convoy is behind us.  And we just drove and drove and drove.  And we didn't see anything; didn't see anything like we had seen the day before.  And the reason was it was all bombed out, it was totally destroyed.  I could not believe the difference overnight.  And that was something that really stayed with me a long time, partly because we had to turn all those people around and bring them back to that same location.  And we finally, we had selected an old church that was empty.  And the roof was gone, and most of the windows were out, but that's where we (laughter) had to stay.  It was the only available place for a group that size.
Story_ID: 531392
Speaker 1: So when you got home, what was that like on your return trip?  We saw you going in and when you're coming back to the United States.
Speaker 2: Well, I think the only thing I remember is getting home (laughter).  I don't remember much around that.  I don't remember any celebrations (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did the Queen Elizabeth [RMS Queen Elizabeth] bring you back, or not?
Speaker 2: No, we came back on a twenty-five or thirty-five footer small boat.  You could reach out and dip your hand in the ocean (laughter).  You know, it would go up and down.  The weather was bad and, oh, that was a miserable trip coming home.
Speaker 1: And how many days was that, about?
Speaker 2: Gee, it must have taken us--I just don't remember.  But it had to be on the same order as the big ship (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Five days or so?
Speaker 2: At least that, and probably a couple more.
Speaker 1: A little more?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you were exposed to the elements?
Speaker 2: Yes, we were (laughter).  We were down in the hold of the ship, the sleeping quarters and so forth.
Speaker 1: But you'd come up during the day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So when you got back on American soil, what was it like?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Any pomp and circumstance?
Speaker 2: No pomp and circumstance, except at home, and the adjustment that you had to make to being back home and getting into the flow of things again.
Speaker 1: Now, there were parades in certain parts of the United States.  Were they not welcoming the soldiers back home?
Speaker 2: In certain parts of the United States, they were.
Speaker 1: But this was more for white soldiers than for black soldiers?
Speaker 2: Well, I just don't remember participating in any, not even as a spectator.  So--
Speaker 1: So, you get back home.  And had things changed as it related to race?
Speaker 2: Not a thing had changed, not a thing.
Speaker 1: And you talked about the incidences where the German soldiers were accepted--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --into places where black soldiers could not go?
Speaker 2: Black soldiers and black officers couldn't go, and yet the prisoners of war, the German prisoners of war in this country were entering the front door of restaurants where American blacks could not enter.
Speaker 1: And this had to be like '44 [1944] or '45 [1945]?  Somewhere around there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was '45 [1945], yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-five [1945].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 531393
Speaker 1: So, after you served your country, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I came home and looked for a job.  And I didn't stay long in Kansas City [Missouri] after that.  I went to, I was in Minneapolis [Minnesota] for a little while, and while I was there I thought I would apply for a job with the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company as a cable splicer.  And went over there and they didn't want me to fill out an application to begin with, because they didn't hire any blacks; they hadn't hired any.  And somehow the Urban League [Minneapolis Urban League, Minneapolis, Minnesota] director learned about that, that I had been up to inquire about a job, he got into the picture.  I didn't know about the politics of the area, you know, I'm from the outside.  But anyway, it ended up that I got a notice from the vice president of the company to come in for an interview.  So I went for the interview, and he wanted me to begin as a grunt, you know, someone at the bottom, where you just hand tools up to the guy who's working.  I said, "No, I'm trained to be a cable splicer, and that's what I want to do.  And I will not accept anything less than that."  He said, "Well, you know, fellows around here don't get to be cable splicers until they've worked for the company for fifteen years.  You have to work up to a cable splicer."  I said, "Well, I'm already trained to be a cable splicer, and I've done it overseas."  Well, they had to say, "Well, we'll talk to you again."  They wanted to call me back for another interview to see if I'd changed my mind, but I didn't.  And I was finally about to leave Minneapolis, and a card came in the mail saying I should report for work.  But I was leaving, I had other plans then.  And so I left (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, they finally relinquished and offered you the position?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  I was on my way out of town the day that that card came.
Speaker 1: And you didn't turn around and go back and take that position?
Speaker 2: I didn't turn around and go back, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, how did you end up in Minnesota?  You just--because you came home.
Speaker 2: No, my wife's [King's first wife, Hortense Leverett Carr] family lived in Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I went there to visit.
Speaker 1: So, you married in-between?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In the [U.S. military] service, or--?
Speaker 2: In the service, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And she was from Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Her family was from Minnesota, but she lived in Kansas City.
Speaker 1: Okay, she lived in Kansas City (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 531394
Speaker 1: So you left Minnesota and--
Speaker 2: Went to Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Cleveland, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yeah, where more of her [King's first wife, Hortense Leverett Carr] family lived.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And that's where, I stayed there for a number of years.  I worked at the VA [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] as a clerk, and then at the post office, and finally became a regular at the post office.  And while I was doing that, I felt like I was too old to go to school.  I was older than the young people in college (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, how old are you now?  You're in your twenties, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I'm in my twenties, but I'd been seeing all of this, and I was a little shaky about remembering how to study and get along with all these young kids.  So, I took a couple of night courses in high school, just to see if I had--to get back in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, this is a person who's, what, put in at least two years of college [at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  And--
Speaker 1: So, your confidence is a little shaky now?
Speaker 2: It was very shaky.  And then after that, I did fine with that.  So, then I started to work at the Cleveland college on a part-time basis until I got in my third year.  And I'm juggling work hours at the post office while I'm attending classes.  And I would have to beg the post office to allow me to come in later and work, you know, and make up the time on the other end, so that I could complete my classes.  And the last year or so of school, I had to spend the days out on Western Reserve's campus [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio].  So, I really had to go to working at the post office at night.  And I did that in order to finish college.
Speaker 1: And what did you major in?
Speaker 2: I was majoring in biology and English.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And zoology, zoology.  So I was getting close to graduation, and started casting about for some meaningful employment.  And I said, well, now, who wants to pay somebody for zoology?  How can I sell this?  (Laughter) I said, I can't sell this.  So, I stayed long enough to get a teaching certificate, and I did a few turns at substitute teaching as soon as I graduated.  That would have been the summer of '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the fall of '52 [1952], I put my application in to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  I said let me get this out of my system.
Speaker 1: So, you went back to the old days when your mom [Julia Banks King] wanted you to be a doctor?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  And I had concentrated on science and chemistry and math, those things in undergrad school, just in case (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That was your zoology background (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That was my zoology background.  And I was accepted at Howard medical school.
Story_ID: 531395
Speaker 1: Well let me ask.  When you were teaching, or when you got your teaching certificate, did you have to do any teacher training?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had to teach?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it--was it called--what was it called then when you were getting your degree?
Speaker 2: Practice teaching.
Speaker 1: Practice teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Now did you spend a semester, or how long did you have to spend out in the field?
Speaker 2: A semester.  And I was at, I was telling my wife [Lois Weaver King] that I remember the name of that school, Patrick Henry Junior High School [Patrick Henry School, Cleveland, Ohio].  And I was, I had done my practice teaching there, and that was one of the places I went to for substitute teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did the students make you decide that it was time to go back?
Speaker 2: They did.  I went in the classroom one day in the winter, snow on the ground.  There was a second level classroom, and there was a little slanted roof outside the windows, piled high with snow.  The room was a wreck.  Kids were throwing snowballs in the room, and in walks this substitute teacher, brand new on the job (laughter).  And these kids had gone crazy.  (Laughter) That was, that was an experience.  It was a job just getting the room settled down, to begin to talk about anything.  And of course, not much learning went on that day.  And then another thing that convinced me that maybe this wasn't what I wanted to do was when they sent me out to be a substitute for a music teacher (laughter).  And I'm like--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Now, how was that?  Well, the first one was for science, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: The first was science, was biology.  (Laughter) And then this time it was for music.  I said, "Okay."  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So how was that, how was that experience?
Speaker 2: That was really an experience.  I don't know how I got through that day.  But that's the way it was then.  I said, well, maybe I'd better go and see what medical school is all about (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, by this time you've stopped working for the post office, right?
Speaker 2: Let's see.
Speaker 1: Or are you still working for the post office?
Speaker 2: I worked for the post office until I left for medical school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you applied--
Speaker 2: When I graduated from college [Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], I was still employed at the post office.
Speaker 1: So you were working at night?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At the post office?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And then substitute teaching during the day?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: That wasn't much money, either, compared to the post office money, was it?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, you definitely wasn't going to use teaching as a career change.  So--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: All right, so you decided to apply at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you got accepted?
Speaker 2: I got accepted.
Speaker 1: So, the fall of 1952 you entered Howard's doors?
Speaker 2: I sure did.
Speaker 1: Now, how was--this was before Brown v. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  This is--so all these schools are black that you were substituting in?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, they were mixed schools?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Patrick Henry Junior High in Cleveland [Ohio] was an integrated school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure was.  Because, yeah, I remember some of the children very well, because we had a good time together.
Story_ID: 531396
Speaker 1: So, you enter Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And what was the first year of medical school like at Howard at that particular time?
Speaker 2: Well, from a student's point of view, it was new, and I was worried about getting through and passing everything.  It was, it was all work and no play. Study (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, how old do you think the medical school was at this particular time?  How long had it been in existence?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  I should know that, but I don't.
Speaker 1: Because at that time there weren't many black medical schools, were there?  You had Howard and--
Speaker 2: There were four, four medical schools then.
Speaker 1: Did you apply to all four, or just to Howard only?
Speaker 2: Just to Howard, just Howard.
Speaker 1: Did you have to take--let me back up.  Did you have to take the medical college admissions test?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.
Speaker 1: Oh, you still had to take that then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, you prepared for that?  Did you have to take a prep course, or you just--?
Speaker 2: We didn't know about prep courses in those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: You just did well on that test.
Speaker 2: Well, well enough to get into medical school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let's get back.  You're at Howard, and a first year student?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What were classes like?  Were they rigorous?  I mean, you said they were.  But, well, for the first year, what basic classes did you take?  You didn't take anatomy the first year?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I don't think we did get into anatomy immediately, no.  I took the basic science courses: bacteriology, biochemistry, and we had some basic, some basic anatomy, yeah.
Speaker 1: Like physiology, or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, how did you, how did you feel entering medical school?  Because you said that you were reluctant to go back to school and finish up, because you felt you were older than most of the students.
Speaker 2: Well, when I got to medical school, I was older than most of those students too (laughter).
Speaker 1: But that didn't bother you?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't bother me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, too, most of the students who were going to medical school, were they from well to do families?  Or, you know, what were your classmates like?  What kind of mix was that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, many of them were from families of physicians; parents, grandparents, and so forth.  And they were from all walks of life.  It was a pretty good mix of students.  So, there were sixty-six members in our class.  And--
Speaker 1: And most of them, did most of them graduate also with you?  Or had that kind of slimmed down by graduation time?
Speaker 2: I think we only lost two, two people.
Speaker 1: Are you serious?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  The final number of graduating--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was sixty-six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We started with a few more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there were a couple of kids who dropped by the wayside.
Speaker 1: That was excellent.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you tackled the subject matter the first year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the second year, third year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No problems?
Speaker 2: No problems.
Speaker 1: You did--well, how were the grades?
Speaker 2: The grades were pretty good.
Story_ID: 531397
Speaker 1: What was your greatest challenge those first two years [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I think it was bacteriology.  And it was the instructor who was the challenge.  We called her Mother Moore [Ruth Ella Moore] (laughter).  That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was a female?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who taught bacteriology?  Now, that was different, wasn't it?  Weren't most of the teachers male in medical school, or am I wrong?
Speaker 2: No, no, most of them were.  The majority of them were.  But she was an excellent teacher.
Speaker 1: And did she have a doctorate?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was it about Mother Moore that presented such a challenge?
Speaker 2: She just demanded a certain standard of conduct in her classes.  And she let you know that when you walked in the door the first day, and then she reminded you along the way.  She was just sort of stern with everybody, but we all loved her.  She was, she was good.
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to go to med school, but I was always afraid of anatomy.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And then--but how was anatomy?  I just have to ask that.
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, anatomy was great.  We, we, we had a--oh, gee, our instructor [William Montague Cobb] was--had a reputation for--we used to do anatomy walks, where they would put out different anatomical parts on a table, isolated, and no orientation for them.  And this was the way an exam was given.  And the reputation that the instructor had was he would wear high galoshes, boots--wear the boots and play the violin (laughter) while you were trying to concentrate on this anatomy.  (Laughter) He was very interesting; a brilliant man, a brilliant man.
Speaker 1: He knew it was going to take a while, huh?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: So, what year was this that you took anatomy?  Was it the second year?
Speaker 2: I think it was the second year, yeah, yeah.  And that was the way the final exam was given, just like that.
Speaker 1: And you had to put the whole part together?
Speaker 2: You had to identify it.
Speaker 1: Is this muscles?  Bones?
Speaker 2: Bones, mostly bones, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had to name all those bones?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, my god.  So you didn't have cadavers?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, we had cadavers also.
Speaker 1: But that was, that was a part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was part of the exam, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when we--on another day we would have the cadaver, and you would identify whatever the instructors had isolated.  That was your exam.
Speaker 1: And this was a medical doctor?  He was--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a trained medical doctor?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because most of the people who seem to care for the cadavers weren't--let's say they always wanted to be medical doctors, but they didn't make it.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But in this particular case, they were all medical doctors?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that's, that's interesting.  All right, so after--well, what subject presented the greatest challenge to you other than bacteriology?  Or was that it?  That was the main one that challenged you most (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think so, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 531398
Speaker 1: So did you know what field of medicine you wanted to practice in, during the time you were in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't really make that kind of decision until my internship.  We did a rotating internship in those days.  That is, we rotated through every service: OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology], urology, internal medicine, pediatrics.  We went through all of those.  And it kind of helps you define what it is you thought you might like to do.  And I settled on either internal medicine, or psychiatry, or general surgery.  And ended up in urology.
Speaker 1: What were the qualifications to get to an internship?
Speaker 2: Just to have graduated from medical school, and from an accredited school.
Speaker 1: And did you have a selection as to which hospitals you would go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --to do the internship, or not?
Speaker 2: No, you put your name in for the places you think you'd like to go.  And then you'd wait to hear if you were selected to go there.
Speaker 1: So, how many choices did you entertain?  Or did you just--
Speaker 2: I just signed up for Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And this was the one at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: On Howard's campus?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531399
Speaker 1: Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] in the early '50s [1950s], did you have any--well, this was the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any contact with the students who were just attending undergrad [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: The location, the geographic location of the medical school was sort of distant from the main campus.  It was just up the hill to it, but we rarely got up there except to go to the dining--the cafeteria was on the main campus.  And that's where we did meet and see a lot of the students in the other parts of the university.
Speaker 1: And do you know who was president at that time of the university?
Speaker 2: Dr. Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek] was the president.
Speaker 1: All right.  And who was over the medical school?  Do you remember who was over the medical school at that time?
Speaker 2: Dr. Johnson was the president of the medical school, Joseph Johnson [Joseph L. Johnson].
Speaker 1: Did you have any encounters with Dr. Johnson?
Speaker 2: Dr. Johnson interviewed me for medical school.  We had, some of us had to meet to be interviewed early on, and we met him in Chicago [Illinois] at the University of Chicago.  And that was my first meeting with him.
Speaker 1: So he came to you?
Speaker 2: He came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Right, he came--
Speaker 2: And there were a number of students who came from all over the country to meet him at that location.
Speaker 1: So, how was that?  I mean, the questions that he asked, do you remember either one or two, or just some of them, like how the interview went?
Speaker 2: The questions were sort of general; what your interests were, and what you thought you might want to do with a medical education, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: But this had a bearing on whether you were accepted or not?
Speaker 2: Oh, it must have.  (Laughter) Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you remember one of your answers that might--can you remember the answer that might have, you know, put you over the line and given you a little bit more--
Speaker 2: The only thing I remember is I did tell him that I was interested in helping people, and seeing that people enjoyed good health, and words to that effect.
Speaker 1: But did you know instantly that you probably were accepted?  Or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know until I got the letter saying that I had.  He gave no clue (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of man was he?
Speaker 2: Gee, he was, he was very precise, immaculately dressed.  And when we got to school we learned that that's what he expected of his students.  That they dress a certain way and at all times look like gentlemen.  But he was very open, and didn't challenge us too much.
Story_ID: 531400
Speaker 1: Well, I asked how many females were in the class [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] then?
Speaker 2: There were about five.
Speaker 1: And they did graduate?
Speaker 2: They did graduate, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you were talking a little bit about Dr. Johnson [Joseph L. Johnson], and how you actually got a chance, how he interviewed you.
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we talked about some of the questions that he asked, but you did get accepted.  Now, how was graduation from med school?  Was that a grand occasion, or how was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a grand occasion for all of us.  It was like a weight lifted off your shoulders (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was four long years?
Speaker 2: Four long years, yes.
Speaker 1: So, burning the midnight oil and lamps and everything else.
Speaker 2: All of that, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did the family do when they came up for graduation?  Who all was there, and how did they feel?
Speaker 2: My mother [Julia Banks King], dad [Delutha King, Sr.], sister [Veatrice King Gray], and uncle were there.
Speaker 1: Your mother's brother?
Speaker 2: My mother's brother, uh-huh.  They were excited and joyful, and sharing in the celebration.
Speaker 1: Were there any exercises that you all had for graduating from med school that was different from what the undergrads were going through?
Speaker 2: It was pretty much the same, cap and gowns.  And then you're called up when your name is called to receive your diploma.
Speaker 1: Did they state where you would be doing your internship at that particular time, or not?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, you went to Freedmen's [Freedmen's Hospital] for the internship?
Speaker 2: Right, the old Freedmen's Hospital.  It's now called the Howard University Hospital [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: But it's still in operation?
Speaker 2: Well, it's in a different facility now.  They built a new hospital.
Speaker 1: But it's still on Howard's campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: It's on Howard's campus.  And I don't know what the old Freedmen's Hospital is used for now, but the building is still there.
Speaker 1: So, that's a historical marker.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531401
Speaker 1: We had talked a little bit about the anatomy instructor [William Montague Cobb].  We couldn't get his name, but what were some of the attributes that he had and some of his past accomplishments other than being an accomplished violinist?
Speaker 2: He was an anthropologist, an accomplished musician, a violinist.  He was what we called a brain.  (Laughter) There was nothing that he did not know something about; a very bright man.  He was just, he was able to add so much to the subject, not only talk about anatomy, but how things evolved to the point that they were.  And I think the first day in class, he introduced us to steatopygia (laughter).  That's the name of the backside of African women.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that the gluteus maximus too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter).  But I'll never forget that term, because of the way he introduced it, and told us a little bit about it.  But he was a very, he made the subjects very interesting.  And he was always encouraging us to go to the free things in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  "Go to the library, go to the museum.  Enjoy these things, they're free."  We were worried about getting through his course, not many of us got down to those places (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you said that Dr. Johnson [Joseph L. Johnson] wanted the students to look a particular way.  So, he encouraged a certain type of--
Speaker 2: A shirt and tie.
Speaker 1: Every day?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Starched?
Speaker 2: It should have been starched (laughter).
Speaker 1: Every day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And that was the dress code that he had quote, unquote enforced.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yes, it wasn't written anywhere, but you know, you got the message from the classes that preceded you, that you would be looked askance if you came in unkempt (laughter).
Speaker 1: And shoes had be shined, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that being emphasized so much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He didn't care about that part, just as long as you had--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they needed to be clean, yeah.
Story_ID: 531402
Speaker 1: Internship, that's always a lot of time.  That's around the clock, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, twenty-four to thirty-six hours on, and twelve off (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you did get a chance to take a nap?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, sometimes.
Speaker 1: Out of twenty-four hours, sometimes?
Speaker 2: Sometimes, yeah.  It depended on how busy you were, or what service you were on.  In the emergency room, you had to come whenever they called.  And it was, it was pretty taxing physically.  And it's an interesting contrast nowadays when the kids coming through the rotations have forty hour shifts.
Speaker 1: Forty hours?
Speaker 2: Forty hours a week.
Speaker 1: Forty hours a week?  How many were you all doing a week?  It was twenty-four?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, how many?  There was no attention paid to that kind of consideration.
Speaker 1: Whoa!
Speaker 2: None whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Now, in contrast, how was Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] different from some of the other hospitals in the district?
Speaker 2: It may not have had all of the amenities that some of the larger hospitals did, but I remember it so well, because the quality of care that those patients got was equal to any that anybody got anywhere.  And for a long time after I left Washington [D.C.], I told my wife [Lois Weaver King] and family that if I got sick, that's where I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: To Freedmen's?
Speaker 2: To Freedmen's Hospital, because I knew the people there cared about the patients, and would do the best for them.
Speaker 1: I know you had some photos of the nurses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --dressed immaculately.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And attentive--
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: --to their calls for duty.
Speaker 2: They certainly were.
Speaker 1: And were the doctors and interns just as devoted?
Speaker 2: Just as devoted.  And one of the nice things about all of our instructors is that they, they were very interested in you.  Because when you left there you represented them, and they wanted you to be equipped to do that, and the best they could make you.
Story_ID: 531403
Speaker 1: Now when you were doing the internship [at Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], you were assigned to certain doctors, is that correct?  Or who were you assigned to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were assigned to certain services, and whoever the doctor was in charge of the service at that period was who you--was your-- mentored you at that time.
Speaker 1: And you were getting graded all along?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did some people actually flunk an internship?
Speaker 2: I don't remember anybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not that--
Speaker 2: --ever flunking their internship.
Speaker 1: If you made it that far, you definitely don't need to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no point in flunking if you get that far (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how long did the internship last?
Speaker 2: A year.
Speaker 1: And that's the same as it is now, approximately a year?
Speaker 2: Well, the rotating internships are not so common anymore.  They tend to be a little more specialized, even the internships.  So, people have a good idea what direction they want to go, and they will rotate in that particular area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And after the internship, any amazing stories that you can remember from those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  During the internship, I have some vivid memories of accident cases that I saw.  Young people driving fast, and just terrible, terrible injuries that they'd come in with.  That was something that really troubles you.
Speaker 1: So, you were in the emergency room?
Speaker 2: I was in the emergency room, yeah.
Story_ID: 531404
Speaker 1: Then after you finished the internship, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Applied for a residency in urology.
Speaker 1: So, by this time you'd made up your mind what you were going to go with (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I made up my mind, right, yeah, yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: And this is surgery also?
Speaker 2: This involved surgery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I spent my urology residency at Howard, at Freedmen's [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] also, under Dr. R. Frank Jones [Richard Francis Jones].
Speaker 1: R. Frank Jones?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You didn't forget him, huh?
Speaker 2: I didn't forget him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of doctor was he, I mean personality-wise?
Speaker 2: His personality was very stern, very stern.  But he was, he had a heart of gold.  But you didn't learn that until you knew him a real long time (laughter).  But he ran a tight ship.
Speaker 1: And how many years was residency?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years, okay.
Speaker 2: Four.  Four years, four years.
Speaker 1: Was that because of surgery, or was it--is it normally like two or three years?  But--
Speaker 2: The first year is--you rotate--is general surgery.  And the next three years are all urology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And any cases that stand out with you?  Or any situations, or any memorable events that might have happened during the residency?
Speaker 2: Dr. Jones had devised an operation doing a hernia repair along with a prostatectomy, a suprapubic prostatectomy, taking the prostate out through the abdomen.  He had devised an operation that he wrote up.  He and Dr. Syphax [Burke Syphax], a general surgeon, worked together to develop it.  They were early pioneers in that approach, an abdominal approach to hernia repair along with a prostatectomy.  And we spent quite a bit of time with him doing that kind of operation.
Speaker 1: Now this one is--did he get a patent, or did he get a copyright, or anything on that technique?  And is it still used today?  Or--
Speaker 2: It's still used, but I'm not familiar with whether he did get a patent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is he given credit for that technique (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --in the medical journals and--?
Speaker 2: He wrote it, the two of them did.  So it's, it's a matter of record that they were early pioneers in that operation.
Story_ID: 531405
Speaker 1: So after residency at Freedmen's [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Dr. Jones [Richard Francis Jones]--our available surgery was a bit limited at Freedmen's.  So, he suggested that I spend a little time at the VA Hospital in Tuskegee, Alabama [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus].  So I went there, and the urologist who was there had died.  So when I got there, the urology service was almost nonexistent.  There were some beds assigned, but very few people in it.  And so I was the urologist for the hospital, and I learned later I was the only urologist of color in the State of Alabama at that time.  And we worked hard, and when I left there we had taken up all of the beds assigned to urology and spilled over into the orthopedics ward.  That's how busy we were.
Speaker 1: So, were you accepting patients from all over the state or something?  Or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right.  These were veterans.
Speaker 1: These were veterans.  But they would come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they came from all over, all over the state, yeah.
Story_ID: 531406
Speaker 1: Now, for those who might view this tape.  What is urology, and what is an urologist?  What is a medical doctor who specializes in urology?
Speaker 2: He deals with the urinary tract, the kidneys, the bladder, and the tubes that lead between those two, and the prostate gland in males.  And we treat females, we treat all age groups, from the pediatric newborns through geriatrics.  And we deal with various problems; incontinence, for instance, which affects males and females, but particularly females in later life especially.
Speaker 1: So, what would be the difference between a practicing urologist who is a medical doctor, versus a urologist who is a surgeon?  Or is there a difference?
Speaker 2: Oh, the urologist is also a surgeon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He does surgery, open surgery; removing kidneys, working on them, doing certain repairs on them, removing stones from them.  Much of that part nowadays is done without making an incision.  Things have changed so much.  Lithotripsy, where stones are shattered and reduced to sand, and you don't have to operate on everybody who has a stone anymore.
Speaker 1: You just have them pass them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, help them pass them.
Speaker 1: By breaking them up?
Speaker 2: Breaking them up, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, let's see.  Do you, does the urologist get into transplants, the kidney transplants?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, we did a few harvestings of kidneys from cadavers for transplant people.  They would come and pick the kidneys up and take them wherever for transplantation.
Speaker 1: But this almost, this had to be immediately after a person passed?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --they would do that.
Speaker 2: They had to make--do the paperwork of course, and get the family's permission.  And so I was a part of that system early on when I got to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: But when you were at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], and even at Freedmen's [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], this was not during the time when transplants were as popular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, that's right, they weren't.
Speaker 1: --as they are today.  So, did you have to do additional training afterwards to actually start working in the field with transplants, kidney transplants?
Speaker 2: My, my role was simply to harvest, to go into a person who had died recently and just remove the kidney.  And there were certain guidelines in the way that you would take care of the material to prepare it for transplantation, but no special training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't have any anyway.
Story_ID: 531407
Speaker 1: Tuskegee [Alabama] at that time--so we're like early, are we early '60s [1960s] now?
Speaker 2: Early '60s [1960s].  It was '61 [1961] when we went to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: That's long training (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you're out of your twenties now, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was out of my twenties when I got to medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--how was Tuskegee during these days, during the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  This is early on in the Civil Rights Movement around the country.  Tuskegee had literally been closed down by boycotts, because the local administration was so resistant to any kind of involvement of black folks in politics, and anything that had to do with economics.  They were just totally excluded.  And they were in the midst of boycotts which had closed down much of the downtown area.  And we had to go from Tuskegee to places in, as far as Columbus, Georgia, or to Montgomery, Alabama, and to Auburn, Alabama for shopping sometimes, just for groceries and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: When you say the town was closed down, it was just deserted, so to speak?
Speaker 2: No, the businesses were shuttered, because they, nobody was buying from them.  Nobody in the black community was buying from them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were--
Speaker 2: So as a result, they had to close (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were boycotted?
Speaker 2: They were boycotted, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, there was definitely a boycott?
Speaker 2: There was definitely a boycott, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how was Tuskegee's campus [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: The school's campus was flourishing, it was doing well.  It was a beautiful campus, and this boycott did not affect the students too much.  There were barbershops available, and beauty parlors.
Speaker 1: On campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But then--and there was one black-owned grocery store in town that you could go to.  But--
Speaker 1: Other than that--
Speaker 2: Other than that--
Speaker 1: That was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you had to go somewhere else.
Speaker 1: Now, you were at the VA Hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, how was that connected?  It was just in the City of Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and not necessarily close to Tuskegee's campus?  This was--
Speaker 2: No, it was a little bit out from the heart of the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But immediately when you left the VA property, you were in Tuskegee, and you had to drive through Tuskegee and past the campus, almost to go anywhere.
Story_ID: 531408
Speaker 1: So how was it being the only black urologist in the state (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --of Alabama?  What did you, what did you encounter, especially during this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Since I was employed at the VA Hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], it didn't really affect me that I was the only one in the State of Alabama at the time.  So, I didn't feel it.
Speaker 1: Now, there were other urologists on board on the staff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were other urologists.
Speaker 1: --at the VA Hospital.  So, how did you--
Speaker 2: Well, the only other urologist was one who came as a consultant from Montgomery [Alabama].  He would rotate.  He would come down at intervals and spend one or two days with me to help me with any problem cases I might have.  Since I was there to increase my information about urology, he was sort of a teacher of mine.
Speaker 1: So, this worked fine?
Speaker 2: That worked fine, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you were it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was it.  When he left, I was it (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you said that the hospital, the beds had expanded?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had increased--
Speaker 2: There were--
Speaker 1: --the number of patients had increased.
Speaker 2: I think we had something like thirty or thirty-four beds in the urologist service, and those beds were all full of patients.  They were empty of patients when I got there, and over time, we kept the beds full and kept the operating room going busy.  And we needed overflow beds, so we--orthopedics was right across the hall from our ward, so we filled half of their beds.
Speaker 1: So, what kind of cases were you mostly seeing?  I'm trying to get an idea of what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of these were male veterans with prostate problems.  They had renal--kidney stones, tumors, kidney tumors, bladder tumors, and enlarged prostates.  There were a lot of those in those days.  We don't see them much anymore.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any females?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember if I saw any female veterans.  I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Because there aren't, weren't--well, I can't say that there were weren't many females who served and had, you know, veteran status afterwards.  I can't say that, because there were females serving in the [U.S.] military (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But you don't remember very many, if any at all?
Speaker 2: If any, yeah.  I can't remember a single female.
Story_ID: 531409
Speaker 1: But I was also a consultant to a local private hospital, John A. Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama], which was on the campus of, it was not quite on the campus of the university [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  It was where I would do surgery and see patients in consultation.
Speaker 2: Now, what kind of hospital was this?  Was this a city (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was a private general--
Speaker 2: A private general hospital?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: It was a general hospital for the Tuskegee [Alabama] area?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And it was a white hospital?
Speaker 1: Black.
Speaker 2: It was a black hospital?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know Tuskegee had a black hospital.
Speaker 1: A very famous location, because they used to have a John A. Andrew clinic every so often.  I believe it was an annual affair, where physicians would come from all over the country to a three day clinic.  And it was their practice to do surgery in their field, in their field of specialization.  So, the local doctors in Tuskegee would collect these patients and bring them to the hospital for that timeframe, just to be seen by our specialists.
Speaker 2: And what was the name of the hospital again?
Speaker 1: John A. Andrew.
Speaker 2: So, the name has to be significant, too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was named for someone who--it's a namesake?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: But that was the only actual black hospital in Tuskegee, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And was it affiliated with the university in any way?
Speaker 1: Only that it saw students from the university.
Story_ID: 531410
Speaker 1: So, how long did you stay at Veterans [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And then where did you go?
Speaker 2: From there, I went to, we went to Atlanta [Georgia].  And we came here on our way to Los Angeles, California.
Speaker 1: And you say we, who was that?
Speaker 2: My wife and I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1961?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So when did you, when did you marry?
Speaker 2: We, Lois [Lois Weaver King] and I married in 1960.
Speaker 1: That's right, you married--I should say I was born on your marriage day (laughter).  I was going to say you married on my birthday.
Speaker 2: How about that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, I can say that.  You married on my birthday, September 3rd.
Speaker 2: September 3rd, right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960].  Because I was born before '60 [1960], so I can say you all did take my birthday (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, so tell us about when you met Lois.  If you married in 1960, this is before Tuskegee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is before VA Hospital.  So, how did you meet Lois?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't looking, and she said she wasn't looking (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, wait a minute.  Nobody was looking?
Speaker 2: Nobody was looking.
Speaker 1: How did a wedding come out of that one (laughter)?
Speaker 2: But I went to a meeting in--well, first, I had helped to establish a chapter of SAMA, Student American Medical Association [American Medical Student Association], on the campus of Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And--
Speaker 1: And this was while you were in med school?
Speaker 2: While I was in med school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And as a delegate representing our school, I went to a meeting, a national meeting of the Student American Medical Association in Chicago [Illinois].  And while there, a boyhood friend of mine, who was a lawyer practicing in Chicago, invited me to a little affair.  And he invited his girlfriend, and her girlfriend was Lois.  And they persuaded Lois to come to that little gathering, which was in a hotel that he was managing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: Your friend?
Speaker 2: My friend, yeah, Leroy Vital.  And that's how we met.  And as they say, the rest is history.
Speaker 1: You said neither one was looking?
Speaker 2: Neither one was looking (laughter).
Speaker 1: There was a change when you all met, then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, must have been (laughter).
Speaker 1: Y'all started looking then, huh, at each other (laughter)?
Story_ID: 531411
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit more about the SAMA.
Speaker 2: Student American Medical Association [American Medical Student Association] was an organization on college--medical school campuses around the country.  And it was a strategy of the American Medical Association to enroll members for the AMA while they were still in medical school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was essentially what that was all about.
Speaker 1: All right.  So this was a national organization?
Speaker 2: It was a national organization (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was a student--okay?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --while I was at that national meeting, I was elected to their national--they call them counselors, national counselors.  But they're equivalent to a board of trustees, a national board representing our school.
Speaker 1: Now, you must also tell us how many blacks were on this national council (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) One, and I was it.
Story_ID: 531412
Speaker 1: So, we're going back to, well, we went back to the Student American Medical Association [American Medical Student Association].  Well, we were going to pick up on Dr.--the anatomy instructor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you had.  You had his name.
Speaker 2: Dr. Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb] was the man.
Speaker 1: And you said that he also did--I mean he taught in other countries?
Speaker 2: As a visiting lecturer at universities around the United States.  And one place I knew of was Japan, and I think there were other international visitations that he made, teaching and lecturing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he also wrote for a national--
Speaker 2: He was the editor of the Journal of the National Medical Association for a number of years.  So, he has quite a history there.  He's an anthropologist in addition to being an M.D., medical doctor.
Speaker 1: Now, we even talked about some of the other Ph.D.'s and M.D.'s from Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] during that time.  And you stated that the president was retired, Dr. Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek].
Speaker 2: Dr. Cheek, yes.
Speaker 1: Is he still alive?
Speaker 2: He's still alive, yeah.
Speaker 1: And retired to North Carolina?
Speaker 2: That's what we understand, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And Dr. Johnson [Joseph L. Johnson], we don't know where Dr. Johnson--he's probably deceased about now, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He is deceased.
Speaker 1: He's deceased by now?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531413
Speaker 1: You finish Tuskegee [Alabama], and then we were moving on from after you left the VA Hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus] in Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: Right.  We moved to Atlanta [Georgia], and as I said, we were on our way to Los Angeles [California].  I'd been out there and made arrangements for office space and hospital privileges, and so forth.  And my classmate, Louis Brown [Louis C. Brown], suggested I just stop and visit with him on the way to Los Angeles.  Well, we stopped and visited, and we've been here ever since (laughter).  We never got to California.
Speaker 1: So when you settled in Atlanta, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I had my first office space in Louis Brown's office, at 985 Hunter [Hunter Street; Martin Luther King Jr. Drive].  He was an internist, and that's where I started my practice, a solo practice of urology.  And in 1968, a group of investors, and I was one of them, got together to put up a multispecialty medical building.  And ours was only the second one like that in the City of Atlanta, from our community.  The first one was built by a colleague and a friend, Dr. Warner, Clinton Warner [HistoryMaker Dr. Clinton Warner], a general surgeon who had built the first building dedicated to a medical practice.  And I spent the rest of my career at that address, 2600 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you leave the VA Hospital and then you move to Atlanta and start your own practice?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was the difference between working for an established hospital and then being solo?
Speaker 2: The paycheck (laughter).  You knew you'd get a check when you had a job.  In private practice, there was no guarantees.  So, you had to do what the traffic would bear.  And I made house calls for Louis Brown (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, he had, he was an internist?
Speaker 2: He was an internist, so he was seeing patients at home.  He was one of the--well, many of the people made house calls in those days.  But there weren't jobs with public health available to us in those days, so we had to just find a way to make a living until you practiced.
Speaker 1: Well, did you connect with any of the hospitals here?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: To work, you know, like work, do the work at the hospital?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Or to have them filter patients to you after they had been--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No such thing as that?
Speaker 2: When you got on hospital staffs, you would cover the emergency room, and that would be--but then there were only a couple of hospitals available to us when we got to town.  And that was Hughes Spalding Hospital [Hughes Spalding Pavilion; Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], and let's see--'64 [1964]--yeah, Southwest Hospital [Southwest Atlanta Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was called Holy Family [Holy Family Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time.  And it was the first hospital in the Southeast to be integrated, with physicians as well as patients.
Speaker 1: And that was Holy Family?
Speaker 2: Holy Family.
Speaker 1: Holy Family?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, you say--what is it called now?
Speaker 2: Southwest Hospital.
Speaker 1: Southwest Hospital?
Speaker 2: Southwest Hospital and Medical Center [Atlanta, Georgia].  And it is closed.
Speaker 1: Oh, boy.  When did it--did they close--when did they close?
Speaker 2: In 2005.  It is in limbo, really.  A group of physicians bought it out of bankruptcy.  But they are trying to open it again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Open up, all right.
Speaker 2: --and change the name.  They call it Legacy hospital [Legacy Medical Center of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia] now.
Story_ID: 531414
Speaker 1: So how did--when you got here, how many urologists did they have?  Or, were you again--
Speaker 2: There was one here.  Dr. Hezekiah Lewis [Hezekiah K. Lewis] was already here.  And he had an office in that building I mentioned that Dr. Warner [HistoryMaker Dr. Clinton Warner] put together.  They were partners, as a matter of fact.  And I was the second urologist in town.
Speaker 1: So did you all bump heads, or was there enough business for everybody (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, there was plenty (laughter).  We had no problems in that department at all.
Speaker 1: Now, you were--still are a surgeon?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So did you do surgery--you had to do surgery at some hospital.  So, how did you work that out?
Speaker 2: There were still a handful of black hospitals remaining.  At one time there were about six, there were six or eight black hospitals in Atlanta [Georgia].  And in '66 [1966], it was when the hospitals were integrated by federal law, and then white hospitals opened up to black physicians as well as patients.  And so we got on those staffs and were in those emergency rooms, and so we began to see a few more patients.
Speaker 1: Now, before 1966 then, you, as a black physician, surgeon, and medical doctor and urologist--you were only allowed to practice in a black hospital?
Speaker 2: Right, in Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now, you had left Tuskegee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And went to the VA [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Now in the VA Hospital, you saw everybody?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you had to come to a segregated environment?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  There were a couple of--I mentioned black hospitals.  There was a Harris Hospital [William A. Harris Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], a McLendon Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia], and they were all black.  They were small necessarily, and that's where I did my surgery.  And then there was Hughes Spalding Hospital [Hughes Spalding Pavilion; Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], which had black and white physicians on staff, but only black patients came to the hospital.
Speaker 1: Now, the hospital could have white--the black hospitals could have white physicians, but the white hospitals could not have black physicians?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did 1966 change that?
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: Where you could serve on either/or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And all?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But by then a lot of black hospitals had closed, you were saying.
Speaker 2: They closed immediately after, after these hospitals were integrated.  It was almost like a vacuum.
Speaker 1: It was just sucked up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sucked all--all the business was sucked out of that community.
Story_ID: 531415
Speaker 1: Now, where did you get, in solo practice, where did you get most of your patients from?  Were they referrals, or were they ones that you actually advertised to get, like through the hospitals?  Or word of mouth (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were referrals.  We got some through the emergency room at Hughes Spalding Hospital [Hughes Spalding Pavilion; Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia].  But mostly they were referrals from physicians out in the community who needed an urologist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you active in organizations, medical organizations or community organizations, to get yourself recognized in the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: When you moved here?
Speaker 2: Sure, uh-huh.  The Atlanta Medical Association was our local medical group.  I joined that and served as president of that at one time.  The National Medical Association, I was a member of that, and would make the meetings, the annual meetings that they had around the country.  And we had a urology section in the National Medical, and served as chairman of that urology section for a time.
Story_ID: 531416
Speaker 1: I think one thing that we really missed--and I don't think you could practice at all until you passed some of these boards, right, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  You had to pass the state medical exam.  But I had gotten my first license in Maryland, and I was able to use reciprocity between Alabama and Maryland, and Georgia and Maryland.
Speaker 1: So, where did you take your first board?
Speaker 2: In Maryland, Baltimore.
Speaker 1: What year?  Was it right out of--?
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957], when I was an intern.
Speaker 1: An intern?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And how many days was that?  How many hours was that, sitting for that board?
Speaker 2: I think it involved two days, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was a lot of preparation right there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, we were fresh out of school.
Speaker 1: So everything was fresh then?
Speaker 2: Everything was fresh then, yeah.
Speaker 1: But a lot of students don't pass, regardless.  Some people are just not adept, you know, not good with taking tests.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But you passed yours?
Speaker 2: Yes, thank you.
Speaker 1: Now, is that testing every year, or is there testing every so often?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or is there testing as it relates to specialty?
Speaker 2: There's, there's testing related to every aspect of medicine these days, periodically.  Some go as long as ten years; you have to renew your specialty license, specialty certificate.  And I think that's the way it is with urology.  And then there are, of course, continuing medical education courses that you must have each renewal period for your license.  You don't get your license until you have accumulated forty hours of CME credits, and that's about every two years.
Speaker 1: And these are taken at a hospital or a college or a university?
Speaker 2: All over. Different places, yeah, around the country. Sometimes you travel for them, but a lot of them can happen right here.  And then the Georgia State Medical Association meets annually, and they offer you CME credits for attending there.  That's our state organization.
Story_ID: 531417
Speaker 1: When you set up at Hunter Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], you had to have everything that was needed for an office?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, waiting room furniture and equipment for the different rooms for you were seeing the patients.  How did you do that?  How did you manage that?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I joined my classmate, Louis Brown [Louis C. Brown].  He had all of that set up at that address at 985 [985 Hunter Street].  He had the waiting room and the office needs; all of that equipment was there.  What I had to provide was all of the instruments that an urologist uses; all of our endoscopes and the lighting that went with it, and the operating instruments that we used through the scopes.  I had to provide all of that.  And in those days, I had to carry it from one hospital to the other.  Nowadays, the hospitals purchase that equipment.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you don't--the doctor doesn't have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They don't have to carry--
Speaker 1: --buy it themselves.
Speaker 2: --them any longer.  But all of us had to do that in those early days.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?  Did you eventually sell yours?  Or did you just--?
Speaker 2: Well, it got used up over time in the office, because we were beginning to do those procedures. Cystoscopic examinations, for instance, we could do in the office.  So, we used it until it no longer served us.
Speaker 1: So you kept that space until you moved into the multi-facility?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: And then you had your own space?
Speaker 2: I had my own space.  And then I had to purchase all of the office equipment and everything.  We had quite a large (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, that was like four years you were on Hunter Street?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And then in '68 [1968], you had to buy all that.  So by 1968, this was after 1966.  So, everything was integrated medically--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as it related to facilities?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, did that help, or did that harm the business?
Speaker 2: It, it helped, in that many of the--well, let me back up a little bit to say that, believe it or not, before '66 [1966], black physicians without hospital privileges at the other hospitals had to refer their patients for certain special treatment to the white community.  And they might never see them again, because they would then be referred around among their colleagues.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just as we would do in our community.  But that was the, that was the practice of that day.
Story_ID: 531418
Speaker 1: Now, who else was in the multi-specialty facilities that you all built?  Were there--I mean it was mainly for doctors, medical doctors (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, it was, right.
Speaker 1: So you had--you were the urologist, and you had--
Speaker 2: I was the urologist.  Louis Brown [Louis C. Brown] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was the internist?
Speaker 2: --was there, and Bernard Bridges [Bernard J. Bridges, Jr.] was another internist who was in partnership with Louie Brown.  There was a dentist, Dr. Phillips, Bruce Phillips [E. Bruce Phillips, Sr.], and an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Lindsay Scott [ph.].  A gastroenterologist was there for a while, Ed Layne [Edward Layne].  And I think there was--oh, a pediatrician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was an ear, nose, and throat, Herb Jones [Herbert C. Jones].  And Booker Poe [Booker T. Poe] was the pediatrician, and then there was another pediatrician there, Willie Bland [William H. Bland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that was--we had a fairly decent complement of physicians.  Oh, and James Kelley [James H. Kelley] was a general practitioner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had just about everything covered.
Speaker 2: Just about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how many floors was this building?
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: Three different floors.  And it was--the investors pooled their money together to buy the land and to--
Speaker 2: And put the building up.
Speaker 1: To put the building up?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, was that--did you all get a return on your investment?
Speaker 2: Sort of, but, you know, it was so difficult to get money to put up a building.  Generally you could walk into a bank and sign your name, certain people could, and go about their business.
Speaker 1: But this wasn't the case here?
Speaker 2: That was not the case.  They wanted--oh, gee, we had to sign away our lives and our future grandchildren before they would lend us money.  And then they were not generous in the interest rate, so we had quite a trial.  But eventually, we worked out a plan with the bank to see that each person was allowed to borrow what money they needed and pay it back.
Speaker 1: So, how much was this facility?  Approximately how much did this facility cost in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, it was under a million dollars to put it up, but not much.
Speaker 1: Ooh, that's still--
Speaker 2: That was a lot of money in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed now.  And is that building still in existence today?
Speaker 2: It is still in existence.  And it's now--Grady Hospital [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] bought it, and they have, it's called the Grady clinic these days.  That's the Grady Hospital.
Story_ID: 531419
Speaker 1: Now these were the days when you all were practicing, in the early days.  This was before, let's say insurance and HMOs [health maintenance organization], a lot of--what is it--Medicare?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Medicaid.
Speaker 2: Medicaid, before all that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to see, how did you survive before--
Speaker 2: Before all those?
Speaker 1: Before all of these.
Speaker 2: We survived a lot better than we survived after they came on the scene, I can tell you that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, there wasn't a lot of red tape back then either, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was cut and dry, paid service.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Or service on credit.
Speaker 2: It was you and the patient, you and the patient.  And then with all of these other things coming about, HMOs and so forth, I must confess that I was one of the, I was involved early on with HMOs.  And if I had to do it again, and know what I know now, I probably wouldn't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, this is a little rumor.  I don't know if you actually heard that one.  It was in Dallas [Texas], and the rumor was that these--there were two or three black men who came up with the HMO concept for, like a Kaiser [Kaiser Permanente], like Kaiser HMOs, or socialized--well, for the--had you heard that in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: You hadn't heard that one?  Okay, that was like a little rumor circulating (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --in the Dallas community, that it was their idea.  However, when it caught on they did not get any credit for it, and they didn't get any benefit from it at all.  So this was when it was kind of new, the concept was new.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 531420
Speaker 1: Now this was, '64 [1964] and '68 [1968] was before socialized medicine, too, right?  Before doctors actually grouped together to have a practice (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were just beginning to do that sort of thing.  In our community, Dr. Warner's [HistoryMaker Dr. Clinton Warner] group was one of the early ones that represented a multi-specialty group.  And then when we put the building up, all of these specialties, and ours was the second one devoted to that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, okay.  So you practiced, and then you moved on into the multi-specialty.  Now, then what happened?  I know you kept practicing, and just going--just give us an idea of what life was kind of like, you know, being in the Atlanta [Georgia] community and getting firmly established in the community.
Speaker 2: Well, I was very fortunate.  The community was very good to me, and we had a thriving practice at that address.  And I was very comfortable in the community.  I was on the staffs of too many hospitals, and was involved in, as I indicated, the formation of the first HMO [health maintenance organization] in the State of Georgia as a matter of fact.  There were four of us physicians who got together and made some plans to form an organization.  And then when the government put out the request for proposals for studies for HMOs, we applied at the same time that a competing organization applied, and the competing organization won the bid at that point in time.  But three years later when they decided not to go in that direction, we took our proposal which we had done three years earlier and it was approved for a feasibility study.  And then we moved from the feasibility to the operational stage, and continued to wrestle with all of the bumps and hills that they put in the way, and we were able to overcome them.  And eventually we matured to the HMO, which was a non-profit organization.  And we had--gee, I know we had twenty-five thousand patients in our collection at that time, or something like that.  And we were really at a point in business where you would look to go into the next level, which would require greater financing.  And nobody would lend us the money to make that kind of a stretch.
Speaker 1: What would that have been?  What would have been the next step?
Speaker 2: To a for-profit organization, to a for-profit HMO.  And we couldn't get the financing.  And the management company that we had hired made the bid for us, and they eventually bought our organization.  That was in '85 [1985].  And out of that sale, we were able to form a charitable foundation which was left to us, to those of us who were involved with the board of the non-profit HMO.
Speaker 1: Now, everybody on that board was a physician, or not?
Speaker 2: One was a dentist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Several were dentists.  And the board of the new foundation [Health First Foundation, Atlanta, Georgia] had one dentist, and all the others were physicians.
Speaker 1: Physicians.
Speaker 2: And I served as chairman of that board, still do.  And we've been able to make significant contributions in the form of grants to our community members, who are non-profit organizations, but health-oriented.  And we have been very pleased with that.  We'd like to increase our portfolio so that we can give more money away, but we're working on that.
Story_ID: 531421
Speaker 1: Now, life in Atlanta [Georgia], what was it--I want to ask what were the times like in Atlanta?  How was the rest of the black community--let's say, how did the black community view you and your cadre of medical doctors with the proposal, you know, for this plan, for this health maintenance organization [HMO]?  And after being accepted, how was the community accepting what you were presenting, you know, like the black community, not the white community?  Were they in favor, or were they against?
Speaker 2: Well, there were mixed reactions to the concept, because it was, it was a foreign concept to both the medical black community and to the citizens.  So, an education process was in order, and we did that.  We visited our own organization and groups, making presentations, and explaining what the plan was all about.
Speaker 1: This was to certain segments of the Atlanta community?  Or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, to the--
Speaker 1: Was it like the clergy, or the business community, or--
Speaker 2: To the business community and to the physicians, the medical community.
Speaker 1: Oh, you had backlash from them also?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were some folks who didn't see eye to eye, and there were a few who felt that it was not something that would benefit the community in the long run.   And they were pretty much on target.
Speaker 1: So, after you actually started to educate them, were they a little bit more palatable?
Speaker 2: They did.  Some came around and joined with us and helped to make it a success.
Speaker 1: Now, I know the other community was in favor, is that correct?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The other community, the white community, was not in favor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was not, no.
Story_ID: 531441
Speaker 1: My name is Evelyn Pounds.  And this is a completion interview, the first one from February 1, 2006 [sic. February 17, 2006], and the second February 21, 2006.  Scott Stearns is the videographer and Dwight Campbell is an observing videographer.  Would you state your name, your full name again for us, Dr. King [HistoryMaker Dr. Delutha King]?
Speaker 2: Delutha King.
Speaker 1: And your profession, your career, what you're doing?
Speaker 2: A physician and surgeon.  Urology is my specialty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are you currently doing now?
Speaker 2: Currently, I'm retired from the practice of urology, and serving on the board of the Morehouse School of Medicine [Atlanta, Georgia] board of trustees.  And I chair the Health First Foundation [Atlanta, Georgia], and serve as its executive director.  And I am the immediate past chairman of the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia [Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 531442
Speaker 1: The last time we talked, when we were interviewing and continuing with our session, we were talking about your starting up the HMOs [health maintenance organization] in Georgia.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Starting up the HMOs in Georgia.  So would you just tell us a little bit more about, you know, what all was involved with that process?
Speaker 2: Well, there were four of us who got together and decided that when the call for proposals were sent out from the federal government--this was back in '71 [1971]--proposals for HMOs--we decided we would join that parade, along with the other medical associations.  And we started a Metro Atlanta Health Plan, since a certain kind of organization was required in order to make the application.  So, we did apply, and on our first attempt we were unsuccessfully--a competing medical organization won the award.  Three years later, we made a second application for that proposal, and we were successful that time.  And a feasibility study resulted from that, to determine whether it was feasible to have HMOs in the area.  And this led to the beginning of our journey along that path.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were successful the second time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, let us--just tell us what actually happened after you did get the acceptance to go on.  You did the feasibility study, and then what happened?
Speaker 2: Then we had to apply for a second development type proposal.  And this allowed us to receive additional monies to move to the next level in the development of the HMOs.  And this was getting the areas together that we wanted to serve, and we asked for five areas, metropolitan areas in Atlanta [Georgia].  And--
Speaker 1: What were those areas?  If you remember.
Speaker 2: Well, there was certainly Atlanta--Fulton County [Georgia] rather--DeKalb County [Georgia], and there were three other counties in addition.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But just in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the general area.
Speaker 1: --area of Atlanta?
Speaker 2: That was the general area around Atlanta, immediately.  And we went to request permission to practice in those counties, and we were not allowed to do that initially.  We were told by the attorney general's office that it was not, he was not able to grant us that permission at that time.  But we went back six months later, and at that time we were granted permission to practice in those five areas.  The foundation--not the foundation--the HMO had a couple of false starts.  We had to wait so long between these federal funds coming in that salaries for employees became a problem, and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 531443
Speaker 1: So, we eventually overcame those hills and valleys, and were successful in developing a vital and growing organization.  When the company [Health First Health Plan, Atlanta, Georgia] was sold in 1985 to a not-for-profit--I'm sorry, to a for-profit company--we had about twenty-five thousand clients, and we were covering much of the State of Georgia.  And so, it was a very valuable commodity at that time.  And we were unable to get the kind of deep pocket financing that was needed to really expand, and we had no choice but to sell to a buyer who happened to be our management company [UnitedHealth Group].  And out of that transaction came the funding for the Health First Foundation [Atlanta, Georgia].  Since we were a non-profit, and the for-profit company bought us, their responsibility was to reimburse the citizens of the State of Georgia, and the foundation resulted from that in 1985.  And I must say that that has been a very gratifying development, in that we have been able to make grants to health-oriented organizations in the State of Georgia.  And I know we have made grants well over $2 million since 1985.
Speaker 2: And who has those grants?  List some of the places that those grants have gone to, or some of the companies or some of the other businesses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They have gone to--well, the Morehouse School of Medicine [Atlanta, Georgia] has been one, and Southwest Hospital [Southwest Atlanta Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia].  There's an organization called Respite [Metro Atlanta Respite and Developmental Services, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] which--
Speaker 2: Would you spell that one for us?
Speaker 1: R-E-S-P-I-T-E.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a respite organization, in that it services parents and relatives of disabled children and adults.  And the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] has received funds for a grant--I'm sorry, the Medical College of Georgia [Augusta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And a number of other--all local--local, in that they're all in Georgia.  There was a group in Macon [Georgia] dealing with abuse that received some funds from us.
Story_ID: 531444
Speaker 1: What did you do next?  So, we still have the foundation [Health First Foundation, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, operative.  But what else, what else did you do after, you know, after the HMO [Health First Health Plan, Atlanta, Georgia], after establishing an HMO [health maintenance organization] in your career?  Because you went on to do other things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Our involvement in the HMO sort of fit very well with the North Central Georgia Health Planning Agency [sic. North Central Georgia Health Systems Agency], North Central Georgia HSA we called it, which dealt with the provision of medical services and facilities in the State of Georgia, north central Georgia specifically.  And I served as the vice president of that organization for several years, and then the president of North Central Georgia HSA for a term.  And beyond that I was nominated by, of all people, Herman Talmadge, senator from Georgia, to serve as a counselor on the National Health Planning and Resources Development council in 1980.  And was--
Speaker 1: How did that come about?  How--did you have any affiliations with, you know, Herman Talmadge?  Or did he just--how did that relationship come about for him to actually, you know, want you to take the position (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I wish I knew all of the particulars about it.  But we had Senator Talmadge at one of our meetings as I recall, and he received a presentation from us.  And I was involved in that scenario, so that's--and we knew him fairly well, as well as you can know a senator.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, I suppose that's the way it came about.
Story_ID: 531445
Speaker 1: And all the while, you were still practicing?
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had your private practice?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You were still at Hunter Street then?  Or had you moved to the new facilities?  This was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's see, that was 1980.  I had moved to the 2600 Martin Luther King Drive [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive] office building, the multi-specialty building that a group of other investors and I had put up.
Speaker 1: Because when we look at, you know, what you've done during that span from the time you left Alabama to the time that you, you know, started up the private practice and became active in the medical community of Georgia--I mean in Atlanta, Georgia--you were quite busy.  I mean you were really quite busy.  You were running a practice and then you were also performing surgeries at hospitals--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the area.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you were working at several of the hospitals, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are some of the hospitals in Atlanta that you did practice out of?
Speaker 2: Well, in our specialty in those days we practiced at the hospital wherever the patients requiring our services--where their physicians had their patients, and were referred to us.  So, it resulted in having to visit a number of hospitals like Hughes Spalding Pavilion [Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], Southwest Hospital [Southwest Atlanta Hospital], now called the Southwest Hospital and Medical Center [Atlanta, Georgia], Georgia Baptist [Georgia Baptist Hospital; Atlanta Medical Center, Atlanta, Georgia], Crawford Long [Emory Crawford Long Hospital; Emory University Hospital Midtown, Atlanta, Georgia].  Saint Joseph [Saint Joseph's Hospital; Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] was downtown at that time.  Those are some of the hospitals we went to.
Speaker 1: Has that changed--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And there were some smaller, older hospitals in the very early days in the city when segregation was rampant, when black people had only black hospitals to go to, both patients and physicians; Harris Hospital [William A. Harris Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], McLendon Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia], and there were a number of other clinics sort of.
Story_ID: 531446
Speaker 1: So was Atlanta [Georgia] like during the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s]--what--well, let's--what was the medical community basically like?  You started out as segregated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --hospitals?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And then you went to--you know, then they became defunct.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And then they moved to most of the white hospitals?
Speaker 2: That's, that's what happened in 1966 [sic. 1964], when the federal government declared that segregation was not the way things should be.  The hospitals opened up in Atlanta in particular.  And then there were some physicians and citizens in Atlanta who were very instrumental in achieving this end.  They formed a committee.  Dr. Albert Davis [Albert M. Davis] was one of those members of that committee.  And a citizen, Mrs. Xernona Clayton [HistoryMaker Xernona Clayton], along with other physicians, traveled to Washington [D.C.] to speak on behalf of the--to speak against segregation in the hospitals in Atlanta.  And ultimately the Civil Service Act [sic. Civil Rights Act of 1964] was signed by the then President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], which opened these facilities to everyone.  As a matter of fact, when I came to town I used to hear people speaking of the Gradys [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], and I thought it was a question of their grammar.  (Laughter) But there were actually two Grady hospitals.  There was one facility, but there was a black side and a white side, and that's why they called it the Gradys.  And that all changed overnight, and the black hospitals that were present when we came to town, very shortly after, just sort of went away because they had no--the patients all went elsewhere.
Speaker 1: And what would you attribute that to?  Was it--I mean you would think that the, that the black physicians would still practice out of black hospitals.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, they did.  They continued to as long as those hospitals existed, in addition to going to other hospitals.  They did, but then as time went on, the flow of patients just didn't make it economically feasible for those places to continue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in the City of Atlanta now, are there any remnants of a black hospital?  Just one that, you know, functioned during those days?
Speaker 2: The Hughes Spalding Pavilion [Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] at one time was predominantly--predominately because white physicians could carry their patients to Hughes Spalding as well as to all of the other hospitals, and black physicians carried their patients to Hughes Spalding.  Southwest Hospital [Southwest Atlanta Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], interestingly, was the first hospital in the Southeast to open its doors and staff to black patients and to black physicians.  And that hospital, unfortunately, closed its doors in, just in 2005.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It is making, struggling to reopen as we speak.
Story_ID: 531447
Speaker 1: Now, when you moved the practice to the new location, what were some of the--did you gain more patients, or did you lose patients?  Like, what changes occurred, you know, in your business?
Speaker 2: Well, my first office practice was in a small house that Dr. Louis Brown [Louis C. Brown] had changed into an office.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, we were cramped for space there.  And when we moved to 2600 Martin Luther King Drive [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], the first issue was space.  And there was a lot of it there, so there was room for a lot more patients.  And you lose some patients, naturally, because of the demographics.  You move away from them or they were closer to you at that time.  So, but, it seemed to fill in with new patients.  And the practice grew, thanks to the generosity of referring physicians in the city who helped us along.  We're certainly grateful to them for encouraging us.
Speaker 1: So tell us now, basically, you know, what--you closed--did you--you closed your office down.  Did you close that down when you retired?
Speaker 2: When I retired, my associate was Dr. Sam Atkins, and he took over the practice.
Speaker 1: And what year did you retire?
Speaker 2: In 1999.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-nine [1999].  Okay, he took over.  And did he change the name?  Or--
Speaker 2: No, it was, it was kept the same.
Speaker 1: Kept the same?
Speaker 2: Southwest Atlanta Urology Associates [sic. Southwest Atlanta Urological Associates, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 531448
Speaker 1: Basically, what does your day consist of?  I know that you, since you don't have--you closed the practice [Southwest Atlanta Urological Associates, Atlanta, Georgia]; you retired from the practice, and we know that you're with the, you know, the Health First Foundation [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And with sickle cell.  Do you still, are you active with sickle cell?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us what--what we should ask you is how did the Sickle Cell Foundation [Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia]--you know, how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. Nelson McGhee [Nelson McGhee, Jr.], the late Dr. McGhee and I attended a meeting of the National Medical Association in 1971, I guess, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And there was a presentation made on sickle cell disease, and it was made by a layperson.  And as we listened, we were a little nonplussed by the references that were made about the longevity of sickle cell patients generally, and the problems that they faced.  And in one or two areas, we had some concerns with the veracity of statements made.  So when we got back home, we looked around to see what was in existence at the time dealing with patients like that.  And we went to the various agencies and learned that there were no agencies dealing with sickle cell disease.  So, that really prompted the beginning of our organization, the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia.  So, we set about establishing an office, and we found a very capable young woman who was the head teller at a bank which was located in our building at 2600 [2600 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive], Miss Jean Brannan [Delores Brannan].  And Dr. McGhee persuaded her to leave her job--and she was pregnant at that time with her first child I believe--and come to work with our foundation as a volunteer, which she did.  And ultimately she became our executive director, and then president and COO.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she currently serves as that, in that same position today, all these years later.  And we had a great deal of support from the community.  Mrs. Clayton, whose name we mentioned earlier, [HistoryMaker] Xernona Clayton, organized a group of some twenty, twenty-five lovely ladies in the City of Atlanta [Georgia], and they were called the Souls for Sickle Cell [ph.].  And they put on a dinner for us in a large hotel in downtown Atlanta.  They were worried about whether they could fill a dining room, and whether there'd be enough money coming.  They wanted to raise ten thousand dollars for the foundation, and in those days that was a whole lot of money.  And as things turned out, she was able to garner the presence of a number of stars, television personalities, movie stars, and--
Speaker 1: Name a few for us who did attend.
Speaker 2: The, the--Jackson, Reverend Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was the featured speaker.  And there was a television actress, Nicole [sic. HistoryMaker Denise Nicholas]--I can't call her last name at the moment.  She was on '222' ['Room 222'], that was a popular television show at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, '222.'
Speaker 2: And gee, I can't--
Speaker 1: I remember the show.  Her name is escaping me, too.  So, that's okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a very attractive lady.  But the dinner was a major success.  We had people--we had to put tables up almost out in the hallways in order to get them all in.  And of course, they went beyond the goal of ten thousand dollars, and that was the very first funding that allowed the foundation to do some very important things like pay their rent and hire people and get things started.  And we also had some additional funds that came from then Governor Jimmy Carter [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] to help us on the way.
Story_ID: 531449
Speaker 1: But the foundation [Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] has thrived over these years.  We now own our own building, and we have employees who have just been so dedicated.  And I think our--the term of our employees is something like twenty years.  I mean, they have just been there continuously for that period of time.  We have all kinds of skills.  We do testing for sickle cell disease, and counseling.  And we counsel the patients when we learn what their results from the tests are.
Speaker 2: So, are these physicians and nurses that are actually counseling?  Or who does the counseling on site (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We have, we have certified counselors who are doing the counseling.  We have a tutorial program for the children who, as a result of sickle cell disease, they lose time in school.  And when they're out ill, just as soon as they are able to function again, they can get into our tutorial programs.  And we have computers which are programmed from kindergarten through the twelfth grade--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so that they can deal with their grade level with our computers, to keep up, so that when they get back to school they're not lagging behind, which discourages a lot of children and they either drop out or just don't perform well.  Most of these children are very, very bright children, and this absence with these incidents of sickle cell crises just causes them to have to be out of school several times a year.  But I must say that we have seen dramatic changes and improvement in the longevity of sickle cell patients because of a number of advancements that have been uncovered over these years that we've been in business, so that their quality of life is much improved.  There're sickle cell patients are living into ripe old ages these days.
Speaker 2: And at one time, that wasn't so?
Speaker 1: No.  As a matter of fact, one of the stories that was put out at the meeting we mentioned was that they didn't live to be twenty.  And--
Speaker 2: Oh, the life expectancy was that short?
Speaker 1: It was very short at that time.  But now, because of penicillin and other advances, they're able to live much longer with a much better quality of life.  And we're, we've incorporated a number of things in our foundation, in the office, that helps them when the diagnosis comes back, whether its sickle cell disease or the trait, we see to it that they get the proper medical supervision.  And we're finding that we had to add on Spanish speaking counselors, because now we're seeing so many, increasing numbers of patients who speak other than English.  So, things have come a long way.
Speaker 2: And what's the earliest that you start testing?
Speaker 1: Newborns are tested nowadays.  Cord blood is tested, so we can--used to have to wait several weeks before we would have a diagnosis, but now we can know that almost as soon as they get here.
Speaker 2: And so you have facilities that will even handle the newborns?  There're programs in effect for them, too (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, there is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's one of our programs that is partially supported by the state, because we see all patients who want to have the test done.
Story_ID: 531450
Speaker 1: So now, back to today.  What does your day consist of as a retired urologist, retired surgeon, retired physician (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, now I'm, as I said, serving on the board of trustees at the Morehouse School of Medicine [Atlanta, Georgia].  I'm on the executive committee, and I chair the academic policy committee.  So we have several meetings a year, and there are some inner meetings for the executive meeting during the year.  That's one thing that keeps me involved.  The Sickle Cell Foundation [Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] has quarterly board meetings, and so we're involved in that.  And of course there are activities that go on in August.  The foundation has a summer camp just for sickle cell patients.  And we spend about six days, five or six days, at this camp.  Children are able to participate in all kinds of activities; horseback riding, boating, swimming, games, you name it.  And we have counselors, volunteers.  They stay in cabins, and there'll be a counselor assigned to each cabin, an adult or someone who is qualified to do that.  And they just have a grand time.  Last year, we had two hundred sickle cell patients from around the State of Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they, it's a sight to see.  It's really a sight to see--

Speaker 1: We wanted to ask, is there anything or any area of your life that I might not have covered that you would like to talk about at this particular time?
Speaker 2: Well, we might expand a bit on the activity of the North Central Georgia Health Systems Agency, in that our job was to travel around to various cities and counties in the State of Georgia to visit their health facilities and try to make an assessment of what their needs were, and to determine just how that organization might facilitate acquiring those needs.  And that was a very challenging activity for us, for all of our board members.
Speaker 1: And about how many were on that board?
Speaker 2: There must have been, gee, there must have been twenty-five or thereabout, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And each one, I mean all twenty-five of you went to different parts of the state and--?
Speaker 2: Yes, everyone didn't go every time, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, you went in teams?
Speaker 2: We went in teams.  And that way, everybody participated in that activity, every member of the board did.  And the same situation was with the National Health Planning and Resources Development council, except that we were concerned with the nation, with the entire country, and the new devices that were coming online that were being developed.  In radiology, particularly, there was a rather early challenge for us, dealing with how to distribute computed tomography devices, for instance.  CT scans, we call them today.  And they were very expensive, and everyone in the community of hospitals would want one.  But at the time there were some questions, and we felt some research is still needed to be done so that they were distributed sparingly, initially.  And then later as the development improved and the price came down, more places and facilities were able to afford them.  And now they're commonplace all over.

Speaker 1: I just have a few questions that we like to ask.  They are our closing questions, so to speak.  But why did you want to tell your story, the story of your life?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter), because you asked me to.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I knew you were going to say that.  But other than that, (laughter) because you lived, you know, a very good and interesting incredible life.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do think that there were some things that we lived through that might be of interest to someone else.  And I think that the challenge of segregation, having lived through those days, makes it important to me for posterity to know about it.  You think that it's gone and in the past, but it's history for our young African Americans who enter the field and enter the community and the State of Georgia to know what their history was like, and what those of us who came early on had to live through. So that, I think that's the reason that we want them to know about it.
Story_ID: 531463
Speaker 1: Now, how do you feel about the way that you have lived your life?  And what was important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, service was always, going into the field of medicine, my early on concern was to be of service.  And we were more service-oriented in those early days of medicine than it seems that we are today.  So that was the motivation, and hoping to encourage others to do likewise.  And medicine has been a very gratifying practice, and I can't think of anything I would rather have done with my life.  And I just hope that that message has gotten through.
Story_ID: 531464
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and what are some of your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My concern, along with the concern of many other of my colleagues, is our young black men--and even further back than that, young black children--our young boys are not finishing high school in large numbers, larger numbers than should be the case.  The enrollment for medical school, for instance, as far as black males are concerned, has declined over time.  It isn't increasing like we'd like it.  Fifty percent and better of medical school classes, entering any medical school around the country, is female.  So, what's happening to our young black men, and why are they not represented in equal numbers?  And we know some of those reasons, but it's a challenge that I think our total community has to meet to get these kids into, get them to finish high school to begin with, and then move on into other professions.
Story_ID: 531465
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  Or what do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Well, that I was a hard worker, and that I tried to perform a service to my community, in addition to practicing quality medicine and healthcare.
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I guess that's it; that hard work and serving your community is a valuable contribution, can be.  And I would hope that many or most of us would try to do that.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, we want to thank you, and thank you for the way that you've lived your life, and thank you for the contributions that you have made.
Speaker 2: And thank you very much.
