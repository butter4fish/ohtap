Speaker 2: Two thousand and six [2006].  Two thousand and two [2002], you said.
Speaker 1: Two thousand and six [2006], sorry.  Why am I getting my numbers mixed up today? Reverend, Mr. HistoryMaker, would you give me your full name and would you spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: My full name is Hawthorne Konrad Matthews [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], H-A-W-T-H-O-R-N-E, K-O-N-R-A-D, M-A-T-T-H-E-W-S.
Speaker 1: And Reverend Matthews, when were you born and where?
Speaker 2: I was born February 7, 1928 in Wilcox County, Snow Hill, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How far is Snow Hill from where we are today, Pensacola?
Speaker 2: Snow Hill is approximately 110 or twenty miles from here.
Speaker 1: So you're close to home?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm close to home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this is home, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Reverend, how do you describe your profession, your occupation?  What do you do?  What are you?  Who are you?  How would you describe your--?
Speaker 2: Okay.  At the moment, I'm, I'm, I'm pastoring a church, an A.M.E. Zion Church.  I've been in the pastory for the past forty-five years, and I describe it as rewarding.  In an addition to my pastoral functions, I also am presiding elder of the Brewton [Alabama] district of south Alabama conference [Alabama-Florida Episcopal District] of the A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] connection, all of which is rewarding as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you spell Brewton for us?
Speaker 2: That's B-R-E-W-T-O-N.

Speaker 1: Before we get into your family history and your growing up years and all the things that socialize you to become the person that you became, we have a few warm-up questions, and also they're People magazine type questions and the, the people who look at your interview over the years will see another side of your personality.  So let me ask you, Reverend [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Collard greens and chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: This time of year.  Is it autumn or fall?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?  Are you're wearing it?
Speaker 2: Obviously, blue (laughter).
Speaker 1: Very good.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?  Some places that you like to kind of go off on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Destin, Florida.
Speaker 1: Destin, Florida?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just across the bridges over here.  Not too far.
Speaker 1: What's the attraction in Destin?  I've heard of the place, but I--.
Speaker 2: To me the quietness.  It's not really--I, I mean it's kind of a vacation spot, but it's, it's not a very, very boisterous-type place.  The quietness is the thing that attracts me to it.  And, and the ability that I have to think when I'm in that area because of the waters and all of that, and that provides me with a kind of a serene kind of surrounding.  And, and I think I'm at my best when I'm in, in an area like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know you--.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) sway it, shift to the right off here four inches toward the camera.  Yeah.  Good.  Okay.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: I know you could give me a number of responses to my next question which is the last one in this category.  But do you have a favorite phrase or saying, or philosophical piece that you like to say to your friends, relatives from day to day?  Anything that kind of--?
Speaker 2: No. Usually just a one word statement, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, okay.  Thank you.

Speaker 1: Reverend [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], in our interviews we start by looking at your family roots and your children and their growing up years, and your growing up years.  So, those who view this interview will know the background and the beginnings and your surroundings and so on.  And I want to start with your mother if I could.  Could you give me her name and where and when she was born?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's, mother's name was Luvenia Johnson, or Luvenia Matthews [Luvenia Johnson Matthews] subsequently, but I never knew her.  My mother died when I was rather young, and so I never--yeah, I was reared by my grandmother whose picture appears in that book.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Lucy Purifoy Johnson.
Speaker 1: Well, what did your grandmother tell you about your mother?
Speaker 2: Not very much accept for the fact that she died from tuberculosis, which during those years was a disease that people just kind of shied away from and perhaps because of that the treatments were not available or at least they--people didn't avail themselves to them.  So that was the cause of death as far as, you know, from what I can understand from my grandmother, again who reared me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well she raised you then?  Your grandmother raised you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Give me her name again?
Speaker 2: Lucy Purifoy Johnson.
Speaker 1: When was she born and where?
Speaker 2: She was born in Snow Hill, Alabama at--it must have been around 1896.  I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: That's close enough.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you know about her parentage?  What about your great-grand-, her--your maternal grandmother's parents [Emma Purifoy and Henry Purifoy]?
Speaker 2: Nothing at all.
Speaker 1: Nothing at all?
Speaker 2: Nothing at all.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about grandmother's growing up years?  Did she ever share with you her childhood experiences?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I, I think my grandmother was just too busy trying to provide for me.  I was the only--I was the only grandchild there at the--at the time.  It was nobody but--except rather my grandmother and I, and my growing up years she spent trying to--trying to make it for us, for the two of us.  She was a country school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had to walk many miles a day to go to school.  I went with her.  At one point, we walked--we walked thirteen miles a day one way.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: There were different schools in that area.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: One was in Shiloh [Alabama].  One was in a place called McWilliams [Alabama]. Just different schools wherever she was assigned by the superintendent of schools for all blacks.  And often we had no really school buildings.  We went to school in churches, one, one-room cabins with potbelly heaters and often times when we got to school after walking that distance, we had to go out and cut wood in order to make a fire.  So it was quite, quite interesting to say the least.
Speaker 1: What about your mother's father?  Her husband, your grandfather?  Did--was he--?
Speaker 2: He was a sawmill worker, and I never really knew him either because they had all passed on.
Speaker 1: I see.  What was his name?  Your maternal grandfather?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't think at the moment.  I think it was Thomas Johnson.  As a matter-of-fact, yeah.  That, that was Thomas Johnson, but his middle name escapes me.
Story_ID: 379322
Speaker 1: How did your [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] become a teacher?  What was the process for her becoming a teacher in those days?
Speaker 2: Being a high school graduate.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, okay.
Speaker 2: Because it really wasn't too much care given for black teachers during those days as long as they could read, write and probably instill the ability to do the same in young black kids, and because that's all they were teaching.
Speaker 1: How do you remember your Grandmother Johnson?  What was she like as a person?  Her personality?
Speaker 2: She was a terrific person.  She was a wonderful person.  She was a person who made sure that I was taken care of regardless of what her lot might have been.  And she's the one who inspired me to do whatever I ought to become--whatever I've become later in life and, and I owe all the credit to her because she was just a good woman.
Story_ID: 379323
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father?  His name and where and when he was born?
Speaker 2: Okay, my father was named John Henry Matthews, Sr. [John Matthews, Sr.].  He lived in a little town called Camden, Alabama which was eighteen miles from where my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] and I lived, and he remarried when I was a small child and his wife's name was Jimmy Lee Matthews [ph.] and, of course, aside from my grandmother, she was the other mother that I knew because she was very, very good to me, very kind to me.  In the times that we did have--did have contact, we--you know, we--I didn't see my father very often.
Speaker 1: I hear. Did they have children who would have been your half brothers or sisters?
Speaker 2: They do.
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't like the word half but (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  My brothers and sisters--yes they did.  One's name is John Henry Matthews, Jr. [John Matthews, Jr.].  My father--my father passed in 2003, I believe, in November.  Maybe, yeah, 2003, because my father-in-law passed in 2002 or '03 [2003] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your father must have been quite along in years then?
Speaker 2: My father was ninety something.
Speaker 1: I was going to say he had--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The ironic thing about that though, I would ask him when he got sick, and you can tell.  I said, "Daddy, how old are you?"  And he says, "Well, I'm eighty-two."  I said, "Well if you're eighty-two, that means that you were nine when you got me then."  So then, you know--he was (laughter) he was--he, he, he, he--you, you know, when you get kind of ancient you, you either choose to forget how old you are or, or you--it's forced upon you to forget how old you are, you know.  So in, in, in like in my case, I'm, I'm choosing to forget.  But I'm moving right along.
Speaker 1: So how many siblings did you have so to speak through your father's second marriage?
Speaker 2: Two.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Two?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are their names and where are they today?
Speaker 2: One's name is John Henry Matthews, Jr.; one's name is Josephine Williams [ph.] who lives out in California.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.  And your father's livelihood, what did he do for work?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer.
Speaker 1: He was a farmer?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Big farm, small farm, or--?
Speaker 2: Pretty good size farm.  He had quite a lot of acreage.
Speaker 1: What'd he grow?
Speaker 2: Basically everything, watermelons, greens, potatoes.  Just about anything you could name that would be grown on a farm.
Speaker 1: Did he share with you anything about his growing up years, his childhood?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Never.
Speaker 2: Never.  Never.  We, we rarely--as I said, we didn't see each other too often and when we did, I guess we were just so happy to see each other that we just focused on the--on the moment.
Speaker 1: I hear you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Even though you had small, fleeting times with him, how'd you remember him as a person?  What was he like, personality?
Speaker 2: He was a great person.  He was a great father.  Even though, you know, our visits were scarce but, and I'm being repetitious when I say that, I know that, but, but he was a good father.  He was a father.  I miss him very much.
Story_ID: 379324
Speaker 1: Reverend [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], what are your earliest memories of growing up?  How far back can you remember in your life?
Speaker 2: I can remember my, my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] going to the rolling store we had years ago.  It was a truck that brought about vegetables and, and foodstuff and that the people would buy, and I would remember the owner calling my grandmother, auntie and calling other black people grown people, uncles and boy.  And, and I, I guess subconsciously that kind of worked on me.  That, you know, I was--I was wondering how did my grandmother get to be their auntie because I was her grandson and we were all this color (points to face).  And I just didn't quite understand how they would be calling her auntie, but they did.
Speaker 1: Yeah. How old were you when you heard this?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Six or seven.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. Anything further back earlier in your life that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I, I just remember my grandmother bought me a, a tricycle when I was very small.  And we had--we had a house that had a hallway longer than this church [St. Mark A.M.E. Zion Church, Pensacola, Florida].  And I can--and we had a swing on our front porch, and I can remember getting on that tricycle and riding up and down the hall and saying, I was going to New York and all these different places.  And I can remember getting in the swing and swinging and said, "We're going here, we're going there."  So that's pretty much--that's, that's what I remember.
Speaker 1: That's good.  Okay.
Speaker 2: The memories that I have are fond memories, incidentally.
Story_ID: 379325
Speaker 1: How old were you when you started going to school?
Speaker 2: About five or six because I had to go with my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your grandmother.
Speaker 2: --because she was a teacher.
Speaker 1: How many children in the school?  Can you--do you remember the setting of the school?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: The school population was not that large, but the fact of the matter is that there were all grades in one classroom.  (Laughter) First, second, third, fourth--they were all in one classroom.
Speaker 1: How did she manage with such differences in, in ages and grade levels?  How did the teacher work that around you?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was an expert.
Speaker 1: Were you in her classroom or another classroom?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  There wasn't but one classroom.
Speaker 1: So you were in that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I was in that classroom.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that classroom?
Speaker 2: And, and, I hated being in that classroom because it looks like she picked on me because she wanted me to make sure that I learned.  Didn't do a very good job of learning, but she wanted to make sure that I did.
Speaker 1: What were the subjects that, that were generally taught (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, English, math.  That, that--
Speaker 1: The basics.
Speaker 2: The basic three Rs during those days is what people focused on:  reading, writing, and arithmetic--
Story_ID: 379326
Speaker 1: Did you do any work--as a student at the school, did you work outside the school?  Did you have a garden, farms or anything?  Was there outdoor education?
Speaker 2: No.  No, only when I got in high school after we left the one-room shacks.  When I got in high school, the high school had a farm and we used to work on that farm for fifty cents a day, you know, as students.
Speaker 1: Now was the high school Snow Hill Institute [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama]?  Was that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Snow Hill Institute.
Speaker 1: That was the high school?
Speaker 2: That's the high school.
Speaker 1: Well, how old were you when you first went to Snow Hill?
Speaker 2: I must have been (pause)--I must have been about twelve or thirteen.  I'm not sure because it was--.  I had--I had--I went into Snow Hill in the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: I see.  And how long were you there?  How long was that period of education?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1947, so it must have been--I'd say I went there in '42 [1942], something around that time.
Speaker 1: So you were about say '28 [1928], '38 [1938]--so you graduated at about sixteen or seventeen then?
Speaker 2: Seventeen cause I had--I had a real good head start, you know, I had a real good head start.  And during that time, teachers were interested in children learning and they were not so much looking forward to the paycheck which was meager, to say the least.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Story_ID: 379327
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you do after school, weekends or particularly during the summer when you were in the elementary grades before you went to Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama]?  What other kind of--what was the other part of your life outside the classroom?
Speaker 2: Okay.  We, we were in a community that was an all-African American community, all black community, up above Snow Hill Institute.  And I had cousins, everybody in the community were, almost were rel-, related, but I had some cousins right down the road from me.  The Lee family, which was Spike Lee's father's--well, father and his uncles and his grandmother all lived down the road from me and then we were related.  So we used to go down and play ball on every day except Sunday.  (Laughter) We were not allowed to do anything on Sunday.  We were certainly subscribing to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy because they didn't allow us to do anything.  You know, all we did on Sunday, we would walk two and a half miles to a place called the station.  We had a cousin out there named Ralph Lock [ph.].  We'd walk out there, see Ralph.  Ralph would walk back with us and we'd walk halfway back with Ralph (laughter), and that was our activity on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Where'd you go to church?  What was the name of the church in your community?
Speaker 2: Brooks Chapel A.M.E. Church [ph.].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And so you started going there as a--as a youngster?
Speaker 2: As a youngster.  As a child, right.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 379328
Speaker 1: Were there any individuals, relatives, neighbors, in particular, anybody at the church [Brooks Chapel A.M.E. Church (ph.)] who you remember as being particularly influential in your--in your young years?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not really.  They--during that time--and I say, not really, or maybe I could say, all of them because during that time, they subscribed to the fact that it takes a village to raise a child.  And everybody was your mother during that era.  If you messed up, you know, you didn't have to wait 'til you got home to get your little fanny tanned.  Whoever saw you mess up did it.  And, and you would just hope they didn't tell your mother or, in, in my case, my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson], because if they did, there was another one coming.  Unlike today if they do that, the mother or grandmother want to go and whip the person who did it.  They, they, they, they believed in the fact that, you know, you're everybody's child and everybody in the community was your mother and your, your father.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get reported--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I, I--
Speaker 1: --to your grandmother?
Speaker 2: --certainly, certainly.  I--you know, and my grandmother didn't play anything.  She'd just--I don't think she even played the radio.  Every time we'd turn--had the radio playing at home, I had to turn it on.  She, she would whip me (laughter), said woman would whip me if anybody would whip me outside of home and they told her 'cause I tried to hide it.  They told her that they'd whipped me, she'd whip me again, and it was no way for me to tell her that I didn't do what they say I did.  "If Miss So-and-So said you did it, you did it."
Story_ID: 379329
Speaker 1: What holidays and special family events during your growing up years do you especially remember?  Is there any (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Christmas.
Speaker 1: Christmas?
Speaker 2: Christmas.
Speaker 1: What was Christmas like for you?
Speaker 2: I always awaited Santa Claus.  I always awaited the arrival of Santa Claus, you know.  We--during that time, we'd just subs-, we just believed strongly in Santa Claus.
Speaker 1: How long did you believe in Santa Claus?
Speaker 2: Until I messed around and got slick one Christmas Eve night and snuck a peek at (laughter), at what Santa Claus had supposedly left me and then found out the next morning after he'd come down the chimney that he'd left the same things, but they weren't double.  So, I kind of figured out that it was--you know, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Well, I gave it up--.
Speaker 2: Kind of took the joy out of Christmas.
Speaker 1: I gave up on it when I came down one morning and found that he had not taken the fruit and the crackers that we'd left for him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we used to leave the fruits, too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Put the fruit there and then it's still there and I said, "Well, he didn't take it."
Speaker 2: --and then cookies and milk and stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's when I--that's when I was a non-believer (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughing) Yeah, and my parents had forgot to take it away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was--I was so hurt when I found out, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 379330
Speaker 1: Could you just describe--and you already started--describe a little bit more about your physical neighborhood around your [maternal] grandmother's [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] house and the street and so on, the environment [of Snow Hill, Alabama]?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Very, very quiet environment.  There were no neighbors, neighbors that you could call next door neighbors.  You know, I talk about my aunt, Alberta Lee [ph.], who lived down the road from us, and it's about a half mile--what, what about a quarter of a mile, and that was a closest neighbor, and the closet neighbor to our left to our lawn was my uncle who was named Grant Purifoy and that was my grandmother's brother.  And Grant Purifoy, he lived equally as far that way as Aunt Alberta did that way.  So, that was--we, we were just kind of right in the middle, and we had a big sprawling place and a lot of pear trees, a lot of plum trees, and that was the thing that I did.  I enjoyed myself in the woods.
Story_ID: 379331
Speaker 1: That leads me logically to the next question.  What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up in Snow Hill [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: When I can walk in a place and smell greens cooking and when--and they don't do this anymore--used to when my Grandmother Bell [ph.] would cook steaks, they would take it and put in on a board and they'd beat it and chop it and carry on.  They don't do that anymore.  They have all these tenderizers and all this stuff, and her tenderizer was a butcher knife, you know (laughter) or something and she'd beat it up and, and it was so good.  So (laughter), those were the things that remind me of growing up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's good.  That's good.
Story_ID: 379332
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your high school years, Snow Hill [Snow Hill Normal and Industrial Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama].  Let me go back to that.  What was that--those high school years so to speak for you at Snow Hill?  How do you remember the instruction?  What did you study?
Speaker 2: Just basic subjects.  I mean, general subjects.  I wasn't the smartest thing in the world because I wasn't too, too particular about applying myself, but I managed to I guess kind of like it was when I was in college [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama].  I didn't want to set the world on fire.  I just wanted to see my way through, so.  (Laughter) A lot of that is what I did.  But there were good years, and, and I guess I always knew that I would wound up preaching because I used to stand on an apple crate in high school and preach and I would have a congregation around me.  So, you know, I just basically been preaching for the last sixty-some years.
Story_ID: 379333
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you at what point in these early years you had made a decision or at least a tentative decision about what you thought you wanted to do in your lifetime.  So, how did you come to, to that to preaching?  I mean, what, what--?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I, I really don't know.  First of all, I, I guess there was this, this, this inner thing that was pushing me, but it couldn't come out because I was too busy dealing with alcohol and other things that were stumbling blocks, and I quit drinking in November of 1959 and, and I guess that urging and stuff forced itself out and I began preaching in 1960.
Speaker 1: But you were already delivering messages as a teenager?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On the apple crate.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  On the apple crate.
Speaker 1: And even then, what, what inspired you to speak out and, and to preach?
Speaker 2: I had no earthly idea.
Speaker 1: Who did you preach to when you were that young?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had--I had a congregation around me.  I had kids around me (laughter) and who listened to me and said--they call me--some of them they call me Lap.  I don't know why they go-, where they got that from, but they say, "Lap, you're going to preach one day."  I said--.
Speaker 1: L-A-P, Lap?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  "You're going to preach one day."  I said, "Not me.  I'm preaching now and that's it."
Speaker 1: Where did you get the text from?
Speaker 2: The Bible.  Yeah, I, I used the Bible.  I--shoot!  I was--I thought I was somebody.  (Laughter) I thought I was doing something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The church [Brooks Chapel A.M.E. Church (ph.)] that you went to on Sundays, did that inspire you in any kind of way do you think?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know.  I--just like--just like it's a mystery to me what inspired me to quit drinking because I did it (snaps fingers) just like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 379334
Speaker 1: Reverend [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], I want to back up if I can.  We had come up to your enlisting in the [U.S.] military, but let me go back to Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama], if I could for just a minute?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm interested in knowing who the professors were and the instructors.  Do you remember any of them particularly and where they came from?
Speaker 2: Now the president was Dr. J.F. Drake [Joseph Fanning Drake], I remember that.  One of the instructors was Dr. Chambers [ph.] and I worked for the dean of students, Dr. Browder [ph.], and there was the math instructor was Dr. Sieburn [ph.], and there was a history instructor that I, I can't--his name escapes me right now.  That's, that's only been sixty years almost ago, so those names escape me.  But I, I remember Dr. Browder because I worked for him.  He was the dean of students, and I remember Dr. Sieburn because he had the habit of writing on the board with one hand and erasing it with the other one.  And I remember Dr. Chambers because Dr. Chambers' favorite statement was that, "The man who wrote the book made an A.  I teach it.  I made a B.  The best you can get out of my class is a C."  So (laughter) that was--that kind of stands in, in my mind, not out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 379335
Speaker 1: Staying with Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama], did you participate in religious and church life there on the campus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  No.  We were forced to go to chapel.
Speaker 1: That's what I mean.
Speaker 2: To an extent we had to go.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And I've forgotten the chaplain's name, but I did go to the dean of students and say to him that, you know, "We're being forced to go to chapel, but his words are so high and lofty, those of us who are sitting there don't understand what he's saying.  So either ask him to bring 'em down on a level that we can understand or either don't require us to go to chapel."  So, I think the end result was he said, "The chaplain would bring the wor-," you know, bring his messages down on a level that those of us who were just lay people and students could understand what he was saying.  Didn't do much good to go there and not know what the man was talking about.  I didn't know what he was thinking.

Speaker 1: How did you feel about the decision that you made to leave college [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama] and enter the [U.S.] military?  How'd you feel about that decision at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh, at the time I--you know, I just wanted to be footloose and fancy free and I thought it was great.  And eventually, I found out it was not so great.  And when I came back out of military, I--you know, I was walking around saying, "Look world, I'm back," and I, I discovered the world didn't even know I'd been gone.  You know, so I--
Speaker 1: So when you finished your military training--let's come back to Fort Devens [Massachusetts].  You finished your military training, you were trained and prepared to do what at that point?  You were in the [U.S.] Army, what's--what branch of the--?
Speaker 2: I was in the artillery.
Speaker 1: Artillery.
Speaker 2: But I was trained and prepared to do absolutely nothing.  Except I'd--like I said, I did some administrative work as far as typing is concerned and, of course, through the years that developed into my being able to work in administration.
Speaker 1: Now, I read a letter that was in your clippings about the examinations that you took for typist/clerk typist and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: We'll come back to that later.
Speaker 2: The day I was going to the interview, supposedly the day that John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] got killed and--
Speaker 1: We'll come back to that as we--as we move along.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 379337
Speaker 1: So you finished your military training. and what was you first assignment?  Where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: Came back home, came back to Snow Hill [Alabama].  Stayed for a little while.  Left and came so I got in 1955.
Speaker 1: No, but I, I want to get you to the [U.S.] military service now.  You finished Fort Devens [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you went where?  Where were you assigned to?  Where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Fort Devens.
Speaker 1: But after that, where did you go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After, after Fort Devens, Korea.  I was over there for a little while, and then when I came back is when I went to, to Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about the Korean War years.  How do you remember them?  Do you want to remember any of it?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Preferably I want to just erase them.
Speaker 1: You did get a Purple Heart though, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  But--.
Speaker 1: What was that for?
Speaker 2: That was for a backache (laughter), I mean that was--no, that's a--they used to say when you go to the infirmary and said that you were hurt, they'd say, "Give him an APC."  But no, I got hit with some shrapnel and hence I was awarded the Purple Heart.
Speaker 1: I see.  So you came back from Korea and where did you move to?  Where was your next step?
Speaker 2: At Fort Sill, you know, I came home on leave and I went back to Fort Sill.
Speaker 1: Fort Sill?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: All right.  So how long were you--you were still in the military then--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --so how long did you stay?  How long were you--did you continue after Korea?
Speaker 2: See, I went to Korea twice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twice.  Came back one time to Fort Sill.  I left and went back to Korea and stayed a few months and then came back to Fort Devens, which is where I was separated in 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was the year you were discharged from Fort Devens?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Story_ID: 379338
Speaker 1: Well, what happened in 1955 when you were discharged [from the U.S. military]?  Then what?  What, what was next?
Speaker 2: Then I came back to Snow Hill [Alabama].  Took up residence with my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] again and she was very much alive and well at that time, and I left Snow Hill in probably 1956, the early part because my uncles and--I had two uncles and an aunt who lived here in Pensacola [Florida].  So, I came down here because I really wanted to--I thought I wanted to work and get out from under my grandmother's thumb.  Even though I was grown, she was growner, and she was still in charge.  So, I came down here and started catching day's work because I was still nurs-, nursing the bottle, and I would work a day and get enough to buy some liquor and work another day and get enough to buy some more, and I did that up until 1960.
Speaker 1: Now how'd you--?
Speaker 2: I mean, until 1959.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Story_ID: 379339
Speaker 1: How'd you break out of that?  What, what was the turning point at that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was working at Baldwin Dairy ice cream [Baldwin Dairy Farms, Pensacola, Florida] down on A [Street] and Gregory Street, and I was going to school under the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] getting eighty dollars a month for the G.I. Bill, and I had had a room added on to my house when I was living here and the mortgage on that was fifty dollars a month, okay.  I was drawing eighty dollars a month from [U.S.] military.  So, this particular month in November of 1959, somehow--because I was paying the mortgage out of the eighty dollars, okay.  So, somehow I had gotten ahead on my mortgage in 19--in November of '59 [1959].  So when I got the--and I can remember the exact date because we always got our checks on the 20th.  This November, the checks came on the 18th which was Friday because the 20th was on Sunday.  So, that eighty dollars that I got that month was free and clear so, so I didn't have to pay the mortgage out of that.  So, I started drinking that Friday evening when I got my check cashed and I drank Friday evening.  Friday eve-, you, you know when you were drinking and stuff, everybody's your friend, until you get broke.  So, Sunday evening--Sunday morning when I woke up, I had seventeen dollars left out of eighty dollars.  Now, eighty dollars during that time was a lot of money, okay.  I had seventeen dollars left so--and my head was hurting.  I had a hangover (laughter) and all that.  But anyway, I went home that night.  I bought a quart of Spearman beer.  Used to be a brewery here that was called Spearman [Spearman Brewing Company, Pensacola, Florida].  Bought a quart of Spearman beer, got in the bed, and I was married to my first wife and I don't want to even mention that, but got in the bed with that quart of Spearman beer, pulled up a glass of beer and held it up and looked at it and said to me (points to himself), to myself, "When I drink this, I'm not drinking anymore."  The next day, I was in the bar drinking 7-Up.  That was November 21st, 1959 and I haven't had a drink since.
Speaker 1: But what snapped it?  I mean what possessed you at that moment?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I have no idea.  People have told me that I did it subconsciously.  I used to be coming home from a little bar over on the Eastside, well on Jordan [Street] and Alcaniz Street [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Drive] that was called Two Spot [ph.] and I, I would get--you know, I was one of them people when I got drunk I got happy.  You know, I wasn't wanting to fight 'cause I'm scared to fight anyhow and I was sober.  So--and, and I would come home and I'd be staggering and falling and, and my son and his little playmates would be playing out in the field and they would say, "There go your old drunk daddy."  Okay, and then he would get in a fight.  And, and, and I don't know but people have said to me said, "Probably that is what prompted you, subconsciously maybe.  You weren't thinking, but that might be what prompted you to quit."  But I quit that day--that night.  Haven't had a drink since.  Felt so much better.
Story_ID: 379340
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The next weeks and the next months took you where?  You, of course, were working and--
Speaker 2: Took me to going to church that I had to forbidden or forsaken, and then a transformation came about as it relates to things that were happening in Pensacola [Florida].  A young minister came in and started seeing the conditions that we were in and, I don't know, it just evolved.
Speaker 1: What were the social, racial conditions in Pensacola at that moment?
Speaker 2: Awful.
Speaker 1: Can you give me some details, specifics?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, I can imagine but, I want--
Speaker 2: We weren't allowed to go into the theaters.  We weren't allowed to go into the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  We weren't allowed to go into the lunchrooms, lunch counters and sit, and this is what prompted our sit-ins and, and all of that.  We didn't have access to public accommodations what it amount to.  And so this young minister came in named Reverend W.C. Dobbins, and he started the movement by, by, by saying--by going downtown.  First of all, it hit him.  He went downtown and to Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] and Kress' [S.H. Kress and Company] and all those places and was able to buy goods out of those stores, but when he got ready for a sandwich, had to come out of the store, go around to a side window and order.  And of course, I started following him.  I guess he saw something in me or something.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: What church was he pastoring at that point?
Speaker 2: He was pastoring St. Paul United Methodist Church here in Pensacola.
Speaker 1: And you were attending the church?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: You weren't.
Speaker 2: I used to--I was just working with him until I started preaching and I started, like I say, started preaching in, in October of 1960 at an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  So that was an A.M.E. church I was affiliated with, United Methodist church I was affiliated with, and then came over to the A.M.E. Zion connection.  So, I--and Reverend Dobbins used to get me periodically when he had to go out of town, he would get me to fill in for him on Sundays in his pulpit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, how come you didn't go to his church?
Speaker 2: Because I was already a member of the A.M.E. Zion church.  I didn't feel the need to, (laughter) to do like some people do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had become an A.M.E. Zion back in Alabama?
Speaker 2: No, I became an A.M.E. Zion--
Speaker 1: Here?
Speaker 2: --here.
Speaker 1: Here in Pensacola.  I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 379341
Speaker 1: Well, we're at St. Mark's A.M.E. Zion Church [St. Mark A.M.E. Zion Church, Pensacola, Florida] at this moment for this interview (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: What role did this church and this congregation play in your--in your years here?
Speaker 2: Okay.  This, this church was very supportive of me.  I pastored this church and this was the last church in Pensacola [Florida] that I pastored before leaving the area.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And the night that my bond was revoked before I had--they had pronounced me guilty, I was out on appeal bond pending sentencing, pending the pronouncement of guilty or not guil-, whatever the case was.  And the night that the deputies revoked my bond, I'd hel-, I'd held a press conference that day and said that, "Pensacola was in for the biggest demonstration that it had ever seen" because Ralph, Ralph Abernathy--Dr. Abernathy was scheduled to come here the following day, probably during that week.  And I said that, "Pensacola's going to see the biggest demonstration it has ever seen.  Dr. Abernathy will be here to lead it," and when the judge read that he said that, "He would be a fool to let a man stay out of jail on bond who is threatening to do the same thing that got him locked up in the first place."  So, that night they came to my house and I was headed here getting ready to walk out of the door to come here.
Speaker 1: This was the mid-'70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is '74 [1974], '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Seventy--'75 [1975] to come here to have a mass meeting in this church when they came and arrested me.  So, this is why this church is so significant to me because it was the last one that I pastored in Pensacola and it was the first one that I was arrested from--almost, I hadn't gotten here--when my bond was revoked.  So, it, it holds some significance for me. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.  Let's come back to that in just a moment.
Story_ID: 379342
Speaker 1: I want to go back just a little bit.  Reverend Dobbins [W.C. Dobbins]--how did you two happen to come together?  What was the attraction?  I mean, he liked you and your personality and so on, but how did you two get hooked up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and, as I say, I think--I think some things were lying dormant in me that I knew needed to be done, but I never had the--either the, the initiative or the ability I thought to get them done and when he came in with that, it was just up my alley.  And I hooked up with him and I became the senior advisor of the NAACP Youth Council at that point.  And those persons were responsible for leading all of the sit-ins and the demonstrations.  However, there were--there were people who belonged to the adult branch who also did it under the umbrella of what was called the Pensacola Council of Ministers, PCM, so.
Speaker 1: Now Reverend Dobbins left Pensacola [Florida], is that right?
Speaker 2: Reverend Dobbins left.  He was a United Methodist preacher, so he got a transfer as Methodist people do.
Speaker 1: And then you kind of moved in, in his footsteps; is that correct or not?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  I had--I had somehow gained the reputation in our community as one who would at least go and ask questions when injustices were perpetrated upon our people.  I would--you know, I would go and check it out at least and ask questions, and so the ministers--ironically, the Baptist ministers got together and named me the civil rights leader of this area and they even made that pronouncement on television.  So, with the reputation that I had, the leadership role was just thrust upon me.  It was not one that I sought or even wanted at the time.
Story_ID: 379343
Speaker 1: During this time, you were also working with the Florida state employment service agency; is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was the first African American to be hired at the Florida state employment service in any administrative capacity.
Speaker 1: And what did that job entail?  What was your role?
Speaker 2: At the time that I was hired, I was hired as a clerk typist II and then I moved from that to interviewer IV, and then clerk interviewer and then I moved from that to director of the youth opportunity program--well, youth opportunity center.  They called it YOC.  When we got mad with each other, we'd say, "You go to YOC!"  So, that was it.
Story_ID: 379344
Speaker 1: You moved from there also I think in terms of employment along with your ministry and community activism to managing a housing project?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Escambia Arms apartment complex [Pensacola, Florida].  I was their manager.  I think--I will always think that that was a ruse to get me out of the employment service because that would be--there were letters being written to Buzz Feeble [ph.] and the heads of the employment agency--service agency in Tallahassee [Florida] complaining about my, my activities, my civil rights activities and, and I was causing upheaval in the community and, and, and a lot of stuff.  And then these people came along and, and offered me this job.
Speaker 1: At the housing?
Speaker 2: At the housing.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I wanted to ask you why you made that move.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, and you know, they promised me all this stuff that I would be able to, to freely exercise my ability, and I was young.  You know, I, I just didn't--I didn't think it through, and the manager of the Florida state employment service whose name was Layden Pierce [ph.], said to me, you know, "If you go--if you want to come back, come back."  But before I could decide after they got rid of me at the hou-,at the Escambia Arms apartments because they, they got new managers in.  It was under new management.  Some people out of Gainesville [Florida] I think owned the apartments 'cause they, they wanted their people in they said.  So, before I--Mr. Pierce was a former alcoholic and of course, I'm, I was blamed even sometimes to this day for him reverting back to his alcoholism because they said that it, it bothered him so about my leaving that in, in--you know, I'm not really buying that but, if I--but that's what people--some people have said.  And, but before I could make the move or the decision to come back, then he had reverted back to his drinking and he lost his job and just a lot of stuff.
Story_ID: 379345
Speaker 1: At what point along this period were you ordained into the ministry?
Speaker 2: I was ordained in 1961.  I started preaching in '60 [1960], ordained in '61 [1961] as a deacon in the--in which is a step of ministry in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion connection, and I was ordained an elder in 1965.  Matter of fact, I was ordained just before (laughter) I made my little trip.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Being ordained at elder, what role did you now play?  What was your responsibilities?
Speaker 2: As an elder, I was--see we have steps in our church--A.M.E. Zion church, A.M.E. Zion connection.  There are courses of study you have to go through after completing--well, I guess I'll get back to the question you asked me earlier about the schooling.  But, but outside of this, there was none.  There are courses of study you have to go through and if you're deemed capable and worthy of being ordained a deacon, because as a local preacher all you can do is preach, okay.  And if you have to--if you belong to a church as I did, if I needed to go some--wanted to go someplace else to preach, I had to ask permission of my pastor to go.  Okay, when I became a deacon without--with, with a church--as a matter of fact, I had--basically had a church from the time I was started in this business.  So, I didn't have to ask anybody's permission except mine (laughter) possibly, but I was not able to do anything as a local preacher except preach.  I became a deacon.  I was able to solemnize matrimony and, and, and with the assistance of an elder, administer the holy communion.  But then when you become an elder, you are able to do it all without being overseen.  So, after I became an elder, I was in a position that I could do all of the--administer all of the sacraments.
Story_ID: 379587
Speaker 1: We were waiting for the tape change, you told me about your first day at the Florida state employment agency, and I think we ought to have that on the record, too.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell, tell--say that again for us.
Speaker 2: Now the first day that I went to work there the, the manager of the employment service, Layden Pierce [ph.], called a staff meeting.  He locked the doors and put the sign in the door, "Meeting in Progress" or "Staff Meeting," whatever the case was, and he made the pronouncement or announcement, whatever you want to call it, and said to those who were there because I was the only African American there that, "Some of you have said to me if a Negro was ever hired in this office, that you were going to resign."  Said, "We have one over here, sitting over there, Mr. H. K. Matthews [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], who just joined the staff," and said, "We--I will be in my office for thirty minutes after this meeting to receive any letters of resignation."  I don't know who claimed that they were going to resign, but I know who did not resign that day.  Nobody turned in letters of reg-, of reg-, resignation and weeks, months and years followed (laughter), and nobody turned in letters of resignation.
Story_ID: 379588
Speaker 1: Coming back to your community activism and leadership around the civil rights issues and denials for blacks in Pensacola [Florida], you confronted the police department here, you confronted businesses, schools.  You looked at the school deseg [desegregation] plan and you talked about the quality of the teachers and you used the courts, you used the courts (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the courts.
Speaker 1: So you really, really had it all thought out and you, you risked an awful lot.  You made a lot of risks.  What was your [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] thinking and saying at that point?  She was still living, right?  So what--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, she wasn't.
Speaker 2: She had passed on.
Speaker 1: She had passed.  Okay.  I just wondered what--how she felt, what she had thought about your activism.
Speaker 2: I, I'm sure that she was looking down smiling.  I just feel that she was.  I could kind of just feel her presence.  As, as I do now.  I, I just feel her presence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was the greatest influence in my life, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay
Story_ID: 379589
Speaker 1: You alluded earlier to your work with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], but I'm a former educator and was involved in the Boston, Massachusetts school desegregation issues back--
Speaker 2: With Miss Hicks [Louise Day Hicks] (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).Sat right beside her in court (laughter). Right beside her on the bench and oh, we went through that in the '70s [1970s].  But you took on and, and you led the charge to the school department on, on the deseg [desegregation] plan.  Tell me about your public school involvement and your work in defending high school students and so on.
Speaker 2: Well, the main thing--I mean one of the main focuses was the initial integration of the schools in this county where naturally African American students were in the real minority because they were--as, as number-wise, I mean the real minority.  And consequently because of them being in that spot, they were not given the kind of treatment that was deserving of students.  That there was a different approach to African American students than there was to white students.  Even the grading system was a bit different and students were kind of disillusioned about the way they were treated in the schools.  But the main thing, first of all, one of the schools here insisted on the kids playing 'Dixie' at football games.  The kids came to us and said, "We don't want to play 'Dixie'."  We went to the administration and they said they're going to have to play 'Dixie' or they're not going to get credit for band.  So we put a damper on that because there was a football team on the ba-, naval base that was called the Goshawks, which is where--what's the boy's name that used to play with the Dallas Cowboys?  Roger Staubach was playing at that time and they insisted on them playing.  The, the band from Pensacola High [Pensacola High School, Pensacola, Florida] played at that game and, and they would not lift the requirement for the students to play 'Dixie' and, of course, I led the charge to get the students to just walk off the field at half-time when they started playing 'Dixie.'  All of the black students dropped their instruments by their sides and walked off, which did not go over real well with a lot of people including Afr-, some African Americans because we've always had people in our community who just didn't understand why we didn't leave things as they were, and I was always one who felt that if we leave things as they are, it'll never get better.  So, but anyway--and that was one instance.  Another instance was they refused to have black history assembly at the same high school, Pensacola High.  So, I took all of the black students out of Pensacola High School, sat them on the lawn--that's when I was working at the Florida state employment services--sat them on the lawn and told them not to go back into class until they agreed to have a black history assembly, and I went on back to work and one of the deputies called me and said, "Do you need to come up here and tell the students to go back to class?"  I said, "I'm not coming.  I'm not going to tell them to go back to class until they agree inside that they can have a black history assembly."  So they agreed and I was the first speaker at the black history assembly at Pensacola High School.
Story_ID: 379590
Speaker 1: The following year, the students wanted me to speak at Woodham High School [Pensacola, Florida] and some of the colored teachers out there fought it and said that that school was not ready for me because I was too militant?  Whatever the case might was, I guess that was it.  And, and my thinking was always that being militant is merely pursuing that which rightfully belongs to you.  That, that was my definition of militant, but they didn't see it that way.  And then the next big thing with the high school was at Escambia High, when the black students went--the African American students went to Escambia High School [Pensacola, Florida], they played 'Dixie' and we didn't complain too much about the rebel flag, the use of it.  We complained about the misuse of it because they were flaunting it in the face of the black students, and that's when the big, big push against the school system when we took the kids out of school and had Freedom Schools set up all over this county.  We had Freedom Schools in Allen Chapel [Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, Pensacola, Florida], the church and several other areas where the black kids were being taught by retired African American teachers and they were getting all of the subject matter that they needed.  As a matter of fact, I set up some down in DeFuniak Springs [Florida] and in Chipley [Florida].  So, we finally got the name Rebel, which was the name of the school, Escambia High Rebels.  We got that removed.  They changed the name of the football team to the One Hundreds or something and they didn't win a game the following year.  But that was the biggest push as it relates to schools.  There were rioting going--there was rioting going out at the school and, and I always said they blamed me for everything that happened here.  If Santa Claus didn't come, they'd blame H. K. Matthews [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews].  Easter Bunny didn't lay no eggs, they'd blame H. K. Matthews.  I was in Evergreen [Florida], pastoring a church in Evergreen and living up there when one of the last riots broke out at Escambia High School and they said it was my fault.  (Laughter) You know, I, I was responsible for it.  I'm, I'm a hundred miles away, but I'm responsible for the riots that took place.
Story_ID: 379591
Speaker 1: And that was also one of my first felony arrests at Escambia High School [Pensacola, Florida] because when they were having the rioting, the, the principal called me to come out there because they could do nothing with the--with the black kids.  And he had me up in his office and the white parents found out I was there, and they were trying to break the door down to get in there to me.  I don't know what they were going to do to me.  I mean, I wasn't anxious to find out.  And then when they did--the deputies did get the white parents away from there, they took me down in the courtyard where the kids were waiting to get on the bus, on--and, and the kids saw me and started running toward me and saying, "Reverend Matthews [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], they're going to take us to jail," and the principal turned to me and said, "Nobody is going to jail.  We're going to take the kids home."  So on the strength of that, I got the bullhorn from a deputy sheriff, stood up on the steps of the bus and said, "Nobody is going to jail."  And when I said that, the deputies moved in and arrested me along with several other students, took us to jail.  We were in the outer court at the jail--outer court yard, and it took them about an hour to decide what we were being charged with.  So they finally charged us with--charged me with inciting and encouraging a riot and let me sign my bond and the bond of all of the students which was inconsistent with the charge.  If I'm charged with inciting a riot and encouraging a riot and you're going to let me sign a thousand dollar bond and then sign a bond for all of the other co-conspirators or whatever you want to call them, that didn't seem too consistent to me, and then they let us go.  And when we went to trial on that charge, the deputies couldn't get--that's the thing about a lie, you can't ever get it straight.  The deputies couldn't get the lie straight and they were out in the hall arguing back, "Yeah, he said this" and they said, "No, he said this" and the, the--so they couldn't get it straight.  So we were--we were acquitted by an all-white jury which gave me a little faith in the system, but I--it was soon to be dashed.
Story_ID: 379592
Speaker 1: Tell me about your forays into the business community.  The forays into the business community.
Speaker 2: Well, what, what--
Speaker 1: Employment discrimination.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Not being served.  You, you got involved in sit-ins and--
Speaker 2: Well, we just--we, we had the sit-ins, we had the sit-ins and they were--the sit-ins here were very unpleasant experiences for a while because the police--well first of all, the white kids would, would come in and, and burn some of the sit-in demonstrators with cigarette butts, throw acid on them.  And the police would take--would go to a rack and take cigar--I mean, flashlight batteries off the rack, come and stick them in the kids' pockets and arrest them for shoplifting.  I mean we, we had--we had to fight the police as well as the other people.  The police were--it was kind of like they said to--you know, this woman went to the door or she heard a noise on the door and, and said, "Somebody's trying to break in," and the man said, "Well let them in--you know--and take his badge number and call him tomorrow when he comes to work--call us tomorrow when he comes to work."  But anyway, the police were as adamantly opposed to our activities as were some of the other people.  The sheriff that we have now in this county, Sheriff Ron McNesby, was a deputy.  He wasn't on the city police force, but he was one of the few people--and he's white--he was one of the few people in this city who stood up for us.  He made sure that we were protected.  He did not go along with the kind of stuff that they were doing.  And this, this is why right now--you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a Democrat, he's a Republican, doesn't matter.  Nope.  I support him in whatever he wants to do.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: M-C-N-E-S-B-Y, McNesby.  Ron McNesby.
Speaker 1: On another spelling, Escambia is spelled?
Speaker 2: E-S-C-A-M-B-I-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And that's a county?  That's the county you're in?  Is that Esca--is this Escambia County?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  This is Escambia County and in Brewton [Alabama] where I lived, there's also Escambia County.  There's Escambia County, Alabama and Escambia County, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went from one mess to the other.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Story_ID: 379593
Speaker 1: Well, the big mess.  I guess you can call it that.
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Took some interesting turns.  There was a black gentleman by the name of Wendel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Blackwell [Wendel Blackwell].
Speaker 1: --Blackwell, who was shot by a deputy and we'll name him later (clears throat) in I believe December of 1974?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And the proceedings following that led you to be arrested and--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --so tell me about your response to the shooting of Wendel Blackwell by Deputy Raines, was it?
Speaker 2: Doug Raines [Douglas Raines].
Speaker 1: Doug Raines, he was the deputy.  Tell how did--what was that incident and then tell us what happened following that.
Speaker 2: Wendel Blackwell was leaving a, a nightclub.  I think it was Club 400 out in Olive Place [sic. Olive Road], out 29 [U.S. Route 29] and story is that he had--he had a young lady by the name of Deborah [ph.].  I can't think of Deborah's last name, but she was in the car with Wendel Blackwell.  And it is alleged that Deputy Raines spotted that car and wanted to get Deborah out of the car with Wendel Blackwell because allegedly he was having an affair with Deborah.  And Wendel was driving the car and a hot chase ensued out on Diamond Dairy Road, out 29, and when the car was stopped, Raines had a civilian passenger riding with him which shouldn't have been.  Anyway he was--and when the car was stopped and he ordered Blackwell out of the car and Blackwell got out of the vehicle and he ordered him to put his hands behind his head (demonstrates), and he put his hands behind his head in this manner from what we understood.  Raines got out with his--what's that--.357 Magnum.  Is that, that--that is it.  The .357 Magnum not .457, .357 Magnum, and instead of aiming to wound, he aimed to kill.  He blew Blackwell's brains out from a distance of three feet and then what we believe, he planted a dropped gun because Blackwell had his hands behind his head and there's no way if you hit somebody with a .357 Magnum in the head and he just lay down--I mean, that's not going to happen.  Logic dictates that that does not happen.  So, then he reached under Blackwell's head and pulled a twenty-two caliber pistol from under his head.  Well, Blackwell--I didn't get involved because of this, but Blackwell was a cousin of mine.  And we got word of the killing and, of course, as I say, I had the reputation of pursuing answers (unclear) and naturally I got involved because we felt from the very beginning it was a case of murder.  And the only tune that the sheriff's department at that time could sing was justifiable homicide.  They didn't know the lyrics, they just knew the refrain, justifiable homicide.  For anything that happened to an African American if they were killed, the--it, it was always justifiable homicide.
Story_ID: 379594
Speaker 1: What was the testimony of Deborah [ph.] and the civilian passenger in Raines' [Douglas Raines] car?  What, what was their testimony (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know, the, the testimony of the civilian was never quite clear to me.
Speaker 1: And what about the young lady?
Speaker 2: Deborah never got a chance to testify and I'll tell you why.  Reverend Brooks and I, B.J. Brooks [B.J. Brooks, Sr.], who was at that time the president of the adult branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], talked with Deborah and we found out that the, the mobile home that Deborah was staying in was registered in the name of Doug Raines.  That was--he had purchased that trailer.  We made the mistake of announcing that, that we were going to pursue that further after we talked to her initially.  So, we were going to pursue her--pursue that further.  But before we got a chance to do that, they killed Deborah, threw her off the viaduct up around Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School, Pensacola, Fla.] with her panties wrapped around her neck.  People have reported seeing Doug Raines' camper in that area.  That murder 'til this day remains unsolved.  So that, that shot that.  We didn't get a chance to talk with her again.
Speaker 1: So you and Brooks then led a protest?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, along with other ministers in the community, Otha Leverette and James Young and K.C. Bass and Nathaniel Smith.  Just a group of the ministers led a protest against that killing--both killings (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At the courthouse?  Was that at the courthouse you went on that?
Speaker 2: Well, if you see some of those pictures (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --that I've got a book.  It was all over the courthouse, up and down the streets, at the jail and--but basically during that time, most of our demonstrations were in front of the county jail.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where the, the final arrest took place was in front of the county jail.
Story_ID: 379595
Speaker 1: Tell us about your arrest and Brooks' [B.J. Brooks, Sr.] arrest and what followed?
Speaker 2: Okay.  We, we had been going to the county jail on a nightly basis.  We were holding mass meetings at, at Reverend Brooks' church on Gadsden Street [Pensacola, Florida], and we would make our plans to leave there and take a caravan--you know, sometime fifty or sixty cars to the county jail.  However, every night before we got to the jail, they were waiting for us because there was an informer and I found out later that the informer was a police person who is going back, but he was supposed to have been one of us, who was going back telling them when to expect us, you know (laughter).  So, so word got there before we did, and so we were going out there nightly and we were having demonstrations, and we were--we would clear the paths so that the employees could go in and out.  We were not blocking their path.  We were not trying to present--prevent them from doing--excuse me--their duties, and we would--we'd sing a chant.  We had--we had been to Tallahassee [Florida].  Our original chant was "Two, four, six, eight, who shall we incarcerate?  Untrying to arraign Askew [Reubin Askew] the whole damn bunch."  Askew was the governor at that time.  So, we went to Tallahassee and Governor Askew assured us that he was not pleased with the way we were being dealt with up there and that he was sensitive to what we were about.  So when we got back, Reverend Jimmy Lee Savage, a young Baptist minister, we went out to the jail that night.  I lead a song and a prayer and Reverend Savage said, "Now, we're going to do the 'two, four, six, eight' chant," and he said, "Since the governor has shown that he's sensitive to our cause, we're going to leave his name off."  So he, he would--he would start the chant, "'Two, four, six, eight, who shall We incarcerate?  Untrying to arraign the whole damn bunch.'"  Well, the deputies moved in.  They gave us two minutes to disperse.  I think it was a minute and about eight seconds or eighteen seconds they waded into us with billy whip clubs and their canisters and I had enough of that in 1965 (laughter).  But, they waded into us and they arrested Reverend Brooks, Reverend Leverette [Otha Leverette] and myself and several other demonstrators.  They all went to get bonded out and when Reverend Brooks and I went to get bonded out, our bond--everybody's bond was two thousand dollars which was a two hundred dollar cash bond.  We went to get bonded out.  Ours was twenty thousand dollars because--twenty-two thousand dollars, I'm sorry, because of the illegal--unlawful assembly, illegal trespass, and the felony charge of extortion, extortion by threat in that we were trying to force the sheriff to do something against his will.  So, we stayed in jail until Dr. Donald Dale Spitts [ph.], an African American dentist here, bonded us out with our bond was twenty--as I said, twenty-two thousand dollars, two thousand on the two misdemeanor charges and twenty thousand on, on the felony charge.  And one of the writers for the St. Petersburg Times [Tampa Bay Times] said that, "It, it was like something that would be plucked from a book that was written by Alexander Solzhenitsyn because of the--."  It was so weird.  It was so unbelievable, you know.  A statute that hadn't been used in years, but they, they used it on us.
Story_ID: 379596
Speaker 1: So we went to trial.  Reverend [B.J. Brooks, Sr.]--everybody, I'm the only blessed person who was blessed enough to have to serve jail time.  Everybody else was given probation or a suspended sentence because they--they breathed a sigh of relief because they knew they had gotten me off the street.
Speaker 2: And that jail sentence was for how long?
Speaker 1: The jail--for the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The sentencing for jail?
Speaker 1: For the misdemeanors or for the felony?
Speaker 2: The felony?
Speaker 1: Five years.  Five years hard labor, the state penitentiary.
Speaker 2: And how much time did you spend there?
Speaker 1: Okay.  The first time, I, I, I went twice.  First time I went, I spent thirty days, got released on an appeal bond to the fifth cir-, fifth or eleventh circuit court of appeals.  I think it might have been the fifth circuit court of appeals [sic. U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit].  You have to remember that's been thirty-some odd years ago.  And then I got out on appeal.  They sent me back when the-, they--when they denied the appeal.  They sent me back and I stayed thirty-three days.  Got out the next time on an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court and there were only two dissentions, so I had to go back for the next--I was scheduled to go back and I called Governor Askew [Reubin Askew] and I said to him, "Reubin, they're getting ready to send me back to jail," because I knew him from here.  I encouraged him to run for governor when he did.  He told me, he said, "H. K. [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], go home, go to bed, go to sleep, don't worry about it.  You're not going back to jail."  So at that point, he moved to commute my sentence.  He didn't--he said he didn't want to give me a pardon because if he gave me a pardon, that would render my case moot and he wanted it to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which it did and they denied to hear it based on a technicality.  So, he gave--he commuted my sentence and they were getting ready to--after my commutation rather, Governor Bob Graham took over who is now Senator Graham, I think.  I called him or I wrote him a letter and asked for a pardon, and he gave me a pardon.  I think that article might have been in that (unclear) thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 379597
Speaker 1: Well, we have to back up from that certainly to--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, was I rattling?
Speaker 1: No, no.  No, no.  No, that's perfect.  We now have to back up to--from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll have the major civil rights marches, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Led by Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Okay, but he was not there on the first march.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  But I'm talking about the Edmund Pettus [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm--
Speaker 1: Tell me about your work with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] here in Pensacola [Florida] and your joining the ministers and Martin's call to come to Selma.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I, I founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in this, in this county [Escambia County, Florida].  I, I brought it here.  I founded it and was the first president of it.  We needed it because SCLC was a little more proactive than NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  You, you know there were limitations in NAACP.  You couldn't use the word boycott.  There were a lot of things that kind of--it was an effective tool.  It's the oldest civil rights organization, but we didn't have quite as many restrictions with SCLC as we had with the NAACP because I was a part of both worlds.  And I founded it here and we've--this because we were continued boycotting the businesses here in Pensacola.  We could use that word (laughter), but we called it selective buying and to get--after we got to the point to we could go into the places, we didn't have the wherewithal to come out, you know.  (Laughter) We could go in an order quail in the glass or pheasant and (laughter), but we couldn't pay for it.  So anyway, our big push then was, was employment, getting people employed even though we had access to the public accommodations.  But I was working as--I was working then--where was I working?  At the Florida state employment service or wherever I was working.  I--when the call went out, I had a 1957 pink and blue Ford Fairlane and when the call went out to come to Selma, I said, "Well here I am, a leader in the community here, so I need to get exposed to some of this stuff."  Little did I know that my exposure would be (pause) a little hurtful.  I think had I known when I left here going to Selma what I was going to face when I got there, I probably would have stayed (laughter), stayed in the safe haven of Pensacola, which was not that safe even at that time.  But I went and I was--I was not a leader in the Selma and Montgomery march [Selma to Montgomery March].  I was a face in the crowd.  I was a part of the crowd but, they were very indiscriminate (cough) as to who they whooped.  And, I guess one of them billy whip clubs had my name on it or either, to whom it may concern, and so I caught one.
Speaker 1: Let's--we'll pick it up right there.  How far back were you in the procession (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was about midway.
Speaker 1: --as you--as you crossed?
Speaker 2: Maybe, maybe, maybe not--maybe not midway.  Maybe a little closer to the front.
Story_ID: 379357
Speaker 1: You joined Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the other soldiers in SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and you were a leader in SCLC here, Pensacola [Florida].  Tell us about Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama] and that march [Selma to Montgomery March].
Speaker 2: Now, we--I was really, as, as I say, I was a face in the crowd, however, I knew the purpose.  The purpose was trying to get a voting rights act passed.  And I considered myself and the people did here, a leader in the African American community and I felt that in order for me to represent myself as a leader or represent this community as a leader, I need to be involved in something that was broader than Pensacola and Chipley [Florida] and DeFuniak Springs [Florida] in those areas.  And, and, and so when the call went out for people to come to Selma [Alabama], I answered the call.  I--you know, I got in my little blue--my pink and white Ford and I, I went to Selma and all, all I wanted to do was just be out.  I didn't care if I was at the tail, or the middle or wherever I was.  I wanted to be in a part of something that was going to make a significant change in the life of this country.  First of all, I served in Korea.  I was disappointed that I had fought against an enemy who could come over here and have more privileges than I had.  And so I, I just wanted to be a part of that.  I, I was not thinking about a part of history making, that was not--that was the furthest thing from my mind.  The thing for my mind was the fact that yeah, our people are unable to vote, you know, freely.  You know, who, who, who wants an interpreter, consulter.  Who can?  You know, who wants to pay poll tax.  Who wants to do all of this stuff just to be able to pull a lever or to vote?  So, you know, that was an opportunity for me to assert myself whether anybody noticed me or not.  And so that was my rationale, my reasoning for hooking up with that march because I wanted to be a part of something, something greater than sit-ins and selective buying campaigns--
Story_ID: 379358
Speaker 1: How did you feel that afternoon as you walked to the bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama] and attempted to go over the bridge?  How were you feeling?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Scared.  Scared.  And wondering, seeing everything that took place, how could human beings do what they did to other human beings.  Couldn't understand it.  I, I--that, that was a, a classic case of man's inhumanity to man that Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] talked about so often.
Speaker 1: Now you were injured that afternoon; is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I don't know if that club had my name on it or it just had to whom it may concern, but I did get hit (laughter) several times and, of course, the most severe injury that I suffered was my left knee that I went to the doctor with a bruised knee.  I felt, I thought, and he did, too.  He said--I don't even remember the doctor's name, but it was--it was an African American doctor, and later years it was diagnosed as having degenerative arthritis because of that.  So it's--
Speaker 1: Well, did you--did you crawl back or hobbled back to Brown Chapel [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hobbled back.  Hobbled back.
Speaker 1: You, you got back to Brown Chapel?
Speaker 2: I didn't go back to Brown Chapel.
Speaker 1: Where'd you go?
Speaker 2: I, I, we--I went to the doctor (laughter).
Speaker 1: Or you went to the doctor in that moment (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I went to the doctor and then went back to Brown Chapel because you know that McCloud [ph.] or whatever his name was, when he came on the bridge and said, "You, you are not allowed to--you will not be allowed to proceed.  Take your people back to the church."  And this is what--and see, [HistoryMaker] John Lewis was the most severely beaten.  He was crunched, see, because he and Hosea Williams, Walter Reuther, several of the rest of them were on the front lines.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] I think, was on the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Um-hm.  So and he said, "You won't--you, you won't be allowed to continue.  Take your people back to the church."
Speaker 1: So you went to the doctor and then you came back to Brown Chapel?  Where'd you spend that evening?
Speaker 2: Oh, I came back to Pensacola [Florida].
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you didn't make the march?
Speaker 2: I didn't make the march all the way.
Speaker 1: I see, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Just the--I, I made the march partially and got brought back to Brown.  After I went back to Brown Chapel from the doctor, went and we went a ways, like to Hayneville [Alabama] and then I came back--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and went back to Pensacola.
Story_ID: 379359
Speaker 1: Did you have contact and, and presence with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] before he was assassinated?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I worked with him in, in several areas as Martin III [Martin Luther King III] mentioned when he came to Pensacola [Florida] about the time that I'd worked with his father.  So, we--I was just a part of the group.  Yeah, and I was never considered part of the inner circle.  I, you know, I wasn't in the inner sanctum, but I was just there putting in, in my little two cent worth and, and, and putting in what I was able to do as a humanitarian.  I called myself a humanitarian.  My, my thing was never--I, I have never sought publicity that--I mean, it, it was like I was saying today, if you do something, there're, there're three ways to get publicity: do nothing, do something good, and do something bad.  If you just seek it, most time you don't get it because folk ain't gonna fool with you if they know that's what you out for.  And I think that's the problem today, they're not leaders across this country and I know in this town they're not committed leaders.  There was one committed man, I think, that was in this town and, and he was president of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and he's no longer president of SCLC, and there was a young man by the name of Ellison Bennett.  And I'd asked him to be here today, but I guess he's working.  He couldn't come.  But he led the SCLC in this city and he was not reelected to that post, but he had commitment to the movement.  He was not concerned about the press, electronic or printed.  He didn't care.  He just wanted to do something to help.
Story_ID: 379360
Speaker 1: Well, that's, that's the role that you played.  You, you sacrificed a lot.  You risked, as you say, you had injury.  You were scared when you went to Edmund Pettus [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama]--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  You lost a lot.  Why did you risk so much in the ways that you did?  Even going to jail and, and so why did you risk so much?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't set out to risk, but I feel that there are certain things that people are ordained by the Almighty to do.  I feel that God--and, and, and had He not ordained me to do that, I don't think He would have protected me as well as he did.  I feel that He ordained me to do certain things, that, that even my family at times did not understand.  You know, why're you doing this?  There was not a definitive answer that I could give them as to why I'm doing this.  I'm doing it because it needs to be done.  I'm doing it because I think the Lord is depending on me to do it.  And, and so that was--might have been a dumb answer, but that was all I could give them.
Story_ID: 379361
Speaker 1: Let's make a little turn here.  You mentioned family. Tell me about your children?  Do you have grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your children first of all.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I've got a son who is fifty-six years old who lives in Los Angeles, California.  We lost contact after (pause) another situation developed.  So, I don't know how he's doing.  I don't know--I guess he's in Los Angeles and I do know he has--last I heard from him he had three children.  He'd, he'd called me when he had read something about me in Jet magazine when he was overseas.  Okay.  So our contact has been--you know, nothing.  We haven't had contact.  Now, I've got a twenty-six-year-old son [Christopher Matthews], soon will be twenty-seven; thirty-seven-year-old daughter who is a lieutenant commander in the [U.S.] Navy.  My son is--was working and now he's unemployed because he got laid off just (laughs) the other day and he's in Brewton [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Are their names on the questionnaire that you filled out? Did you put in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I can get that information.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What does he do in Brewton?
Speaker 2: Well, he's looking for a job.  He called me earlier today when I was over at Art's [Arthur Rocca (ph.)] place.  He's, he's, he's--
Speaker 1: Do you have grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The picture of one is in that book ['Victory After the Fall,' Reverend H. K. Matthews with J. Michael Butler].  The name is Taylor Stood [ph.].  I'll, I'll try and find it for you.
Story_ID: 379362
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the book because I'm an author and I, I value writings.  This is a book that you said, soon to be published.  Why don't you just hold it up, we'll get it on the screen.
Speaker 2: Scheduled--
Speaker 1: And on the camera.
Speaker 2: --scheduled pub date is December of this year.
Speaker 1: And the title?
Speaker 2: 'Victory After the Fall' [Reverend H. K. Matthews with J. Michael Butler].
Speaker 1: What's in the book?  Tell me what's in there.
Speaker 2: The--I guess, it's, it's been an odyssey for the past several years.  I've been wanting to do--at least I had given thought to the book.  But that then--so many people who encouraged me to put my experiences in writing.  And of course the name came about in a strange way because I had fallen all the way down with nothing and after I got released from the penitentiary, I wanted to show you my--after I got released from the penitentiary, then I went to Alabama.  Moved to Brewton, Alabama where I was assigned to Brewton as a pastor of a church [Zion Fountain A.M.E., Brewton, Alabama], the same church I pastor now.  I've been there twenty-, twenty-eight--twenty-nine years.  And so, I got hired at Jefferson Davis Community College [Jefferson Davis Junior College; Jefferson Davis Community College Atmore Campus, Atmore, Alabama] as a financial aid clerk working in a building that was called the George C. Wallace administration building (laughter).  And, and so, I, I, I considered that a victory because I had fallen so far and the people in Pensacola [Florida], including African Americans, would not give me a job.  They were afraid.  They wouldn't give me a job.  They wouldn't touch me with a ten foot pole.  So, my bishop--
Speaker 1: This was following the jailing and your commutation?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In, in coming back to Pensacola where I, I, I pastored this church [St. Mark A.M.E. Zion Church, Pensacola, Florida].  As I said, this is the last church that I pastored before I, I moved to the--out of the area.  And so--what was I saying?  Anyway, I came back to the area and, and got hired at Jefferson Davis and I considered that a victory.  So, I--the, the, the name--I didn't come up with the name, somebody else came up with the name 'Victory After the Fall,' and I latched on to it because I thought it was quite apropos.  So, that's what I did.  This is a--now this is my son [Christopher Matthews], the youngest one, and that's him right there, the two of us in Honolulu [Hawaii] in '02 [2002], and this is his daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we have some pictures, I think, of them over here that we'll shoot on the camera later (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 379363
Speaker 1: So you've been pastoring twenty-nine years; is that correct?
Speaker 2: No, I've been pastoring forty years.
Speaker 1: No, I mean in Brewton [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: In Brewton, yeah.  Twenty-nine years.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now tell me about your congregation today and tell me about your church today.
Speaker 2: It, it's a small congregation, but it's a supportive congregation and we--a full-time church [Zion Fountain A.M.E., Brewton, Alabama].  And then in addition to my church, then I have fourteen other churches that I'm responsible for because I said I was a presiding elder and, of course, they call it in the United Methodist Church, district superintendent, where I serve as presiding elder.  And I've held that post for the past twenty-two years.  I just--they just celebrated a twenty-second year appreciation for me the other Sunday.

Speaker 1: Is all that in your book ['Victory After the Fall,' Reverend H. K. Matthews with J. Michael Butler]?  Is that all--the present ministry is that in your book?
Speaker 2: I don't think much of it is, no.  I don't know what all is in it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Let me ask you to read your book.  Would you read some of the chapters to us, 'cause I think they're quite descriptive.  Just read a few of the chapter titles on the table of contents.
Speaker 2: What did I do with my glasses?
Speaker 1: I think (unclear).  Are they reading?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  In your jacket pocket maybe?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Are they reading?  Reading?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see. They might be over there some place.  They, they gotta be somewhere 'cause I, I, I--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  These are not them, are they?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: No.  I brung them in.  I know I brought them in here.
Speaker 1: I was interested in the--these I think.  Just read this--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What about your jacket?
Speaker 1: They might be in there, Art [Arthur Rocca (ph.)].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I feel something.
Speaker 1: You feel something in my jacket?  Oh, that's my pistol.  (Laughter)  No, I don't--I don't know where it is.  I don't where--they're, they're here in this room--in this room somewhere.  I don't go without them or either they're in my car.  Okay.  The arrest and their effects?  That's on page 179.
Speaker 2: So you talk about the effects of the--of many of the arrests or, or--?
Speaker 1: I, I think this basically is the, the felony arrest.  I'm not sure.  (Reading) "The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] continued to organize mass meetings after we met with Governor Reubin Askew in Tallahassee [Florida] on January 31st, 1975.  The forums actually energized the movement leaders, particularly myself because I thought the governor would intervene on our behalf and work to ensure racial justice in Pensacola [Florida].  In fact, a few days after our meeting at the state capitol, Governor Askew called Escambia County sheriff, Royal Untreiner and urged him to meet with NAACP and SCLC representatives to hear our grievances.  Untreiner agreed to meet with us on February 21st, which was the first time during the Blackwell [Wendel Blackwell] crisis that he acknowledged any black leader.  We welcomed the opportunity to present our prospective to Untreiner, but we did not expect much to come of the meeting.  He harbored who we believed was a murderer and showed no signs of addressing our main request which was the termination--the termination of Douglas Raines.  While Reverend Goodwin [ph.], Reverend Brooks [B.J. Brooks, Sr.] and I awaited the meeting with county officials, we continued our mass meetings and demonstrations at the sheriff's department.  Each occurred on almost a nightly basis.  The church continued to overflow with folks who were fed up with the way blacks in Pensacola were being treated.  After we returned from Tallahassee, the congregation actually spilled outside of the assembly hall and into the street.  When the meetings ended, usually between three and five hundred people carried our protest to the jail.  We followed the same routine every night at the Escambia County jail.  We marched, sang, carried protest signs and prayed.  What we did not realize however, was that we were being monitored by one of Royal Untreiner's most trusted assistants.  From February 6th to February 18th, Sergeant Jim Edson filed nightly reports that documented our activities at the downtown--at the jail.  Jim Edson commanded the riot and crowd control division of the Escambia County Sheriff's Department.  I knew Jim Edson before the Blackwell situation because he was often one of the main deputies in charge of calming the chaos that consumed Escambia High School [Pensacola, Florida] two years earlier.  We even joked at times about meeting so often on the campus.  Yet Edson was a hardcore racist who did everything he could to harass blacks and impede racial justice in northwest Florida."
Speaker 2: I think that gives us a good flavor of, of the situation at the time.

Speaker 1: Give me a couple more of chapters [from 'Victory After the Fall,' Reverend H. K. Matthews with J. Michael Butler] that kind of caught my eye.  (Pause)  Well, you talked about the fall.  You talked about SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  So you--we were really cov-, covered some of this.  The legal lynching, what was--what, what does that cover?  You don't have to read it, but does that chapter covers legal lynching as you moved down to the end?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  I, I'd better look at it, 'cause like I say, I don't remember a lot of this stuff.  I guess I must have been talking about the death penalty, probably because that's what I've always described it as.  The (pause)--I, I described it as a legal lynching because we--I always felt that that's all the death penalty was.
Speaker 1: (Pause) I was just reading a bit of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I might have.  I can.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I might've even described the legal lynching as being the time that they just hung me out to dry when they--when they sentenced me to those five years.  That, that, that could have been it. I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, this reads very well.  It reads very well.  It's really, really right up front and intimate.
Story_ID: 379366
Speaker 1: Did you reach a time when you thought that you needed to step away from the movement?  Was there ever a time when you had any bitterness even though you had victories?  Was there a time that you--that you really wanted to step, step back and let other people come in?
Speaker 2: There, there, there were times when I felt that younger blood was needed because the inference by some of the younger people were--was that we had served our usefulness and, and there were times that that was a little bit disturbing to me.  But as far as bitterness is concerned, I tried--I mean, I absolutely tried to be bitter and to hate, 'cause I've had white people right here in this town [Pensacola, Florida] say to me, "H. K. [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], I don't understand why you don't hate all white folk."  Well first of all, all white folk didn't do to me what was done to me.  Secondly, all white folk are not bad and all black people are not good.  Thirdly, I don't have time to hate and I really don't (laughter)--I've got too many, and, and, and fourthly, there, there, there's no room on my schedule for hate.  So, so, so hatred is ruled out.  Hatred to me is like acid.  It eats up the container.  So, so I don't want anything gnawing at my insides.  I want to be able to go home and sit down at night and eat my dinner without worrying about who I'm hating.  They--if, if people hate me, that's the price they gotta pay.  You know, I, I don't want to live here and catch hell and then die and go to hell.  I've got enough that I'm going to have to pay for.  The things that I've done.  So I, I don't want, want to add nothing on the plate.
Story_ID: 379367
Speaker 1: March 2006, I think there was a certain kind of vindication of your life and your work here.  What happened in March that I think surprised you--?
Speaker 2: Was it March or February?  You mean the--?
Speaker 1: Was it February 2006?
Speaker 2: The naming of the park [H. K. Matthews Park, Pensacola, Florida]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's what I--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was one of the things.  However, there have been other things that--one of the things, Movement for Change [Movement for Change, Inc., Pensacola, Florida], honored me in 2004 with a tremendous breakfast and stuff.  But prior to that, the--now I don't know, Art Rocca [Arthur Rocca (ph.)] was responsible for it, but I can't even think of the name, but I was given the Martin Luther King, Jr. award that year when [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory was here and several other people.  And, and, platitudes of things have been coming my way, but in February of 2006, the city council of this city, led by--well, initially the move was made by Ellison Bennett to the city council, but was led by Councilman John Jerralds and Ronald Townsend and Jewell Canada-Wynn and, and all--it really, all the members of the city council and the mayor, John Fogg, to name a park in my honor.  And, and I thought that was--that was good because normally when things are named after you, you have to be--you don't really see them, you know (laughter).  You kind of gone on.  So for them to do for me while I was still alive, and it was a unanimous vote, there were no dissensions from the city councilmen.  They all paid their respects and said good things about me that, that I really appreciated.  So, the hits as the song says are--as the television said, "The hits keep on coming" you know, and my wife [Bobbie Matthews] said, "Well maybe they gave you that honor because they gave--they named that park after you 'cause they gave you so much hell when you were young, they figure when you get old they'll do something for you."  I said, "Well regardless, I, I got it," you know and the park is not too far from here.  But that, that was a great honor for me and, of course, the church--the episcopal area that I'm in, Alabama-Florida episcopal area [Alabama-Florida Episcopal District], in 2005 gave me a--an honor.  They gave me an honorarium and in Greenville, Alabama at our annual conference.  Prior to that, the--at the Board of Bishops meeting in Birmingham [Alabama], they gave me an award.  I've forgotten what it was.  After that in 2005, I guess at the Board of Bishops meeting in Houston, Texas, they gave me the Paul Robeson Award [Paul Robeson Citation Award] and at the same time they were giving me the Paul Robeson Award in Houston, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] was holding its convention in Jacksonville [Florida] and they gave me in my absence, the Faithful Servant Award.  So, of course I've said if I could sell these plaques, I'd, I'd be in good shape or take them down to DHR [department of human resources] and try to exchange them for food stamps (laughter), but, but I'm appreciative of the honors.  I really am.  I really, really am.

Speaker 1: We have some wrap-up questions.  Then we'll go to the photographs and learn a little more detail.  For the first wrap-up question is this. Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview that I have not asked you about?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so, but, but I would be remiss if I allowed this interview to close without really-- and, and he doesn't want it, but without thanking Art Rocca [Arthur Rocca (ph.)] for, for making it possible, okay?  And I know he's not looking for that, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us--
Speaker 2: --I have to speak what I feel.
Speaker 1: --tell us who Art Rocca is because people are going to look at this interview, we should know who he is.  Who is Art Rocca?
Speaker 2: He's, he's some, some person somewhere.  Art Rocca is one of the most respected African American businessmen in the State of Florida, not Pensacola [Florida], in the State of Florida and throughout.  He's known all over the country.
Speaker 1: What is his business?  What does he do?
Speaker 2: He deals with, with schools.  He's, he's a, a--I guess a coordinator or director of, of all Florida schools and, and he in the past has had--has been responsible for charter schools in this area, and he has worked very closely with trying to provide an adequate education, an adequate forum for students, not just African American students, but for students to obtain an education that they otherwise might not be able to do because of economic conditions or, or other things.  So, he has through his actions demonstrated that he is, too, a humanitarian.
Speaker 1: Anything else you want to tell us about Arthur Rocca?
Speaker 2: Nah, I don't think so.  Just that he is--he's, he's a dear friend and, and I say about Art as I say about Ellison Bennett that true friends are like diamonds, precious and rare.  False friends are like autumn leaves found everywhere.  And of course those two people are certainly true friends.
Speaker 1: How do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of course, Art, Art is here with us today.  We--you know, I'm, I'm happy about that that he could take time out of his schedule to accompany me over here for, for this interview that he's responsible for.
Speaker 1: I really appreciate the fact that he had originally offered his office space for this interview--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --but moved it over here, which I think is even more significant to do this here--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --in St. Mark's A.M.E. Zion Church [St. Mark A.M.E. Zion Church, Pensacola, Florida].  So, I want to thank him for that and you, too.
Story_ID: 379369
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you have lived your life?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think the world owes me anything (laughter).  You know, I, I, I think I can say as one of the song writers said, "I, I, I've lived my life if I never get well no more."  I don't know who sang that (laughter), but I've had a good time if I never get well no more.  But I, I, I, I know that there are some voids in my life.  There are some things that I would have liked to have done.  For, for instance, I, I would have liked to, to have become a lawyer--you know, that I, I, I really wanted to be an attorney and, and I thin-, because I fought enough legal battles, not just for me, but for other people in this area until--you know, I almost hung my shingle out at one point because every time something went wrong, people called me again.  Not because I was that smart, but because I had a reputation of checking things out.
Speaker 1: That actually answers the next question.  Would you choose a different career path than the one you've been in?
Speaker 2: I, I think I would have a dual path.  I would be both minister and lawyer.
Speaker 1: Makes a lot of sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of--one of my dearest friends just died here not too long ago, John Hewlett, who was the first black sheriff in Lowndes County, Alabama in Hayneville.  So, he was a sheriff, and he was a preacher and he was a probate judge after he left the sheriff's office.
Story_ID: 379370
Speaker 1: Reverend Matthews [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], what do you still want to do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: I, I want to get off of the firing line because I'm still being called.  People who feel that they're in trouble because of racial issues are still calling me (laughter) and, and, and, I try to refer them to other people.  Even where I live now, I've become the community pastor when people have trouble with racial issues and, and I, I must admit that, that I'm getting to the point that it's becoming a burden because of my age.  At seventy-eight, I can't do what I did at forty-eight.  So, and I'm not claiming old age, but it reaches a point when you just become weary.  You become tired.  I have people to tell me that I should've--you know, I should've bowed out long time ago because I could've had anything I wanted if I'd just accepted some things that folk tried to bribe me into accepting.  Had I been in it for money, oh, I could've been pretty wealthy.  But there was monies offered to me to stop doing certain things and to make sure that other people stopped doing certain things as it relates to the movement.  It's always time for the movement.  The movement is not dead.  I, I think our leadership sometimes dies because the movement itself, and I think I said this early on, has to be fronted or lead by people who are interested not in themselves that much, but in those whom the Lord has called them to serve.  I think that was my role.  I think that's still my role.  I'm, I'm not--I'm not--you know, I'm a pinch hitter.  I'm, I'm not a regular player, but I'm still in the game and if I'm needed to pinch hit and the coach calls me--and that's the coach, then I get involved.  So, I have not forsaken by any stretch of the imagination, the movement--
Story_ID: 379371
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American communities of Alabama and northern Florida today?
Speaker 2: You know that I, I used to--I used to say that, you know, I would--I would love to see the day come when all of God's children are treated as equals.  Don't think I'll live to see that the way it's going.  I still want to see that.  But right now, I'd like to live to see African American young men pull their pants up and not wear them around their bottoms.  I'd like to live to see African American men treat their women with respect.  I'd like to see African American young women stop having babies when they're babies.  I'd like to see African Americans period become self-sufficient.  Not have to depend on a welfare system even though there are more white people on welfare basically than there're African Americans, and we're given that tag of being moochers off of the federal government.  It's not fair because there are, there are people who really need that help.  Those persons I have no problem with, but I do have problems with African American women piling up three and four children from three or four different fathers, and drawing a check from the tax dollars that you and I and him have generated.
Speaker 1: Any ideas how we can deal with that situation?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  And I could--I don't even want to hazard a guess because I don't know.  I'm, I'm--I, I wish I did.  I wish--I wish I had a magical answer or just an answer.  Not magical, just an answer.  But I think--I think somewhere along the line that our churches--a lot of our African American churches are failing our communities.  I, I, I--you know, if you are in the business of ministry for the purpose of healing, that's another thing, but if you're in the ministry for the purpose of seeing how many people you can drum out of something which I think is the case with a lot of our churches.  In all my singing, I'm, I'm a minister, been one for forty-five years and so, I don't care.  I have no qualms about saying what I'm saying, you know.  I, I, I think when you reach the point that your only concern or your major concern especially in the ministry is you, you've lost focus.
Story_ID: 379372
Speaker 1: You know, I could have been in areas that would've provided me with nice plush church, salary, automobile, but I don't think that's what I was cut out to be and do.  I feel much better with a congregation of fifty-five or sixty people who I know each one of them and when they get in trouble regardless of what time of night it is, they know that they call, I'm not going to be too busy to answer.  I don't have to have somebody for them to go through to get to me.  The only person they have to go through to get to me is if they call my house is my wife [Bobbie Matthews].  And, and, and I, I don't--I don't want to ever reach a point that power and prestige and money causes me to change from being just a plain old country boy born, breed and reared in Snow Hill, Alabama.  There's another friend of mine that y'all have interviewed I think at some point or another was [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Tillman and Dorothy Tillman's home is here.  She is an alderman in Chicago [Illinois], but her home is here.  She's, she's a dear friend.  But I, I, I just don't know what's going to happen to us unless there's some commitment that rises up out of the dust and people become more concerned, and I know I varied just then but, more concern about their fellow man, or at least concerned.  We've got too many of the priests and the Levites who are looking at folks' needs and passing by and if not doing that, they're going over and looking down and adding insult to injury in passing by, which means that church membership itself does not guarantee a Christian response to people's needs.  The Good Samaritan who probably didn't even belong to a church came along and helped the man.  Probably said to the innkeeper, "I don't know who this fellow is.  I found him on the side of the road.  Somebody's done him wrong.  Take care of him.  I'll pay you."  But the priest had to hurry up and get to prayer meeting probably.  The Levite had to hurry up and get to choir practice, but they left the man.  So, until people get the spirit of the Samaritan in them--not just for African Americans, we, we here in this City of Pensacola [Florida].  I want to feel help to free a lot of white people who were burden down by the--who, who were just beat down by the burden of feeling that they had to--in order for them to make it, they had to walk on their black sisters and brothers.  And so I think in that sense, we freed some white people.
Speaker 2: One last question.  Reverend Matthews [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 1: I want to be remembered as one who cared.  That's it.
Speaker 2: Perfect.  Thank you so much for sharing.
Story_ID: 379373
Speaker 1: Okay.  That, that's--as I mentioned early on, my father [John Matthews, Sr.] lived in Camden, Alabama and of course, we--my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Purifoy Johnson] and I would catch the bus, the Greyhound bus to ride down to Camden.  It was eighteen miles away.  There were no paved roads, there was just dirt roads, and she would have a little nap sack under her arm and she'd be holding onto me with her hand and she would have her hand holding onto the strap.  I don't know if you remember the straps that use to come down from the rail of the bus.  It's been years since I've ridden a bus, but we would be standing in the aisle and that bus would be bobbing and weaving around those dirt roads and we'd be standing in the aisle not because there were no vacant seats, but because there were vacant seats all in the front, and we couldn't sit down because we were the wrong color.  We were--we were black, and I used to look at my grandmother with tears in my eyes and said, "Mother, why is it that they treat us like they do?" and I was a little fella.  And she would look at me and say, "That's all right, baby.  That's all right.  Life is like a revolving wheel.  Those who on top today will be on the bottom tomorrow," and if she didn't say that, she just said, "After a while, the bottom rail is going to come to the top."  And I guess that's why that old lady is the dearest thing, even today.  Even though she's been dead for forty-seven or forty-eight years, is still dear to me because she instilled in me the pride, the ability to know right from wrong, and I, I, I just love her to death even now.
Speaker 2: How old was she when this was taken approximately?
Speaker 1: I don't know exactly how old my grandmother was when she died.  She died back in the early '50s [1950s] or the late '50s [1950s], and she was in her eighties I can imagine.  I think she was born out in the--she was born in 1896 I think, and I'm just not sure how old she would've been when she died.
Speaker 2: I know this is cracked, but it's an earlier, younger picture of the Reverend [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews].
Speaker 1: I, I--I'm not sure what that picture represents if anything.
Speaker 2: Well how old where you so that I can submit--?
Speaker 1: I was--I don't know, maybe twenty-eight, twenty-nine.  Even had hair at that time, but it was--that picture was taken right here in Pensacola [Florida] on 12th Avenue by a man--I can't even think of the photographer's name, but it was taken here, and I was in my either late twenties or early thirties.
Speaker 2: Hold on please.  Wait.  I'm not done.
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead.  (Pause) Do we have any more 8 x 10 size?  Remember, we usually (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Picture was taken, I guess twenty years ago.  It's when my son was--my youngest son was about six.  A very innocent young fella at that age and time.  Much has changed since then (laughter), but that's--.
Speaker 2: His name?
Speaker 1: His name is Christopher Jonathan Matthews [Christopher Matthews].  My--he's still my pride and joy, aside from his daughter.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead.  Keep it--could you keep him centered on the stand?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just right in the middle.  Great.  Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the day after I had been pronounced guilty for extortion and sentenced to five years in the state penitentiary, and I was being led back to the county jail in preparation for shipment to the state penitentiary.  Didn't know how it was going to be as quick as it was, but they woke me up at two o'clock the following morning and transported me to the state penitentiary handcuffed to a little white boy who tried to entice me to run because he had been advised to do that so that they could shoot me and say that I was trying to escape.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: That, that picture was taken in 1979 or '80 [1980] at Jefferson Davis Junior College [Jefferson Davis Community College Atmore Campus, Atmore, Alabama] at the time when it was a year that Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] ran for president and Martin King III [Martin Luther King III], and this is--I, I can't even think of his name.  He was--he was a recording artist--gospel recording artist came down and that's him, Martin III, me in the center facing out, and of course Reverend George McCormick who was president of Jefferson Davis at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture (laughter)--I guess must have been in 1951 or '52 [1952] in the jungles of South Korea.  The units had not too long since been integrated, and the young man on my right and, and is a man by the name of Holland Head [ph.].  I've forgotten his, his first name and then me and then a young man by the name of Hall [ph.], and I don't know the other young man's name, but we were all in the unit together.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968] I think it was a year that Hubert Humphrey made his last run for president.  I coordinated his campaign in the State of Florida.  I was his minority campaign coordinator in the State of Florida.  He and--he came down and Lorne Greene of, of 'Bonanza.'  We worked together on the Humphrey campaign.  (Pause) That picture was taken in Evergreen, Alabama probably in 19--probably when I first went to Evergreen, first moved back to Alabama, '74 [1974], '75 [1975].  We had a march on Memorial--not Memorial Day, Independence Day.  We had a march to demonstrate that we were not quite that independent.  There was a young man that came down from Chicago [Illinois] by the name of Freddie Rogers who was involved and, and who got me to following that to come to Chicago and, and speak at Operation Breadbasket [Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.
Speaker 2: A little bit to your left with the photo.
Speaker 1: This right here?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960], we had formed a--with Toastmasters Club, Toastmasters International, which is my--which was my springboard really for doing public speaking.  I had never experienced that too much, and that helped me with my deliveries when I went into the ministry in that same year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly what year that was but as you see, I'm standing in the center and the gentleman to my right with a white hat on is my father, John Henry Matthews [John Matthews, Sr.], and the gentleman to my left is my father's brother--my uncle, James Matthews.
Speaker 1: Hold on please, still working.  (Pause)  Got it.  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: That I believe was in 1998.  I was enstooled by the Kwanzaa Committee of Pensacola [Florida] and, of course, to my right is a bust that is supposed to be of me that was sponsored and paid for by Dan Bimbo, a local mortician here in Pensacola.  That bust now is, is housed in the library at Jefferson Davis Community College in Brewton, Alabama--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it's been there for a while.  That picture was taken in Montgomery, Alabama several years ago when my son was small.  We had been to Tuskegee [Alabama] and came back through Montgomery and as you see, I am on my left and your--yeah, I'm, I'm over here, the taller person, and in the center is [HistoryMaker] Tyrone Brooks who's a field--who was a field director for Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] at that time and who is now a state legislator in the State of Georgia, and to his left the gentleman with the beard is Reverend Fred Taylor [Fred D. Taylor], who is an organizer for SCLC.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: Let's go to the last one, Scott [Scott Stearns].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That picture standing behind the mic and gesturing is Martin King III [Martin Luther King III].  To his immediate left is H. K. Matthews [HistoryMaker Reverend H. K. Matthews], and to his immediate left is Alderman Dorothy Tillman [HistoryMaker Dorothy Tillman] from--an alderman from Chicago [Illinois].  That was a celebration of when Alcaniz Street the name was changed to Martin Luther King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Drive, Pensacola, Florida].  It had been such a struggle until we got Martin III to come and speak at that gathering.
