Speaker 1: And ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born June 25, 1952 in Annapolis, Maryland.  I was born in a clinic--Annapolis was still very segregated, my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] has told me these stories; and there were only a few black doctors in Annapolis, and Dr. Johnson [ph.] was the doctor who delivered me and he had his own little clinic where he could deliver babies.  So I think I was the first is what she told me, baby delivered at this clinic.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I am a journalist.  I currently do freelance editing.  I do some work for The Tennessee Tribune in Nashville, Tennessee.

Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Gallatin, Tennessee, about twenty-five miles north of Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the home of the famous radio station, WLAC [WLAC Radio], right, Gallatin, Tennessee [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm just learning about that.  I've only lived in Gallatin a couple of years and a couple of people have mentioned this radio station, I said, really?  Okay.  But it's--I mean it's no longer here, but.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were famous for the 'Night Train' [sic.] and all that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and black people all over the Midwest and the South listened to it.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah I didn't know about that.
Speaker 1: Late at night (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --get it on the radio.  Okay.
Story_ID: 660304
Speaker 1: Well before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is crabs.  I grew up in Annapolis [Maryland], and love to eat crabs (laughter).
Speaker 1: So do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is red, partly because I'm a member of Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], but I also like red because it conveys power, and it's a warm color.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is summer, partly because I was born in the summer and I like getting out early in the morning, and the sunshine on your face, so.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't really have a favorite destination.  I like to go to the beach when possible.  So and it can be a beach anywhere, it doesn't have to be in the states.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I will often say to my children [Sean Long and Shari Long] that I'm doing the best I can with what little I have; and making it into the best that it can be.
Story_ID: 660305
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  Your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Florine Estelle Davis Maclin [Florine Davis Maclin].  Florine is spelled F-L-O-R-I-N-E, Estelle, E-S-T-E-L-L-E, Davis was her maiden name, D-A-V-I-S; Maclin was her married name, M-A-C-L-I-N.
Speaker 1: All right, and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She wa- her date of birth was February 8, 1927; and she was born in, gosh, I want to say Edgewater, Maryland--it's south of Annapolis, Maryland--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on a farm.
Speaker 1: Okay, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  I mean how far back can you trace that side; and what were they doing--what were the stories from that side?
Speaker 2: I can't go back very far.  My mother's mother, my grandmother, her name was Maude Elizabeth Gray [Maude Gray Queen]; and she was one of eleven children, and she grew up on a farm.  She went to fourth grade and then she had to leave school and be one of the--you know, helped to work on the farm.  Her parents [Mary Gray and George Gray] I don't know very much about.  I know she always said that she had a grandmother who may have been, had Indian, American Indian [Native American], but I just don't know very much about them.  Their names were Gray; and we don't have family reunions so nobody has really put the history of the family together on that side.
Speaker 1: Okay now, so is there any tradition in the family of your mother's side being from some other place other than Maryland?
Speaker 2: No, not really, no.  Everyone pretty much--the uncles that I knew when I was very young and the aunts were all from Maryland, and from the area just south of Annapolis, more farm area; and for a while I know they owned land that was a farm that ha- was handed down and they divided it up among the eleven children and sold off pieces of it.  So it's no longer a homestead there.  My mother was the--my grandmother's only child.  So she di- you know she didn't have any sisters or brothers, but grew up with cousins.  So I knew a lot of the cousins who were closer to her age.
Story_ID: 660306
Speaker 1: What year was your [maternal] grandmother [Maude Gray Queen] born, do you know?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was born in November 1, 1906.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was always a little question about exactly what year, she wasn't quite sure, but that was the date that we always celebrated, but, so close to that time.
Speaker 1: That kind of speaks to a rural--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --upbringing where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah, and they kept it in a Bible; the Bible burned and so she didn't--she never had it.  Her youngest brother, the youngest of the eleven just died about six months ago, so; and my grandmother died in 1989.  I was very close to my grandmother growing up because we lived with her.  My mother [Florine Davis Maclin]--I'm the oldest of five children that my mother had; and we lived with her, and so I would go to the grocery store with her, I would go to church with her.  Early on--my grandmother was a domestic worker and she grew up in the African Methodist Episcopalian church [African Methodist Episcopal], the A.M.E. church.  But, in wor- in becoming a domestic worker decided that she wanted to become a Christian Scientist, which was very different; and she--so we, and I still have a couple of her books written by Mary Baker Eddy who was the founder of that whole movement, or leader.  But when I was very young, my grandmother could read, but she always liked me to read to her.  So I remember reading from you know the texts of--the works from Mary Baker Eddy; they also had newsletters telling stories of how prayer can help you accomplish things in life.  It will help you through illness.  So it was--I actually learned a little bit more about the Christian Scientist religion through my grandmother.  And those were important times because that was when I kind of had her to myself when I would sit and read with her or there was an event at the church and she would take me with her.
Story_ID: 660307
Speaker 1: But you were--yourself weren't brought into the church [Christian Science] as such?
Speaker 2: I grew up in the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal] and was Mount Moriah A.M.E. Church on Franklin Street in Annapolis [Maryland].  It's now the Benjamin Banneker-Douglass Museum [Banneker-Douglass Museum] on Franklin Street; and the church itself has moved to suburbs--what was the suburbs of Annapolis, it's out on Forest Drive, in Annapolis.
Speaker 1: So it's now the Benjamin Banneker--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Benjamin Banneker hyphen Douglass, I think with Frederick Douglass--there was a connection--museum on Franklin Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did Benjamin Banneker live close by at some point?
Speaker 2: I think Benjamin Banneker was from Annapolis [sic.].  (Laughter) One, one of my hobbies has always been to learn a little bit about local history and I used to read a lot about Benjamin Banneker, so that's the connection, that whole thing; and I actually have a couple of pictures of Benjamin Banneker.  I also collect stamps, and so I have Benjamin Banneker stamps and some of the cover photos that were done of him surveying, doing some surveying, so.  Yeah, but that is the connection.
Speaker 1: Yeah I was just going to say, a great scientific mind--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and yeah, 1700s, who you know--yeah, so I didn't know there is a museum dedicated to him, so (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah it's--I guess within the last I don't know, twenty years.  I've act- I went to it early on and it was still very small; and recently I drove by it and I was like, wow, it looks like they've done some renovations, so part of my plan is to get to Annapolis and go to the museum so I can see what it looks like.
Speaker 1: Is Annapolis on the Eastern Shore of Maryland?
Speaker 2: No, Annapolis is on the Western Shore.  You go over the bridge to get to the Eastern Shore.  Now the other connection with Annapolis is Alex Haley becau- and on the city docks they have a statue of Alex Haley [Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial, Annapolis, Maryland] with children climbing on his shoulder, and that connection is because Kunta Kinte, his ancestor arrived in Annapolis.  So they put this statue there.  But all of that is in the last twenty to thirty years; and I haven't lived really in Annapolis since I was eighteen and left and went to college [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland].
Story_ID: 660308
Speaker 1: All right, now back to your mother's side of the family, now what did your grandfather--any information about your grandfather?  Now your grandmother is Maude Gray (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Well, Maude Elizabeth Gray Queen [Maude Gray Queen], eventually because she married.  But no, my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] was born out of wedlock; and I, and so I did not know my biological grandfather at all.  My grandmother had married and I knew--I grew up with a step-grandfather whose name was Elmer Queen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I have memories of him and spending time with him; and he was a city worker.  One of the few jobs that black men could get in Annapolis [Maryland], working on the trash trucks.  So that was what he did.  So I remember sometimes he'd bring home lamps and things (laughter) that he thought were sala- salvageable that we could possibly use.  I had actually forgotten about that, but he did.  He would bring home things that he would find (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those were the days I think in a lot of communities if it weren't for salvaging things you wouldn't (unclear).
Speaker 2: You wouldn't have much, yeah.
Speaker 1: Clothes would come from your aunts and your grandmother that were doing day work.
Speaker 2: Right, right, that's right--day work is what--yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Let me see here, now what did your--what was growing up like for your mother?  Did she have a chance to go to school or anything?
Speaker 2: My mother, yes, and she graduated from high school which was a very big deal.  She graduated from high school in 1945; and I used to have a picture of her.  I'm not--I think one of my sisters has the picture now, of her on the day that she graduated from high school; and she went to Bates High School, Wiley H. Bates [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Now is that a black high school?
Speaker 2: It was a black high school.  It was the only school that blacks could attend in the area.  So they came from Baltimore [Maryland], I mean it was like a--one of the few schools that blacks could attend in Maryland at the time she went to high school.  And so it was a very big deal, but she did graduate from high school.  She didn't go further beyond that.
Speaker 1: So you're saying Bates drew students from all--from that area (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From all over Maryland.
Speaker 1: --around Maryland?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it did.  That's the stories that she told me, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I know really it probably had a high school in Baltimore, I would guess, you know, but?
Speaker 2: I would think that they would have one in Baltimore, but Wiley H. Ba- Bates was the one that probably drew the black students who lived in the rural parts of Maryland; and coming to Annapolis was the big city for many of them.
Speaker 1: Now who was Wiley H. Bates, are there any stories about him?
Speaker 2: There is a story about him and I don't really know it, but he was a pioneering educator is what I--my understanding of it; and it's now--for a while it was the black high school, then it became a middle school [Wiley H. Bates Middle School, Annapolis, Maryland].  When I was going to school, it was a middle school; and now I think it's become a senior center [Wiley H. Bates Heritage Park, Annapolis, Maryland], so his name still lives on.  You know, there is still a lot, but I just don't know the real, the whole story behind it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where were your--what did your mother say about growing up and about her aspirations growing up?
Speaker 2: She didn't talk a lot about growing up, but she hated the farm life because she grew up on a farm in the country as I was saying--she didn't like that.  She wanted to see the city.  She didn't really feel that she could go to college; she didn't have any money, so she worked as a short order cook for many years at various places in Annapolis.  But, she had a tough life in some ways because there were five of us that she he had; and she was not married, she was a single mother.  So I have two younger brothers [Charles Carter and Jerry Maclin] and two younger sisters [Sharon Maclin Brown (ph.) and Anita Maclin Wyatt] also.  So, she had to provide for all of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Did she ever talk about what she wanted to do if she could you know that's different what sh- from cooking?
Speaker 2: From cooking?  She would have liked to have been a singer; she liked to sing.  I remember at quiet times she would--you could hear her singing a song and she knew a lot about music and the musicians who were popular during her day; and you know she'd talk about them.  But that's about it.  Mostly, she wanted to just kind of get through; and she loved reading the newspaper and that was one thing that we always had in our home was a newspaper, and she would take time every day to read the paper so she would know what was going on.
Story_ID: 660309
Speaker 1: Well let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Herbert Leroy Dawson: H-E-R-B-E-R-T, Leroy, L-E-R-O-Y, Dawson, D-A-W-S-O-N [Herbert Dawson].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was July 22, 19- 1919, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was he from Annapolis [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: He was born in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I don't know--I do not, I do not have memories of my father as a little girl.  I did not grow up with my father in the household; and I met my father when he was fi- when I was fifteen.  So I met him as a teenager.
Speaker 1: Now did he live in Annapolis?
Speaker 2: He--my father was a military man.  He had--his first part of his career was in the [U.S.] Navy, the second part of his career was in the [U.S.] Air Force; and he always told me he was too young to fight in World War II [WWII] and too old to j- fight in the Korean War.  So he was sort of between the two wars, but he served in the [U.S.] military for many years.  So, the years that I was growing up as a young girl and teenager, he was really being deployed to different bases around the country.
Speaker 1: That's interesting because he wasn't too old for World War II; he was right on the money--
Speaker 2: Yeah that's what I--
Speaker 1: --born in 1919 (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what he said (laughter), I can only go by that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: My father was born in 1919, I mean he was just--you know he's like twenty--he'd be like twenty-five, twenty-four, twenty-five when the war started, which is prime age.
Speaker 2: That's what I was thinking--yeah, and I--but now it was also very segregated then so maybe that had some issues, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, it definitely was segregated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: Brut- you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Harshly segregated.
Speaker 2: Right and that's why I don't know--but that's what he would always say to me, that he was--.  And now, and then so I met my father.  My mother [Florine Davis Maclin] says to me one day, "Your father has moved to Annapolis," so I'm like oh, really?  So and I remember she gave me the phone number and I called him up and said, "Hi, I'm your daughter Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Long Weaver]," and that's how we connected; and I found out then I have an older sister who is you know my father's child who was five years older than I am, and I met her when I was sixteen.  And she didn't--she was twenty-one when she met me so it was quite interesting because we're both you know fairly old and had different interests and raised very differently.  And I would spend--I did spend time with my father when I was a teenager.  I'd stay with him and Inez [Inez Dawson], his wife's name was Inez; and Gayle [Gayle Dawson Symonette] who was--since she was five years old she had really moved out of the house.  She had gone to college, and she went to Langston University in Oklahoma [Langston, Oklahoma]--she graduated from there.  So I got to know Inez a little bit and spent time with them; and because I went to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and they lived in Lanham [Maryland], close to Maryland, during the summer.  One summer I had a summer job in that area, so I stayed with them; and that's really when I got to know him as well as I did, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 660310
Speaker 1: Any stories from his side of the family, or (unclear) go back (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not a lot.  They're--that side of the family because I wasn't really growing up with them, but the Dawsons have a family reunion.  I have never been; I've always said I wanted to go, but I did meet his mother, my grandmother.  Her name was Cherry, C-H-E-R-R-Y [Cherry Coward Dawson], and I met her before she passed on once; and I met one of my father's sisters and one of his brothers, Uncle James [James Dawson (ph.)] was his name.  And so I--and I met them before they died, but I was still a teenager.  So I don't really remember a lot about them, and I wasn't really included in the family reunions so much.  So that's why I had never been, but I did--my father [Herbert Dawson] died in 1999, and I didn't go to the funeral, which was in North Carolina.  He relocated after he retired completely from the [U.S.] military.  They moved to a small town in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the town?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it's the town--and we'll, we can Google it in a little bit, but Pepsi-Cola [Pepsi-Cola Company; PepsiCo] was started--that's where it was originated [New Bern, North Carolina]; and I don't why I can remember that fact but can't remember the name of the town (laughter) but that's the name--it was a town where Pepsi-Cola was started (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, I had no idea there was such a town, so I--this is interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's where it was started.  So then the reunions were not in that town but in another smaller town in North Carolina, and I'm not sure.  My sister Gayle [Gayle Dawson Symonette] has gone a couple of years, and she and I have talked about going together but we still haven't done it, so.  But it's always, I think, the second weekend in August that they have the family reunions, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you and your sister Gayle have the same father then?
Speaker 2: Yes we have the same father, different mothers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the same father and I'm five years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That's your older sister (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: --that's my older sister.
Story_ID: 660311
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I didn't find this out until after my father [Herbert Dawson] had died, and my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] had died.  But one of my father's friends at his funeral told me that they met during a period when he and his wife, Inez [Inez Dawson], had separated, and they were going their separate ways; and my father met my mother, they got together; I was born, and actually I had a younger sister--she had another child who was stillborn, and I saw the birth certificate at one point.  I don't know where it is now.  But they were together for a number of years and somehow, I don't know what happened but he and his wife, Inez, reconciled; and went their different ways.  I don't know but that's what I understand; and because he was in the [U.S.] Navy, I guess, and was stationed in Annapolis [Maryland] for a while--that's during that time period.  And going out, the--Annapolis had a life for blacks, the clubs, there was a place, I think it was called the Dixie Club [Annapolis, Maryland] where blacks would go back then, you know.  Because there were only a few places that you could go.
Story_ID: 660312
Speaker 1: You were telling me before we started the interview that Annapolis [Maryland] is about 25 percent black. Was that true when you were growing up, or true now more?
Speaker 2: It's true now, more so now, but I think it was not quite--that black population was not 25 percent then.  It was--but it still may have been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I would have thought it would have been more then with all the, you know, the gentrification of Annapolis that's going on today.
Speaker 2: Well, there--yeah, there is a lot that's going on today, but now Annapolis becau- there are two things in Annapolis: the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy], and usually somebody in your family worked at the Naval Academy; or they worked for the State of Maryland because it was the capital.  So the jobs were limited in some senses; and with the Naval Academy--(laughter) what the Naval Academy did was bring in Philippine- Filipinos who did the service jobs at the Naval Academy.  So they were the waiters and the people--but now blacks still worked in the kitchen so there were a limited number of jobs that people could have; and then like my [maternal] grandmother [Maude Gray Queen] did day work, my grand- my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] as I told you was a short order cook.  So, it was interesting; and I think back then in the '60s [1960s] the population in Annapolis was really about thirty-five thousand, and it's much more now.  It was small--it was a much smaller place to live.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you could really--we walked everywhere, walked downtown, down all those little streets, and--because we didn't really have a car, so.
Speaker 1: Well the veterans always say--the World War II [WWII] vets always say that the [U.S.] Navy was the most prejudiced and mean of the services (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: --even with a segregated you know [U.S.] Army, and with the [U.S.] Marine Corps being--the Navy was the worst.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't know that.  Yeah
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's what they all say.
Speaker 2: That's interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those who were in the Navy they speak to that so I don't know.  Maybe Navy culture in Annapolis--I mean I don't know if there's a correlation between what goes on in Annapolis and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, it could have been, but I just didn't pay--I wasn't paying attention to it, so.  My first job, my first paying job was at the Naval Academy.  And I was in high school [Annapolis High School, Annapolis, Maryland] and I worked in the Naval Academy library; and my job was to--the books would come in boxes and we would take the books out of the boxes and catalog them according to the Dewey Decimal System [Dewey Decimal Classification], which I can't tell you the Dewey Decimal System anymore but I used to know it then.
Story_ID: 660313
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this: when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, what they look like, their sense of humor, what they were interested in, their talents--who do you think you take after the most?   Or even consider your [maternal] grandmother [Maude Gray Queen] who you were around a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I have--I think I have some of my grandmother's disposition.  My grandmother was a very patient woman, I'd like to think that I'm patient (laughter); but, and she was a very kind woman is what I remember; and she was a very good listener, and I do think I listen well.  I think I may have--and I did not realize this but it struck me when I went to my father's [Herbert Dawson] funeral and I looked around the house--the home that they lived in in North Carolina.  I hadn't really visited there, and I'm looking at different awards that he had gotten and the connections that he had with people and he was somebody who liked to work behind the scenes to get things done, and that's a lot of what I also like to do.  My mother [Florine Davis Maclin] was a very quiet woman.  She was shy in a lot of ways, and I was never really shy.  She used to tell me that I talked all the time; and she would often just kind of sit and look at me and go, "Okay" (laughter), and not really quite know--all right why is this little girl talking all the time.  But she was a very smart woman and loved to read; and that's what I think that I got from her, is my love of reading and love for words and putting things together.
Story_ID: 660314
Speaker 1: Now can you name your siblings for us beginning with the oldest, and put yourself in the order, you know?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I have an older sister, Gayle [Gayle Dawson Symonette].  She and I have the same father [Herbert Dawson]; and her name is spelled G-A-Y-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have two younger brothers and two younger sisters.  The brother closest to me is Charles [Charles Carter]; and then Jerry [Jerry Maclin]; Sharon [Sharon Maclin Brown (ph.)]; and Anita [Anita Maclin Wyatt]--Anita Kim, and we always call her Kim [ph.], family name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us something about them.  What are they doing now and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My sister Gayle is living in Tyler, Texas; and she is a corrections officer in the prison system in Texas and does that--thinking about retiring this year.   And my sister Sharon who--works for the Annapolis housing authority [Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis], and w- oversees one of their properties in public housing.  My sister Kim works with the Maryland state insurance company [Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund; Maryland Auto Insurance]--I've forgotten the exact title of it, but she does work with Maryland state insurance; and she's mar- I left out, she's married and has a daughter.  My sister Sharon is married and has a daughter and a son.  My brothers--Charles was married; he's widowed, and has two daughters who are adults now.  My brother Jerry works for one of the restaurants in Annapolis [Maryland], and he's worked at various restaurants and doing short order cooking and whatever you know in, sort of in the background.  And he was married--he has three sons, so they're all still alive, most of--and still living in the Annapolis area.
Story_ID: 660315
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I actually have a very early childhood memory of walking, and I remem- I told my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] about this once and I remember sitting in a chair--they, it was between two chairs.  And I'm not sure who the two people were, but sort of walking from one chair to the next chair--that's very early, I don't know why I remember that, but--and laughing as a baby.  But then my memories kind of jump to spending time with my mother and going to the Star Theater; and in Annapolis [Maryland], the Star Theater was the black theater.  That was the only movie place that you could go to; and we used to go every Sunday.  And we'd go--she would always take me on Sundays to see the movies, so we did that I think until I was about five or six [years old], I think; and then when she had other children she couldn't take me as often, but that used to be our Sunday activity to go to the movies.  And reading--she read to me and I would read back to her the stories, so.  By the time--around four or five I could read because we spent a lot of time reading.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and your [maternal] grandmother [Maude Gray Queen] you know had you reading the--?
Speaker 2: My grandmother had me reading when I was young, probably eight or nine I would read the Bible to her, or also read to her from the Mary Baker Eddy text, from the Christian Scientist world but yeah I would always--you know, so it continued as I was young.  I also remember there was a story--this is, my grandmother would get home because she was a day worker, she was usually home about three o'clock, my mother would be at work; and so I had gone to school and I think I was in the first or second grade and we walked to school.  We walked everywhere, they would walk me to school and my grandmother had to--would walk there and meet me.  Well, this particular day I was waiting and waiting and she hadn't shown up, so I told the teacher, "I think I see my grandmother outside," well she wasn't outside; and I went outside and walked home by myself.  So I had my grandmother and all the neighbors searching for me.  My grandmother had never been so angry with me in her life, and for years she talked about, "Do you remember that day" (laughter) "that you left school and I was there looking for you and waiting for you?"  And I said, "Yes, grandma, I remember," but.  So it was sort of a family story about how I left early that day; and after that day because I had gotten into big trouble, I never left early again.  I was patiently waiting.
Speaker 1: And you were how old?
Speaker 2: I think I was six, so I think I was in the first grade; and it was--and I guess it was also a big deal.  I didn't realize it because the schools for the most part were segregated, and this was the first year or second year that the schools had become integrated; and what they did in Maryland was basically give you a choice: you could go to the all-black schools or you could go to the white schools and I went to--they called it Green Street elementary school [Green Street School; Annapolis Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland] which was the white school.  So for this little black girl to be out there by herself with all these whites was a big deal, but I didn't understand that, and had no clue.  I just knew I was ready to go home--that's (laughter) that was my only concern.

Speaker 1: You said you grew up near gate three--
Speaker 2: Of the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland].
Speaker 1: --U.S. Naval--and that, and you said Annapolis [Maryland]--people from Annapolis know it as?
Speaker 2: Know it as--(laughter) yeah the, people from Annapolis will know if you meet somebody re- you'll say, "Oh, well what gate do you live near?"  And you'll say gate three or gate one--there are eight gates and around the whole property of the academy; and at that time it--growing up in Annapolis we lived near gate three, which was--we grew up on College Avenue and gate three was one block over I want to say that's Maryland Avenue and around the corner from where we lived.  So it wasn't as locked down as it is now since 9/11 [September 11, 2001] so we as children could go back and forth into the Naval Academy, and the Naval Academy became a playground for us in many ways.  So we knew where the Tecumseh statue was, and we'd go into the chapel and (laughter) play hide and seek in the crypt where John Paul Jones is buried, and you know all these different places but it was grassy, it was just wide open and as kids we--that was part of our playground.  You know, we had that type of access.
Speaker 1: Can you describe--we discussed earlier a little bit how picturesque Annapolis is--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, but can you describe what your neighborhood was like; and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  As I said I grew up on College Avenue.  College Avenue is named such because St. John's College [Annapolis, Maryland] is on that street.  Another--it's a beautiful campus, and I remember as a child we would go--if it snowed that's where we would head to go sledding and sliding down the hill and we thought this was the biggest hill in the world and--you know because we were little children.  I went back (laughter) to look at it as an adult and it's not a big hill at all, but for us as little kids it was a big hill.  But St. John's College was just gorgeous.  I mean it was tree lined and grassy and again we had access so you could be on the campus and be outside.  And we always thought that people who went to St. John's were a little weird and sort of that beatnik area--era in time, and, and that's what we thought.  But it was a small college, liberal arts.
Story_ID: 660317
Speaker 1: Our block of College Avenue was an all-black block.  And we were all very close, so you knew all the families and everybody kind of looked after you; and I lived at 25 College Avenue.  My best friend lived at 15 College Avenue; and there was a third girl we were friends with, and she lived at 7 College Avenue.  So we--and there was, at the end of the block we used to call him Bop Daddy [ph.] (laughter) and he was and I can't remember his full name now, but he was a radio personality, one of the few radio--and so we would you know we would all talk with him and--
Speaker 2: So this is a black radio personality?
Speaker 1: This is a black radio personality.
Speaker 2: Bop Daddy?
Speaker 1: Yeah that's what we called him (laughter).
Speaker 2: Was that the radio handle too, I mean?
Speaker 1: I think it may have been his radio handle; and I want to say maybe his name was Charles Adams [sic. Hoppy Adams]?  I can't quite remember now, but he and his wife were very friendly; and across the street from us, Ms. Lily Mae [ph.] and Ms. Lily Mae was--worked at the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland], and she would be the person--and I can't remember exactly what she did, but I think it was something domestic.  But she would be the black person who would look out for the black midshipmen; and so up until 1970 there were only one or two maybe three black midshipmen admitted every year, and it was also before women were admitted to the academy.  And so Ms. Lily Mae would be sort of their contact person (laughter).
Speaker 2: So just to put this--so here they come, they're in an all-white environment--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --probably not friendly--not most, not the friendliest environment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, they had a hard time.  They had a hard time.  Yeah.   Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so they--Ms. Lily provided like that community link--
Speaker 1: She did.
Speaker 2: --or comfort zone.
Speaker 1: Yes, she did.  She would--
Speaker 2: Did she feed them?
Speaker 1: She fed them, she would introduce them to people in the community; she--beca- they could attend church in the community.  So I grew up in Mount Moriah A.M.E. Church [Annapolis, Maryland], so often we would have the black midshipmen you know worshiping with us, and that was Ms. Lily Mae's connection.  Ms. Lily Mae also--what is--I'm forgetting the name of the movie, oh, gosh.
Speaker 2: 'An Officer and a Gentleman'?
Speaker 1: 'An Officer and a Gentleman,' and there's a scene where--how they come out in the community and they meet women, so Ms. Lily Mae knew us as young girls so we could go meet some of the midshipmen as you know we became of age and you had to wear gloves and that kind of thing.  But she was sort of the person who showed us a little of the etiquette.  And then there was Ms. Green [ph.] who lived on the corner across the street.  Ms. Green was a teacher, very strict--or I thought she was, but she was al- she looked out for us.  Ms. Poole [ph.] lived on our street and I think Ms. Poole--I think Ms. Poole was also a teacher.  My best friend's father worked at the Naval Academy and they used to call him Crab Cake Jake [Richard Jacobs]--that was his nickname, I still remember that, but he was one of the cooks at the Naval Academy; and I think that was one of his specialties, I'm sure that's why they called him Crab Cake Jake.  But we--so it was a very close block, and it was a great block.  Mr. Notice [ph.] had an upholstery b- business and people would come from all over Annapolis [Maryland], and he would refinish chairs and couches and we would kind of stand outside while it was loaded on the truck and watch.  And, so it was a close block.  But as you worked your way up, St. John's College [Annapolis, Maryland] was on the right hand side, the Naval Academy alumni house was on the left hand side; you keep going, the governor's mansion [Government House, Annapolis, Maryland] is at the top of the block.  There is a historic post office that's at the top of the block across from that; and then you run into Church Circle pretty su- yeah Church Circle; and then it veers off into West Street, and.
Speaker 2: Now Church Circle, does that include a lot of churches, is that why they call it that?
Speaker 1: It's one big church that literally is in a circle and you can go around--and it's a Episcopal church as I recall, or it was then, it was an Episcopal church.  And West Street came off of it; Franklin Street where Mount Moriah church was.  And the library, there was a little, tiny building (laughter) and I remember I used to go there and look for books and I always wanted books about somebody black and they never really had and that's where I first read about Benjamin Banneker.  I remember there was one book and the librarian said to me, "You've checked this out now three times," and I said, "Well I don't see anything else."  But, I read it and read it several times, so.  But it was a little tiny library at that time.
Speaker 2: Now did you read about him because you heard he was from Annapolis [sic.]?
Speaker 1: It was somebody black; I think his picture was on the cover of the book.  I mean I was a voracious reader, so I would go and check out five books at a time and I'd be back two days later and want five more books, so--especially during the summertime because I could walk to the li- my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] would let me walk to the library by myself because it was you know just a few blocks away.
Story_ID: 660318
Speaker 1: Now how was Annapolis [Maryland] I guess--or how was the black population in Annapolis deployed?  Were they--I know in some towns you have a black side of town or across the railroad tracks is the black community.  Some communities, even like Cincinnati [Ohio] they are scattered in different pockets.
Speaker 2: Well Annapolis was very--and like I said, my block was the black block.  There were other parts--I mean you'd go walk up College Avenue and it was whi- all white.  But most blacks, or a lot of the blacks lived in what we called the 4th Ward, which--and we called it uptown Annapolis because it was--and it was a little bit away from us.  So--and there was Adams Park [Adams Park Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland] was the name of the school--the elementary school that a lot of the blacks in Annapolis went to elementary school.  It was interesting, I went to Green Street [Green Street School; Annapolis Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland]; my friend who lived three doors away went to Adams Park.  So, we went to different elementary schools.  So we talk about we had different friends in elementary school, but she and I were friends because we grew up on that same block.  There were not a lot of--and blacks also lived on some of those small streets that feed into State Circle where the state house [Maryland State House, Annapolis, Maryland] is.  Like, I think it's Pinkney Street or Cornhill Street--those streets blacks lived in those little tiny houses as well.  Now the gentrification has changed all of that and blacks really aren't in there.  There were also blacks who lived in Eastport [Annapolis, Maryland] in pockets, different sections; and blacks who lived on Spa Road, S-P-A, Spa Road.  So, the- but it was always a very tight knit black community, so you knew the people in your community and they helped you.  And there was a beach, Arundel on the Bay [Maryland] and--I'm forgetting.  It was another community in the beach area of Annapolis which were all black communities as well.  'Cause beaches were segregated.  And there were two beaches that were public beaches, Sandy Point [Sandy Point State Park, Annapolis, Maryland] and Carr's Beach [Annapolis, Maryland]; and when we were growing up they literally had a fence that went down the middle into the water, into the deep part of the water so blacks and whites could not mix on the beach, and that's--yeah, I remember that, going there as a child.  That--but there was a fence that separated the races.
Speaker 1: So this is in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah late '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Late '50s [1950s] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: --early '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s], yeah until things really started to open up a little bit.  But you remember that--I remember signs that said on the water fountains it said for colored only; and restroom were separated.  We could not try on clothes when we went into some of the clothing stores, so those are you know early childhood memories, but I do remember them.
Speaker 1: So Maryland once called a border state, was really a southern--in a lot of ways (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was--oh yeah it was a very segregated state, yeah.  You grew up very (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But you know once--I know the Chicago [Illinois] riot of 1919 happened when somebody drifted on to the white beach from the black beach.  They had a separated--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --beach in 1919, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you know it's--you know they at some point decided not to do that anymore, but.
Speaker 2: Yeah and I don't know when they decided to open it up either, but I remember that.  And Carr's Beach was the beach where a lot of black entertainers came.  So on the black radio you would hear announcements: Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and The Supremes, The Temptations, the Four Tops--they all came to Carr's Beach to perform because it was one of the few places that they could go to perform.  But my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] would never let me go (laughter) and I was too young really, but of course I wanted to go and see them.
Story_ID: 660319
Speaker 1: Well tell us about elementary school.  Now you started school at Green Street School [Annapolis Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I started elementary school at Green Street elementary.  It was all white, I was the only black in the class; and I did not go to kindergarten and I didn't realize this--I think my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] didn't send me to kindergarten because you had to pay to attend kindergarten, and she didn't have money to send me to kindergarten.  But I could read, so when I got to first grade, I could definitely read.  And we lived (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were ahead of most kindergarteners anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right, yeah because I could read.  So I had no problem keeping up and you know they put you in reading groups.  And (laughter) they started me in one group but had to quickly move me up because I could read.  And we--I was there through the middle of third grade; and then we moved from College Avenue to section of Annapolis [Maryland] called Parole [Maryland] and it was still a little rural at that point, but my [maternal] grandmother [Maude Gray Queen] and grandfather [Weaver's step-grandfather, Elmer Queen] with whom we lived had built a house in that area on Hicks Avenue.  And so I had to switch elementary schools, and so I went to Parole Elementary [Parole Elementary School; Walter S. Mills Parole Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland], which was an all-black school.
Speaker 1: So how do you spell Parole?
Speaker 2: P-A-R-O-L-E.
Speaker 1: P-A-R--
Speaker 2: O-L-E.
Speaker 1: --O-L-E, okay.
Speaker 2: Parole--
Speaker 1: Like you're on parole (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like Parole, it was Parole Elementary and it may have been named Parole--somewhere out there they had a Civil War camp and you could still find coins and artifacts in those early days from the ci- left over from the Civil War.  I don't know the whole story about that but it was called Camp Parole, that's--and they shortened it to Parole, so.  That's what I know about it (laughter).  But so I switched to Parole Elementary and I remem- I met one of my first friends was Annie Hillary [ph.] and we're still very good friends today.  And in third grade--and Ms. Parker [ph.] was my third grade teacher, I'm surprised I remember that, that Ms. Parker--
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite teacher at Green Street before you went--?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  But at Parole your favorite teacher was--well (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well she was a teacher that I remember.  I think my favorite teacher was Ms. Swan [ph.], who was my fifth grade teacher.  And she--but you know Ms. Parker was--I remember her, she taught us how to--the one thing that I had missed in transferring from Green Street to Parole was how to write cursively.  So my cursive writing never quite met her standard (laughter) and that's how we'd get into trouble for, what is that curlicue (laughter); and I liked to talk a lot so I always got into trouble for talking.  And also though in third grade, it was third grade where I finally convinced my mother that I needed eyeglasses because I was always squinting trying to read the blackboard.  And it was Ms. Parker who really noticed that I couldn't see so she was the one who pushed my mother: "You have to go get her eyeglasses so she can see."
Speaker 1: So you're nearsighted, basically, right--
Speaker 2: Very--
Speaker 1: --you can see close but not far away.
Speaker 2: --very nearsighted, yeah, yeah, I was very nearsighted.  So I wore glasses from the time I was about seven or eight [years old] really through well my entire life; and wore contact lenses, so.
Story_ID: 660320
Speaker 1: Parole Elementary [Parole Elementary School; Walter S. Mills Parole Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland], and I did very well at Parole because I could read.  I was reading in books that Parole Elementary did not have because the white schools had more money so the textbooks were different. So I was reading on a whole different level than the students in my class.  So for a while I was in my own reading group by myself, which was not good.  And it was--in Parole at Parole Elementary as much as I liked it, that I do remember that was the first time that I felt I did not fit in with blacks or whites because the whites didn't really care for me that much because I was black, and the blacks said that I talked like I was white because I had gone to a mostly white elementary school [Green Street School; Annapolis Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland], my inflections and the whole way I talked.  I didn't even understand what that meant.  "You talk like you're white." What does that mean--that's just the way I talk.  But as I grew older, I came to understand it but that was the first time that I felt that I was an outsider in sort of both places.  But I still did very well while I was in Parole, and graduated from the sixth grade.  Mr. Mills [Walter S. Mills] was the principal and had gotten awards for doing well in English and math; and then went on to Annapolis Junior High [Annapolis Junior High School; Annapolis Middle School, Annapolis, Maryland], which is seventh, eighth and ninth, and that was also a mostly white school at that point.  And then there was Bates Middle School [Wiley H. Bates Middle School, Annapolis, Maryland], so--and Bates was mostly black.  Still, the schools were still a little bit segregated, and they really did not open up until I got to high school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you went to Annapolis (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I went to Annapolis Junior High--
Speaker 2: Junior high, all right.
Speaker 1: --yeah, which was all white; and it was a brand new school at that point.
Speaker 2: Okay did--were there many black students there?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Were enough to make a little community, or?
Speaker 1: No, I was the only black student in most of my--in just about all of my classes, as I recall.  So, really had to find my way; and fortunately you know--and I'm trying to remember, we moved back to College Avenue I think when I was in middle school or at the end of middle school because then I went to high- went to Annapolis High School [Annapolis, Maryland] and we were walking to school and we always complained that it was such a long walk (laughter); and, of course, my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] had a better story that she used to have to walk five miles to go to school and ours was only one mile, so what were we complaining about.
Story_ID: 660321
Speaker 1: You were saying earlier that your family kept up with the news.  I mean your mother [Florine Davis Maclin] always read the newspaper (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother always read the paper, it was the evening Capital [The Capital]; and so it was delivered to the house every day, and she--I mean she just wanted to know what was going on in the world.  So she read the paper, and sometimes she'd point out stories to me; and what I recall a lot about the paper was there was not a lot of stories about blacks in the paper unless you died or you had committed a crime--they just didn't really write about the black community at all, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now were you involved in any community activities like Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or Boys Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of America], or some of those?
Speaker 2: I was--I was a Girl Scout for several years.  Mostly when I lived in Parole [Maryland] and joined the Girl Scout troop that was run after school at Parole Elementary [Parole Elementary School; Walter S. Mills Parole Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland]; and I remember, sold lots of cookies (laughter) and so that was good; and I was a Junior Girl Scout and then a Cadette Girl Scout, and then I left Girl Scouts after that level.  But yeah I did spend time there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't really do very many other after school activities.
Speaker 1: But you say you did like actively seek books about black people and history especially or?
Speaker 2: Ye- in history, yeah I was always interested in history and at one point I thought I might be a history teacher because I was--that was just something I was just so interested in, but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Now I know your mother was working hard and was probably not--I don't know if she was directly involved with the Civil Rights Movement or not but all that was going on when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: No she wasn't, she was more of a spectator of what was going on.
Speaker 1: Did the papers cover you know the civil rights activity locally or nationally you know?
Speaker 2: They may have, I didn't really pay enough attention to it to really so.
Speaker 1: I know some of the papers don't and you wouldn't know if they didn't because they just wouldn't be in there, the paper.
Speaker 2: Right, but I have one memory of this particular day.  Part of my job because my mother was working and my brothers [Charles Carter and Jerry Maclin] are closest to me in age, and I was twelve or thirteen, but I used to have to take them to the barbershop which I hated because I was the only girl in the barbershop.  But I'd have to sit and wait for them to get their hair cut and I had a little transistor radio that I was--I'd listen to my music and this particular day I was listening to my music and they asked me if I would turn it off because they wanted to listen to these speeches.  It was the March on Washington in August and I remember--
Speaker 1: It was 1963.
Speaker 2: --nineteen sixty-three [1963], and I--so I must have been eleven and sitting with my brothers waiting for them to get their hair cut at Carroll's barbershop, C-A-R-R-O-L-L--S, apostrophe S.  The Carroll brothers.
Story_ID: 660322
Speaker 1: You heard the--some of the speeches from the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Yes, and did not understand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they have television, or did they listen to the radio?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have television, they were listening to radio; and I didn't really understand the total significance of what was going on but I remember them saying this is Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you should listen and so I tried to listen.  And, but I--you know I wasn't there that long and then later on that evening I remember seeing it on the news you know about the March on Washington, so.
Speaker 1: Is this the first time that the Civil Rights Movement (unclear) kind of resonated with you actually?
Speaker 2: I think it was, yeah, just you know a little bit--I still didn't know a whole lot; and then I guess the next time I really paid attention, I remember fifteen [years old] again with my little transistor radio and hearing Martin Luther King had been shot and they didn't know--and listening to the details and calling my mother [Florine Davis Maclin].  I said, "Martin Luther King has been shot, I don't know what's going on, what's going on," and following that on the news and then paying more attention to the riots as they occurred across the country.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't imagine there were riots in Annapolis [Maryland], but.
Speaker 2: No there weren't riots.  I think people were angry, and--but it didn't rise to that level but there were riots in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and I think in Baltimore [Maryland].  So they were cloaked around us but not--people in Annapolis didn't riot, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you're in high school by this time and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you're attending like a mostly white high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was there any--what was the reaction at Annapolis High School [Annapolis, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Not--I, you know what, I don't even recall that there was much reaction at all.  I'm sure there was some, but I just don't recall what it was.  But I remember wanting to watch what was going on on the news, and that's how I would follow it: on the television news.  We talked about it with our friends a little bit, but I don't recall much reaction.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's funny how this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in black communities everything came to a standstill, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --within their high schools--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and the elementary schools, colleges.
Speaker 2: No it did not come to a standstill--no, life, life went on as I recall, so that's kind of sad, but.
Story_ID: 660323
Speaker 1: Were you still pretty much the only black student in your classes in?
Speaker 2: In many of my classes because I was taking advanced college prep courses, so I had like trigonometry and calculus and very--and advanced English, so for many of my classes I was the only black person.
Speaker 1: Sounds like you were on a scientific track?
Speaker 2: Well for a little bit, but I was mostly interested--I was interested in English; and I really liked writing at that point, and as I said I liked history.  But I was on an academic track because I knew I wanted to go to college--I didn't know how I was going to go to college, but I knew that I wanted to go.  So that's what I--I pursued that but in many of my classes--now I met one of my close friends, still today Mary, Mary Fields [ph.] and we became friends because Mary really was a math genius.  She was brilliant; and she would, we would be in classes together in math, she would get it and I'd call Mary at night and say, "Okay, walk me through this one more time," (laughter), "help me figure out how to solve this problem."  The rest of my classes pretty much I was by myself--in terms of being a black student.  Just didn't have a lot of interaction.  And the one thing that I did, because I did like to write, was join the student newspaper--the Tally-Ho.  I'm not sure why the Annapolis [Annapolis High School, Annapolis, Maryland] paper was named the Tally-Ho, but it was.  And so that was where I had my first page one story; and this is what convinced me that I wanted to become a journalist.  The--I was wor- did stories from time to time for the paper, but this particular day we found out Alex Haley who we knew at that point had written 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley]--that's what we knew him for in 1970--and he was appearing at the Arundel Community College [Anne Arundel Community College, Arnold, Maryland].  So my friends and I decided to cut class at high school and go hear him at the college and it was packed.  I remember we couldn't find a seat and we had to sit in the aisles in this auditorium; and you know we're listening to him and he was mesmerizing.  He's talking a little bit about Malcolm X.  He talked about how he'd met Malcolm X and what he was doing; and that's really what I wanted to hear: how did he know Malcolm X.  But he said, "But I want to tell you another story, I'm starting to trace my family history," and he starts talking about how he had gone to Africa and sat at the feet of the griot and this is what he was doing; and I was able to turn this into a story that appeared on the front page of the Tally-Ho.  And I--my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] cut it out, and for many years until it just fell apart she had it on the front of the refrigerator, I remember that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is, what, 1970?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, because I graduated from high school in 1970. So it was right around '69 [1969], '70 [1970]--somewhere in there.  And many years later flash forward I'm married [to Sanford Long (ph.)], living in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] working for which pa- I was working for The Philadelphia Inquirer and I have a nine year old son [Sean Long] who is in school studying genealogy, partly because of what Alex Haley had done with 'Roots' and so forth--he had seen 'Roots' and Alex Haley comes to the area at an area high school to speak.  So I take my son and his best friend and we go hear Alex Haley and I have my copy of 'Malcolm X' and we, he's signing the books; and I have my son standing next to me and I have him sign the book for my son because I'd never had it autographed, and I said to him, "You know you're part of the reason that you--that I became a journalist because when I was a high school student I came to hear you talk," and he's looking at me.  And then--so his inscription became not just for my son but he wrote a little extra something for him.  And I don't remember what it is now, my son has the book.  But, I, I was always thrilled that I had a chance to tell him before he passed away that he had had an influence on me becoming a journalist in my career and what I was doing, so.  But that's--that was really where I started.  My interest in newspapers and being a journalist started in high school; and seeing Alex Haley and writing that story really cemented my passion to becoming a journalist.

Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers in high school [Annapolis High School, Annapolis, Maryland] that encouraged your writing?
Speaker 2: No, not really--no, none that I can recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  None, okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like--well, you were kind of on your own, I guess in high school in terms of (unclear) I mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right--and because I was away like I said from most of the black--there weren't a lot of black students.  I had--I remem- I have one teacher who was interested in seeing me succeed, he was an economics teacher.  I remember taking a class from him and he you know encouraged me to do better but he wasn't a writing teacher.  So no not really.
Speaker 1: Now were you--did you have an active role in church at the A.M.--at Mount Moriah [Mount Moriah A.M.E. Church, Annapolis, Maryland] or--I mean in terms of you know doing something--?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I went to Sunday school, went to church--not really participating in a lot of the youth groups or youth activities; and didn't really have time because part of growing up I you know I worked at the Naval Academy library [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] for a little bit, but also--
Speaker 1: This is as a teenager?
Speaker 2: Yes as a teenager.
Speaker 1: Now this is--that sounds like a good--I'm thinking this is a good position for you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, what?  As a--?
Speaker 1: In the Naval Academy library.
Speaker 2: Yeah and it was; and I, and at that point I thought I wanted to be a librarian because I did enjoy you know bringing in the books and looking to see what they were, what books they were bringing in and that's--I got to catalog the Malcolm X book ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley].  So that's one of the reasons that I knew about it.  (Laughter) But, but part of my life was also--I was the oldest.  I had four--you know two brothers [Charles Carter and Jerry Maclin], two sisters [Sharon Maclin Brown (ph.) and Anita Maclin Wyatt] younger than me.  My mother [Florine Davis Maclin] worked at night; I had to babysit.  So when I got home dinner was ready, I had to make sure everybody ate and then cleaned up and kind of get everybody off.  But I couldn't really do a lot of after school activities because I had to be home with the younger children, so.  It was--you know you missed--I missed out on a lot of things that I may have wanted to do, but I had to come home and take care of everybody, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, all right, so--but you do--yeah, being in a library sounds like a pretty good position to be in.
Speaker 2: It was and I think I did it for about a year and a half; and I remember I was paid the minimum wage of $1.60 an hour (laughter) which was a lot of money (laughter) back then, so; and during the summer it became a full time job and I remember a paycheck for, I think about sixty-four dollars a week.
Story_ID: 660325
Speaker 1: Your grades are good, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was a pretty good student.  Through high school I wasn't a four point--math was the class that I struggled with, so that kind of brought my average [grade point average] down a little bit, but I did pretty well; and I was able to get a scholarship to go to the University of Maryland, College Park [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Now what kind--I'm interested in what kind of counseling you received at Annapolis High School [Annapolis, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: The counseling was not very good; and the--I remember the counselor saying, "Well you probably want to go--either go to work right after high school, or maybe you could go to Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]."  But they--it was not encouraging me to really go to college to pursue anything or really encouraging me to apply to various colleges.  So I only applied to the University of Maryland, College Park.
Speaker 1: So let me get this straight, you write an article that appears on the front page of the school newspaper [Tally-Ho], which does--that means something.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was a big deal--it was a big deal in my life.
Speaker 1: And yet your, the counselor says you know you could go to work afterwards or maybe go to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Morgan State--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) feel like it, but that's kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But not encouraging me to--or help me or guide me toward, well how do you get financial aid, how do you, you know fill out the applications; and it was challenging because my mother [Florine Davis Maclin] did not go to college, my [maternal] grandmother [Maude Gray Queen] left school after the fourth grade so I didn't really have anyone who had pursued higher education.  My father [Herbert Dawson] had graduated from high school [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland], but no one said--they were--my mother said, "Well I'd like you to go to college but I can't help you and I don't know how to fill out these forms.  I don't know what to do."  So I had to figure all that out on my own.
Speaker 1: So did your sister [Gayle Dawson Symonette] help?  Your older sister that you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --you mentioned that (unclear) were sixteen [years old], right (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right, she was twenty-one, right--so she had graduated from college [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], but she--no, she didn't help me; and didn't really--we didn't have much of a relationship then.  It took a number of years to build a relationship because she was a young adult and she finds out she has a younger sister, like, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So it was pretty surprising to her.
Speaker 1: Twenty-one year olds don't have a lot of time for anything--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --except their immediate--
Speaker 2: Right, ex- their friends and what's going on; and especially a sister that she did not know growing up, and she grew up as an only child.  So that's a whole different thing as well, so--but no I was determined and learned how to fill out the forms and got lucky and got a scholarship to go to Maryland, and that--
Speaker 1: Now where were you considering going, did you consider Morgan State or (unclear) or any of the other schools?
Speaker 2: Considered it, but didn't fill out an application.  I only filled out, like--I think, just the application to Maryland.
Speaker 1: That's because it's the biggest state school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And thought I might have a chance to get a scholarship, and I got lucky and did.
Story_ID: 660326
Speaker 1: University of Maryland--this is College Park [Maryland], right?  This is big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) College Park.
Speaker 1: --the big campus.
Speaker 2: Right.  Big campus, there are what, thirty-five thousand students, eight hundred of whom are black (laughter).  So we were a very tiny community on the college campus.
Speaker 1: Eight hundred is more than a lot of schools had.
Speaker 2: Oh really (laughter)?  It was small though.  And you know, I had a pretty good college experience.  I started out trying to major in English; and then decided you know what I really want to major in journalism and switched majors.  Majored in journalism and part of the reason was I decided I wanted to work for the black student newspaper; and Maryland had a daily newspaper, The Diamondback, and I wanted to work for the Black Explosion, which had been started the year before I actually came to the campus.
Speaker 1: So the Black Explosion.  This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The Black Explosion.
Speaker 1: --is that--could it sound more militant (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No (laughter); and it still is published today, so it's still there.
Speaker 1: The Black Explosion--that's the paper of the black student--?
Speaker 2: Of the--for the black students on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it published by the Black Student Union or organization, or?
Speaker 2: No, Maryland formed like a media council, so it was part of that whole group.  In the beginning it was published by the Black Student Union; and when Maryland formed this Maryland media group it became part of that as well, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Black Explosion--and this, do you know anything about the history of it; how far back it goes?
Speaker 2: Well I got there in the fall of 1970--it was one year old; and the woman, Patricia Wheeler who became my very close friend was the founder of the paper.  So she was the first editor, I became the second editor of the paper.  So it's right around that time; and I remember one of the covers was about Attica--I think there had been a riot at Attica prison [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York]; and was very much advocating change for black students.  So learned a lot about putting together the paper.  And in the beginning we could only get the paper out about once every couple of months; and then we moved to getting it out once a month, and eventually, I think we got it out every two weeks.
Speaker 1: So did you become editor in--what, in '71 [1971], or?
Speaker 2: My junior year, so '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-three [1973], all right.  Nineteen seventy-three [1973], now this is the year after the National Black Political Convention--
Speaker 2: Right.  Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: --in Gary [Indiana], and--assembly [National Black Political Assembly], right, yeah; and so the--it's also, I think, there were student groups formed early in the '70s [1970s] YOBU [Youth Organization for Black Unity] and SOBU [Student Organization for Black Unity], all of that--do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: I remember it, I didn't become part of that.  I'll tell you, going to class and working on that newspaper--that was pretty much what I did because the newspaper just became your life.  And we had a small space inside the student union building for the Black Student Union and then the newspaper was part of that as well.  And we recruited students, whoever was sort of interested not because they were journalism majors but because they were interested in writing for the Black Explosion--we had students who did that (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 660327
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was the black community very organized at University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] by this point?  I would guess it was, but I don't know.  There had to be like a black student organization.  Was there a black faculty and staff association or any other, you know?
Speaker 2: There may have been a black faculty association--but, so I graduated in 1974 and I guess 1972 somewhere in there is when the first black fraternity came to the campus.  So starting in my junior year, I think, the fraternities and sororities started to come onto the campus.  I know the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] came on in my senior year, and I was so focused on I must graduate that I didn't try to pledge in anything.
Speaker 1: Now that's something I wouldn't have guessed--I would've guessed that black fraternities and sororities would have been there long before.
Speaker 2: No, they came in those early '70s [1970s]; and I think--
Speaker 1: That's about when they came to my school in Ohio, but mine was a new state school, and you know I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I was--I think they were already at the other campuses.
Speaker 2: Oh real- well Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], of course, was down the road from Maryland, and that's where you know a number of the fraternities and sororities were founded, so.
Speaker 1: So did University of Maryland have black students--had they had black students very long when you started?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I think that history goes back much further, but there were--it was just such a small community that you know you really didn't have large student organizations, so.
Speaker 1: Because I know--I would think that like a school like University of Maryland, Baltimore, or [HistoryMaker] Freeman Hrabowski--they would have black students long before the big school- I don't know.
Speaker 2: Bal- Baltimore campus or Baltimore County campus you're talking about; which, you know?
Speaker 1: (Mumbles) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah UMBC [University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland] because I know they have a black chancellor, I think that's what he's called at UMBC--but se that was pretty rural back then, and that still was open.  Even Maryland's campus was even a little rural because agriculture was a big major.  I remember us walking down and getting ice cream from the creamery they had.  'Cause they still had cows and everything on the campus.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was amazed that it was so close to Washington, D.C. 'cause it's you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah it is--it's very close.  So you could take the bus but I stayed on the campus most of the time.  I really didn't even go back to Annapolis [Maryland] that often except for the holidays and I would go back trying to earn some money.  I would sign up to be a substitute teacher during spring break or Christmas break or you know, something.
Speaker 1: These are the days when the, I think, the basketball team was--Lefty Driesell.
Speaker 2: Lefty Driesell; and, gosh, Len Elmore--
Speaker 1: Len Elmore.
Speaker 2: --and Tom--
Speaker 1: McMillen.
Speaker 2: --McMillen--those were the big stars, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they went to the tournament [NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament], I think they may have won one ye- I don't know.  I--but they were--
Speaker 2: I think they did win; and then Tom McMillen went on to--gosh he became, he was a scholar.
Speaker 1: Rhodes scholar [Rhodes Scholarship]?
Speaker 2: Rhodes scholar, yeah, I was trying to remember.  I think he--yeah.
Speaker 1: I think he played for some pros.  I know he played for somebody.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so did Len Elmore.  So those were--and then there was somebody else black who played tennis (makes sound) whose name has now escaped me.  And he also played basketball too, I think, but I can't remember his name now, I used to know.
Speaker 1: That's--okay, I stumped on that one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But around that time, so it was--yeah, but we went to all the games.  Our big competition was North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], so anytime North Carolina was in the house you were always there.  Didn't follow football so much, but basketball we always followed--Cole Field House was where we would go.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any special mentors or teachers at University of Maryland?
Speaker 2: Wow, not really--depending on what class I was taking, I you know worked with that teacher, but not really.  No one I really grew close with or who really kind of guided me through the curriculum.
Story_ID: 660328
Speaker 1: Did you have any relationship with the Afro newspapers [Afro-American Newspapers] at all?
Speaker 2: I did not--I would read them, but no, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or any of the black papers during that time period?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I did not.  Yeah the Afro was the one that we read.  And (laughter) one of the big stories that I remember the Afro doing, I told you--right after the early '70s [1970s] or right around 1970, until that point the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] only admitted one or two black midshipmen; and it was 1970 or '72 [1972] when they had done a lot of recruiting and they had about a dozen black midshipmen.  I remember that was one of the big stories that the Afro had--we were all talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did your family--I didn't ask you this, but growing up did you get like the Johnson publications, Jet and Ebony and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: We'd pick it up occasionally, but not regular subscription; but occasionally Ebony would be the one that we would look at--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) sort of the black life.
Story_ID: 660329
Speaker 1: Now did you get any summer jobs in--in journalism in college [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes, the job I think that had the most influence, I had an internship with Newsweek magazine; and learned how they put their magazine together and the stories, and it also taught me that I didn't want to be a magazine writer.  (Laughter) I was more--I liked the daily newspaper and so I mean you learn through experience, so that was an experience.
Speaker 1: Why--what was so bad about being a Newsweek magazine writer?
Speaker 2: It's you know one week at a time, and you may write just a piece of a story.  You're researching maybe just a small portion that becomes a part of a bigger story.  You may or may not get a byline.  Newspaper you get a byline; you write the whole story, you learn how to research everything and you're doing it every day.  So it was that pace of: I--you've got this done today, you had a deadline today that you had to meet, and that's what I liked.  I liked going after something every day and getting it done; and the other thing about being a journalist is you're always learning something new.  If you know--depending what stage you're in in life or what you may want to go after, you're learning something new all the time, so.
Speaker 1: So when were you at Newsweek, what summer was that?
Speaker 2: Summer of 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you in the New York [New York], or?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was in a New York office; and I worked very closely with a woman named Veronica Pollard, and I remember Veronica actually helped me a lot learning about the magazine, but also life things; and there was something going on, and she asked me if, had I ever been on a plane.  Twenty-one years old and I'd never ridden a plane, and so she set it up so I could fly from New York to Washington [D.C.]--it wasn't very far.  But that was actually my first plane ride, and it was about a story.  So rather than take the train, I actually flew; but, and that made a difference in my life in term- when I got ready to interview for jobs, I had that experience; and that was one of the things that helps to round you out.
Story_ID: 660330
Speaker 1: So the D.C. area [Washington, D.C.] around this time and national news, this is like, we're heading--in '73 [1973] we're head- heading for the downfall of Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Watergate starts a little investigation and starts to grow.
Speaker 2: (Gesture) Blew up, right; and that--and I read--one of the things that I did do when I lived on the campus [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland], I subscribed to The Washington Post.  So I read the paper every day reading The Post.  So I'm reading the investigation and what's going on.  But it wasn't so much--I know, when you talk to some white journalists especially of that, from that era they'll say that's what influenced them to go into journalism.  That really was not what did it for me.  It really was more that I wanted to tell stories from the African American community, and make sure that they were stories that were balanced.  Just stories that we weren't telling about our community or did not make the papers.  I wanted to change the world in that sense, and make that kind of a difference.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know a lot of people that we interview that go into journalism--African American people talk about that wanting to set the record straight 'cause--
Speaker 2: And it's true because, I think I was telling you earlier, you know newspapers wrote stories about blacks if they committed a crime or if you died.  Those were the only times that you'd be in the newspaper, but yet all the statistics show that blacks are the greatest consumers of news.  That they would--really read newspapers, they were loyal newspaper readers, but they're not reading about themselves, they're reading about other people; and so I really wanted to make that effort to make sure that we had that story--those stories in the papers, so.  That was what convinced me to go in--that's why I worked for the Black Explosion.  That experience that I had on the Black Explosion and my Newsweek internship led me to get a job right out of school at the Wilmington, Delaware newspaper [The News Journal], circulation a hundred thousand, which was a good size newspaper.  Some people had to go work for a weekly or twice weekly paper--I was able to go work for a daily newspaper and you know build my career from there, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So like Watergate hearing is ended toward the time--and the philosophy, the process of journalism is in the news a lot, I guess that's why I kind of focus on this in some ways because people you know talked about journalistic ethics and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, was--were Woodward [Bob Woodward] and Bernstein [Carl Bernstein] you know pushing the boundaries, you know; or?
Speaker 2: Exactly--and that was part of--we had discussions about that, but we also had discussions about, well how does this tie into the black community; and those are questions that you don't necessarily--that weren't being asked, and that was one of the things.  But yes, they pushed the boundaries, how could--could I be an investigative reporter so all that came about.
Story_ID: 660331
Speaker 1: So this time, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there was a lot of information available especially about black thought and black ideas in those days in the public media--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) music and radio, TV.  I mean, a lot black reporters were trying, were starting to make a noise; you had like Tony Brown on.
Speaker 2: Right, the- 'Tony Brown's Journal.'  When I went to the Phil- and some of this grew out of the Kerner Commission report and looking at the fact that there were hardly any black reporters available to cover the news in 1968.  So there was this big push in the early--late--the very late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s] to do more public affairs talk shows.  And so coming into Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I watched 'Tony Brown's Journal.'  There was a show with--oh gosh I'm blanking on his name, and it's right over there--but it was a black talk show in Philadelphia with [HistoryMaker] Acel Moore and with, he's dead now, oh, I can't think of his name but it will come to me.  But anyway their talk show was very popular and it was 'Black Perspectives on the News,' and that's what it was.  It was a black perspective looking at the events of what was going on and covering it.  Vernon Odom, a television reporter in Philadelphia also had a TV show that he did that looked at issues going on in the community.  So there were a number of people who did that.  In newspapers in Philadelphia, one of the things was [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone was a columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News; Claude Lewis was a columnist at the Evening Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin]; and Acel Moore was a columnist at The Philadelphia Inquirer.  So the city had three major newspapers--actually four, there is a Philadelphia Journal.  But there were three black columnists who were writing all the time about issues going on in the black community.  And that's one of the things that attracted me to Philadelphia, and to that whole area.  I spent--
Speaker 1: Wilmington's adjacent to Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Exact- yeah, so.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) like how many miles, what--?
Speaker 2: About thirty--
Speaker 1: Thirty miles.
Speaker 2: --about thirty miles.  So I, I get to Wilmington [Delaware] in 1974, and I'm the only black reporter on the staff [of The News Journal].  (Laughter) And the- I used to talk to a woman who worked in the newspaper library and black janitor at night, because I worked at night when I first got there.  But you know I used the opportunity to cover as many stories as I could.  I would fight to get my stories on the front page.  And in--I wanted to connect with other black journalists to talk about their experiences, what could I do--because I was very young and did not know how to you negotiate in the newsroom, how do you get to these other points?  So Philadelphia, I think I met [HistoryMaker] Joe Davidson somehow, and he invited me to a meeting of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists.  So I would drive up from Wilmington to Philadelphia; and at this point they hadn't connected 95 [Interstate 95] between Wilmington and (laughter) Philadelphia so you had to wind your way through the City of Chester [Pennsylvania]--very interesting (laughter).  But I would go to the meetings and that's how I met Claude, I met Acel and Chuck and they all became mentors to me in various ways.  And Acel was very helpful in me getting to The Philadelphia Inquirer; and I met--I worked at the Evening Bulletin before The Inquirer, and Claude Lewis always had an open door to talk to black journalists, and I would go in just about every day to talk to Claude.  And, of course, I met Chuck through the meetings of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists.  Now the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists is considered the founding chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists because much of what's in the bylaws is based on what we had in Philadelphia.  And Philadelphia was--Journalists was started while I was still in college [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland], so I didn't join it at the beginning but I'm one of their early members that came into the organization.
Story_ID: 660332
Speaker 1: Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] is the home of the formal black journalism, I gue- I mean professional black journalism in the first place (unclear) the Freedom Journal [sic. Freedom's Journal]--
Speaker 2: Right--oh, that's right I had forgotten about the Freedom Journal (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) (unclear) 1827 or something?
Speaker 2: Right.  That's right--I have forgotten about that.
Speaker 1: John Russwurm [John Brown Russwurm] and--I can't think of his other, the other (unclear) of the name.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah I know who you're talking about, yeah--but I had forgotten about that.  And so yeah, coming to--being in Wilmington [Delaware] and coming up to Philadelphia was learning a lot about Philadelphia.  Wilmington had its own issues, one of the big issues was school desegregation; and Wilmington was a city surrounded by eleven suburban school districts, mostly white, and what they wanted to do was desegregate.  So the City of Wilmington ends up being carved and--carved up and parts of it became with the suburban districts.  So you could more equally distribute money among the schools because schools really didn't have a lot of money.  (Laughter) I remember the, there was a district--excuse me--at that time called the De-la-ware school district [ph.].  They broke it out so it was hyph- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) De-la-ware?
Speaker 2: De-la-ware, it was hyphenated: D-E, hyphen, L-A, hyphen, ware, W-A-R-E--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --De-la-ware school district.  De-la-ware had very little money.  They still had books that did not have Hawaii and Alaska as states, and this is in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Now this is a black district?
Speaker 2: This was--it was a mix of white and black, it was just a very poor district; but that's what they wanted to do was create something more equitable.  And the reason I mention this is because I was a reporter [at The News Journal] that worked at night.  I covered a lot of the school board meetings where desegregation was discussed.  So I was involved in putting together a lot of that, but it also went through the courts for a number of years.  So I wasn't doing so much the court stories, but a lot of the day to day involvement of those stories.  And community action agencies were big in the mid-'70s [1970s] so I covered the community action agency in Wilmington; and I used those clips after four and a half years.  I got a job at the Evening Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin] and I worked there for another four and half years, I think.  The Bulletin closed in 1982 and I took a year off--I was pregnant with my son [Sean Long] and took a year off with him; and then started working as a freelancer for The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer]--a stringer (air quotes) is what we were called.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we're breezing too fast--we have to go back a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).  Okay, I'll slow it up (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Wilmington--so what was the significance of this De-la-ware school district?  They are poor but what was the?
Speaker 2: They were poor, they wanted to merge with Wilmington so they could have more money for students; and it was also--it was a district I think that was mostly black but it was a suburban district.  And then you had the Christina district [Christina School District], which was a very wealthy district.  'Cause Wilmington--the DuPont family, of course, there's a lot of DuPont money in Delaware, so that was it.  And actually the newspaper was founded by the DuPont family.  It used to be two papers: The Morning News and the evening news [The Evening Journal]--there were two brothers that owned the papers at one point.  They merged them into one; and eventually the paper was sold to Gannett [Gannett Company, Inc.], I think in 1977, '76 [sic. 1979]--somewhere along that line.  And it went from six days a week, when I came to the paper in '74 [1974] it was six days a week; and in '76 [1976] they added the Sunday paper, so it grew.
Speaker 1: So this--well, it seems like a situation that would cause some conflict.  You are the only black reporter--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with school desegregation being the biggest issue--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you're going to school board meetings late night.
Speaker 2: Right, that's what I'm doing.
Speaker 1: So were you ever in any danger?
Speaker 2: No, not really because I always identified myself--I was able to meet with people--no, that wasn't it.  What I felt more so was I was excluded from the very big stories.  The school board meeting stories often--routine and would be in the B section of the paper.  I wanted to be part of the bigger stories on desegregation that were on A1, and those were often--they were given to the white reporters; and after I was at the paper for a year, (laughter) and I remember going to my editor and I had you know worked very hard, done a lot of stories and I wanted a raise.  And he went through and counted the number of page one stories that I had and he came back and told me that I couldn't have a raise because I didn't have enough page one stories.  I said, "Well I don't make the decision on what goes on page one.  You know, I'm writing the stories, and you know," but he said, "If you had more page one stories and--you know we could give you a raise."  And that's when I knew it was time to look for another job because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he the one who made those decisions as to?
Speaker 2: He was one of the people.  (Laughter) So I mean that just told me a lot--it was time to move on.  I was not going to move up there but so far as long as he remained my supervisor.
Story_ID: 660333
Speaker 1: You went on to the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is in 1975 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Seven [1977], 1977--well, we're missing something here.  We mi- we have you attending the local meetings of NABJ, but you were at the founding meetings of the national, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did leave that out.  Yes, so I was still--
Speaker 1: That's in 1975?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975], December 1975; and I was still a reporter at The Wilmington News Journal [The News Journal], and they--I was able to convince them to send me.  The idea was to cover I think it was the Black Caucus, which was also in its infancy in those days.  I think we were saying there was a meeting or something from there that we were going to cover.  But I remember taking the train down and getting off the train in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and thin- I knew about the meeting to form the National Association of Black Journalists because we'd also talked about it in the chapter meetings, the Philadelphia chapter [Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists].
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting, I'm just now really getting to this.  I probably heard this before but didn't really hear it but that--so you went down ostensibly to cover the Black Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and but so did all the black reporters know that they were going to meet to form NABJ, or (unclear) something like it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there was--somehow the word got out.
Speaker 1: But they didn't announce to their papers, I'm going to form NABJ--
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) they were going to cover the Black Caucus.
Speaker 2: No because it was actually a big deal, and you didn't know if you'd have a job.  I mean there were pe- there were people who were there who were hesitant to sign.  I mean there was a sign in sheet; and you'll see there are forty-four of us who signed our names and what our news affiliation was.  Most of us were newspaper people.  But there were a few people who were, "I don't think I can sign it because if they found out I was here, I might not have a job."  So it was a very brave thing to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah to be clear for anybody looking at this in the future, NABJ is formed by the black employees of the major white media, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, for the most part.  There were not really any black newspapers.  The black press did not really be part of this for whatever reason.  In those early days the black press just was not a big part of it.  But it was mostly employees--and most of us, I think, were on the East Coast because I talk to people today and they said, "Well you know if we knew about the meeting, I would have been there.  You know I was in the business at that point; I would have come if I had known the organization was being founded," and I said, "Well."
Story_ID: 660334
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask one of these begging questions here.  You all have--you've gone to college, you've got a job with a major newspaper--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean, what could be wrong; what would you all have to discuss?
Speaker 2: Oh we had so much to discuss (laughter); and just as I said to you: how to negotiate for a raise in the newsroom.  How to negotiate for better assignments; and your white colleagues were not telling you these things, and they didn't care whether or not you were involved in a story.  So--
Speaker 1: So you--how do you do things without having any allies--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the organization?
Speaker 2: Exactly and because many of us were the only black reporter or very--there was still very few black editors at that point.  But you could be the only black person on the staff.  So it was also lonely in a lot of cases because you didn't have anyone who looked like you that you could discuss things with.  Do you know what, do you know what I mean?  We were all very young you know at that point.  There were people who had been in the business who were the pioneers and then NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] was formed, but we stand on their shoulders for you know the work that they did, but.  It--just--how to get another job, how to look for a job?  I mean there were so many things that we needed to talk about; and coming together and you're like wow, you face that issue too, well how did you handle it?  I mean it was--and there were still very few black women that were in this business as well.  Out of the forty-four, there were eleven women that were part of the founding group, so.
Speaker 1: In those days it was really a--it was tougher for a black woman to get (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was, there were--that's why I'm saying it was fewer black women that were in the business; and black women were starting to make inroads in television and in newspapers, but there still were not a lot of us--and in radio.  So you'll see the symbol has those three things.  The new media is--we're still learning how to grapple with that; and the industry has changed in these thirty-nine years.  I can't believe it's been thirty-nine years but it has been.  But, yeah, no, we came together to talk about many issues that we needed to talk about; and also to have a voice at a national level on issues that were taking place and how people were treated in the business.  Things that were and were not being covered; and [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone who just passed away within the last month of this interview was the founding president, and pretty much it was unanimous that he be the president of the organization because he'd been a leading voice to really a form a national association of black journalists, so.
Speaker 1: Now were there--I've heard that there was--there were you know stories of indignation told at these, at this meeting.  People were crying; people were, felt that their white spouses were being attacked at some point.  I mean there were a lot of different stories I hear coming out of these initial meetings of NABJ.
Speaker 2: Right, oh, okay--and it could be; I don't remember all of that out of that initial meeting.  What I remember is wow, being in the room with some people I'd heard of and we're now agreeing that we're forming a national organization.  This is a big deal, this could be life changing and what am I going to tell my bosses [at The News Journal] when I get back.  So I don't remember that type of indignation, it was more of I'm glad that we're coming together for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were the issues that attracted you, I mean that you thought were the most important at that point?
Speaker 2: Really someone--the connection, so you could sh- have someone that you could share with, how do you--this happened to me.  Has this happened to you in the newsroom?  Here's what I think I should do.  How have--what do you think I should do?  How has it been handled?  Just kind of sharing those points of you know, how to elevate yourself in the newsroom; and how to handle yourself so you can get through; how to get better stories, how to get better story assignments; and how to cover a beat.  And they sound like basic things but they were important to all of us because a lot of us didn't have that experience coming in.  I mean these were our first newspaper jobs, and for some newspapers it was a first time they were hiring people.  That was another thing--promote- being promoted to jobs that previously had not been opened to African Americans.  So you're now dealing with a mostly white staff in a lot of cases, how do you handle that?  You know you've got somebody on your staff who doesn't want you to edit them becau- you know so how do you handle that?  Is it a black issue, is it a racial issue or is it just a news issue?  You know, just, just having those types of discussions and know that you're not alone--there's other people in this business.  And whenever I went to NABJ I'd always come back feeling a little more inspired and--okay, yeah, you can make it, you can--you'll do well in this business, so.
Story_ID: 660335
Speaker 1: Now what, what was the reaction of the Philadelphia Bulletin I gue- no, you were at (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in Wilmington [Delaware], I was in Wilmington.
Speaker 1: You were in Wilmington.  What was their reaction [at The News Journal] when they found out that the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] was formed and you were a part of it?
Speaker 2: A couple of my white colleagues thought, wow, that's a really big deal, that's really great; that was really good.  The editors were kind of like, okay, so--they didn't really react one way or the other, they didn't really care that much, so (shrugs shoulders).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's okay.
Speaker 1: So did--but NABJ did make a difference in your life as a journalist?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, definitely.  Yeah partly be- there are connections, there're friendships that I made over the years, you keep.  Here it is thirty-nine years later and there are people you look forward--you may see them once a year because they work all over the country but they're friends; you've made lifelong friends in the organization.  So and that's important; and there're also people I can--I know I can go into almost any city, call someone and say, "I'd like to come see your newsroom," and so they'd say of course I could see their newsroom.  Or I'm working on something, "Who can I connect with in your city?"  So I have contacts that are immediately built in and in those days the organization was very small so you could--you know, you knew most of the people.  But now, of course, it's over what, three thousand people maybe close to four thousand that are members.  So it's very different, it's evolved over the years.
Speaker 1: So initially it was forty-four people?
Speaker 2: It was forty-four of us.
Speaker 1: At that--okay, in 1975--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 660336
Speaker 1: In '76 [1976] you were still in Wilmington [Delaware], or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I left Wilmington in 1977.
Speaker 1: All right, now '76 [1976]--was it seventy- no it was before that.  Well, 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] actually as a book came out what in '74 [1974]--'73 [1973], '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: No, I think '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it did come out in 1976, right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know the movie came out in '77 [1977]--the TV movie ['Roots'].
Speaker 2: Right; and I think the book came out in '76 [1976] so right around that time.
Speaker 1: All right so it came out in--were you, did you continue--well I guess you continued to be interested in that?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) And I think I covered the story when he came to--Alex Haley came to Wilmington to speak before the movie was done and everything.  So I think I did cover the story then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you think of the book when it was finally (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh I thought it was great.  You know, page turner, you know, reading it.  I thought it was awesome; and I could remember some of the things that he talked about when I heard him talk about his research in 1970; and now here it is, he's you know done a book on it so I thought that was pretty amazing too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 660337
Speaker 1: Any other thoughts about Wilmington [Delaware] before we move to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Wilmington was a small town, learned a lot there.  I was able to--that's where I guess I could make mistakes, and then you know grow from my experiences.  Glad I went there first and was able to move on.
Speaker 1: Was there anybody there that you bonded with at all?
Speaker 2: I did have a couple of friends on the staff [of The News Journal] that I made.  There was a couple of women--a couple of white women that I connected with; and we'd go out to lunch and talk about what we were covering and the stories and that sort of thing.  But Wilmington was--I spent the time there but I was also looking, where else could I move to, (laughter) especially after I had the editor tell me I didn't have enough front page stories; and the white women I talked to, their experiences were a little bit different. Nobody was saying that to them.  So he had set up a different criteria for me, which I thought was not fair.
Speaker 1: Did they commiserate with you all on any level of having similar problems because there were women on (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes we did connect because we were women; and we talk- you know talked about being able to move up, and what else could we do on the staff; and would we always stay there, and none of us did--we all moved on to different places, so.  And for a couple of years I stayed in touch with them, but eventually we lost contact.
Story_ID: 660338
Speaker 1: Well tell us about how you went over to the Evening Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin].
Speaker 2: Let's see, so I think I went in the fall of 1977; and I took a job--
Speaker 1: Well how did it happen?
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: How did it--did you find about it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Really connecting, I think, with Claude Lewis, and learning that there was a position that was open; and then connecting with, I don't remember who the editor was that I connected with at that time, but sending them clips of my work and calling and saying that I was interested in coming and I could you know do some things.  And I went there, and my first job was at night.  I remember working Tuesday through Saturday, seven p.m. to three a.m.--I think it was.  Not a good way to meet people; you don't (laughter) you know because Saturday night you're not, you can't really go out so that was kind of hard meeting new people in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But I did that for a while; then there was--at that point the Bulletin had a Wilmington [Delaware] bureau, and I actually because I had experience in Wilmington and knew it, I went to work in the Wilmington bureau I think for about four or five months during the day, and commuted from Philadelphia back to Wilmington.  So I couldn't quite get away from it.  But that was a good experience because then I was writing for a major metropolitan daily, not The Wilmington News Journal [The News Journal]; so I still moved on.  But my experience at the Bulletin was great.  I did--I worked as a reporter in the suburbs, Delaware County [Pennsylvania].  I remember one--the Bulletin started out as an evening paper but then to compete, the mid-'70s [1970s] were a time where you saw a lot of newspapers folding because the advertising dollars were shrinking and evening papers were going away because people's lifestyles were changing; and you really wanted a morning paper.  So the Bulletin switched and became a morning paper--yeah, it started in the morning.  But before it switched the last deadline of the day, I think, was around one p.m.; and I, part of my coverage was the City of Chester [Pennsylvania] and there was--the mayor [John H. Nacrelli] had resigned for some corruption reason that I've forgotten.  At any rate, I was there when he resigned and got an interview with the mayor, was able to call it in for that final edition on deadline that--literally talking, you know you see the jokes, "Get me rewrite," and had somebody rewrite the story as I'm dictating it; and get it on the front page of the five star edition I think it was called at that point.  So I had a lot of fun and I continued to grow while I was at the Bulletin; and then I also realized I wanted different experiences, so I took a job--a position as a copy editor in the features department, and that really helped my writing as well because as a copy editor you're looking not just for the spelling but the grammar and you know how you can say things more succinctly, and you know making the story better; and then you have to write a headline to go with the story, captions for the photos.  So I grew as a journalist and learned; and I also had, did the layouts sometimes of the features section.  So I learned a little bit more about production.
Story_ID: 660339
Speaker 1: What's the philosophy behind writing a headline?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You, you want to convey what the story is about in a few words, but from really the first few gra- paragraphs of the story is where you try to get it.  And it's always a little more challenging with feature stories because that may not necessarily be the meat of the story.  So you have to really kind of think about, what's the whole story about.  So that's--yeah (laughter).  And I'm assuming you ask that because people are always complaining, "Well the headline was misleading," or "The headline was this," but you really do try to make the headline give you the gist of the story from those first four to five paragraphs that you are doing--at least that's what I did back then.
Speaker 1: But you--well, I don't know--newspapers have personalities like New York Daily News, their headlines are always a pun or some comic hook that pulls people into it; whereas dail- well The New York Times is di- always different.  But what was the character of the Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin] in terms of head- how they use headlines, and?
Speaker 2: Oh I think the Bulletin was pretty much straight forward.  The Bulletin was a conservative paper--it was a family owned newspaper, so they were concerned about family values.  So there was nothing that was really going to hook you or be misleading or outrageous, the--that was not the Bulletin; that's not what we did.
Story_ID: 660340
Speaker 1: Yeah we were discussing off, offline here the character of the three papers and the three black reporters you know and their styles you know matching up to the papers that they worked for but you said the Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin] was more of a conservative kind of a paper?
Speaker 2: Right, I think the Bulletin was more conservative, but what made it interesting in coming to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the mid-'70s [1970s] was having a different black columnist at each paper.  So Claude Lewis was at the Bulletin; [HistoryMaker] Acel Moore was at The Philadelphia Inquirer; and [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone was at the Daily News [Philadelphia Daily News], and Chuck had this big personality.  He liked to use big words that you needed the dictionary to look up often; but he also had a personality where people who needed--were supposed to be arrested for some reason or the other would surrender to Chuck because they were afraid to go to the police because they didn't know how they would be treated.  So that made the Daily News interesting in that sense.  Acel was always a little--was sort of on the cutting edge of news and really in the community connecting with people and what was going on.  There was also a gang problem that was not as bad in the mid-'70s [1970s], it was starting to wane a little bit, but there was still a gang problem and they--Acel had a little more connection writing about some of those issues that went on.  But you could see the different personalities in all three of them, and connecting with the news and what was going on.  And I was lucky to know all three men and learn from them during that period of time.
Speaker 1: I think the--I think it's borne out by the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] presidential selection that Chuck Stone was one of the most well known black journalists in the country at that time and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --would regularly appear on 'The Phil Donahue Show' and other talk shows--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Chuck was--Chuck was pretty amazing.  I mean he did, he just had a very big personality--but he also had time to talk to journalists that were coming up and he made that time for you; so he was good.  As did Claude and Acel, and you know I still talk to both of them from time to time now.
Story_ID: 660341
Speaker 1: Now was the, the Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin] a politically conservative paper, I mean was it on the right wing of the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Um-hm, um-hm. Yeah, yeah, I'd s- much more conservative; and my last job at the Bulletin just before it folded was on the editorial board.  So sometimes the columns that I proposed or the editorials that I proposed were not as conservative as they should have been, so I would have to rewrite them a little bit to fit more with the tone of what the paper should be.
Speaker 1: For instance, like what position did they take on school desegregation?
Speaker 2: They supported it, but take it slow.  (Laughter) Don't--let's not rush, let's not make changes to quickly here.  So, it was--yeah, I just felt that the Bulletin was much more conservative.
Speaker 1: Now this--you mentioned prisoners turning themselves in to [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone, I mean or fugitives--
Speaker 2: Fugitives, yes.
Speaker 1: --or wanted people--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) is because I think he had at least a public--the perception of him was that he was someone who was for justice you know in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that wanted--in a city that--where the--well like a lot of bigger cities the police and the justice system--criminal justice system was known for abuses.
Speaker 2: Right; and that's part of what Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] had a reputation for.  So people would go to Chuck and turn themselves in and then go to the police; and they felt like well if Chuck knows about it, then nothing will happen to me; I'll be able to navigate whatever issues they may have had.  But, that went on for a while.
Speaker 1: So, black people, and maybe some white people too saw him and maybe other reporters as a somehow a shield against--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know abuses by the criminal justice system.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: If you--if a reporter knows that I'm being arrested for this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --then they have to treat me right because they have to be accountable to--
Speaker 2: Yes and that was the feeling, that was the philosophy.  So that was why he did that; and you know--and he would write about it in his column, so and so had turned themselves in, and what they were wanted for and all those issues, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know there were similar stories about the Panthers [Black Panther Party] coming to Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] in Chicago [Illinois] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the radio and you know--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --other such stories around the country.
Speaker 2: I had forgotten about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so we got--the police situation begins to really you know deteriorate under the leadership of Mayor Frank Rizzo, right?  Which starts before you get, you arrived in town.
Speaker 2: Right, it did.  But it continued (laughter) while I was at the Bulletin; and used to try to do stories--I would work with a white male reporter and we'd try to do stories about how it impacted different communities at the Bulletin.  And we actually won an award, I think we came in third place for some of our reporting on what was going on in the communities, and how it related to Frank Rizzo and the political scene at that point, so.
Speaker 1: Now I know we have a note here that in '78 [1978] the--no, that's with The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer], I'm sorry; that's not with the Bulletin.  The Inquirer won the Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize in Public Service] for investigation of the police department [Philadelphia Police Department].
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, but that's was before I got to The Inquirer, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, you were still at the Bulletin at that point.  But the Bulletin is even investigating--the conservative paper's even doing some investigation.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah because it became so outrageous that you had you know to look at some of it.  Yeah, Frank Rizzo was something.
Speaker 1: Now he was a former police chief.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and then I think his brother [Joseph Rizzo] became police chief under him--or fire chief, that's what it was.  I think his brother became the fire chief.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But yeah, he--it was quite a dynasty under Frank Rizzo.
Speaker 1: Yeah now he was going into--he was in the middle of his second term, I guess when you or started his second term at least when you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Yeah so that's when we were looking at--we were covering communities in Philadelphia and just what was going on and how they were impacted by the police and what, you know--and there was little things, it might be trash pickup, might be--I don't know, just however the im- communities were impacted.
Story_ID: 660342
Speaker 1: So you were--were you a copy editor in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe I was a copy editor in '78 [1978].  No, let's see, I got there in '77 [1977]--no, so I wasn't; I was still a reporter.  I think I became a copy editor maybe in '79 [1979] and stayed a copy editor until about 1980--'80 [1980]; and then I became an editorial writer and I did, wrote editorials and also part of my job was editing the letters that appeared in the Saturday paper.  So learned how to do that.  So I spent time, a good bit of time on the editorial board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then the Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin] folded in January 1982, so.
Speaker 1: So I know the first appearance of MOVE as a big news story is 1978 when they have a shootout with the police [Philadelphia Police Department].
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you cover any of that?
Speaker 2: I did not; I didn't cover any of the, that part of it.
Speaker 1: Now was there a black reporter assigned to--?
Speaker 2: To cover MOVE--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from the Bulletin?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I don't think so--I don't think it was a black reporter who was assigned to cover.  I don't remember who did at this point.  I know Claude [Claude Lewis] wrote about it in his column but you know he wrote about whatever was going on in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But there were, there was a black reporter who was a police reporter.  So I know he did a number of stories as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a black photographer on the staff as well, who shot some MOVE things.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Don Camp, C-A-M-P [HistoryMaker Donald Camp]--and he and I are still friends today.
Speaker 1: Was he the first black photographer?
Speaker 2: I don't think that he was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but he and I had gone out on a couple of stories, and that's how we connected.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so in--so in 1980, '80 [1980] is when you--well the Bulletin is sold in '80 [1980], right?  So this is a--
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982] is when the Bulletin folded--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --January 29, 1982.
Speaker 1: All right now (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I remember the day (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before we get to that, I want to go back a little bit to Frank Rizzo.  And the story that The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer] did, do you think that led to his not--his being unelectable in, for a third term?
Speaker 2: I think some of it did; and the Bulletin would follow, I mean the papers were pretty close.  It was a, it was definitely a very competitive era in newspapers in Philadelphia because you had all the papers were competing against each other; we would show up at the same stories, but they were going head to head.  And The In- we lament how The Inquirer may have beat us out on something, but yeah I think that probably led to it.  And also with the Bulletin--whatever stories the Bulletin was doing at that time as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So Frank Rizzo loses in '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Is that when?  Yeah, I had forgotten about that.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And Bill Green [William J. Green III] becomes the mayor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in '80 [1980]; was his administration different, you think?
Speaker 2: It was more open, and I think Bill Green brought more blacks into his administration.  Thing- I think things started to open up a little more under Bill Green as you went on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I didn't really cover the politics; I covered a lot of the local news and communities--what was going on there.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were some of the stories that you remember that you covered?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I have no idea--well I told you about the Chester mayor [John H. Nacrelli] resigning, so I covered the City of Chester [Pennsylvania]; I covered Radnor [Radnor Township, Pennsylvania], the suburbs.  I would sometimes go into some of the communities and West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and do feature stories on black families.  I covered school districts--those kinds of things.  So it was more general assignments, so I did a little bit of everything--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --that needed to be done.
Story_ID: 660343
Speaker 1: So in '82 [1982] you left the Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin]?
Speaker 2: Well, it folded.
Speaker 1: It folded (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I had no choice (laughter); and I was actually on maternity leave, so--because I was pregnant with, I was eight months pregnant with my son [Sean Long] at that point.  So when it folded, didn't really have a job to go back to; and there, didn't, gosh I knew I wanted to take time off to spend with my son, so I didn't really pursue going to The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer] to see if they would hire me.  Because The Inquirer hired, I think a couple of hundred people when the Bulletin folded; and they had been looking at it.  They had a plan in place, so when the Bulletin folded they kind of knew who they would hire.  Not a lot of them were African Americans--excuse me--at that point.  So I waited and my son was born in February; and December of 1982 I took a job with The Inquirer as a stringer, which basically meant you got paid by the story--paid by the piece as they would call it--and covering the suburbs.  And I did that for about a year; and January 1984, The Inquirer hired me full time on their staff.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so you came in as a correspondent, or?
Speaker 2: Yes, stringer.  Yeah, correspondent is the more elegant word (laughter).
Speaker 1: I see.  I see.  All right but you were hired full time as a reporter then, right?
Speaker 2: January '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: January '84 [1984].  Okay, all right.  So the issues are still the same in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I guess but how were the approaches of the two papers different, I guess in terms of how they (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think The Inquirer had a--more resources than the Bulletin actually had.  More people; and they would give you a little more time to explore the issues and to really look at them.  And again, I spent a lot of my time in the suburbs, so I wasn't covering the City of Philadelphia so much in those early years.  But more looking at what was going on in suburban school districts, suburban towns; and how it then related to Philadelphia because they're all connected.
Story_ID: 660344
Speaker 1: You're covering the suburbs [at The Philadelphia Inquirer] during the time that the MOVE was (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I actually was.  Yeah, when MOVE happened, it was Mother's Day, 1985.  But they called in reporters from everywhere to go cover that because it was one of the biggest issues ever in the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  The bomb was dropped on the house, it was C22 [ph.], it wasn't a smoke bomb and people were killed.  The police were shooting, the MOVE people were shooting--it was never really clear.  And the- I mean there have been a lot of reports since then and the neighborhood burned down.  People lost their homes, they ushered them out on Mother's Day.  Some people had gone to church and they had nothing when they came back through no fault of their own.  The whole neighborhood was gone, which was ridiculous.  And the iss- I mean and you went to look at it--so I didn't go the first day, I think, the second day is when I was deployed to try to come up with some stories that were going on.  And second day was harder because a lot of the good stories--you know you write about people's misfortune.  So I hate to use the word good, but in terms of looking at what you're trying to do, finding people and talking to them about what happened became more difficult as the days went on.  And it turned from shock to anger; you know, what happens now, what happens to us now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people want to know who is to blame.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is not a natural disaster--
Speaker 2: No, it was not.
Speaker 1: --so who did this.
Speaker 2: Yeah; and the city had done it, so.
Speaker 1: In terms of the city, is it fair to blame the mayor?
Speaker 2: Well I think Mayor Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.] did take ultimate responsibility for what happened that day.  And you know whether it was poor advice that he received, or not knowing that it was not a bomb that was going to level the home and then burn the whole neighborhood, I'm--no one wanted that I'm very sure of that but that is what happened.  It's hard to believe that's almost thirty years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So what was an incendiary device, some would describe it as a bomb like you just said--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --dropped on the roof of the MOVE--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --home--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: --on Osage [Avenue].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Osage had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) These are row houses, right?
Speaker 2: These are row homes and that's why they burned so quickly.  It was terrible.
Speaker 1: What was your perception of MOVE in those days, I mean what kind of group was it?
Speaker 2: It was a fringe group, really--that was my perception.  Some, they had some points about the way they were treated in the city but they were so--they were a little bit too far, as far as I was concerned, to the left.  And you know, if you lived in that neighborhood and they are up on the roof at two a.m. on a loud speaker, they're destroying your life and infringing on your personal--how you live in that neighborhood.  I don't think that was fair.  So that always bothered me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  For the sake of history, like what were they about?  I mean what were they organized around?
Speaker 2: I was never really clear on that (laughter); and that's why I say they were a fringe group because it was part religion, part eating healthy, organic--they had those issues.  I know they wanted to be free, but it was never clear that it was one particular issue.  It was more sort of rantings or railings against government, but yet living in an urban environment; so they weren't good neighbors to the people around them.  And so, the police finally--you know, Mother's Day figuring a lot of people would go to church was the chance to go in and arrest them; and (gesture) it all went wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So are there any lessons being learned from this, you think, or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think the police changed the way that they would approach those whole issues and how it's handled at this point.  I think there are many lessons to be learned.  There were lessons for the--they hired contractors to rebuild homes and a lot of the homes were not built well after that whole event; so how all that's handled.  There was a lot of money spent that was not spent well, so I think you know looking at that, just--but in terms of police and handling those situations, the approach totally changed, I think.
Story_ID: 660345
Speaker 1: Just kind of walk us through your career at the tri- at The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer] you know your, the, your career moves and some of the highlights for us, in the eight- late '80s [1980s], and?
Speaker 2: Oh in, at The Inquirer?  I started out--that, I was hired full time on the staff working in the Horsham Neighbors bureau, which The Inquirer when the Bulletin [Philadelphia Bulletin] folded it started Neighbors sections that came out once a week; and they really did local news in various communities around the suburbs of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Horsham [Pennsylvania], which covered part of Montgomery County [Pennsylvania], was one of the first Neighbors sections.  And so I reported on various communities, and I've forgotten which ones at this point, but that's what I did.  Then I spent some time--also The Inquirer had a section that came out once a week on Sundays and oh gosh I've forgotten the name of the section, but I was the last editor for that section as they decided we could phase this out and then put neighbor sections on Sundays.  So Neighbors came out Thursdays once a week and then they wanted to expand to Sundays; and this section which was features and had local community stories in it was on its way out.  So I did that I think maybe about six months--not very long.  And I had a maternity leave, unfortunately it was a maternity cut short and I lost a child at six months into my pregnancy.  So when I came back I did, I think I was still a reporter.  But I wanted a chance to do editing, and I became a Neighbors assistant editor.  So that was one of the next things that I did working in the--I think I was still in the Horsham bureau.  And then I became the editor of a Neighbors section on the Main Line, which was more of an upscale communities and I think I had thirteen communities that I covered; and I was there for several years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the famous Philadelphia Main Line, yeah.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Main Line because the railroad ran through it, they would call it that.  The biggest story that came out of my years as editor of the Main Line was when Senator Heinz [John Heinz] was killed in a plane crash; and the plane collided with another plane and dropped down onto a playground where children were playing.  Senator Heinz was killed, the pilot, there were a couple of children I think who were killed and a couple of children who were severely injured with burns because of the fuel.
Speaker 1: This is Heinz spelled?
Speaker 2: H-E-I-N-Z, Senator Heinz.
Speaker 1: Is he a member of the Heinz family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of the famous Heinz soup?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And, but yeah so he was killed in that plane crash.  And so my bureau was the closest bureau to cover, so I was able to send out every reporter that I had in the bureau to really start covering the event.  So a lot of the stories that day were written by people on my staff.  So that was the biggest story that came out; and the story--the work that we did that breaking news was a finalist for a Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize], but we lost that year.  I think it was 1990--'90 [1990] or '91 [1991] and we lost that year to--oh, the--
Speaker 1: Was that Janet Cooke?
Speaker 2: No that wasn't Janet Cooke (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not her, all right.
Speaker 2: No, no this was a breaking news story.  This we lost to the Long Island newspaper [Newsday].  Can't remember--anyway but it was a subway crash in New York [New York]; and that was the breaking news story that won the Pulitzer, but we were a finalist.  So it was--I can always say I was, had a finalist.  But it was, it was a pretty amazing day (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 660346
Speaker 1: Janet Cooke, that's '81 [1981], I'm sorry that's (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was--yeah, that was--and that was features.  She won--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Right.
Speaker 2: --she won a Pulitzer for the feature [Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing], for a feature story ['Jimmy's World'].
Speaker 1: I have to ask you about that at some point just to--what you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that sent reverberations throughout the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, throughout the industry; and how we were all viewed as black reporters and were we telling the truth and were we making it up, so you--yet something else that you had to overcome when you're selling yourself to an editor.  But you know we moved passed it fortunately, but yeah that was a big mess; and you wonder well how did she get away with it?  Because if her editors worked closely enough with her they should have known better.  But white editors at that point were still willing to accept sometimes stories that blacks brought in without vetting them as well as they should have been vetted because that should have never have gotten in the paper.
Speaker 1: So this is interesting because we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Milton Coleman--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who actually was her editor.
Speaker 2: Oh wow, okay.
Speaker 1: And he you know--he seems very much you know a real journalist that he's--
Speaker 2: Oh, he's a great journalist.
Speaker 1: --yeah; and he felt at the time people were giving him hints that they didn't think you know other black people on the staff [of The Washington Post] would say, "Hey, I don't know if she is really--," and he said, "Well you know editors got to stand behind their reporters."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's what--that was his--
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --that he stood on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He said, "She's a reporter just like you all are, and I have to stand behind her.  If she says it's true, I have to stick with her"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --"as long as I c- ," you know.
Speaker 2: As long as he could.
Speaker 1: And then he--when finally some questions are raised he couldn't answer, he says that he asked to visit--
Speaker 2: The little boy.
Speaker 1: --yeah, the little boy with her, she said, "Well they moved," you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And he said, he said, "Well let's go in the neighborhood and see if we can find them," you know; she said, "Okay we'll do it Monday," and then she didn't show up for work.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And then, you know he--
Speaker 2: It all fell apart.
Speaker 1: --yeah; then he knew--then, that's when he knew.  Said (unclear) Ben Bradlee cussed everybody out, and you know it was really a big mess.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: But that's--I mean if he had the--
Speaker 2: I'd forgotten about that.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --if he had (unclear) that, you know--
Speaker 2: I didn't realize he was directly involved in it.
Speaker 1: I--we didn't either when we interviewed him, when we got to that point was like an hour we spent talking about that.  It was really--
Speaker 2: Oh, it had to be fascinating.
Speaker 1: --it talks--well so you know, a journalist and editors' ethics have to do with the trust of his reporters--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you do have to trust your reporters and trust that they are telling you the truth.
Speaker 1: So journalists, I suppose then operate on a principle that if you make it far enough to become a journalist and--I mean a reporter in a major paper, you have imbibed the ethical code that you're suppo- you know?
Speaker 2: That you're supposed to have--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that you're supposed to have.
Speaker 2: --right.  Yeah, yeah.  You do believe that, but a major story like that you still have to really push your reporters; and if there is any question in your mind then you go back one more--let's talk about this one more time and see what we can come up with.  So, it's--that must have been very tough. I didn't realize that he went through that, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's a tough situation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He survived it, of course, but it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah and she did not, but.
Speaker 2: Well, and she shouldn't have--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) because what she did was reprehensible.
Story_ID: 660347
Speaker 1: So this leads me to another question before we go through the rest of your career.  I just wanted to ask you this as an issue, I guess a philosophical issue that black people have, especially evidenced today in young black people--they, those that do read news read a lot of news, but then they typically say that they don't believe what's in the paper (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Have you ever encountered this phenomenon?
Speaker 2: Yes they don't--yeah, a lot of times they don't believe what's in the paper, but they're--they read a lot of news, but they're not reading the newspaper.  They read it online or they'll read a blogger or they listen to a podcast, or they'll watch a documentary--
Speaker 1: On YouTube.
Speaker 2: --or they'll watch, what's that show, the Jon Stewart, 'Daily Show' ['The Daily Show'] and you know get their news that way.  So they're getting news in different ways that they form different kinds of opinions.  And so they become distrustful of the news that's presented to them for various reasons; and it's hard, but yet you still have young people who want to go into the business, thank goodness.  And s- you know you still have to convey to them that it's important that you have ethics and you need to have credibility.  So, to just start blogging about some issue that you really don't know very much about is not going to work.  You have to build your credibility, and let people know that it's a credible source that you use.  You can't just use one source for a story.  You really need to dig; and so those things you have to talk to young people about.  But yeah--but for some reason they're pretty much reading on line.  They're not as engaged with turning the pages as we were, so it's hard.  And that's part of what's going on with this business as well.
Story_ID: 660348
Speaker 1: Were you covering the Main Line when (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes I was the Main Line editor of the Main Line Neighbors section for a number of years, and I think I told you that that story was the biggest one that I did when I was editor there; and then became the--one of the assigning editors for the State of Pennsylvania and how we--in the suburbs and how we covered the news and which stories we were putting in the daily paper [The Philadelphia Inquirer].  So I'd coordinate from all the bureaus in Pennsylvania and pull the stories and edit for the daily paper.  And I did that for a number of years before moving into the main office, and I became the assistant managing editor for finance and administration.  So again I had an opportunity to really learn how the whole newsroom comes together, and how we spend the money in the newsroom.
Speaker 1: Now did you go to--we have a note in here, and kind of like out of limbo--it has no date on it, but you went to Northwestern's [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --management--is that?
Speaker 2: Advanced--advanced executive program, and I did that in 1999.
Speaker 1: Okay so this preceded you--
Speaker 2: This preceded--
Speaker 1: --going into the management (unclear)?
Speaker 2: So this was--yeah, this was my first management job when I became assistant managing editor for finance and administration; and it was really a steep learning curve--learning how expenses are done, learning how we spend money for the tools that journalists use.  One of the biggest purchases that I had in that very first year was for a satellite--to send stories by satellite back to the main paper.  So if you were in a foreign country, you could send your story or send photos; and you know this is before the (gesture)--well it was just before--just as the Internet was becoming the Internet that we know of today.  (Laughter) And I remember, oh, I had to vet it several different ways but it was like, was it fifteen thousand?  I think it was fifteen thousand dollars.  And it was like a suitcase almost, this large suitcase that you had to carry with you.  But I remember spending a lot of time exploring why it was necessary and why we should have it, why it was important for reporters to use this tool.  And so I learned a lot about all the resources--things that are behind the scenes but yet are critical to journalists being able to do their jobs the way they should be doing them, and--
Speaker 1: Was there any pushback against that kind of thing (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah the pushback is from--because you know the newsroom really is mostly expenses.  The newsroom does not earn money; the money comes through advertising and through the sale of the paper.  So, most of the money is sent for--spent for salaries in the newsroom and for the tools that you need.  So the pushback comes from the business side of the company, and well why do you need this, so you--we had to make capital budget.  That would have been a capital expense because it is you know so much money.  So there was always pushback and because I had--I was a journalist I knew how we used the things that we wanted to buy; and if I didn't know, I would go and say, okay well why do we need this latest camera--whatever it may be.  And as we moved into the digital world, I had to learn how to make the arguments for that; and how to--we had to have storage a different type of storage system--no longer filing, but an electronic system that you now file your photos on.  So everything, as a technology change and I had to learn all those things--to make the argument for expenses and how we spent the money when we would send reporters to cover sports or to cover a breaking story, when the--whatever is going on in the world.  In the beginnings of the--when we went into Afghanistan and having reporters deployed or embedded; and buying the jackets, bullet proof jackets and all those kinds of things--things that you just normally don't think about.  But, so there was always pushback and you needed to spend the money efficiently and, but also buy the best so your reporters are safe you know in doing their jobs so that was important.
Story_ID: 660349
Speaker 1: When did The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer] go digital in terms of photography, you know?
Speaker 2: Some- in the l- I think in the late '90s [1990s] they began to move into it; and gosh, I've forgotten exactly what year the paper went to color because that was also a big change.  When we start- rather than just a black and white front news- and now you can't imagine what the paper would be like if it was all black and white but it was a big change.  And it might have been like 1992 because the company built a new plant, and that's when you were able to use the color.  So I think that was around 1992 that that happened.  But that changed the way we did things, and buying all new camera equipment and all those kinds of things, so; and I had a chance to be involved in all those decisions.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So do you think The Inquirer was keeping pace with the rest of the big city newspapers at this point in terms of--?
Speaker 2: I think so, sometimes I thought we were a little bit behind.  Just in terms of making the large purchases but making--excuse me--the argument for why we needed them.  But The Inquirer was a flagship newspaper of Knight Ridder.  So there was always a lot of money up until about 1996, and I--that's when I think things started to tighten up just a little bit.  And by 2000 they were really starting to get tight, but there was money that was spent for expansion of the Neighbors bureaus, to add more pages to features sections--all those kinds of things.  Building the plant was a bit--major expense so all of that happened, but it changed the way we did business.  And there were--you know we were hiring more people still to be on the staff, but about the mid-'90s [1990s], '96 [1996], '97 [1997] you started to see things tighten up a little.
Story_ID: 660350
Speaker 1: You went from assistant to managing editor [of The Philadelphia Inquirer] in 2007, 2008--is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, well assistant--I had a couple of assistant managing editor jobs and I became a deputy managing editor; and when I was deputy managing editor my job expanded so I had most of the production side of the newsroom under my wing.  So I had photo, graphics, I had the copy desk, the news desk--all those staffs came under, is what I managed; and wor- you know making the relationships work between the reporting staff and the editing staff, the news editing staff, so.  And then became managing editor and oversaw all of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you enjoy that as much as reporting, or?
Speaker 2: I did in a different way.  I really enjoyed reporting and writing, but when I took that first assigning editing job, I als- I enjoyed that because you also got to shape the story; and because you, I had the reporting background I could talk about how you're going to report the story, and the different pieces that you need to look at.  There is a different type of satisfaction from when you are doing it yourself to helping to shape different types of stories, and learning and talking them through with the reporter or talking about what the front page should look like, or what the front page of a section should look like, or what the redesign should look like that's going to take you to the next level that readers will like.  So it, it's a different kind of thing, but I, I did enjoy it.
Story_ID: 660351
Speaker 1: In 2008 you were named the vice president of newsroom operations--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for Philadelphia Media Holdings [Philadelphia Media Network], which is The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer] (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the comp- The Inquirer and the Daily News--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so, the company.
Speaker 1: And so is this different from being--well this is bigger than managing editor I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  So I had all those duties as managing editor plus also--I also, part of my job--what I had to do was bring together the photo staffs of both newsrooms.  So I was incorporating some of the production from both newsrooms to work as one, which was not an easy task because the Daily New- Philadelphia Daily News photo staff and The Inquirer photo staff competed against each other.  So you go from competing to now it is one staff, sharing those resources, and that was part of the tightening of the company.  Also the copy desks had to work more closely together.  So my job then became working in both newsrooms.  So I had to get to know people on both staffs.  Figure out how they worked and the Daily News mission was slightly different from The Inquirer mission; and convincing people that you know this is--I'm here to make it work for both papers so we can continue to publish both papers, how can we go about doing that?  And then I would also work a little bit, not as much with the philly.com people as well and--as they're doing for the website because the content was coming from both newsrooms.  So, you still had to have some coordination to make that successful as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now this is almost--I hate to say this, it almost sounds parallel with Barack Obama's presidency [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't think so--
Speaker 1: --you know he becomes the president after this big financial collapse.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, but you become you know responsible just as The Inquirer is--
Speaker 2: Starting--
Speaker 1: --in trouble--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: --big trouble.  They file for bankruptcy in 2009.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Philadelphia Media Holdings company files for bankruptcy.  I mentioned that suit off camera, big lawsuit--I don't know how that contributed to it, but they had to payout $24 million to this guy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --in a lawsuit (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, but I think some of that they had already--
Speaker 1: Saved--put aside?
Speaker 2: --put aside just in case it turned out that way.  'Cause that lawsuit went on many years before it was finally concluded, but the problems that led to the bankruptcy had to do with the advertising dollars basically going to the Internet.  You saw it--classified ads decreased; the movie ads started going away because people look up movies in different ways as the lifestyles change.  And you know we kept trying to stay with it; and my job really because we went through several different new companies that owned this and then we had different editors who came through.  So there was a lot of up and downs.  So a lot of my job was to keep things in perspective and keep us moving forward every day because we still had to put out daily newspapers as well as content on our website every day.  So that's what I really focused a lot on; and also how we could make the transitions because we were also downsizing our staffs throughout the news- throughout the company and in the newsrooms and especially on the production side.  So how can we continue to do all this--to do the work with fewer people in the same amount of time?  So it became quite challenging, but we pushed through it.  I did retreats with the staff, talked about what we could do, how we could make it work; and we did it.

Speaker 1: Twenty ten [2010] now the, the Philadelphia Media Holdings files for bankruptcy in 2009; then a group called Philadelphia Media Network--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: --you know; and who are they anyway?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness they were all local owners.  At one point there was a hedge fund, and I've forgotten who were some of the (laughter) owners were now because they weren't there that long, or they were there a short time.  But Brian--oh gosh what's Brian's last name?  I think he was Philadelphia Holdings; and then he--the paper went to auction again and he lost--they thought they would ge- still maintain it, keep the paper.
Speaker 1: Right, Tierney.
Speaker 2: Brian Tierney, I'm sorry, thank you.  And they lost the paper in 2010 to this other company that was a hedge fund--had a hedge fund and they were there for a couple of years; and that's--in 2011 I was downsized from being a vice president of the company.  So at that point, I left, but they're now on the auction block again.  So it continues to be a problem there.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear) in 2010 I have a note here that Bill Marimow [William K. Marimow], the fellow that won the Pulitzer Prize (unclear)--
Speaker 2: He won two.
Speaker 1: --was dismissed because he refused to fire several senior writers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this is the kind of crisis--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that exists down on the ground--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the newsroom, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--and that's what was going on all the time.  So that's when you see departure of some of your senior editors, senior writers, people are looking for a more stable environment where they can just do their work and not worry about what's going to happen tomorrow.  Who is going to be my editor, who is going to be the leader?  So all of that was--it was hard times.  You didn't know some days what you were going to face when you came in.  So, it was difficult.
Speaker 1: You eventually, I mean you left in?
Speaker 2: July 2011 I was downsized--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --out of the company for--
Speaker 1: So you were actually let loose--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --cut?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was; and I was a vice president still working in both newsrooms [The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News], and doing my job and they said, "Sorry but it's time for you to go."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had--you know during the course of my career unfortunately we had a number of layoffs and had let many people go.  But it's still devastating, but I don't mark my career by that one event.  I always tell people I had a long and great career and got to do many different things; and I always feel, this little colored girl from Annapolis [Maryland] eventually became vice president of a newspaper company and who would have dreamed that.  I didn't dream it when I was a little girl, but eventually that's what happened, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, but this is, what happened to you is symptomatic of what is going on across (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was going on in the industry--exactly.  Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: --the nation; newspapers are in trouble because of the--do you think the situation has leveled off any in terms of the balance of print media versus electronic, or?
Speaker 2: It's still going on, it's still evolving.  The business itself is changing; and you know part of the discussions with young people as they're in college or coming into the business trying to break into it is how you can be more entrepreneurial and your you know yourself, your business, your freelancing, or your figuring out ways to work with other companies.  So you can still do some of this business but you have to connect in different ways--but it's definitely still going on.  Newspapers are still competing for shrinking ad dollars in some areas; and the Internet is growing in different ways and ad dollars are going there and they're not coming to newspapers and so they're still making the case.  But it's definitely--the business is evolving and no one has the answer.  Whoever has (air quotes) the answer will make a lot of money (laughter).

Speaker 1: You're currently in Tennessee and--you're in Tennessee because you got married [to Lance Weaver], right, in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I moved to Tennessee in 2011.  I was let go [from the Philadelphia Media Network] in July, and I got married in September 2011; and moved here then and decided I really did not want to go back into daily newspapers.  So I n- haven't pursued doing that at all, but I was interested--there is a black newspaper that was thriving, came out once a week, The Tennessee Tribune, so I do some freelance work for them.  I do freelance editing, looking at the design of the paper, the stories that they have. I created a video series for the newspaper it's called Take Ten on Tuesdays with The Tennessee Tribune because I like alliteration, but the idea is to extend the brand beyond Thursdays.  The paper's published on Thursdays, but on Tuesdays we put up a video and it's an interview with someone from the Nashville [Tennessee] area who may be starting a business, who's been in the area for a while but usually it's with someone who is African American to let people know what other people are doing.  And sometimes we interview people who come into Nashville who may be notable African Americans and they are connected to Nashville for some reason.  And we've now done it for just about a year and a half; it started in January 2013.  I host it sometimes, there is a young man, Jason Luntz who also will host it and we just do a video; and the idea is that it's ten minutes--taking ten minutes out of your day with The Tennessee Tribune to watch an interview with someone you may or may not know.  It's been pretty successful.  The view- the viewership has gone up steadily over the course of a year and half and we now get requests from people that say can you do a Take Ten about this issue or a Take Ten you know interviewing this person.  So it's growing and it's a little bit different--I think we're the only black newspaper in the country that does a video series like this.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay it's the first I've heard about.  So this is on the website of The Tennessee Tribune?
Speaker 2: Yes, you access it through The Tennessee Tribune's website: tntribune at--tr- tntribune.com--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's how you can access it.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 660354
Speaker 1: You also have another program that you started recently called Tea and Conversations, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Tea and Conversations I actually started when I was an editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer; and I started it in 2005.  The idea behind it then was to expand the voices of people that we have in the paper, so we're interviewing or getting photos of more African Americans and more people.  So I did it in connection with The Inquirer, and the first year I think about fifty women came out.  I sent out invitations to people that I knew and set it up so they would network with each other, and literally we had tea.  I had a tea company--a tea company, a mail tea company that I found, and they would serve tea to the women and network for a little bit and then I broke them into smaller groups to meet with editors and reporters to talk about what's going on in their lives; what's going on in their communities or churches; and to develop story ideas.  Everyone enjoyed it, the community and the staff, so I continued to do it--excuse me--through 2010.  So I did it for six years there.  The last year I did it there were 380 women who attended, and we still broke into smaller groups; and I was about to plan it in 2011 when I was let go from the staff [of Philadelphia Media Network].  So then moving here I always felt it was something that no one else was doing and would be an opportunity--maybe I could try it here.  So this year, 2014, I launched here in Nashville [Tennessee].  It's Tea and Conversations with African American Women.  It's a standalone apart from a daily newspaper, but the idea is kind of the same; but it's a, more of an experience for African American women to network with each other, start conversations over issues that maybe you can have impact in the community concerning.  So this was the first one in Nashville.  We had about fifty-five women who came, and we had--I had workshops.  So it's communication, it's workshops, it's educational, it's spiritual; and it's fun because we also wear hats, and gloves are optional.  But we had a hat contest and we talked about social media, we talked about health issues that affect black women disproportionately.  We also talked about fashion and what was trending for spring.  I had a young woman who is an up and coming singer kind of sing during part of the day; and just, it's creating a different type of experience.  Again, I think it's an experience that's not being done anywhere else.  So I started here in Nashville, I'm going to take it back Philly and also trying to take it to the West Coast, so hopefully you will hear more about Tea and Conversations with African American Women.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now there is also a like a painting by, was it--[HistoryMaker] Synthia Saint James, was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes for this event--one, when I was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I always had a poster done by one of the biographic artists on the staff and something that is, that gives you an image.  So when I did it this time, I had done an interview with Synthia Saint James who's nationally known and best known for designing the first Kwanzaa stamp and also the book jacket for 'Waiting to Exhale' [Terry McMillan]; and so in the interview, we'd finished the interview and I'm telling her a little bit about Tea and Conversations and decided I would connect with her to do the painting for me.  So I commissioned a painting that's called 'Tea and Conversations' and she captured my vision of black women in hats and drinking tea and having conversations.  So, it's a beautiful painting that I'm very happy with; and that's the image now that will always be with Tea and Conversations.
Story_ID: 660355
Speaker 1: What are your future plans?  You have, do you have a big idea that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I want to grow--I know and well, one, I want to grow Tea and Conversations and when I did this one in Nashville [Tennessee], I have a website and I'm starting--so I built the website to talk about Tea and Conversations.  Let people know what it is, have photographs.  I'm also asking women to share their tea stories with me; and what is a tea story? Tea story is, when do you drink tea in your life?  Is it to calm you down, is it when you sit down with your mother just to talk, but share your tea story.  And so I just did the first one that will go up on the website with Ndileka Mandela who is the oldest grandchild of Nelson Mandela, and she was here in Nashville for a Panafest that was coming up and I interviewed her for a Take Ten [Take Ten on Tuesdays] and I asked her to tell me a tea story.  So I have a little short video clip of that.  But that's what my goal is now, is to grow Tea and Conversations, to do a blog with it, to really reach out to a lot more African American women, to continue the Take Ten.  I'll continue to be very much involved with the National Association of Black Journalists, which we will celebrate our fortieth anniversary in 2015--I can hardly believe it.  But the organization is forty years old and it's grown from forty-four to close to four thousand people which is amazing.  So I want to continue my involvement with them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, forty-four to four thousand, yeah that is--I mean I was in Atlanta [Georgia] in a ballroom and saw a sea of members--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] spoke.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah in two thousand--
Speaker 2: Two thousand five [2005].
Speaker 1: Right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: That was the year for that, so.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Now you've also--you convened something called di- the first Divine Nine breakfast--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) NABJ members?
Speaker 2: --yes.  NABJ was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in 2011, and I'm a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. and there are a number of us who are members of sororities or fraternities and are active in these organizations as well as being active journalists.  So we got together, we--the Divine Nine and had a breakfast and also raised some money for a group in Philadelphia that we did that.  So we did that in 2011.  But I also started the Founders Reception in 2011, which we never really had a reception for our founders.  So I did it then, and was very successful.  And we've continued to do the Founders Reception every year; and this year I'm hoping that we do something to honor [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone, who was our founding president.
Story_ID: 660356
Speaker 1: So we're talking about NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] and this is the--you said we're approaching the--
Speaker 2: Twenty fourteen [2014] is the thirty-ninth anniversary; 2015 will be the fortieth.  For 2014 we'll be in Boston [Massachusetts]; and in 2015 we'll be Minneapolis [Minnesota] to celebrate that milestone, which is huge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is your journalistic philosophy?  We ask that of everyone, and so?
Speaker 2: My philosophy?  Really to seek truth and to tell stories, but my focus really--I always wanted to be able to tell the stories that are untold, what's going on in the black community; and I really feel that's important.  But seeking truth, making sure the truth is told and making sure that people know what the story is--that's it.
Story_ID: 660357
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'm concerned about health issues.  I think that that's one of the things that we still need more information about for especially black women, as I told you, health issues, heart disease, breast cancer, colon cancer--focusing on those issues especially, making sure more information is getting out.  I'm concerned about education, making sure that young people in the grade school, high school levels are being educated as well as they should be.  That mon- there is enough tax money to really educate young people.  Make sure that they are able to go to college, or if not college to get some type of education so they can support themselves.  But you know making sure that they have some skillset whether or not they go to college but they go to a vocational school, but something so they are ready to enter the work world when they come out of high school.  Those are really the big issues for me--health and education, and I focus a lot on those things.  Finances, I'm also concerned with; as I've gotten older, I'm worrying about retirement and having enough money, making sure that young people know that they need to be saving money throughout their entire lives and why and how they invest their money and being smart about that; and being able to communicate well.  You know, I always tell young people whether or not you decide to stay in this business, journalism--the communication skills that you learn are critical for the rest of your life, you'll use these skills.  Whether it's writing, whether it's speaking, getting in front of a camera, having the confidence to do that, I think all those things, so; and just surviving in this world.  The economics is tough--it's tough for young people to find jobs and to keep them because the business world keeps changing where we're going.
Story_ID: 660358
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on your career, and you look back on what you've been able to accomplish, is there anything major that you would go back and change if you could or do differently?
Speaker 2: I think--hm, I think I would pretty much do what I was able to do.  I--because I'm interested in health issues, I may have pushed a little bit more to become a health reporter or do some more reporting in that area.  Not interested in being a medical person, but writing about it and making sure that people understand what the issues are.  I'm glad I became a managing editor, but I think maybe I would have expanded so I was a little more involved in the investigative stories.  We really had more people who were editors who oversaw the investigative areas.  But otherwise I think I'm pretty happy with the way my career went--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --over the years (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 660359
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And likewise when you look back at everything, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My professional legacy is, I think, the integrity that I brought to the business, the mentorship because I always reached back and made sure that I was bringing someone along in the newsrooms; and I think that I'm a founding member of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists]--that it says to young people that you too can do this.  That you can you know have--you can be involved in this business and you can make a difference; and hopefully I've made a difference in some of the stories that we were able to produce and you know publish in the paper and bring to fruition, so.  And make sure that there were diverse voices that were in these stories, because--and that's really critical: that you're not just focusing on one group of people, you have diverse voices in every story that you do, and you're asking the questions--especially I come- keep coming back to health because we get lots of studies all the time (gesture).  We're bombarded with health stories about how this study has changed, how this study has--what this study says; and a question I always have is, so how many African Americans were part of that study group, were there any or if there were, what did--what does that segment say?  Were there Hispanics, were there Asians?  And often we don't hear, we hear, "The study says--," but who were the people who were in the study or does it make a difference whether there was any ethnic differences in the group that was studied, so.
Speaker 1: Okay so we should go a little deeper in the--yeah?
Speaker 2: Oh in the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta--
Speaker 2: In what area I wanted to go into, you mean or what?
Speaker 1: No, well you're saying that--well--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh go a little bit deeper into stories?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--that's exactly what I'm saying.  Yeah, I want the stories to be better balanced in terms of how they impact people and what people are we talking about; and often stories don't do that.  It's a question that I'll always ask.
Speaker 1: And does this like speak to the need for you know black reporters (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Speaks to the need for black reporters, black editors, black copy editors, black top editors, black managing editors at television stations; more black bloggers.  We need to be everywhere, and really telling the stories and asking the questions so you know that impact is felt.
Story_ID: 660360
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about your family.  You have how many children?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have, I, I, my--I've been married twice.  My first marriage was in 1979 to Sanford Long [ph.]; and out of that union we have two children.  A son, Sean [Sean Long] and a daughter Shari [Shari Long] who are now both adults; and my son works at Macy's [Macy's, Inc.] as a brand manager for women's shoes.  My daughter is a teacher who works with special ed [special education] children in high school in Brooklyn--they both live in Brooklyn in New York.  And I have a granddaughter [Giselle Long (ph.)]--my son is married to Asha [Asha Long (ph.)]; and I have a granddaughter who is now fifteen months old and, of course, she's a delight, she's wonderful.  Now my second marriage in 2011 is to Lance Weaver and we live here in Nashville [Tennessee]--in Gallatin, Tennessee, right outside of Nashville.  Both of us enjoy playing racquetball and traveling and reading.  He is an avid newspaper reader as well; and so I have a good life, an adjustment from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] life to the Nashville life.  It's a little bit slower but it's a very good life, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I'm still active as a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], I joined the chapter here; and I'm also a member of an organization called (Unclear) and the mission is lighting the pathway for girls and what we do, we mentor girls between the ages of eleven and seventeen.  So I have a twelve year old girl that I'm working with, and one of the things that we do together is go to the theater and see plays and talk about how she's doing in school, but really working with her.  So I'm, I have a busy life here (laughter).
Story_ID: 660361
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you about that we need to talk about or touch upon before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think we've covered (laughter) just about everything.  The only other thing I can think of is one of my hobbies is collecting; and I may have touched just a little bit on this.  One of the things that I collect are stamps, but my niche is stamps that depict African Americans so it's very narrow; and I'm a member of an organization called ESPER--that's an acronym, E-S-P-E-R, and it's Ebony Society for Philatelic Events and Reflections [sic. Ebony Society of Philatelic Events and Reflections] (laughter) and it's roughly about two hundred members, I think, nationwide.  We just celebrated our twenty-fifth anniversary about six months ago--last fall.  And the members collect all kinds of stamps and everybody has something different.  So we get together, share what we're covering.  There's all kinds of stamp shows across the country, so usually we'll have a table to do that.  But mine is very specifically African Americans and--on stamps and on covers, which are the envelopes and they tell the stories; and I think this is part of the reason I do this is because of my interest in history.  So the stamps tell a part of our history and so, but it's always been something that I do a little bit on the side and create (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now do you--
Story_ID: 660362
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you have a favorite journalist past or present that, or columnist that you read, or are impressed the most by?
Speaker 2: Wow--oh, wow I hadn't thought about that.  I think Ida B. Wells, past; and NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] has an Ida B. Wells Award.  But she was a very brave woman and writing about the lynchings, and advocating for them to end.  So I've always admired her and the work that she did.  So I think that's the person I would say; and I guess present a woman that I admire is Robin Roberts, who's a television personality. But fighting through having cancer twice and beating it twice, and being a sports reporter and she was a sports reporter before--in the early days when it was difficult for women to get sports reporting jobs; and being able to do that and then make the transition to news and being successful at that, so.  I'd say those are two of the women that I, I really admire for the work that they've done.
Story_ID: 660363
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Wow, okay (laughter).  I'd like to be remembered as someone who had integrity, who really pushed through; was successful in this business; and who was able to give back and work with young people, and bring them along in the business and you know served as a mentor.  But as an honest person, a person who had credibility; somebody who was also creative and tried to tell stories in different ways.  So, I think that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: All right.  Thank you.  Thank you--I really appreciate it (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 660364
Speaker 1: All right, this is a picture of me when I was three years old.  I don't know what the occasion was--it's one of the few pictures I have of me as a little girl, so I was age three (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me when I was eleven and graduating from Parole Elementary [Parole Elementary School; Walter S. Mills Parole Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland]; and I received an award for academic performance.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me with my mother and my two sisters.  Let's see, that is me on the left and my mother is next to me, my sister Sharon, I can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you name you know, (unclear) yeah because it's like a photo caption, so you kind of have to--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --name them from left to right?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, yeah, so--yeah, left to right.  That's me on the left; my mother is next to me, Florine Maclin [Florine Davis Maclin]; my sister, Sharon Brown [Sharon Maclin Brown (ph.)]; and my sister Kim Wyatt [Anita Maclin Wyatt].  And gosh it looks like this was taken in the '80s [1980s] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, that's just a picture of me relaxing at home; and I think that was in the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me with my son, Sean [Sean Long], and it was family weekend at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  Just, I always went down for the family weekends while he was there.  He graduated from Morehouse in 2004.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me with my very dear friend Carla [ph.]; and this was taken during my wedding shower in 1979 from my first marriage.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) This is a picture of me as a college student on the campus of the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] with Denton Hall where I lived in the background.  And my friend Patricia Wheeler was taking a photo class and I was the subject for her class that she was taking (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me, I was doing a story on makeup for the paper in Wilmington, Delaware [The News Journal]; and this is me after the makeup, and I guess--I think I had a wig on, think I had a wig he tried to do.
Speaker 2: This is me talking at a meeting of the Black Explosion staff.  I think this was our luncheon at the University of Maryland.
Speaker 1: This is a birthday picture and I turned ten years old.  First time I had a birthday party and it was in the basement of our home in Parole [Maryland], in Annapolis.  This is the other part of the birthday picture, and you can see my friends and my brothers.  Some people I'm still friendly with from Annapolis.
Speaker 2: This was--this picture is part of the--that story I was doing about makeup; and he was the makeup artist I was doing the story on in Wilmington, Delaware.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the staff of the Black Explosion newspaper, of which I was the--I was the second editor at the University of Maryland, and this was our luncheon at the end of the year.  And I am fourth person from the right.  I don't remember the names of everyone else (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my [maternal] grandmother, Maude Queen [Maude Gray Queen] in my home in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when I first moved there.  My grandmother was very instrumental in pushing me to stay in college and very faithfully sent me five dollars every week while I was a student. I remember that.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother, Florine on the left; my baby sister, Kim in the middle; and my grandmother; and this was taken outside my mother's home in Annapolis, Maryland when she was alive.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me at a piano recital and I believe I was about ten years old.
Speaker 2: This is a picture from the Black Explosion luncheon that I had; and on the right is Pat Wheeler who was the first editor of the paper; and to the left was Stan Cofield who was one of the writers at the paper.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of part of the black staff from The Philadelphia Inquirer, and this was taken in ninet- in 2005 while we were in Atlanta [Georgia] for the black journalists conference.
Speaker 2: This is me with my granddaughter, Giselle Long [ph.] and she's six months old in this picture--one of my favorite pictures with her.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me with my husband, Lance Weaver on our wedding day, September 3, 2011.
Speaker 2: This is a picture the day my daughter graduated from New York University [New York, New York].  To--on the left is my son Sean; I'm next to him, Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Long Weaver]; then my daughter Shari [Shari Long]; and my former husband Sanford [Sanford Long (ph.)].
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me with my children Shari and Sean on my fiftieth birthday.
Speaker 2: This is one of my favorite pictures.  It was taken in November 2010 and it was on Thanksgiving Day and I have my immediate family.  My son and his wife, Asha [Asha Long (ph.)]; my daughter Shari; my younger brother Jerry [Jerry Maclin]; my nieces Delisha [ph.] on the far left, former sister in law Jennifer [ph.], husband Ricky [ph.]; my sister Sharon, her daughter Sharika [ph.]; Sharon's husband Tony [Tony Brown (ph.)], is in the background; my sister Kim and her husband Cliff [Cliff Wyatt (ph.)]; my niece Ashley [ph.] and her son Nassir [ph.].  So we had a great day.
Speaker 1: This is an award, a memory from Philadelphia and it commemorates the, those of us who were in Philadelphia area who were also founders of the National Association of Black Journalists.  And so that was given to me in 2011.
Speaker 2: This is a--this is a duplicate of something that hangs in the newsroom at, of The Philadelphia Inquirer; and it was given to me when I left The Inquirer in 2011 just to sort of commemorate my work there, while I was there.
