Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five warm up questions we always ask and they on- they only require a brief answer.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I have a favorite food, it is shrimp.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I do have a favorite color, well I have two favorite colors.  Growing up my favorite color was pink and now my favorite color is probably earth tone-ish brown.

Speaker 2: I do.  The one that comes to mind most that a lot of people will have heard me say a lot is: in God we trust, and everybody else bring a fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 533547
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and then your father's [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Dorothy Vary, V-A-R-Y, that's D-O-R-O-T-H-Y, last name Vary--that is her second husband's name.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her maid- her maiden name was Dorothy Mae, M-A-E, Harrison, H-A-R-R-I-S-O-N [Dorothy Harrison Vary].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Bath, South Carolina, and her date of birth I'd have to look up.
Speaker 1: Okay what do you--can you give us a rough guess, about how old was she when you were born?
Speaker 2: My mother is now about seventy-eight years old.
Speaker 1: All right, now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Limited, my mother came to Michigan with her mother, Maggie Cole, and her mother has either lived next door to us or with us for my entire life.  And as such, we didn't visit much of my mother's family with her mother being there.  So I know my mother, my grandmother's siblings but beyond that, that's as far as it goes on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: So your great aunts and uncles you know?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: But before we get into them, just, are there any stories about what the family was doing way back when in South Carol- well are they, are they originally from South Carolina, as far as you know?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My, my mother was raised by her grandmother most of the time in South Carolina, because my grandmother--husband and her split very early in my mother's life.  And so my mother is an only child and was, and was raised by her grandmother while my grandmother spent most of her time working very, very hard.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but I guess what I'm asking are there any stories from way back in the past, any stories from slavery?  Any stories about African origin or, or the Indians [Native American], or about the Civil War or Reconstruction or any, any of those kinds of stories passed down during the family?
Speaker 2: Not, not the, no not the certainly not on my mother's side and not to, to a larger extent on my father's side either.  The one exception is we'll get to my father's grandmother--my father's mother [Mary McNeil (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay we'll (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandmother on his side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And but not much on, by the way of stories beyond that of my grandmother's generation on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: What did your grandmother's generation do for a living?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My maternal grandmother did day work, she cleaned houses traditionally for white folks up until probably the, as late as the early '90s [1990s].  And that was the work that she did all of her life.  My mother didn't work outside of the home until after my father and, and she were divorced when I was about fourteen years old.
Story_ID: 533548
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Dorothy Harrison Vary] talk about growing up and what it was like?  Did she grow up in South Carolina or Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: She spent much of her time in South Carolina, and came to Detroit p- I believe as a, as a late teenager.  But no, my mother didn't talk much about her growing up in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay so she came to Detroit when she was a late teenager, was, was--did she go to high school in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did, and later went to college at a very late age in, in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah what high school did she go to, do you, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I do not; I don't remember what high school my mother went to.
Speaker 1: Okay, college?
Speaker 2: She went to Marygrove College on the near west side of Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, now does your mother have any stories of growing up in, that she passed down at all about what it was like?  What the racial cli- climate was like in South Carolina or how, how Detroit was different or?
Speaker 2: No, no, not on my mother's side, my mother, we, we talk about it often, she was a, a rather quiet woman, and so was my [maternal] grandmother [Maggie Cole].  So most of the conversation about growing up and the stories tend to have come from my father's [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] side.
Speaker 1: Okay did you have any sense of what she thought about Detroit, you know did she, did she like it better than South Carolina or?
Speaker 2: Gee, that, that's a good question, I, I she like, like most of the, my family that migrated from the South thought it was a lot better in terms of opportunity.  And thought, in fact that the, the racial climate was gonna be a lot better than what it was.  My grandmother's siblings, a couple of them had some difficulties in South Carolina with, with some white folks and the law, and so some came to Detroit kind of in a hurry, if you will.
Speaker 1: Now can you explain, now that should be a good story now 'cause I'm sure that whatever it is, is long past and no, nobody's in jeopardy now.  But can, can you tell us what, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well my, my grandmother's brother, Uncle Rafe [ph.], was a, was an independent spirit, and he got into an altercation, both in South Carolina and in Detroit.  And subsequently ended up doing sig- significant amount of time in the penitentiary because of the, the altercation in Detroit.  And he had a similar altercation in South Carolina that had him wanting to come to, get away from the South.  He, he was not an individual to be necessarily subservient to anyone in fact he was--a white guy struck him at a place in Eastern Market in Detroit, and he ended up subsequently killing him and so he was probably a bit more aggressive.  And if you wanna use the term militant before his time and that certainly wasn't something that was necessarily tolerated in the South.  But that was who he was.
Speaker 1: Okay yeah that's pretty extreme even in Detroit you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He's (unclear)--
Speaker 1: But we don't know, know, you don't know the circumstances of, of how intense this altercation was, right so?
Speaker 2: In South Carolina?
Speaker 1: No even in Detroit if the white man hit him but that doesn't mean that that's all he did so I don't know how--.  Do, do you have a sense of what, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, well Eastern Market was a, was a place where they would sell fruit and the, the gentleman had an issue with, with Uncle Rafe looking at and, and touching the fruit and that sort of thing.  And told him to stop and an argument ensued and he subsequently struck my Uncle Rafe, and my Uncle Rafe who was, used to carry knives had it with him and ended the altercation there, unfortunately with the death of the individual.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, this would've occurred back in the what '40s [1940s] or?
Speaker 2: That that would've occurred in, no in the, the '50s [1950s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.  Now, so, so your mother was kind of disappointed in the way that black people were treated in Detroit, you know based on what they heard before they moved, is that--?
Speaker 2: No, I, I didn't get that sense from my, from my mother much at, at all again, she, she was a homemaker for most of the time that we, in my early years.  And with her grandmother and family migrating to the North in Detroit they expected it to be better.  And from, from all that I can tell from their impression growing up and later in life, they thought it was better.  Up to a point, now as we move forward there's a, an awful lot of talk about members in my family moving back to places in the South because of primarily some of the conditions that exist in Detroit.  But early on and for most of their life, I'm sure if you would've asked them as I did, they would have preferred the North of Detroit clearly over the South.
Story_ID: 533549
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Elijah, E-L-I-J-A-H, middle name Levingston, L-E-V-I-N-G-S-T-O-N, last name McNeil, M-C-N-E-I-L [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Valdosta, Georgia, and my father is approaching ninety.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, now well, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I spent a lot of time with my father's mother, Mary McNeil [ph.]; she lived to be 107 years old.  And we would make an annual pilgrimage out to New Jersey to visit her and spend time with her.  And unlike some of my other relatives she absolutely loved to talk and she would talk about stories.  She again did, did some day work in Georgia and that sort of thing.  She would talk about her husband who was killed when my father was three years of age by a train.  She had, she was a very religious woman, extremely religious, Church of God in Christ, and her faith was everything to her, above medical, above sustenance, above a lot of other things.  Sustained injuries and, and wouldn't seek medical attention and things of that nature.  So when she talks about some of the, the indignities that she had to suffer, she talks about them in somewhat of a, of a--muted terms if you will.  But she just said it was white folks being white folks to treat her, her family and her husband they way they did.  She would se- share stories, my father would share stories, I can remember one vivid story about him going to a movie theater, and they would have to sit up in the balcony in the movie theater while the whites would sit on the, on the first floor.  And even as, as such he recounted an instant where he was jumped on by four white guys and beat up in the theater.  His brother came to his aid and just for no apparent reason those kind of things.  And he'd go home and talk to his mother and the issue or the resolution tend to be well, you have to kind of suck that up and just, and just move on.  And, but, she was such a, a kind spirit that she would find it hard to talk in any really harsh terms about people treating her and her family poorly.  Although we know they did.
Story_ID: 533550
Speaker 1: What did your father [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] say about growing up in Valdosta [Georgia], did he grow up all the way in Val- Valdosta or did they move?
Speaker 2: He followed his brothers to Michigan, he, he came to Michigan to, to work in the, to, to find work principally in the automotive industry.  He did not like the South and doesn't have much favor for the South even, even today because the, the mistreatment of him and the subservient nature that he had to assume is still a fairly fresh wound in his mind.  And so he will, he doesn't even like to go to the South.  In fact, to get him to go to various places I have to go with and that sort of thing, so he's, he's not, not all that interested in spending time in the South.  Because he knows for a fact as he has shared, said folks didn't like him would have no problem and have every right to tell you that they don't like you.  And would exact any kind of either verbal abuse or in some instances physical abuse.  And he's got no desire to understand or see whether or not how much of that has changed.
Speaker 1: Okay now how old was he when he moved to Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I think my father would've been just a young adult around, I'm not sure I like to have my facts in order, but I, I, think he would probably have been at that high teens I, I, I think would've been the case.  Because he came to Detroit, lived with a brother, then had to move to live with another brother and then went into the [U.S.] Navy from Detroit.  So all that occurred after he had come to Detroit, and he worked in Detroit in the automotive industry for forty-two years, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He would've him, being a, a, late teenager is a, is probably pretty close to accurate.
Speaker 1: Okay so about 1935 or so, is he seem, yeah now from his age I guess he's born in, in 1917 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: I think?  Yeah, okay.  So, so he worked for forty-two years?
Speaker 2: Forty-two years at--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Budd Wheel [Budd Company].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The parts manufacturer over on the east side of Detroit.
Story_ID: 533551
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Dorothy Harrison Vary and Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: They, I, it's not very, it's not a really exciting story, I think they, they spent much of their courtship via church, Friendship Baptist Church and, I don't know how long the courtship was, but--
Speaker 1: Okay is that Friendship Baptist in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so they met in Detroit.  When, when you think about your parents' personalities and, and characteristics and talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's a, that's, that's clearly a no brainer: I take after my father.  When people often ask me for heroes in my life and that kind of stuff I will mention him, even though he only finished the sixth grade.  I think he's one of the most intelligent guys that I know.  His, I, I would describe him as an individual of--a structured individual.  A traditional individual one of both high moral and integrity, and it was very important for him that he raise young black men who could, as he described it, have the right kind of steel in their spine to take care of their family.  That was the issue that he wanted, and he--it didn't necessarily care what you did, but you have to be the man of your household.  You have to take care of your family, and he was structured, he was a disciplinarian, didn't laugh much.  He wasn't very affectionate, wasn't very necessarily affirming in the soft sense.  But in terms of those, those molding of, of characteristics that go into making sure that you were a man who could stand up and have the kind of character was, was how I would describe him.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was your mother's personality like?
Speaker 2: Well early on my mother was very quiet and she was but also an individual who was, very much a part of setting expectations for her kids.  She was a, a homemaker par excellence she could stretch a dollar, she could grow stuff, can stuff, she could stretch my father's salary to feed the six of us, and sometimes a neighbor family, in a very, very efficient way, so she was, she was an absolute consummate homemaker.  But very quiet, my mother was very quiet.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now when she went to college [Marygrove College, Detroit, Michigan], did, did you have any idea of her objective was, that she plan on a career or she dreamed of a career?
Speaker 2: Yes my, my mother spent a lot of her professional life in social work and she had a couple of academic pursuits.  One was in sotial--social work and the other was in, in becoming a licensed practical nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she spent time, more of her time was spent on the social services side, but her work in nursing did have some applicability in her social services work as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did she work for like a social service agency or not-for-profit?
Speaker 2: She worked for the City of Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was it in a, I mean what department did she work for?
Speaker 2: That's the department of social services for the City of Detroit [Department of Human Services].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay so she was in the city office, she wasn't out in the field necessarily?
Speaker 2: She did do some fieldwork for a short period of time, but she did, she wanted to get into management wanted to further her career.  And the educational pursuit helped that, and she did, she did, did quite well for going to college probably at the age of fifty-five, sixty years old.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay so she waited a long time to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --go.
Story_ID: 533552
Speaker 1: I describe both of my parents--when, when you want to talk about, you know headline is that we were on the east side of Detroit [Michigan].  My, I guess you call us working poor, but we didn't know that because (laughter) I would describe my, my, my time as a youth as, as very rich.  With both my parents there until I was about fourteen, fifteen years old and both of them clearly landed on the side that said there are expectations for you as a child of Elijah [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] and Dorothy [Dorothy Harrison Vary].  And they enforced and reinforced those expectations and in spite the fact that, that the expectation was that you're, you're going to go to school.  The expectation was that you were going to work.  And at a certain point in time if you got to the point where neither of those were the case, I'm sure you, you probably wouldn't be living in, in our household.  Fortunately all of our siblings fell in line, all of my siblings fell in line and did both of those, work and, and get an education.  But it was clearly--it, it was because of their I guess their ability to do that that kept all of this peripheral stuff that was going on around us in Detroit at bay.  Not to say that we didn't get into trouble, but the extent of which we could have gotten into trouble and the extent that we did get into trouble is far and few between.
Story_ID: 533553
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory.  One of the earliest childhood memories I have is well one is, is--there a couple.  The, the one memory I have is, is, is my father [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] in my elementary school [Marcy Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], and I went to an elementary school right down the street.  And my father's, interesting story about my father when he was in the [U.S. military] service, he was a, became buddies with a guy by the name of Gonzales [ph.] and he didn't speak much English.  So he taught my father Spanish and so he would not speak in English to my father and their friendship lasted for, for a number of decades.  But the, the upshot of that was that my father became proficient enough in Spanish to teach Spanish at the adult night school, following me mentioning to my Spanish teacher in elementary school, Mrs. Phillips [ph.], that did that.  And I was young, but I was, I remember that because it, it created this dichotomy about what you view education to be.  This is a guy with a sixth grade education that an awful lot to offer, that, that that example stuck with me for a long time.  He was a teacher, he wouldn't have the ter- stereotypic resume that you would think of as a teacher or, or as an educator.  And just the way he went about having to learn Spanish and his ability to, to, to, to teach Spanish was, was a, was a memory of mine.  The, the trips we would take to New Jersey, the driving trips that we would take to New Jersey are--stuck with me for a long--.  Because that was the only time we got out of Detroit [Michigan] principally was on the driving trip to, to New Jersey.  I didn't fly until I--
Speaker 1: That's to see your grandmother [Mary McNeil (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: To see my grandmother, and those were always an adventure, those, that was some of the things that molded this notion of family.  We, my mother [Dorothy Harrison Vary] would pack a, pack a, the lunch and stuff, we stop on the New Jersey or Pennsylvania Turnpike, family would have lunch.  And those were, I thought the, the best of times and I, I thought that was this, this storybook existence of what things should be like.
Story_ID: 533554
Speaker 1: Your family lived at Helen [Street] at Mack [Avenue] in Detroit [Michigan] on the east side?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did, I, I, I spent the first fifteen years of my life on Helen and Mack, my family moved from Seyburn [Street] when I was an infant.  And moved over to Helen and Mack and that's where I stayed until my parents got divorced, I spent some time with my dad [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] in Helen and Mack.  And my mother [Dorothy Harrison Vary] moved over to the west side of Detroit, off of Appoline [Street] and 6 Mile [Road].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now so that was sort of suburban in those days, right?
Speaker 2: It sure was.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me about those early days can you give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: You, you know I, I, I think about growing up in Detroit fondly, it was, first and foremost the automotive industry was clicking.  And homeownership in, in Detroit, Michigan was high because the wages that folks made in the automotive industry were really, really good.  So the sights for me, one of the clear sights for me was all of these cars.  I used to live right across the street from a guy who was, his profession was I guess was a pimp.  But I remember he had the nicest orange Cadillac with a white convertible top.  But cars were everywhere, we used to sit on the front porch and play this game called, that's my car, and you'd see a car go by and you'd pick it and argue back and forth as to which car was which.  The smells of cooking the sights of Stroh's ice cream, Vernors soda that you could get in a number of places, being able to walk to Belle Isle.  That I thought was absolutely phenomenal park where you could go, in fact, you could go and you could spend the night in Belle Isle Park [Detroit, Michigan].  It was just a nice, nice place to be, so you can smell the cooking, you can, you can see the cars.  You can hear the Motown music [Motown Records].  Growing up, used to love party, the, the basement parties, the quarter parties.  There was always a place in your little sphere of the east side there where you could go and, and party, it was a, it was a, it was a very good time.
Story_ID: 533555
Speaker 1: Now what kind of personality did you have when you were a kid, now you-- you're a, you have six brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: Four?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's four of you, and your household consisted of when you were growing up I guess up until age fourteen, I know you and your mother [Dorothy Harrison Vary].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, do you have like--
Speaker 2: Two older brothers [Randy McNeil and Von McNeil (ph.)], an older sister [Linda Jackson (ph.)], I'm the youngest of four.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did it--and you said your [maternal] grandmother [Maggie Cole] always lived next door or someplace else close by?
Speaker 2: Yes my grandmother lived two doors down, and my aunt and uncle lived three doors down, so there's a, right at Helen [Street] and Mack [Avenue] there's a duplex.  And my family lived in that one, and then the Hurds [ph.] lived in the one in the middle.  And then, then came our house, so we were, we were real close to family all of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 533556
Speaker 1: What would you describe your personality is like when you were growing up, I mean what, what did you like to do and, and--?
Speaker 2: I, I, was, I, I wouldn't of described it this way now but I was probably always living in the shadows of two older brothers [Randy McNeil and Von McNeil (ph.)] when I was growing up.  So I used to, I used to like to compete, I loved to play sports, love to play basketball a lot.  Loved to play football, I was, as I probably was looking to find my space because I had two older brothers who had carved out their space.  And for the longest period of time I'm just the little brother, so I, I probably tried to overachieve.  That resulted in for a long time in my youth I was considered to be a hothead.  I was aggressive, I would get into s- get into fights, not a, not a whole lot but I was fairly quick tempered as a, as a youngster.  And, but by and large was a combination of athletic, little bit of a hothead and loved to absolutely party as a youngster.
Story_ID: 533557
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I did, and I was--school early on came pretty easy for me.  I went to Marcy Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan] that was right down the street.
Speaker 1: So how do you spell that one?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-C-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went to Barbour Junior High School [Detroit, Michigan] and that was within walking distance about a half hour to get to Barbour Junior High School.  And part of me I, I didn't really, to some extent I didn't have a choice because I was gonna be the fourth McNeil going to all these institutions; all of my siblings went to Marcy so you're the fourth.  So if, if you did something that was out of character or if you know if your siblings excelled and you didn't, it would be brought forth.  So when you said did I like school, I did like it but when I think about, I, I didn't have much of a choice other than to, to go to school and do well, that was kind of the, the pressure that was, was one of those expectations that occurred inside of the household.  But I, but I did enjoy it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject was, was math and stats [statistics], the number side of the deal, I used to like numbers, still do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: My favorite teacher in elementary school was a lady name Ms. Phillips [ph.], I had a crush on her, she was cute and had kind of brownish hair, so I had a crush on Ms. Phillips.  (Laughter) My, I don't know if I had a favorite teacher at Barbour, at Cass [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] my favorite teacher was also the football coach, a guy by the name of Mr. Smith [ph.].
Story_ID: 533558
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, another one of those non-negotiable deals, you had to go to church and so I, I grew up in Friendship Baptist Church [Detroit, Michigan].  I, I enjoyed it there, it was a, I, I met a couple girlfriends at church, was on the usher board, sang in the choir, played on the church basketball team.  So it was a second home because you did spend a fair amount of time in church growing up in our household.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Listening to music and dancing to it, in terms of playing it, not at all (laughter) I couldn't, I couldn't play a note.  But I tell you my, my favorite group all time, still is, then and still is The Temptations.  Motown [Motown Records] then was--the reputation was, was being had when in I was growing up.  And, and the music was vibrant and was everywhere, so I love music.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you were in school, now you, you said you like sports, did, did you play sports in elementary and junior high school?  I mean did they have like a--
Speaker 2: I, I did I played in junior high school we had a basketball team and I played on the basketball team for the junior high school.  And there again followed after my brother had played, so I wasn't good as he, as he was, but I played.  Then in high school I played primarily football was the sport that I excelled in, played a little bit of basketball.  In there again I had a brother who was better in basketball and a brother who was better in football than I was at that high school.  So I was in this, there was this constant theme in my life of trying to find my own space, and then I had a really smart sister [Linda Jackson (ph.)].  So you know you had, you had athletics covered by an athletic brother in basketball, athletic brother in football, and a smart sister so.  I, I was looking for my own space.
Speaker 1: So did you play on the Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] football team?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  I was the captain of the football team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Enjoyed it, and, in my last season at Cass Tech the assistant coach was my brother, so, it was (laughter)--
Speaker 1: So you had a ri- a rich tradition?
Speaker 2: It continues, I, I followed throughout high school, everybody went to Marcy [Marcy Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], Barbour [Barbour Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan], Cass and, and Wayne [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  Although my brother spent some time at Eastern Michigan [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan] because he got a scholarship to play football there.  But we, we kind of all just lined up and followed, and I happened to be the last of four there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so what, what position did you play on, on the team?
Speaker 2: I played linebacker and guard, probably the better position was guard, linebacker is the one I enjoyed; I liked to hit people.  I did, I, I mentioned before that growing up I had a, a somewhat of a temper, I was described as a hothead.  And there were a couple of things that ended up helping to, to abate that, one was playing football it was an opportunity to take some of that aggression out in football.  The other was martial arts and that, that helped a bit, and the other was getting in trouble with the law that helped a little bit too.
Speaker 1: Tell us about both of these things now, now playing football we know about now, but you're captain of the team.  But what martial art did, did you take?
Speaker 2: It was kempo, and it was--I, I had a, a desire to wanna get involved in martial art and it, it helped a lot in terms of again channeling some of that aggressive behavior that I had.  It really did, I, I, I attributed that more so to anything than helping me kind of tone down some of the hotheaded behavior that I had.  I can still hear my brother's voice ringing, "Dean's [HistoryMaker Ronald McNeil] a hothead," and, but I attributed a lot to, to martial art.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so did you take that at a local--
Speaker 2: Yeah the kempo dojo was loc- located on Livernois [Avenue] off Fenkell [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I was involved in the club for about four years.

Speaker 1: Now how did you get in trouble with the law, this is a--
Speaker 2: You know illegally parked and had a knife in the car and so when they searched the car, they found the knife, and they got me a trip to, to jail.  And found that that's not a real nice place to hang out.  The, it was a, I was illegally parked in a manager's space.  He came out, I wasn't apologetic for being in his space, he called the police, they came out, searched the car, found the knife and there I was.
Speaker 1: So you can't have a knife in your car?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's considered a concealed weapon or something in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Back then it was, it may have be- it may have been somewhat of, as I think about it, having been an ex-police officer, they probably had no real probable cause to search my car.  But growing up in Detroit, if you want to talk about (laughter) one of the other sights on the east side of Detroit was something called the Big Four.  And the Big Four was a large black Plymouth [Chrysler Plymouth] with four white police officers, plainclothes in the car.  And their job was to create a physical presence to stem crime on the east side.  They were notorious for putting head in a window and rolling the window up to talk to you.  So if you, if you talk to people in Detroit, mention the Big Four you'll probably get a chuckle, it's a, it's not that that was funny, it's just that involuntary response of just remember the Big Four in that big black Plymouth cruising down the streets of, streets of, a Chrysler.  I don't know, I don't know if it was a, one of the biggest Chrysler, probably wasn't an Imperial [Chrysler Imperial], but it seems like it was that big.  That was, so that was, my, my, my brief brush with the law, may not have been, been all that kosher or, or legal, but it was effective.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now were the, I know Judge Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis] talks about the Errol Flynn gang [Errol Flynns] and were gangs a big factor of growing up on the east side?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, they, they were, they were a bit more sporadic on the east side, there was a, I don't attribute a lot of the violence that we had on the east side necessarily the gangs.  But just to the criminal el- there was a, there was a fairly large criminal element on the east side of Detroit.  And I wouldn't necessarily attribute it solely to, to gangs.

Speaker 1: When you were in high school on the verge of graduation what did you project as a career?
Speaker 2: I was, I was very lucky, I, I wanted to, to, to be in business, and the beauty of the high school that I went to, Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], was that I don't know maybe you describe it as a, as a charter school today with curriculums.  But when I went to high school you could actually pick a curriculum.  And I picked a curriculum of business, and so when I was getting out of Cass I knew right away that I wanted to go into, into some business pursuits, whether that be on the corporate side or, or whether that be on the entrepreneurial side, but I wanted to go into business.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you get involved in Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA] in high school or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no, my, my time in high school was, was filled between dating, football and, and, and going to school.  Not much in the way of extracurricular activity for me in high school, other than those.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how, how were your grades? Did you get decent grades?
Speaker 2: I did, I was my, my high school and junior high school grades were, were, were pretty good, something north of a three [3.0 grade point average].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now did you have any favorite teachers in high school, you said the coach--
Speaker 2: Coach.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Coach Smith [ph.] also taught in, in high school and he, he was a, I, I think his, his background as a, as a teacher also was one of the things that made him effective as a coach.  And so I was--enjoyed spending a lot of time with him.
Story_ID: 533561
Speaker 1: When you graduated, had you selected a college or did, did you know what you were gonna do next?
Speaker 2: No I didn't I, I, I thought when I graduated from high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] that I wanted to play football, so I, we had a pretty good team.  And I, we sent our tapes to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and, I'll never forget a line I got from Duffy Daugherty who was the, the coach at the Michigan State University at that time.  And he said, "I will have guys that ha- that are twice your size with twice your speed that will sit on the bench."  And if you'll remember back then that was before some parity days and some of the larger colleges and universities could essentially stockpile a lot of the, the really good players and that sort of thing.  And so most of them back then had, had views of not playing freshmen, not playing folks with talent, just bringing them on and keeping them from other folks.  And the advice that he gave me said, "If you wanna play football, you ought to go someplace and play football.  And, and go from there."  So I thought I wanted to play football, went to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] and after just shy of a season find out that I really didn't, wasn't all that interested in football.  Because I really, really wasn't interested in going to practice, didn't mind playing in the game but really didn't like going to practice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had--went, you went, went to Wayne State, now were you, could you just go to school full-time? Did you have to work too or?
Speaker 2: I, after my first year I spent, not even a full year, I spent most of my college career working, and that ended up an absolute blessing in disguise.  Be- a portion of that time I, the primary jobs I had when I was at Wayne was being a, a police officer and working for an advertising agency called Campbell Ewald [Lowe Campbell Ewald; Campbell Ewald].  What, what I didn't recognize when making that choice to work and end up going to school at night, I ended up with a different, going to school a different type of student, an older student.  Particularly majoring in business, there were a number of folks that were going to school at night that were already working in some, some business pursuit.  And you also got more adjunct professors than you got full professors who were in fact involved in business as well.  So, the--I think I got a richer and more relevant business experience by virtue of the, the technical, subject matter that was going over the same for everybody.  But when you add that to the, the combination of students, there's more students that were involved in business and older.  And more of the professors are, are adjunct professors who were in fact involved, involved in business as well.  I think I got, I got a better and more relevant experience in going to school at night.  So it ended up paying, paying off for me.
Story_ID: 533562
Speaker 1: Going back to high school for a second, but what, when your parents split up, how, how did that affect you?  You're, you were fourteen--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] is like downtown so I guess it didn't affect where you went to school at all?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: But, but how did it affect you otherwise?
Speaker 2: It was, it, again I didn't, didn't necessarily recognize it at the time, people will rarely talk about the--something beneficial coming out for a young kid in a divorce.  But, the downside was it hurt, and I was not adjusted enough to, to, to kind of figure that out so, it could've been a lot worse.  I had designs on playing them both off; I could go with Mom [Dorothy Harrison Vary] sometime and go with Dad [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] sometime.  But what happened that I call blessing in disguise was that my father wanted me to spend some time with him.  And so the quality time that occurred with my father, and just he and I because everybody else was gone, was the stuff of, of storytelling.  It was ab- it was absolutely phenomenal.  It, I don't care where you go, what you do one of the strongest things that people will talk to you about making an impression on their life is just people spending time with you.  Not that I give you money, gifts or any, it's not, it's spending time with you.  So what happened in the divorce, my spo- my father ended up spending a lot of quality time with me.  He wanted to make sure that he and I had a relationship in the split because of the, the split hurt him an awful lot as well.  So that's where I learned an awful lot about my father, and that's where he tried to in as, as condensed a matter as possible impart as many lessons to me about being a man as he could.  And I am really the benefactor of that, and I say, again, the only way he would've been able to shower that kind of individualized attention solely on me was because of the divorce.  So that's the beauty from the end of the divorce, that, that time we spent together has left an indelible that--in, in fact, I described for the last fifteen years when I've been speaking to kids, to colleges, campuses and things of that nature, I talk to them about something called choices.  And I tell them that when you're at the end of your life, if you were, had a whiteboard in front of you that had your life mapped out on it, you would see that the quality, the enjoyment and in fact even then maybe the extent of your life would be largely governed by the choices you have made.  And I s- tell them that I can put all of the choices that you're gonna have to make in your life into four buckets.  And if you get committed to making the right choices about these four buckets, and get better at making that right choice quicker, you'll be all the, all the more better off.  And, and how that relates to the time I spent with my father is, I didn't come to those choices on my own, people talk about this grandiose enlightenment that kind of stuff.  He gave me some lessons, some choice platform that I took from fourteen years old and carried it forward.  So he made that a lot easier, things that have, that I began to do throughout my life are a function of that foundation he gave me for understanding how to make choices, and it has worked for me.  So that, that time we spent together was, was truly phenomenal.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 533563
Speaker 1: At Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] now you're, you are working now almost as soon as you enrolled at Wayne State you--
Speaker 2: Went to work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, as a police officer?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And so, athletes are often like good candidates for police officer but did you ha- is this something that you envisioned in, in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] that you'd be a police officer?
Speaker 2: No, no, to become a police officer was, it was really a s- a very simple story associated with that.  At that time in the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], Detroit [Michigan] was probably 80 percent plus black, and the police department [Detroit Police Department] was 80 plus percent white.  Our young mayor, Coleman Young wanted to try attract a, in his, his terms a, an, upgraded candidate for the police force.  So they went on a campaign to recruit folks either college graduates or folks in college to become police officers.  And within a particular focus on, on trying to get young blacks.  So my best friend who he and I had gone all through high school, we had played football together.  Went to Wayne together, no he went to U of D [University of Detroit; University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan], I went to Wayne.  But we, he was my best friend; he decided to do it and said I should too, and that is as complicated as it was.  We just decided on a lark if you will to go and become police officers.  I, I rationalized though that that would be okay.  Because I said well maybe I can also turn this into a positive adjunct by going and working in the financial area for the police department.  That turned out to not be the case but I, again though I stumbled into that and I wouldn't trade that experience of being a police officer in Detroit for the world either.
Story_ID: 533564
Speaker 1: What was it like being a police officer in Detroit [Michigan]?  Now you're one of the few black officers maybe you say 20 percent of the officers were black pretty much?
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: This is with a 80 percent black population?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So how did you, how did you take to it?
Speaker 2: I, well first off I didn't know what I was doing but I, I got hooked up with a couple of older, Bill Downing and Sam Jones who were--Sam William- Bill Downing [ph.] and Sam Williams [ph.].  Two older police officers had been around for a long time who kind of took me under their wing, and they took me under their wing for the sole purposes of making sure that I would not be a cowboy.  And, so that was the, the grounding that I got that was beneficial.  The thing that was eye opening that a lot of people have little insight into, is how fractured the police department was.  I could, I've got story upon stories of things that happened when I was--when I was a police officer from, from fights between police officers in the, in the briefing room, to un-handcuffing prisoners, black prisoners because they were being mistreated by white officers.  I don't characterize that as the all of what the, but, but the eye opener for me was the level of racial tension inside the police department that I, that I had no clue walking into.  I, you know you think about this, this blue brotherhood of and, and that really (laughter), really wasn't the case.  But the other thing that it helped me get sensitive to was the, the plight of the f- person on the other side of that badge.  Because I've been into so many instances where black folks would do just about anything the police officer would ask you to do.  Whether or not you should or shouldn't, it was just kind of what you decided to do.  But then the, the flipside of that was to, to get insight into the level of compassion that black officers would have in those situations was, was, was kind of a, a real good educational exposure for me, as, as a young man.  So, and then but then the other side of it was the, the danger aspect of it was something my family didn't want--excuse me--didn't want me to be a police officer.  But I, I used to tell them I said, you know, the, the crooks have always had more firepower than the police.  But back then when I was a police officer we did have the element of a slightly more sophisticated communication system.  That was pre-beepers, pre-cell phone, pre- all of this other kind of stuff, pre--so our communication network was at least a little better than that of the criminal.  So I, I would use that to kind of defuse the notion of, why do you wanna be out there chasing crooks and putting your life in harm's way all the time?
Story_ID: 533565
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of tension in the Detroit Police Department?
Speaker 2: Back then it was, I, it was over thirty years ago for me, but there certainly was then, and I, my hats off to those guys that were able to hang in there and, to, to put up with all that stuff.  And still manage to do a balance and, and good job, for me at the same time because it was, it's tough going to work in, in those hostile conditions, it really is.
Speaker 1: And we're talking about the internal conditions--
Speaker 2: Internal conditions.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --more so than external.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  Now how did the black community react to the black officers?
Speaker 2: By and large pretty well, because I, I, I don't do my history from the six o'clock news.  And most communities are, even on the east side of Detroit [Michigan] and the precinct that I had there were a lot of law abiding citizens who had, at that time a lot of respect for police officers.  They would cooperate with you, particularly black police officers, they, they really would.
Speaker 1: But the internal, do you have any stories about some of the internal--?
Speaker 2: None come to mind other than, well one, one comes to mind.  Well I guess it's not so much a story as, as it is a, a process that says that there was a rule amongst black officers that you know if I got my prisoner handcuffed, and somebody wants to come up and do something, I (unclear) that person, "You can take the handcuffs off."  And that was just a, a way of, of checking particularly white officers from trying to do something to prisoners when they were handcuffed.  So it was, "Take the handcuffs off."
Speaker 1: Yeah, now you weren't a police officer very long, did, did you, was the, did you, how did you deal with the training?  The training probably all right, you were, you an athlete I guess so?
Speaker 2: Yeah it--
Speaker 1: It probably wasn't that big a deal.
Speaker 2: The, that, that wasn't bad, and you know the, I, I was, was in school [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] and that sort of thing, so the, the legal side of it was not.  There, there was nothing necessarily challenging about becoming a police officer for me either physically or mentally.  Didn't know quite what to expect one- once I got there, and, but I'm--I learned quickly.  And again I had some guys who were, took me under their wing as I was coming in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you named them earlier, they were--
Speaker 2: Yeah one was, was Bill Downing [ph.] and the other one was Sam Williams [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Last time I saw Sam, he was refereeing professional boxing matches.
Speaker 1: So Bill Downing and Sam Williams.  And you said there's no police association as such, black--
Speaker 2: Not, not that was active in terms of the daily issues we had to deal with, you had to deal with those on your own.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so, so you were only a, an officer for about a year and a half?
Speaker 2: No, it was close to three years.
Speaker 1: Three years, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This was from 19--let's see.
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973] to '76 [1976], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, '73 [1973] to '76 [1976].  So did, but I take it you didn't like it because you know?
Speaker 2: I, I had never planned to, to, to be a police officer, my, I was pretty much focused on wanting to want to work in, in business.  And as soon as an opportunity arose I, I, I jumped on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the, being a police officer was, because it was a good job main- mainly was that it or rather than?
Speaker 2: Well, and, and, and again I was responding to a campaign that the mayor [Coleman Young] had wanted to, to change, wanted to more integrate the police department.  So that was really the, the reason that I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when you look back on it, do you, do you, are you pretty much pleased with your three years?
Speaker 2: Absolutely I, I, think in a short period of time, I was able to function in a way that was beneficial to the community that I served.  Again I give credit that to the guys that helped me, not go out and waste time being a cowboy upfront.  And I was both compassionate enough and intelligent enough and also strong enough to, to wanna make sure that we were out there to really serve the community.  And, and the bad guys, that's another story, but the in terms of serving the community, I feel very good about that.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And learned a lot.
Story_ID: 533566
Speaker 1: Now you were a supporter of Coleman Young, I guess?
Speaker 2: Early on I sure was, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Later on I was not.
Speaker 1: Well what, what happened now, how did--
Speaker 2: I, I, I think he, I think he might've overstayed his tenure, early on I think Coleman did a lot of good for the city.  He really did, he was, was a strong leader with a long history.  He was bound and determined to make sure that Detroit [Michigan] was a, was as much an equitable place for blacks inside a lot of different doors.  So I, I, I applaud him for, for doing that.  Later on in, in his tenure, the, the process of, of alienating some of the regional aspects of the city, I thought was, was detrimental.  So it kind of almost put a, a bull's eye on the, on Detroit by some of the alienation and some of the rhetoric that, that Coleman would, was involved in.
Story_ID: 533567
Speaker 1: In 19--I guess '76 [1976] then you, you got a chance to work with Allstate [Allstate Corporation], right?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, it was a, a it's kind of six degrees of separation bef- early on I had worked for Campbell Ewald [Lowe Campbell Ewald; Campbell Ewald] and there was a guy at Campbell Ewald who had worked in human resources.  And he also had worked for Allstate, and much like what drove me to the police department [Detroit Police Department], they were looking to--.  The very first black officer in the history of Allstate Insurance Company was the regional vice president of Michigan, a guy named Joseph P. Harris, and Joseph wanted to integrate the finance department.  He, Joe I guess had a number of years at Allstate at that time, and said that, you know, "I don't understand why we never seem to be able to get a black in insurance to work with the numbers."  So he put a ticket out there, if you will, to go find someone to integrate into the controls department as it was called.  That was the financial arm of the local office.  So the guy that I knew at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] was the ex-guy at, who had worked at Allstate.  Who now, head of human resources agency or recruiting agency and he knew me and he said, "This might be something that you're interested in."  And that's how I landed at Allstate.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, at that time, had you, had, had you finished your degree at, at, Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah my, I was just completing my undergraduate in finance.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And starting my, my master's in finance at Wayne.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now what position did Joseph P. Harris hold, what, what was his title?
Speaker 2: Joseph was what we call a regional, well we changed the name but it was a regional vice president.  So he was in charge of all of the Michigan operations for Allstate Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he at that time was the highest ranking black in Allstate?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Highest, and he was the very first officer appointed at Allstate Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you came in, did, did you come directly into finance when you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause I had a note here that said that you were assistant to human resources or something at one point where, is this true or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Not, not when I first came in.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, when I, when I started, I, I went right into the financial area, and then I went on something called a management rotation development program.  So that took me into most of the major areas of insurance.  Very pivotal rotation because it gave me an opportunity to learn a lot about the various aspects of insurance.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the assistant to the vice president of corporate--human resources is just--
Speaker 2: Oh, that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) part of the rotation?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, that's another job altogether.
Speaker 1: That's another job altogether.
Speaker 2: That's another job altogether.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 533568
Speaker 1: So you attended, you, you were brought in to do finance and that's--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's something that they hadn't, they, they always say they couldn't find any black people to do, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah and unfortunately you know I was, was the first one there and I was the first black officer in finance, and probably still am the only black officer in finance at Allstate [Allstate Corporation].
Speaker 1: So there's been none behind you?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Okay that's interesting.  Now, why is it difficult to find someone to do this or, or is it, I mean even now that you'd be the only one?
Speaker 2: I think it's, it's one, one of them is the, is the industry.  When you, when you think of the insurance industry, we haven't historically enjoyed a reputation that would have brought a, a lot of blacks.  It's kind of the, the some of this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  There are some views that people have about insurance, they'll take you all the way back to the, to the debit days of, of going up and collecting the, the twenty-five and fifty cent premiums, or, or debits walking the beat.  People also sometimes will not view insurance as, as a sexy profession, if you will if I can describe it as such.  So that's, that's on the one hand, on, on the other hand, if you, you have to make a strong and concerted effort to, to want to bring people into the insurance industry and finance.  And it's not just that at Allstate, one of the things that up until the, my very last days there, I'd go to insurance industry sessions and it was not necessarily a very diverse group at the upper levels at a lot of organizations in the insurance industry.  So partly the, the candidate may have other options that they view better and the other part of it is that you got an industry that I don't think has worked nearly as hard as it should at trying to attract blacks into the business.
Story_ID: 533569
Speaker 1: What was the insurance, the state of the insurance industry nationwide when you joined Allstate [Allstate Corporation]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure the, the state of the insurance industry nationwide, I'm not sure what that means.
Speaker 1: Well what, I guess how are they different then than they are now?  I mean now, the insurance industry, what was it--
Speaker 2: You know when I, when I first started in the insurance industry, it was easier to make money for an insurance company.  And as such didn't have, didn't force insurance companies to be as innovative and creative as they should be.  I would describe the insurance industry when I first started as a, just kind of a large subsidized moving entity with regard to how you put products in the marketplace.  And how you price products and, and settle claims as well.  I also think that there was, it, because it was easy enough to make money, and you didn't have to be creative, you wouldn't have found a lot of insurance companies that would venture into certain urban areas.  If there was the hint of the notion that I might either not know how to make money, or may not make money.  Early on there wouldn't have been a lot of emphasis or effort in trying to make that happen.  So I characterize it as a, it was, it was pretty much a by and large a, a non-diverse, non-creative business entity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But profitable entity.

Speaker 1: I mean by the time that you got involved in insurance I know that black people were working for a lot of the major white insurance companies.  I think, that that wasn't true right in the early part of the century, right?  Could you--
Speaker 2: Yeah but you know but I, and see I char- what I characterize the, the real, how should I say?  When I, when I think about what's really important in the insurance business is I have something that I call the, the wheel of fortune view.  And I, and I, I wrote about this, and, and spoke about it in, in a number of different settings.  And the thing that should happen is that you should have--an enlightened insurance company should be one that first and foremost understands and has a good strategy to be, and knows what they're doing.  But they also ought to have a diverse entity and they also ought to know how to make money in diverse marketplaces.  What I characterize as some early window dressing in the industry was that we would pop- we would have a lot of blacks populating a number of insurance companies.  And when you, when you look at though, how well those companies were doing inside the marketplace, that's a different story altogether.  I give you, give you an example of one of the things that I did when I was in Pennsylvania was we would look at the ratio of people that wrote business in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to the ratio of business they wrote outside Philadelphia.  I mean it's, it's a pretty simple, simple equation, and you would oftentimes find that there are a, a lot of very successful companies that just would, weren't writing a lot of business in urban areas at all.  And that was at a time when there was a, a fair amount of lip service to diversity and, and things of that nature.  And so I, I, the real issue for me would be not what you say or, or, or who you trot out in a, in a construct of, of who is employed, but where and how are you doing business?  Because if you believe that insurance is an important entity in making the economy go, right, businesses need insurance.  People need insurance, it helps fuel housing markets, small business, things of that nature.  If you believe that, as I do, then it's very important that you--that you make sure that insurance is widespread and diverse.  And that, that's, that's my only yardstick, is are you doing business?  And if you are as good as you say you are, you ought to be able to find a way to make money.  We, we started something I was fortunate that with a small group of other folks to start something called the Neighborhood Partnership [Neighborhood Partnership Program] in Philadelphia.  For us to address, address that very thing at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] was, we partnered with some of the local neighborhood communities.  And we talked to them about here's what, what we face and here's why when people say they don't make money, or here is why we don't make money, here's what we're up against.  And they said now let's talk about what you're up against.  And so together we formed both products and pricing mechanisms and discounts and that--excuse me and that sort of thing to write more business in Philadelphia.  And I was, was happy that we moved from probably about a 7 percent penetration in that marketplace to about 33 percent in that marketplace, and was very profitable.  So that's--was just a matter of having--.  I don't want to make it sound like you know, I'm this great and wonderful.  Because it's, it's not rocket science to understand if you, if you are, grew up in some of those community, you know that there are, in fact law abiding prosperous individuals that want the very same things that any of those communities want.  And all you have to do is not look at some of those initial detractors to those communities that cause businesses to not do business there.  And f- and get to the root of it.  And, that, that's, so that's my, my, my benchmark in terms of what the insurance industry, how the insurance industry should be measured.
Story_ID: 533571
Speaker 1: Did the Civil Rights Movement affect the regulation of insurance industries?  I mean insurance companies in terms of how they, they were supposed to or mandated to do business in the urban community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, certainly because--there's a, you know the infamous connectivity of, of the redlining aspect of insurance is born out of both you know an understanding of what happens in the banking and finance and insurance industry.  And, there were regulations that were promulgated to make the, the, the unfair discriminatory restrictions and pricing procedures illegal from an insurance construct.  It's, it's tricky in insurance because when you, if you, dis- insurance does discriminate.  The, the purist I'm a--from a statistical standpoint discrimination is, is, is, is a surrogate for variance.  It says that okay, if you say one entity has a lost cost of X and another entity has a lost cost of Y, to discriminate the price you charge for X and Y is a legitimate construct to have.  What becomes I, I think tricky in some settings is about how you view the differences, the real differences and lost cost between those two.  So, there is protection against redlining, but there, there isn't a mandate to necessarily be creative and innovative to go fine.  It says that once present, there's certain things you can't do.  There aren't as many in, in many instances there aren't any that says okay you have to do certain business in certain areas.  And again I say in an industry that is, that employs the level of intellect with all of the folks from an intellectual capacity in the insurance industry, there isn't any market--.  I shouldn't, I, I used to describe the insurance market that says that just about any insurance company that wants to can probably serve 99 percent of the marketplace out there, 98, 99 percent of the marketplace out there, there's a, there's a, there's a fringe element in the marketplace that you aren't going to be able to serve.  But the right kind of creativity you can do that.

Speaker 1: Allstate [Allstate Corporation] in those days was a part of Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know who were the, who were the competitors with, I, I know in old days Sears was competing with Kmart [Kmart Corporation] and who was come meet, competing with Allstate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, back when I started over thirty years ago the, the primary competitors that you--State Farm was certainly one of the c- the, the, the big competitor.  And, and back then State Farm and Allstate used to be a lot, lot closer together.  And you had the, the Nationwide [Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company] and the Travelers [The Travelers Indemnity Company], some of the other entities came in later, the Progressives [Progressive Corporation] and the, the GEICOs [Government Employees Insurance Company] weren't nearly the size they are now.  But principally, State Farm, Farmers [Farmers Insurance Group], Nationwide, some of the farm bureaus were the competitors out there.  And the, the--we were wholly owned by Sears and that gave you some additional both financial cushion in the business.  But it was I guess it was what it is I, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay I mean was it you, you think it was better than when it was under Sears or?
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: Better later?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.  Sears--there's one, and there's an element of, of working for, being owned by Sears was having access to that capital base and their customers, very valuable.  Anybody would, would love to have the access to that, that customer base that that Sears had.  So you'd put them both in the underneath the elevator and people would flock by and just write business.  So that was, that was a marriage that was very profitable for a very long period of time.  What, what became clear though, and this was through the folks at Sears decided to split, spinoff, not Allstate.  But, the ability, there was a lot of shareholder value that was generated in that, in that spinoff.  The spinoff worked very well for Allstate in that it gave an opportunity to compete as a standalone insurance carrier, as opposed to someone attached to a retailer.
Story_ID: 533573
Speaker 1: So when you started at, at s- at, at Allstate [Allstate Corporation], was, was Joseph Harris [Joseph P. Harris] like a mentor to you when you first started?
Speaker 2: He sure was, Joe would spend time talking to me, I, I was, I was very fortunate because the three of the earliest officers, in fact the number one and number two, because the second officer promoted in Allstate was a guy by the name of Ike Thomas.  And Ike came to visit me in Michigan and it was, it's just a wonderful gesture he had.  He had heard that there was this brother who was just hired to, to work in the numbers side of the business.  And he took it on his own to come and make sure that he knew that he was there to support me.  And would be watching me to make sure that I was doing okay, and would also if I ever needed anything or needed somebody to talk to, he did.  So Joe and Ike early on were very much mentors to me at Allstate.
Story_ID: 533574
Speaker 1: I was asked to ask you about the Million Dollar Round Table.  And now these are people in sales, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were, were there any, any blacks in the Million Dollar Round Table at all that you know of?
Speaker 2: Let me think about that, in my early days at Allstate [Allstate Corporation], I, I don't remember any of our, the Michigan guys, there may have been, I don't, I don't know, but I can't off--.  The, the Million Dollar Round Table is for selling life insurance.  And for the longest time, Allstate was a property and casualty and, and, in, in fact still is today.  About 90 percent of the business comes from property and casualty business--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as opposed to life, so it wasn't as heavy on--emphasis early on.
Speaker 1: So, so property: home and auto--
Speaker 2: Home and auto--
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Rather than--
Speaker 2: Recreational vehicles--
Speaker 1: Rather than life, yeah--
Speaker 2: Life insurance, life insurance is a larger piece, but it's still only about 11 percent of our business.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay you're in good hands with Allstate, I remember the (laughter) the hands--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah that's a 90, 90 plus percent unaided recognition of you cup your hands together--
Speaker 1: Right, let people know what it--
Speaker 2: People know--
Speaker 1: Yeah they know exactly--
Speaker 2: --that's what you're talking about, that's a, that's a heck of a brand, it is, it is a heck of a brand.
Speaker 1: That's right.  So what was those early days like? Were there any other black ex- young executives around when you started there?  Or what percentage would, would you guess it would be young black executives?
Speaker 2: There, I'd hazard to guess what percentage, but one of the nice things about the Allstate that I grew up in early was that there were people that would take charge of making sure that the blacks that worked for the company had an opportunity to network.  And that was through blacks like a lady named Terry Mabry [ph.] who--later Terry Codd [ph.], and Ike Thomas and, and the like they would, would make the networking capability amongst the blacks that worked in the company easier.  And, and when I say easier, there were, I can remember when, in Michigan going to parties that were given by folks that worked, black folks that worked in the headquarters of--home office to give folks an opportunity to get together.  So it was it, it, it was, it, it was a, a mission to make, make that happen.  So the percentages weren't high, but the, the caliber and the commitment of the folks was extremely high of, of the, the black folks.  I, because I--you know one of the things having just retired, is I'm struck I got a, you know a series of books of congratulatory comments and stuff from folks.  And the things that people remember that they force you to remember has me reminiscing about just how supportive people were.  And the blacks were in my success, not, not just blacks, but, but blacks in my success, the notion that people would be out to see you not be a success for you to (unclear) wasn't, was, was really not an issue for me at all.  And I attributed that to a lot of those folks who spent the time to make sure that network was alive and, and kicking.
Story_ID: 533575
Speaker 1: Yeah you were just discussing how--you were telling us how important it was to--for the black people at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] to be networked and to--how useful that was for you.  But were, were there people who didn't really want, want that kind of you know shied away from being associated with other black people?  And, and how do you see that as a strategy, a success strategy?
Speaker 2: You know I can say that there weren't many that say well you know I, I really don't want to be associated with a black networking entity or being seen a lot because of I may be viewed as, as not potentially valuable or something you know in, in the larger--.  But you know one of the things I can--because I, I won't mention the guy's name but I can, I can think of one guy that he was in fact tolerated by the black folks.  Even though he clearly had a strategy that says I'm going to try to really just ingratiate myself with whites to, to the detriment of, of, of blacks.  And he, he gained a certain level of success, but, he, he was, I think he was bound to fail.  And, and so on one hand I applaud the, the blacks for not absolutely killing him you know metaphorically.  But on the other hand the real reason why he can't be ultimately too successful is that when you think about what, what brings value to an organization is your ability if you wanna rise, your ability to lead.  And if you create these false constructs of leadership such that I gotta put somebody else down to show my value as a leadership over here, at some point in time the folly of that will come to light, it, it is, it's fairly ridiculous and it is the antithesis to, to diversity just happened to be perpetrated by you know in, in that instances a black person.  So, so it's absolute folly that, that someone could, could rise through an organization--well I should rise through Allstate or any enlightened organization for that to happen.  And, and the other side of it is for a long time organizations wanted blacks in their organization to be more of a view and a visible and a relationship entity for other blacks.  So it's kind of like why do I need you if you're gonna come in here and out--white white folks when that doesn't do any good with the white folks and it also doesn't do me any with the black folks either.  So I say it's folly, it's, it's a, it's a kind of old construct, and, and maybe there're some people that will, will end up getting some benefits from that.  But I, I, I say they will, they will be short lived.  And you, you know if you flip that, I am a, an individual that, that also believes that--at the end of the day, I've seen people who have left out my organization that have done things, that would compromise them and it makes for one miserable existence once you get to a point where you understa- understood what you compromised.  May not occur right away, but I got to tell you, if you can't look yourself in the mirror when you're shaving at retirement and feel like you were honorable, that's a, that's a heck of a burden to carry around.  So, I say it'll probably occur earlier in enlightened businesses 'cause it's a, it's a strategy that's fraught with folly.  But if you happen to matriculate through a system and, and then there, I say it'll catch up with you when you, when you do grow up.
Story_ID: 533576
Speaker 1: Now you were trained in finance, and I'm sure you learned some, some additional things about finance as you were matriculating through the company.  But what, what cultural things did you have to learn from the, the majority white colleagues to be able to make it?  I mean what did you, you, you have to adjust in your behavior or change or, or embrace to be able to be successful?
Speaker 2: You know, I--the, the nice thing about finance, early in my career I was probably not as, as outgoing, wasn't as quick to, to establish relationships you know with the broader folks in the organization.  That, that was probably okay in finance because finance is populated with a number of people who get so focused into numbers and that sort of thing.  And don't see the forest for the trees and, and that.  So early on the fact that I was so focused on the numbers was in fact a benefit for me.  The--once though you venture outside the, some of the departments that would allow you to have more of an individualistic approach, or it's both the departments you've got outside of, and the level you get to at a certain of leadership.  There is a, a, an adaptation of forming relationships that becomes important that you, you, you need to adjust to.  The, at one point in time it was extremely difficult to establish relationships because they were held by folks in the majority culture and weren't necessarily interested in having you participate in those relationships.  That quite honestly still exists today, but there is a way I do think though to, to establish yourself as a person who can establish relationships without necessarily having to give up on too much of, or all who you are.  I was--have often said that--you know and this goes back, we talked about one of those things my father [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] when he, he gave me a saying one time.  He said, "Would you let anybody set your watch?"  And it sounds like it's really a dumb thing, but if you, if I've gotta be somewhere at eight o'clock would I give my watch to you and say, "Set my watch to whatever time it is now."  And his, his the, the message was that you need to do things on your own terms.  And for me, that is a lesson that, that resonates so loudly with me that once even before I got to Allstate [Allstate Corporation] I was bound and determined to set my own watch, or my set my own terms.  Now that, that was--that was helpful, and it also hurt me in, in aspects, if you, if you choose to categorize it that way because there's some of the aspects of setting my own watch and setting my own standards, or what I would deem to be successful, or how I would deem to be significant that might not have been what was most appreciated by others in, in power.  But it was my determination to do it that way and at least you knowing going in that there may be consequences for setting your own watch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Makes it easier on the other side though.
Story_ID: 533577
Speaker 1: Did you consult with your dad [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] you know often--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --in, in your career [at the Allstate Corporation]?
Speaker 2: I did.  You know and he, he doesn't necessarily know what I do I mean because it's, it's kind of--there's certain aspects of business that you know you just, he just knows that, that he has a son who was, was doing well.  But we would sit on his couch, I'd go to Detroit [Michigan] and sit on his couch and talk about stuff.  He'd wanna know how I'm doing and what I'm doing and we talk about his life, my life, we'd recount some stuff.  The, the help that that I would get in sitting there was, he'd wanna talk about who I was as a man and what was important to me.  So we'd invariably end up talking about my family, my wife [Regina Clark McNeil] and you know when you talk about there's a, an aspect that I'd have to spend time talking about is, is my wife.  But my dad would wanna talk about me as a man, we'd have tho- we continue to have those s- you know what is important to you?  Where's the steel in your spine, we continue to have those, I call them those Helen Street man conversations all throughout my career.  And they just help you to think about stuff, and I would always leave those conver- conversations and ju- .  And, and then also when he would share with me about some of the frailties that was a whole new entity because I'd never experience him talking about, I never envisioned him any, anything other than this strong guy, worked in the plants for forty-two years and that kind of stuff.  But when he would begin to share some of the things that were frailties to him, he was again giving me more of those lessons.  And I'm a, boy I'm a sponge, if, if you wanna spend the time to earnestly share some things with me that may help me, I'll soak those all up.  So those were, those were some really beneficial times.
Speaker 1: And so that that time spent is well spent then?
Speaker 2: Still is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Still is.
Story_ID: 533578
Speaker 1: Can you kind of walk us through your career at Allstate [Allstate Corporation], and, and kind of you know, well just you know I guess and, and tell us what, what you learned at each stage?
Speaker 2: Well, you know started in the finance function and was lucky to start with the first black officer there [Joseph P. Harris].  Starting in finance was, was, it was a godsend because I learned so much about the whole business, it's not like you can learn a lot about sales.  You can learn about claims or underwriting or actuary; you learn a lot about the, the whole business.  So I quickly got to a place where I was--both recognized that and was told that, that you know you're gonna get a look at the business from a, from a unique perspective and take advantage of that, and I did.  Because I'd have to tell you that I, I mentioned at an early age in the learnings that I had had and the time I spent with my dad [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.].  And, and, and my, my mom [Dorothy Harrison Vary] as well, there was this platform of choices, and the first choice, and I said there were four, the first choice is choose to learn because the best title you can ever have as a student because when you think about it, you're paid to learn.  And that's your title.  And when you think about it, the, the most underutilized muscle you're gonna have, when you're born you got far more brain capacity and when you die you still have untapped, unused brain capacity.  So, choosing to learn both spiritually and cognitively if you make that affirmative choice that's the deal, that's huge.  So going into Allstate in the finance department, I was poised that I was gonna learn as much about it.  And again I can go back to lessons that my father would teach me, y- my father put in his own driveway changed the furnace, rebuilt half the house.  He did all those things by just watching people and asking questions.  Now at the time that wasn't something that was so this huge revelation to me until he kind of put into perspective to me.  He said you know, "Son, I only had a six grade education, but I think if I can sit down and watch you, and I can ask you certain questions, I can do just about anything," and, and he did.  Rebuild engines, put--he, he did all that and other kind of stuff, didn't have the money to do some of the other alternatives, but he, he did again with this six grade education.  Could learn all this stuff that, hell, I can't do today.  So as I got to Allstate it was clear that I figure I could, I could just about learn anything that was out there.  I mean because those were the, the kind of expectations that he had put on me, so being a student of the business.  So I learned a lot in that that that first job.
Story_ID: 533579
Speaker 1: Then the s- then the, the, the--my second job at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] was again was an important one, not necessarily because of the job, but because it caused me to move to Chicago [Illinois].  I had never left the City of Detroit [Michigan].  Although Detr- growing up in Detroit was one of the best things going given I was used to seeing black people with cars, houses, resources, in power and those kinds of things, of some of that was beginning to wane.  And with me then accepting a job to move into home office gave me an opportunity to see--
Speaker 2: So well give us a chron- a chronology like when is this--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  In--
Speaker 2: --that you actually moved to Chicago, yeah.
Speaker 1: I moved to Chicago in 1978.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I again worked in the finance area in 1978 in home office.  What I learned there was more about the, the finance culture and a lot more about the business.  Because now, as opposed to just understanding the finances from the Michigan perspective, I was understanding the pers- financials from the entire organization.
Speaker 2: So, so what was the title in '78 [1978] that you had?
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978] I was, what was my title?  Financial analyst I guess it, you know, there were two of them, but financial analyst, budget and financial and exec info analyst.  So it was financial analyst in home office.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then after--I, I worked there for a while, then I moved to New Jersey and became the assistant comptroller for the eastern part of the country.
Speaker 2: Now what year is this?
Speaker 1: That was in '79 [1979].  (Pause) Then I moved from being the, the eastern regional assistant comptroller to being the comptroller of New Jersey in 1983.  (Pause) And then I moved to become the comptroller in Florida in 1986.  Then I moved back to home office and had a series of jobs: I was an auto comptroller, I was a field administrative comptroller, I was administrative director, I was assistant vice president of human resources, and then I became an assistant vice president in finance.
Speaker 2: Now, now this is, now when do you move back to Detroit?  T- in, in '86 [1986] you're in Florida, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, then I moved back to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay, then Chicago in what year?
Speaker 1: Let's see when did I move back?  Oh no, no, no, no, I went to, went to Florida in '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Right Florida in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: And moved back to Chicago in '87 [1987], I was only there to open the region, so it was a short period of time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then from '87 [1987] to n- to '91 [1991] I had all of those jobs I talked about; they were a series of jobs.
Speaker 2: And then they were in, in Chicago?
Speaker 1: In Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had five director jobs and two assistant vice president jobs.  And then in 1991 I became the regional vice president of the Valley Forge area, and that was at that time the largest region for Allstate.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Valley Forge region, so that's Pennsylvania, West Virginia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware.
Speaker 2: Delaware, okay.
Story_ID: 533580
Speaker 1: Now you got married in 1983?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And now can you tell us what, how you met your wife and?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I have known my wife longer and more intently than any other woman other than my mother [Dorothy Harrison Vary], sister [Linda Jackson (ph.)], grandmother and aunt.  I met my wife in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] in 1967, late '67 [1967].  I fell in love with her, dated, I wa- she was an upperclassman if you will, I asked her to go to her prom.  She was so enamored that this youngster asked her to go to her prom, but I was the captain on the football team.  She was a statistician working for the coach and she was a, a pep club and class vice president.  So I went to her prom, she went to my prom.  We dated until she went away to school, and I stayed in Michigan and we probably split off in mid-'70s [1970s], and then I got married.  The interesting story about that, you know how you used to go to, go to weddings in an old Baptist church and they'd put a flower arrangement on the pew and it says pause there?  That's where the pictures are going to be taken as you're coming down the aisle?  Well the place where they put the pew and all those pictures were taken, my present wife, Regina [Regina Clark McNeil], was sitting in that seat.  So she was in all of the pictures in my, from my first wedding.  So people said that was probably an omen.  I had, I, I, I would have married her the first time around, but it was, it's--certainly wasn't our time.  But I got divor- I got married in '79 [1979] and got divorced in '82 [1982].  And went hunting for Regina, and got married in '83 [1983] and it has been nothing but goodness.  You know one of the other, one of the other choice- as you, as I talk about choices, choose to learn, and the second choice is choose to contribute in terms of adding some value, making things better.  One of the things that's important and both is that, is that you don't grow in isolation.  And when you have a partner who loves you as much as my partner does, and who is as talented as she is, and who has invested in me, it really is as good as it gets.  Because throughout my, my career at Allstate [Allstate Corporation], she has helped me in a number of different ways, on the business side she can help me, she's a smart girl.  She's got a master's in math and a Ph.D. in statistics.  She's also a great writer.  She's also a great thinker, and so we have had an incredible teamwork that I say as much of the success that I would credit to all of the stuff I would do, I credit her as well for, for helping me to be who, who I ultimately turned out to be because she's been around my life that long.
Story_ID: 533581
Speaker 1: So in '91 [1991] you're regional vice president of Allstate [Allstate Corporation], Valley Forge?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you, what did you do?  You, you were responsible for all the insurance operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was a good time because my fondest memories of Valley Forge was one, turning the place around because prior to getting there, they had lost $20 million a year.  And I got us to making money, the second was that, where we launched a neighborhood partnership program that said that we're gonna find a way to go inside urban areas and make the product valuable and beneficial to both sides.  And that was something called the Neighborhood Partnership Program.  That was launched, and it really was a place that gave me an opportunity to really spread my leadership wings.  Because you were really the CEO of that particular marketplace, everybody else was eight, nine hundred miles away.  And it was your operation to run and it was a very large operation.  And watching things you need to do to get people engaged, both their head and their heart to make money, to wanna do this, to grow; it was, it, it was a wonderful time.  So, so wonderful that my wife [Regina Clark McNeil] and I would take walks and we'd say, "You know at some point in time they're gonna call you and ask you to go back to home office."  And I don't wanna go because I'm having too much fun out here.  And we had decided--because I had turned down two moves before.  That was, used to be the kiss of death was that you can't turn down a move, who are you?  That was the, you, you know when I early on in Allstate career as you can tell I moved around.  And it was, it was just part of the, the, the, the course for you to move around.  I turned down two moves.  I turned down a move to Jackson, Mississippi because probably influenced by my father [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.], I wanted to go--I did not want to anywhere near Mississippi.  So and with the help of one of my early mentors, she softened the blow because there were some people upset that I didn't want to go to Jackson, Mississippi.  And my girl, Rita Wilson helped make sure that was okay in the minds of folks that you know, don't, you know don't be trying to put a bullet in this guy's head, because he doesn't want to move to Jackson, Mississippi.  And the other place was Texas, I didn't want to go to Texas either, and I, I was able to turn that, turn that move down and survive, so.  But Valley Forge was a, was a, was just a wonderful time.
Speaker 1: So did you stay in Valley Forge from, from '91 [1991] to, to '94 [1994] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ni- ninety-four [1994], yes.

Speaker 1: Oh tell us about the Neighborhood Partnership project.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, what, what we did in the Neighborhood Partnership Program, and it was myself and the, probably more people than, than, than I would name.  But wha- the, the goal was that we are not able to have the kind of flexibility in the Philadel- Pennsylvania and Phi- marketplace that we wanted to.  And one of the reasons was that the regulating community said, yeah, you know they didn't trust the insurance industry.  She said, "You guys don't--most of, most of the companies don't play fair, you wanna do your business out there in the burbs, but none of you wanna come and do business in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]," and that sort of thing.  And so we designed a process as the name describes to put a partnership together with my leadership team and the Fern Rock-Ogontz-Belfield community organization [Fern Rock-Ogontz-Belfield Community Development Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And over a period of a year we got--not, not even a year, I, I, probably have to look at the dates.  But over a period of time we got to un- an understanding of having them understanding we wanted to do, and understanding what they wanted to do as well.  And said, how can we partner to make this work to make it non-ad- adversarial and, and that sort of thing.  So we, we designed--the, the highlight of the, the deal was, we designed some products, there was a dividend component of the products that was based on the ability for losses to be mitigated and that kind of stuff.  So they had skin in the game to help make the, the environment insurance friendly, if you will so they were getting something out of that, they were getting insurance, and we were get out of what we needed as well, we want customers.  So I, I've got some brochures and some of the newspaper articles associated with that, that I can leave you with.  But the, the long and short of it was that we were just committed to finding a way to have a conversation.  Understand the needs of each other and use that commitment and the innovation to make it happen.  And the, and then the proof in the pudding was that we ended up owning about 33 percent of that marketplace and making money.  And they were happy, and, and if I fast forward, one of the young, the son of the director of the Fern Rock-Ogontz-Belfield neighbors is now a lawyer for Allstate [Allstate Corporation].  People inside the community work in claim department.  So you, you know it's the, it's this this, this, this feeding that, that, that went on that was just the outcome of us getting together with the folks in the community.  Not being afraid to go in a black community and say, you know, to listen to people.  Because you, you know you can, you can imagine being an insurance person going into a black community.  And a lot of instances and (unclear) now you say way, "Well I don't see any insurance companies around here, you guys don't wanna do business here.  You know when you do wanna do business here, you wanna charge me so much I can't afford it, you know.  So you know help me understand why, why, why I should trust you?"  So we had to build trust, we had to build a relationship.  Once we built a relationship, we both profited from that relationship, and it was an awful lot of fun.  And at the end of the day, I made some friends as well.
Speaker 1: Was your initiative the first time a company like Allstate had gone into--
Speaker 2: Absolutely it was the first time, and, and what I did was I, because having worked in home office and moved around, people knew me as a, as a, as a f- as a field general.  I asked the company to participate with us and give us a million dollars to invest in that community as well.  My, that was something totally different, I said, I'm gonna make money on the insurance operation.  But I do wanna do something inside of, of the empowerment zone activity that's going on that the governor [Robert P. Casey] and the, and the, the mayor were engaged in.  So because of the way that--because of the fact that, you know I got involved in the, the, the, the committee work early on, we were able to give some very lucrative tax credits associated with that.  So, at the end of the day the outlay of that million dollars is about seventeen cent on a dollar, so and the kind of returns that it got--.  You, you know when you, one, one of the returns there used to be an organization called ACORN [Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now] that was going after insurance companies and that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: That's right, they're still doing it (laughter).
Speaker 2: When ACORN went after Allstate you know who called the insurance department said, "This is not the Allstate I know."  It wasn't the Allstate folks, it was the Fern Rock-Ogontz-Belfield community center.  "Hey wait a minute, let me tell you what these folks are doing out here with the partnership."  So, the, the b- it was just the benefits began to, to, to, to kind of octopus all over the place.
Speaker 1: Can, can you spell them again the Fern, what is it?
Speaker 2: Fern, F-E-R-N--

Speaker 1: We're at a key juncture now, 1994 you're elected to senior, the senior management team as a senior vice president of corporate relations, is that true, is that, is that accurate?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, corporate relations.  The--I was one of the few people, I'm not sure how many people did this, but I went, I was never a vice president for Allstate Insurance Company [Allstate Corporation]; I was assistant vice president, and went from assistant vice president to senior vice president.  And that was, again the, the choice to move around and get exposure to various people, one of those individuals  that I had gotten a lot of exposure to was both the chairman and one of the chairman's most respected leaders.  And the opportunity came when the present senior vice president of corporate relations left to go to Ameritech [Ameritech Corporation; AT&T Teleholdings, Inc.], and she told the chairman that--.  Again based on, because when you think about what corporate relations does, the media, all that other kind of stuff so forth and so on, they got a glimpse of what I would look like doing that because of the work we did in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Because I was all over the media there and on news and talk shows and that kind of stuff.  But then the other side of that was that the--when we were getting ready to, to go public in the business experience that I had would also bring kind of a different flavor to that role that has traditionally been held by people who had journalist backgrounds or things of that nature, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Now, now, you, you're a friend of Rita Wilson--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who was there?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now, now she was the highest ranking black in, in Allstate before--
Speaker 2: Before me.
Speaker 1: --you?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She was the v- was the first senior vice president as a black and board of director for Allstate Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you recruited for this job, I know that from what I have here that there was a man named Jerry Choate [Jerry D. Choate]--
Speaker 2: Choate.
Speaker 1: Choate.
Speaker 2: Choate, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, C-H-O-A-T--
Speaker 2: C-H-O-A-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was, he when, when he left then Rita left shortly thereafter then?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  Jerry was the chairman, and Rita left first going over to Ameritech.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that created the opening for the job she had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Jerry called me and offered me that job.  But then she subsequently came back to Allstate, and left shortly after he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so Jerry Choate recruited you actually for the job?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And now th- he wasn't there, well, did Ed Liddy take his place shortly thereafter?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ed took his place about two and a-half, three years later.
Speaker 1: Okay so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Ed came over from Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] when we were divesting from Sears and going public, and then was groomed as the potential candidate for chairman, and did ultimately become chairman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were, were you, would you, would you consider Jerry Choate a mentor at that point or, or somebody who--
Speaker 2: I call him a supporter very much so, and so yeah I'd call Jerry an ardent supporter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So now, okay so you held this job for two years, this particular position.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, but you the big thing is that you become part of the senior management team, right?
Speaker 2: Correct it's the, it's the--our senior management team is what, akin to be the board of directors at other, other organizations.  And so that's the, the top seven to twelve people in the company, so that was, that was huge.  And, and I, I take you back to the comment I said when my wife [Regina Clark McNeil] and I used to take walks in Pennsylvania and say, "We're not moving back to home office?"  I did not expect (laughter) that that call to come in home office would be to come in on the senior management team.  So that was a, that was a, an opportunity that I certainly wasn't gonna turn down.
Story_ID: 533585
Speaker 1: So you're one of the top seven people at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] at this point, in 1994?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And in 1994 it would've been top ten.
Speaker 1: Top ten, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then it got down to, the last part it was top five.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well just kind of walk us through again what, what happens next here in, in--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was corporate relations for a couple of years, and then I went on this path of, of what I call first, or starting things at Allstate.  We, we started the property [property insurance] company, and we started the property company because we had been losing a lot of money in the property organization, wanna figure out how to do that better.  Or--so I put together a team and all the functions and held that job, gee, I can't remember how long I was at property.  But I was a senior management, senior vice president of the property organization.
Speaker 1: It says here two years.
Speaker 2: That that sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, to '98 [1998]?
Speaker 2: Right.  And mission accomplished, I started something called product operations, which if you think about my Detort--Detroit [Michigan] background, it's the entire manufacturing arm of the insurance industry.  So everything that we build, put into words, add a price to and underwrite, I had all of those functions.  So that was, and that was a mark of distinction for us, because there were, there were things that we created when I started the organization that literally started to make billions of dollars for the organization.  Not my words, the chairman's words that "Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald McNeil] has, has generated billions of dollars for the organization in that job."
Speaker 1: What, what are the products that, that generated this (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one of the things that created was something called a strategic risk management rating system, and it's the, the combination of, of pricing underwriting and marketing elements driven into creating a pricing segmentation approach.  So, we brought to bear some of the, the huge database of information that we had to find tranches of risk that looked the same that we could, could market to that other folks might not otherwise find.  So it was a, a very large segmentation scheme, it drove--.  The, the long and short of that is that if you can find value in the marketplace before your competitor i- does, and become attractive to that segment, and go get them, you can, you can be very profitable at doing that.  So, we were able to do that, and the type of customer at one inst- one instances that we were able to attract were those that were more likely to stay longer with you.  More likely to buy other products, more likely to buy life insurance, more likely to refer people, so forth and so on.  So there's a lot of money to be had in making sure that you can surgically understand who is out there and what.  So that was touted, it's throughout all of the annual reports, it was what began to have people notice Allstate a lot more.  So that was one of the--the other part of it was something in, in terms of how I restructured how we would interact with the field.  There is always a home office in the field entity, and one of the things that has always been important to me was, was leadership.  And my leadership philosophy is to--had a couple pillars that you have to have the right results and the right environment.  And in order to, to sustain them, you need them both.  And the, and an environment that says, that has you either too centralized or too decentralized without some pretty specific rules of the roads is, is not necessarily what's gonna be most advantageous.  I redesigned our field and home office structure where the people in home office were aligned with the field, and had a P and L [profit and loss] responsibility associated with a certain geography.  So I had people that would get up in the morning living in, in Chicago [Illinois] who would eat, sleep and drink the results in New York, Pennsylvania and that sort of thing.  So they would bring all of the forces to bear in home office towards making that geography mo- as successful as it could be.  They were called state management approach and that sort of thing, also very successful.  The leadership elements I had a, had a nice run at, at developing people as I've had in bringing people into the organization throughout my career.  And I continued to, to land on those pillars that says in order to create the right environment you have to have the right leaders, and you have to develop them and you have to, have to, have to groom them and go get them.  So the product operations was a good from a, from a company product standpoint, from an innovation standpoint, and from a leadership standpoint.
Story_ID: 533586
Speaker 1: From what I understand here, you have to correct this, or, or adjust it probably, but you were--part of your responsibility was hel- helping the sales force make a transition from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would--
Speaker 1: Was that?
Speaker 2: That was my next job.
Speaker 1: Okay, your next job, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I had the product job, the manufacturing job and then, the, those--the interesting--about--those last three jobs didn't exist.  There wasn't a property organization, there wasn't a product organization, and my, my last job there was at distribution.  We had--distribution at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] was kind of flung throughout the organization; there were nine different distribution organizations.  And I brought them all together under one umbrella, and ended up being about seventy-five thousand people who were selling Allstate's products.  And my, my objective in, in bringing those together was to maximize the effectiveness of our distribution network and to grow market share.  So, in doing so, there were a number of transitions we needed to take the agency force through.
Speaker 1: Now what year is this when you, you start dealing with the distribution?
Speaker 2: That would've been two thousand and--late 2003.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was the title?
Speaker 2: Senior vice president of distribution.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Go, go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: So there was a, in, in, in order to, to grow the market share of the organization, or to position us to grow the market share of the organization, we had to make sure that our distribution entities were poised to heavily capt- capture their respective marketplaces.  So, much like the work of segmenting the customer base and segmenting the product base that we did when I ran the product organization, we went through a similar segmentation approach to the agency where we would adjust everything in their life based on the value that they brought to the organization.  Heretofore, it was a pretty standard approach to how you dealt with agencies with things like compensation, rewards, support, material and things of that nature.  We wanted to, I wanted to segment that approach so I said, you could, you could allow people to run to different levels, and then also attract people from other industries and outside of Allstate to come in because they saw the opportunity to run through those levels.
Story_ID: 533587
Speaker 1: Could you explain the segmentation approach again just for a minute, just, just for--
Speaker 2: For which one, the--
Speaker 1: For--
Speaker 2: --product or the agency?
Speaker 1: Well as a, I guess just as an approach to--
Speaker 2: As an approach?
Speaker 1: --either, yeah.
Speaker 2: The, the, the, the notion of segmentation is that you are going to apply the--let me think about what's the best way to, to describe this.  Is that you're, you're going to get far more surgical and matching benefit and reward.  On the customer side, if a, you need to understand which customers are--let, let me think about that a second this is.  I don't wanna, I don't wanna get so, so overly complicated in it, but the, the segmen- the segmentation approach is that I need to understand where discrete value occurs.  And match my rewards and benefits to the discrete value from customer's perspective.  If I know that I can get a customer that is likely going to bring me all their cars, their home, buy life insurance from me, refer their friends, I need to make sure I am, have an attractive enough price to be able to get those customers in greater numbers than they would go to someone else.  Does that make sense?
Speaker 1: Okay, so you give them a deal on a package (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So give 'em a de- so but, but in order for me to understand what kinds of deal I need to give them I need to know the value they bring to the organization.  So that's the, the statistical aspect of segmentation is understanding what discrete segments mean from a profit and loss standpoint.  So if there is a, a someone who is likely to stay with you a long time, who is going to bring products to you, you might certainly want to spend more money trying to attract that customer than you are going to spend trying to attract a customer who is likely only going to stay for you for six months.  So you're segmenting the resources and how you apply them because the additional money that I spend to attract that higher value segment is going to payoff to me later.  It's the same approach then for the agency.  If I've got an agency who can drive to, to generate a $50 million business, and generate a profit, I should invest more resources in that agency than in someone who just wants to spend, who maybe would be satisfied with just a million dollar agency.
Story_ID: 533588
Speaker 1: What happens next?  'Cause I don't think even we have it on the chart here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay from--
Speaker 1: Yeah from 2003 to two- through the end of end of your career [at the Allstate Corporation], I guess.
Speaker 2: Two thousand and three [2003] to 2007--well actually 2004 to 2007, I was the senior vice president of, of distribution.  And then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --retired effectively in February of, of 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now from what I understand, you were a candidate for the president of the entire organization.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and I don't know how many times, but, but tell us what happened and you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I have at least on a couple of occasions created the--certainly what I thought was the level of, and, and others as well, the level of performance and distinction to warrant getting that nod.  The, the second time around, the one most recently, when you look at the, the entire body of work, the entire contribution of the organization, the, the organizational reach and things of that nature, there was a, there was a horse race.  And there would be many, myself included, who would've thought that, that would've, should've been a horse race that I would've won.  But one of the things that you, you do also understand that, you just have to understand how decisions are made, and, and just deal with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and, now, how are decisions made at that level?
Speaker 2: You would, there's a certain level of per- performance that is, goes without saying is fairly table stake in making that decision.  But where it becomes a bit more subjective is the portfolio effect of what the, the decision makers would think the organization needs.  One of the portfolio effect would be the relationship with the, you know the chairman and the president.  One would be what the organization needs at that time, and so those are the kind of portfolio entities that come into play.  So it's, it clearly is, you need a, a, competent leader to be able to even get into the running.  And then the aspects of about who or who would not get the nod have some of those more subjective portfolio effects that are then considered before making that decision.
Story_ID: 533589
Speaker 1: When you retired you were one of the top five--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --individuals in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Allstate [Allstate Corporation].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And from what we understand you left a legacy of people of mentees, people who have gone on to become vice presidents at, at Allstate.  There's a, there's a list of names here I have, yeah, Darryl Fletcher [ph.], Darryl Page, Keith Green [ph.], Rhonda Woodard, Cynthia--what's her last name?  Cynthia--?
Speaker 2: Young.
Speaker 1: Young, yeah, Cynthia Young, and, and others.  Tell us about your approach to this, your approach to mentoring other African Americans especially.
Speaker 2: Well you know the, the first part of mentoring for me is to do everything in my power to get African Americans in the position that they should be in.  One of the individuals on that list was hired into an officer job off the street.  Which is something that, in fact the, he may, as I think about it, he may be in the f- the first, or certainly the first or second at his level hired off the street in an organization that would promote from the inside.  My, my so my approach first and foremost is to make sure that you get the qualified candidates into those positions of leadership that they so richly deserve.  Because when you have an opportunity to make some of the portfolio decision effects and that kind of stuff, you can, you can, can do those as well.  So from there, then, my, my--I don't necessarily calling it, necessarily menting--mentoring.  My leadership style is one that the folks on that list would say is one of incredible accessibility.  And so that is what I put under that bucket of, of men- of mentoring because with those folks at that level the notion of structured mentoring program is not something that I think will be the most beneficial.  What I do think is as leaders is the same kind of thing that, that worked for me and that was to--making sure that you were accessible to help individuals.  And that you were close enough to those individuals to recognize when they could use some support, both in front of and behind the scenes.
Story_ID: 533590
Speaker 1: You were telling us about four principles that you gui- that kind of guide you, you know you said the first was choosing to learn.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Second was choosing to contribute, what are the others?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first one is choose to learn both spiritually and cognitively because the minute you stop learning is the minute you're, you're dead, you know once you think you know it all, and that's, that, that's real important for the second one which is choose to contribute.  Because whatever you're doing to make it better, add some value, and the only way you gonna add value or be able to contribute, I say as if you're a critical thinker.  And you're not gonna be a critical thinker if you are committed to that first choice called choosing to learn.  The third one is choose to share, and that is a, the, the, the act of sharing, whether that's your kindness, your wealth or your wisdom, but sharing.  And the, the fourth is chose to lead, and, and that is simply, that doesn't mean a title, that means getting people to a place where they would not have gotten to without you.  Now I've used that, that, I, I've got a thirty second speech of choices, and I've got a thirty minute speech of choices.  And what I always challenge the audience to do is to tell me, give me any aspect of life that doesn't fit into one of those four choices.  And the reason I bring that up is for fourteen years no one has come up with--.  Let me give you an example.  Where's religion, well religion is clearly in my choosing to, to learn spiritually because I, the education and the manifestation of that.  Whereas education where a schooling, clearly education and schooling is embodied in that cogitative learning piece so.  Whereas all of this--so I, I give people an opportunity to try poke holes at that.  The only place where people have made a kind of a, I think a, a, slight then they say, "Well Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald McNeil], tell me where choose to love is?"  So they want me to make chose to love as my fifth choice, the reason I haven't made choose to love because it has, it permeates through all of those.  Because you should love to learn.  (Laughter) You should love to contribute, you should love to share and you should love to lead from wherever you happened to be in line.  So, but if, if there were a fifth element, it would be chose to love, but for, for years it has been those four choices.  And when I'm talking to kids, I, I, I give them a choice, I said, "Okay, I'll give you $5 million today, or I'll give you a penny a month, and double it for thirty days or thirty-one days, which would you take?"   And oftentimes folks will make the wrong choice and take the $5 million.  And I said--you know, my, my issue around choices is that, just like Ken Griffey [Ken Griffey, Jr.] is sitting there with a fastball coming at a hundred miles or ninety miles an hour at his head, he's gotta make a choice, and he's gotta make it very quickly.  And so the trick is getting to a place where you can make better choices a lot faster.  And I used that little kind of exercise as a, if you only had to make that choice once now, of course you'd be better off, you've got $5 million or the penny a month.  But the ability to make quicker choices, so and, and how you do that is in following that, that, that loop of those choices, so.  That, that's been my--if--as, as I come away from if, at, if I've made an affirmative choice and a well thought out one in those four dimensions, or five if you will, I usually come out feeling very good about it.  And come out with--in, in the best place.
Story_ID: 533591
Speaker 1: What factors I guess prompted you to retire in this year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well one I had, I had long since thought about retiring early, fifty-five, in fact I used to be dead set on wanting to retire at fifty-five.  So that was one.  The fact that, I didn't feel like I've needed to stay and continue to generate the kind of value that I, that I would generate in the organization [Allstate Corporation] without the corner office is, is, is, is the other one.  And the third one is that my wife [Regina Clark McNeil] and I started a foundation a number of years back, and we have left the foundation work to the universities.  And we've been trying to find the time and space to take a more hands on approach to running our own foundation.  And, so all three of those played into--some obviously maybe more pressing than others, but those were the three decisions that, that, that took me to retirement at this place.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what's the name of your foundation?
Speaker 2: The Ronald D. and Regina C. McNeil Foundation, Inc.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's the president and I'm the treasurer.  Secretary is Geneva Williams [ph.] out of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and what does your foundation do primarily?
Speaker 2: We grant scholarships, college scholarships to folks with, with academic agility but the, the lack of financial resources.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your activities are primarily in Michigan today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we--you know you have to start in an area that you're familiar with both from, from a following standpoint with, with getting our 501(c)(3) status.  And there's certain elements of that you need to do from a procedure standpoint.  And also the fact that we're more comfortable with those institutions because of the institutions that we had gone to and that sort of thing.  So that's why we started in Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so and to this point how, how many students have been able to--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: --benefit?
Speaker 2: --we're up to eleven now, we most of the students have been in the engineering department at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I also have a, a scholar athlete program, and there've been I think four through, through those as well.  But what we're headed to do now is we're gonna branch out into the other institutions in Michigan, namely some of the smaller institutions, and some of the community colleges as well.  Which, had we tried to do that with the hands off approach, it would've been somewhat overwhelming.  So now that we've got a position where can, we can in fact stretch that, we're ready to branch out beyond just the, the three universities that we had identified early on.

Speaker 1: Can you describe just for us if you will the relationship between the insurance industry today and development in the black community I guess.  I mean because there's a, there's a meshing of ins- insurance and banking and everything now that didn't exist like years ago.
Speaker 2: You, you know actually I, I've seen it go both ways, I've seen it go where there was a kind of a confluence of forces where you're trying to be everything to everybody.  You know I want banking, insurance, financial, credit cards; I want all of those together.  And then I've seen the, the spirit of what you need to do is to focus; that was the, the buzzword, you need to focus, so you need to go into a niche approach to your business philosophy.  In, in, in both of those at a high level, a lot of the black community and communities of color have been left out of that equation.  When, when, when--because if you go in the first approach that says I'm gonna grab for the multiline account, the path to making money there is on the large dollar accounts.  Case in point, you know Merrill Lynch [Merrill Lynch and Co., Inc.; Merrill Lynch Wealth Management] as an example, if you got less than twenty-five thousand dollars won't give you a live person, they'll make you talk to a--talk to a call rep center.  The approach of segmentation when you start collapsing those financial services tends to leave even more folks in the black community out of that equation.  Now, if you're sitting, if you're talking to, to folks in the financial community they say well you know when you look at there's reasons for that because when you look at savings rates, net worth, and all that kind of stuff, they give you those reasons why that exist.  True, but I go back to this notion of innovation of product.  If you are really prone to want to make money, and I think making money is a fine thing to do.  And you can make money by being creative inside underserved communities.  So now let's go to the other approach that says the focus side of it, I think that there has been a push to, to, to understand where demographics is heading, and to understand how much income potential exist in various communities.  You probably heard the numbers of the, what, maybe eight, seven hundred between blacks and Hispanics is probably a trillion and a-half dollars between those two communities if you, if you just look at those two.  And so the notion of companies trying to find a way to get access to that is something that gets a lot of, I say lip service.  But tends to get less real push from a broad spectrum of organizations.  And, and the reason I say that is that when I look at, at who owns certain urban markets, they're still some of the you know some of the traditional players.  As, as an example, you, you we would contract with, with external research firms to say who is doing what in urban marketplaces.  And when you look at who places in those markets you say well State Farm and Allstate [Allstate Corporation].  And you know we would run one and two in terms of life, homeowners and automobile in, in a number of those marketplaces.  Despite the fact that there've been a number of entities that have come onboard another, a number of financial entities.  So, and the same can be said for the, the, the Hispanic community when, when, when I get input from people like the National Council of La Raza [UnidosUS] and things of that nature.  And others who are still looking for financial literacy at this stage of the game, that tells me that that huge billion to trillion dollars of marketplace has not been effectively captured by a number of players in the marketplace.  So I, I, I'm, still at a place that says that putting resources behind innovation define ways to make money and partner in some of the communities still not there.
Story_ID: 533593
Speaker 1: We're about a year and a-half, maybe two years away from the Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] catastrophe--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Aftermath of that is a, I know that had to really--I mean it's, is really of concern to the insurance industry as it is to the people who weren't insured so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What, what was the impact at Allstate [Allstate Corporation] when that happened?
Speaker 2: Well for starters we lost about $4 billion there and that's a, you know with the size of the, the, the marketplace, you'll never--you lost all the money you have ever made and will probably ever make in that marketplace with Katrina.  So, and the same would be said for State Farm and some others.  The, a perfect example is that, so what do you do about that?  Now there is some cutting and running that's und- I, I, I think people will understand the notion that says that you know if you had 20 percent of that marketplace is 20 percent the right number?  So there'll be some adjusting of what's in the marketplace and everybody will do that.  And adjusting what you have in the marketplace will go from cutting back how large you are to getting out of the market in total.  But the flipside of that though is, and where I keep coming back to, are you going to do something to invest in creating an alternative?  And where I say it is easiest, and most people fall is on the side that say, hey, just do my calculations and cut and run.  There're far fewer folks that will say, well you know there is a way to do this if you, if you did a combination, public, private, if you did this, if you did that.  Here are, here is a path to make the insurance market viable there.  Because if the insurance market cuts and runs, I don't like the prospect for a marketplace that makes insurance so unaffordable because then that will spill into that, into the housing industry, housing industry spills into the construction industry.  I mean it's a ripple effect, it's not just that I'm gonna, gonna create some pain for the insurance industry and have them--are, are to go away.  It is a larger market issue, and I think Katrina unfortunately was not as large of a wakeup call on a number of different fronts.  There's a racial element that was not addressed I mean you know we have so compartmentalized a lot of things.  And once something gets off the front page and out of the news, it's out of sight, out of mind.  And, and that's, that's just not right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything else about the insurance industry we need to talk about in your career before I, I move into you know more general questions?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: If something occurs to you, you know just feel free to raise it but.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 533594
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what are, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in general today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Mine is boy I was a, I've been so bent out of shape by the, the events that have occurred here recently.  But my, my hope is, is and always been for the black community that we could flex in- intellectually flex our capital muscle.  I mean you know we, we live in a capitalistic society, the black community has a lot of money, doesn't have a lot of wealth, but have a whole lot of money.  And all of the trappings of flexing your--intellectually flexing your capital muscle mean a lot of things.  That's, that, that drives into politics the kinds of things that you should expect, the kind of things that should occur in your communities.  So, but our, our capital muscle is taken for granted because it is squandered.  Now I keep adding that intellectual piece in there, and that is because if, if I had to land on one thing that was clear in my black culture and a whole bunch of other folks that I know as black culture was that of, of, of what you were expected to do.  The black culture I know was a culture that could overcome obstacles, could persevere, could stand up, could better themselves that were also critical thinkers.  I got to tell you, I do get concerned and I don't wanna do this monolith, but I do get concerned with how the black community does get marginalized and distracted by--because people shape issues for us as opposed to us shaping issues for ourselves, and I say shaping issues for ourselves is that element of critical thinking.  Yet you know the notion I get, I, I don't necessarily have issues with, with people out in front, but just the notion that all of the black community needs a black leader or several black leaders I think is folly.  That continues this notion of herdist monolith that I think continues to, to marginalize us.  So the issue is embracing that culture and embracing that culture, there's some of those elements of standing up critical thinking, advancing that unfortunately have a lot of different things biting away.  So my, my fear is that we continue to get marginalized, my fear is that, in fact my generation really lost, dropped the ball.  When you think about you know your generation, you know my generation, my father [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.], other fathers, mothers always say you know, "I want you to do better than I did.  I want you to do this, I want you to do this, I didn't have this, but I want my kids to have that."  When you begin to look at there are a number of advancements in the black community, but there are a number of, of, of the generation that we dropped the ball on and didn't help them be better off than we were.  So the, the, I do have that, that, that concern.  My, my hope though is that there continues to be because we are so out of the loop with regard to in God we trust but everybody else bring facts.  The elements about things that are occurring in the black community rarely get talked about, rarely get reported.  So you continue a wave of misinformation that goes on, so one of the hopes I have is if there's a place to, I think there can have a kind of a very significant impact is the quicker we can change the factual or, or change to a factual imagery of, of who we are.  Because I gotta tell you even as a police officer, as an insurance executive, as a business leader, or whatever, the, the information that gets put out in the bros- broad media tends to be anecdotal--by and large it's anecdotal.  And you, you, you don't build a foundation on anecdotal information the anecdotal information would be if you look at the images you saw of black people and based your research on the six o'clock news, you'll have a totally erroneous view of what black people are.  I was in Aus- well I, I could divert to when I went to Australia and the only thing they had on Australian TV were black videos.  And so for a, for a fairly sterile culture anyway to see those are the only images.  So, when, when I talk to folks out there, the, I say, "What else do you see?"  "That's all I see."  So it's the same.  It's the microcosm of what we have here, if all you see are, are those, those images those are, those are detrimental.  But, but I don't just wanna land on the images because that's, that's just one element.   And the thing that's, that's really important is that to understand that these are complex issues that we talk about.  And because we try to get into such a easy answer, compartmentalized view, I think we mess up, miss an awful lot.  But if, if you had the, so I'm, I'm, I'm kind of on both sides of the fence says, says well you say it's complicated, don't try a one trick answer, but if you force me to try something first it, it is, it is this notion of critical thinking that I would go to.
Story_ID: 533595
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point is there any major thing that you would do differently if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: Yeah I thi- on par I'm pretty comfortable with the decisions that I've made and I can, I can pass my father's [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] steel and spine test when I look at who I am and what I, what I've done.  But I, I certainly could find some things that I would do different with regard to--probably speed would be the, the thing.  Because you know I have prided myself on taking calculated decisions and that sort of thing.  Thinking through them, being critical thinker, all that other kind of stuff, but sometimes I think in going through that process you may have thought about something longer than you should have.  And I, so I would inject an element of speed in some of the decisions, so it's kind of like you know and the beauty of whiteboarding your life.  And that's one of the other elements when I go into my thirty minute conversation about those choices, I go and I actually talk about you ought to chronicle those things.  Because you can go back and take a look at them and, and say, all right, now what would I have done differently?  And as I've done that, I say well you know you, it took you a year to, to get MPP up, it took you eight months to bring a, a, black vice president into the organization.  So it's, it's what is it about that decision that caused it to take eight months as opposed to four months?  So first and foremost, I would go at the speed element of it, and I'd probably also go harder at the ask of what I would want people to do on two dimensions.  One's at the business level and two's at the philanthropic level, when you ask, I used to try to get people to do things philanthropically by example.  I think I asked them, point, point blank, more direct, "Why don't you do this?"  And at the, at the, at the business level, it might be pushing to the ask that turned into greater levels of innovation particularly in the communities that you could then use as a springboard for saying, here's something that other companies ought to be looking at and doing.  Because people don't like to be outgunned and sometimes if companies see you doing something, making money, folks aren't gonna let you make all the money by themselves.  So I think sometimes that creative influence that does things that work for you and the black community will cause other people to be there as well.
Story_ID: 533596
Speaker 1: Likewise when you look at everything you've done to this point, and, what do you s- would, what would you say today is your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, well I go to when I was leaving Allstate [Allstate Corporation] they put a website out there where you could or page and you could write comments to me and then the rest of the organization could read them.  And you can send private stuff as well, but if one of the--the thing that struck me was how much of an impact you can have on folks' lives when you embrace a philosophy that I had that says work is the thing you do to fuel the real important things in your life.  And so in--I've always operated that way that people have more important things to do with their lives other than work.  And that came back to me in, in so many powerful ways when people reflected on how something I may have done or said touched them in a real life sense and not in just a, he happens to be this corporate executive and that sort of thing.  So I would have hopefully left a legacy of being someone who you respected, had integrity and was significant enough to make a difference.
Story_ID: 533597
Speaker 1: Now your activities since retirement are primarily the foundation [Ronald D. and Regina C. McNeil Foundation, Inc.] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I am on, I'm on the board of directors, I've been involved with the Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of America] both at the national level and Midwest level for a while.  I'm also on the Lake Forest Graduate School of Management board, and so and I've got other request to do some things, but primarily what I've done since, in the, in the month since I retired.  Because I had official Allstate [Allstate Corporation] duties up until the end of March, and what I've done since then is just relax.  And try to get, well the only official thing is, I've done is my wife [Regina Clark McNeil] sent out probably sixty letters to universities letting them know that the foundation may be open for a business in a different sort of sense.  So we've been focusing mostly on the foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay these are universities in Michigan primarily (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 533598
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family now, you, you talked about your wife [Regina Clark McNeil] some--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But do you have children?
Speaker 2: No, it's just my wife and I.  We, I like to think we got a lot of children, and a lot of children coming between the stuff that we do but it's just been she and I.  We've been married now for what twenty-four years, almost twenty-five years.  And it, it has been, it's been as good as it gets.  One of the things that people as they get ready to go into retirement are, are wondering about being underfoot and all that kind of stuff, and invading somebody else's life.  My, my wife has been wanting me to retire for some time because of how much fun we have together and the things that we do.  So, that's a, that's a neat thing, so we, we're gonna have some fun and she'll be, she'll be lobbying heavily for me not to do anything other than you know hang out with her and do the foundation [Ronald D. and Regina C. McNeil Foundation, Inc.] as opposed to if I decided to get into any kind of limited professional pursuits beyond what I've got going now.  My, my dad [Elijah L. McNeil, Jr.] we continue to have those conversations, and he is a cancer survivor and don't know how much longer I'll have him.  But while I do we'll have a great time.  I, I have a relationship with my brother in Toronto [Canada] who is blind, and we have, we have a wonderful relationship.  And I like to support him in some things, he's had some tough times but he is a, he's also been a, been a mentor to me in terms of strength and perseverance.  And going blind was, was something I don't know if as late in his life as he that he went blind because he was over fifty before he started losing his eyesight, that's a long time to see.  My, my two other siblings, I, I don't talk to my brother and sister as much as I used to, but they're doing well and having their families, watching their families go off and do things.  But everybody is doing well, my grandmother's [Maggie Cole] still alive on my mother's [Dorothy Harrison Vary] side, she's 103.  So people live a long time, so I better stay healthy.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 533599
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that you think we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as an example for, for how to maximize the gifts you've been given.  And what I mean by that is that not that I done all of this 'cause I still have some, some time to work.  But if, if when you look at Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald McNeil] at the end of that curve and say, you know, he really made things--he had a practice of making things better than they were than they gave them.  So he applied something to them whether that was critical thought, love, care, handling, or whatever to have passed this rock that he was given to be a shiner or bigger rock when he gave it to someone else.  And that he used--not that he used, but, but that he was invested enough in making it better that it was easy for himself to invest in people.  And it would encourage them to say, you know, it is unacceptable for me to not pass through here without making it better and having impacts on other lives.  So I, I'd liked to be you said you know I'd like to, to, to--if Ron was an example of, of giving of, of making it better and doing it in such a way that other peoples want, other people wanted to make things better, and that was their benchmark for significance, I--there isn't anything better than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you for spending your time with us sir.
