Speaker 2: 6/18/60 [June 18, 1960] in Chicago [Illinois] at the University of Chicago Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's exactly where you were.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a music executive, I guess, or entrepreneur.  I founded this record company that we're sitting in right now, Hidden Beach Recordings, so I run that.  I'm President or CEO, whatever.  We do-we kind of shy away from titles here--but when one's predominant.  That's when it's Founder and CEO.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: I hope this isn't a test.  What was it--is it the seventeenth?

Speaker 1: Hidden Beach Headquarters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119658
Speaker 1: All right.  Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that management compels me to ask--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a lightweight answer, a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, sir, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Favorite foods?  I don't know.  That's pretty tough about--to nail a specific food.  I love a lot of foods.  I don't look too partial to junk food.  And I'm trying to break that habit actually right now.  I love great steak.  I love sushi.  I swear, I've never been asked that question before.  I love Chinese food.  It really is--I guess I don't have a--I have to take--the answer is no.  And I don't have a one favorite food, but I love a lot of different foods.  I obviously like to eat, so I'm actually, you know, in the process of working on that right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably blue, blues, and different variations.  And there's one, you know, if you want a color, they have been saying that ever since I was a little kid.  But I, you know, again, like that, there's, you know, all shades of things in between oranges, rust colors, blues, you know, for look, depends on what--green.  In fact, the company sort of color, company, the color--company color here is green, like a real relaxing kind of green.  So, yeah, I've probably named every one in the spectrum as well, but, yeah, if I had to say one color--blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like the--out here, I like the fall and winter, and you living in California, you know.  If you ask me that question in Chicago, it's obviously the summer.  I couldn't (laughter), I try to stay out of Chicago during the--no offense at all, but Chicago is behind--put this together, but stay out of Chicago during the winter time.  But, yeah, I love the, the, actually the fall and winter here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably Aspen is--and I love Europe.  I love Africa.  The best trip I've ever been on is like a safari in Kenya.  That's as much favorite place I've ever probably traveled to--most amazing are the Seychelles [ph.] Islands.  But I love to ski, so in the United States at least, probably the favorite place to go for, you know, a trip is Aspen, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I'm sure everybody out in the hall could tell you probably something different but if I do, I'm not conscious of it.  Did the other people you interviewed have ready answers to something like that?  I'm just curious.
Speaker 1: No, not--I mean, it really varies.  You know, some people--it's something that they exclaim when they hit their thumb with a hammer, or some it's a quote from the Bible or Shakespeare.  Some is a quote from another black, a black leader or something if they--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --they made up themselves, you know.  A lot, a lot of people really don't (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I have a thousand quotes that I use all the time, but not a--what was your question, favorite saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  For favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, so something--not something that you use all the time, but it's some, some words, such you--
Speaker 1: Well, at least a favorite thing to--favorite saying that, that--
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of those would probably be, you know, phrases or quotes or things from like [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  One is probably appropriate here is that rigorous self-examination is the highest form of maturity, but I don't--I guess, I have a thousand quotes that I use all the time, or like have always tucked away, but I don't have a favorite.  I don't think I have a favorite phrase.
Story_ID: 119659
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It is Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever.  Clarke is her maiden name with an "e".
Speaker 1: Okay.  With an "e"?  Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: 6/08/36 [June 8, 1936].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Me or my mother--I mean, me, personally, I can go back just to my great-grandparents.  But we have pictures in my mother's portraits going back--I think two generations in front of that.  I mean--
Speaker 1: That's interesting, like what you know about the--I guess, how far back you can actually--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know before--I know I should have, yeah, I feel like I'm, as, as I'm--should have actually gotten on the phone with her beforehand 'cause she's been amazing historian in the family.  And I don't think we've ever done a huge, you know, sort of the full-blown, you know, family tree in our ancestry.  But she has really done a wonderful job of sort of keeping in that history together and sort of researching and, and, you know, the background.  In fact, a lot of stuff I know now, I didn't know growing up as a kid, like what my grandparents on her side, and some of their history.  But I, I fairly comfortably know the, you know, 'cause I also knew them, their grand-, my grandparents' parents.  I knew them when they, they were very small--the Richardsons.  And, and I don't know, but I never knew my grandfather's parents or then the Clarkes, that, that history really well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you said and they go back like--and you knew your great-grandparents--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, but it goes back--
Speaker 2: My mother knows--
Speaker 1: --your knowledge goes back another two generations.
Speaker 2: My, my family knowledge goes back--I think at least another two generations that my mother--and we have pictures and from the 1800's of some family members, the, that my mother has sort of pieced together.  And she's really the, you know, if you really want that history--I mean, sit with her for a little bit, 'cause she's, she's, you know, has been studying it for fifty years, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But we could say in your family, you all can trace--you said, at least back to the Civil War and past it.  Is that, I guess--
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's Civil War--
Speaker 1: 1860's--
Speaker 2: It's--I think it's probably more late 1800's that, you know, we know about.  And, again, it's just not like history in my hand.  It's--I'm saying that I know that my mother knows it.  And I guess I really should, became the, but they're pretty much--the pictures from the last century are--if I actually went upstairs and, and pointed--I really couldn't tell you who's who, but she can kind of tell you that instantly where, where the lines were.
Story_ID: 119660
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have any stories that have passed down through the family about the real old history in your family at all?
Speaker 2: I mean one, the first that comes to mind is that my grandfather, John Clarke, my mother's [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] father, grew up--I think he had a German mother.  And he grew up as first, and this is something I've actually learned fairly recently 'cause I mean in the last twenty years or so.  But he, he grew up for the first eight years, eight or nine years of his life, as a white kid, you know, in fairly nice neighborhoods, you know, Caucasian neighborhood in St. Louis [Missouri].  And I don't know the specific story, but one day the fact that his parents had came out, and in one day, he had to get moved out from a really good school and was moved.  And his family was moved to the other side of town because they found out that he was actually indeed black.  And he had something you would think would be a, especially in that, you know, time period or any time, pretty dramatic, you know, revelation for him.  And the thing that was amazing about--my grandfather was the kindest, the super, super smart, super well-read, and he had knowledge of geography and everything else.  But he was known, at least that I saw growing up, and he's the person who drove me to school every day.  It was, you know, we were really close.  There was no--you never saw the slightest inclination that there was any scars left behind.  It was never any hint.  He was very proudly, you know, a black American and very proudly, you know, in every aspect.  So, I would always think that somebody would, you know, you know, like that, he may grow up like a Clarence Thomas--or not Clarence Thomas--but Ward Connerly, you know, with a real resentment toward, you know, their own race.
Speaker 1: That would be Clarence Thomas.
Speaker 2: Thomas, yeah.  Everybody took (unclear) of it, too, most, yeah.
Speaker 1: Supposed so--I mean, I--supposed, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, well, is he--does he look like he's white?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, that's what's so, you know, he's actually about your complexion, funny enough, he was--and really, but it's very funny--same, you know, kind of features, maybe a little fair.  I don't know what he looked like as a kid.  Oh, yes, I do--I mean, yeah, he did have very, kind of straight hair.  And we do have a lot of pictures of him as a three- or four-year-old kid and, you know, real small, like standing in little dresses they used to put kids in.  And he--so, I guess and, yeah, in those pictures, he definitely looked more, you know, Caucasian than he actually, you know, did as later in life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do he do for a living?  What did your grandfather do?
Speaker 2: He [John Clarke] was a janitor, at least in the most of the time when I, you know, from when I came into the world.  He was a janitor in the public school system.  And then he worked, inter-managed--my parents bought a apartment building.  And he, he--on Dorchester in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], and he became sort of the manager of that and the janitor.  He was overall manager, kind of that, that space.  And that's what he was really doing until he passed away.
Story_ID: 119661
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did, let's see, any other stories about that side of the family?  Any--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, my, you know, I guess, the Richardsons, I remember, I actually remembered, and I thought--I can't tell you what they--
Speaker 1: That's your mother's [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] side?
Speaker 2: Did mother's side, did for them.  I don't know much about the Clarke side other than that, that story.  The--other than the, you know, the most recent sort of history, not on the way back meaning, but the migration and, you know, my mother's, my grandmother's brothers and sisters, like Creighton [ph.] Richardson, and my mother was Edna Richardson, Maddy Edna Richardson.  I know some of their histories and I know most of the stories.  I, I actually did this myself with them, you know, with the video camera.  So, I've kind of videotape of most of them telling anecdotal stories from when they were my grandmother and, and grandfather started dating, and those kind of things like that.  But so, I've got a little, you know, stealing chickens when they were dating and, you know, my more and more humorous little stories about how my grandfather used to--actually I know my grandfather's sisters.  And one of them is still alive, which is Aunt Hazel, Hazel Cowen [ph.] who lives in the--where my parents live now-Oglesby [Illinois].  They, you know, they always tell stories how my grandfather, when he was going out with my grandmother, would give her gifts, these wonderful trinkets and bracelets and everything else.  But he would steal them from his two sisters, and they said my grandmother was so proud walking down the street. I think she was like sixteen at the time that, you know, like, "Oh, look what John bought me."  He got me this wonderful, you know, locket or whatever, and they would be frozen in anger 'cause it was theirs, but they wouldn't say anything to, you know, blow it for him.  But I know a lot of those type of stories like that, but not so much or like direct ancestry kind of like, you know, pieces.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119662
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] grow up in St. Louis [Missouri] or did she--
Speaker 2: She grew up in St. Louis and she migrated to Chicago [Illinois].  She was the first to migrate.
Speaker 1: Was she grown when she migrated to Chicago?
Speaker 2: In high school.
Speaker 1: High school, okay.
Speaker 2: So, she came up into high school.  And my grandparents actually and the rest of the family followed her, so she was the first to come up.  It's for her to go to Hyde Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: You mean, so she came up to go to high school in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Does she have relatives here already, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had a relative, Aunt, my Aunt Hazel and her--I think, she may have been, I can't, (unclear), but she was--I mean, my, yeah, Aunt Lu [ph.], which was my grandfather's sister, and she was married to a man, Schumacher [ph.].  And it's funny when I look back.  He may have actually been white.  It's so funny, but as a kid, you don't even (unclear)--they lived on the South side and (unclear), I mean, maybe just 'cause of very, very fair-skinned black guy or mixed.  I'm not really sure, but always with--and it was never even a, you know, something you just didn't see really as a kid.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119663
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] talk about growing up and any of her experiences?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, all the time.  I know, I know all of her experiences pretty much from, you know, almost infant on up.
Speaker 1: Any favorite stories that she tells about growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, there's so many.  I mean, from the mark that she has on her nose to try to give herself a freckle with a lead pencil to--oh, I mean, to (laughter), yeah, I can, I mean, just almost ask the age.  You know, she, she was the oldest of her whole family.  So, she was sort of like, she, she had one older sister that passed away right around the time that she was born.  But, then, she's the oldest of my--her sister, Loretta Clarke, Joanne [ph.] Clarke, Richard Clarke, John, Jr. Clarke, and then there's an aunt that's my age.  She's six months younger than me.  She is Laura [ph.] Clarke.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, so I mean, she ran herds, you know, kind of the bully or the, you know, that the, of the big girl, oldest, you know, kids.  So, you know, every time we get together, my, you know, her, my aunts and uncles, you know, have a bunch of stories of what, how my mother used to (laughter), you know, treat, and actually, none of those stories have all, still goes on.  All of them, thankfully, are still alive and so, they play out that same drama every time, they, you know, they get together.  All those, you know, familiar relationships, have never, you know, haven't changed over the years.
Story_ID: 119664
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: He's [HM] Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He's 6/15/34 [June 15, 1934].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And was he born in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, all right.  What do you know about his side of the family?  How back, far back, can you take them?
Speaker 2: Not as far back.  I think, I know of stories from his mother.  And I've met her as a three-year-old or two-year-old, but I don't remember her.  I don't know much about his father, Lester McKeever, Sr.  I knew as a kid, and he was, you know, wonderful.  But my grandmother was divorced and married Mr. Greenwood [ph.].  So, as a kid, I just thought I had--it was a natural thing that you have three grandfathers and those, you know, Mr. McKeever, Mr. Greenwood, they're all gramp-, you know, grandpa and my mother's mother, Mr. Clarke.  I know he's from New--he came here by way of, I think, New Jersey.  And I don't know much about his background, McKeever.  I know that my grandmother came from--I'm pretty sure the South.  Some places are--very small kid.  She started going out with my father's father at a fairly young age--I think she's like, she had him when she was like sixteen or something.  He was--I think ten years older.  And I don't know when they got divorced.  It was before I was born.  And, but it's so funny.  And I know about her mother, my grandmother's mother, you know, as far as, you know, because they--she was, mamma was the--yeah, since my mother was so young, she had--my grandmother was so young, was out working a lot.  When my father was coming up, so she was involved, and sort of helping oversee them.  And my aunt, her sister, helped raise my, my father and his three brothers, his two brothers, and a cousin that, you know, always were sort of in the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there are things like ten years difference, so they're, they're not a huge difference between my father and my, his aunt, who's still alive now but--
Story_ID: 119665
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father [HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.]  talk about growing up in the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean, he had, you know, and again, I'm like that, like my mother [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] knew, you know, stories about him from, you know, grammar school, high school, college, you know, every, sort of every step of the way.
Speaker 1: Oh, what was he like growing up?  Can you tell us or--
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, he was (laughter), to hear him tell it, he was the, you know, the ladies' man, real suave, and the smooth guy, and a good athlete.  I think he boxed a little bit.  To me, he was a, you know, complete nerd in the sense that he, in a complimentary way, but I mean he's a real, serious about school.  And the reason I used to think that is 'cause, I, you know, I came up with not being real, you know, serious about school at, at a age, at least when he was frantic about it 'cause his cousin always tell the story how he was the hall monitor.  And my father even tells the same thing, but how he was the monitor in one of the classes.  And my father didn't like to go to gym class, or this one teacher.  And my dad had all A's at his high school.  This is--I guess, it's at--I think it's [Wendell] Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois], and he didn't go, so he skipped gym, thinking his cousin was going to hook him up.  And his cousin marked him down absent every week and so when he got the grades he got an F and they still tease him about how much he cried for days 'cause he had never had an F before.  He'd have all A's and he was, you know, he's the oldest kid, a super achiever, and everything else.  And so, I remember I used to hear the story as a kid, like, you know, I wish I would have cried with just, you know, like one bad grade or had one bad grade.  But he--and I would see his notebooks 'cause he, you know, would keep them around.  And I was like amazed at how his notes were so neat, 'cause I'm the complete opposite--and so neat and so organized and, you know, kind of studious.
Story_ID: 119666
Speaker 1: The--I mean it's probably the most amazing story of his growing up is that the--there's a family on his street called the Beasleys [ph.].  Do you know the--Mr. Beasley?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Dr. Beasley?
Speaker 1: Yeah--no, it wasn't a Dr. Beasley.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was Mr. Beasley, Allen J. Beasley.
Speaker 2: Allen, oh, Allen of the Beasley Group or the Beasley bunch.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  And he is an amazing guy and, and he almost would--became a fourth grandfather because my dad [HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.] --every time he was around, he would say, we don't, we would have nothing if it weren't for Mr. Beasley.  And Mr. Beasley is a painter, who is also kind of an entrepreneur, who invested in some real estate.  And but, and things like that, but he was extremely philanthropic--I mean, just a big, big philanthropist, and yeah, with very little.  In fact, I think they've documented how much, how amazing it was for how much money he gave away for someone who made lower middle class wages, but had a real dedication to putting things back.  There's a building named after him in Ohio actually right now.
Speaker 2: In what part of--
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I think it's Cincinnati [Ohio] in one of the colleges.  And he saw my dad was like number two--I think in his high school class.  And, you're taken after two tests, and they told him he should be an accountant.  I didn't even know what an accountant was, but said, oh, wow, maybe this is something to do.  But I think his designs were--when he was in high school, he was going to be a painter 'cause he had done some work for Mr. Beasley.  And Mr. Beasley saw him with his newspaper routes as a real hardworking kid.  And so, when Mr. Beasley found out he was going to go to--he had, just do a vocation.  He said, you're too smart, you need to go to college.  And the Beasley family took their money out of the bank.  They had no kids, and gave it to my father and sent him to school.  And a really incredible, you know, story which is a truism of life of how, you know, what goes around comes around because it was always--Mr. Beasley was always credited with, you know, putting us where we were--all the opportunities and things that my father had, wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Mr. Beasley.  Later in life, his wife died, Mr. Beasley's wife died.  And then my grandfather, John Wister Clarke died and the--as he was almost a part of our family from that, you know, embrace of my dad as a kid, he got to know, obviously, my family and my mother and her family, and started a relationship with my grandmother.  And it was really interesting because Mr. Beasley--because my--he was--my father was estranged from his, his father, and a little bit after the divorce.  And my father, my grandfather had apparently a drinking problem to some degree.  And Mr. Beasley became a real serious father figure for my father and, obviously so, from the way he sort of helped lift him up, and he was always like my dad's father.  And so, later in life, my--the person who was like my dad's father ended up marrying my mother's mother.  So, it was like my parents had the same set of parents.  And my grandparents, you know, conceptually were--they, my parents almost came out of the same tree.  But his--what he used to say 'cause my father--the whole time he was alive that I knew him--I don't think there was an occasion my father wouldn't thank him for, you know, we wouldn't have this glass of water, or he wouldn't have this if it weren't for you.  You're providing me with this education and the opportunities that came from it.  And he would always then joke--look, you know, he had, his life was happier at the end.
Story_ID: 119667
Speaker 1: Yeah, is there a story about how your parents [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever and HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.] met?  Did they tell a story about how--
Speaker 2: They met a party.  And, you know, again, there's obviously two sides of that.  My parents say that my father, you know--my mother is extremely attractive--is that, I mean, still now, but as a young woman.  And my father was this, you know, debonair--I guess he had just got out of--no, no, he was still in college.  I guess he was a senior in college 'cause he's still downstate.  He went to college at the University of Illinois in Champaign [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois].  And, you know, I don't know how he approached her.  If you listen to him, he was the, the playboy who was able to go up and make introductions and, you know.  However, they, they didn't go on a date.  And I just know that, I guess, he, at that point, he finally--I think had a car, maybe the year he got out that, that on their first date, you know, he had one door that you couldn't open.  They always had to slide out.  And they pulled up some place at valet, and they opened the door, and this whole door, you know, sort of fell off into (laughter) the driveway at a hotel.  But my mother plays this, that sort of little bit more coy in--I don't really--her, her side of it, I don't know as well as, you know, that she's clearly real popular and, you know.  She was the president of her--I think she's--I don't know if she was president of her class, but she was in debutante like--not society debutante type of thing, but she 'cause she was clearly not that, and that both my parents grew up with very, very little.  My--but they named her like in, in high school, in one of like South Side magazines, like the 'Women to Watch' and this, you know, super-achiever type person.
Story_ID: 119668
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, she [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] was involved in clubs and groups way back--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, she was, she's just like, you know her now, and she's just like she's--
Speaker 1: Now, she's very, she's a high-powered volunteer.  She volunteers for a lot of things and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, volunteers.  She was--that's how she's always, she's always been that way.
Speaker 1: --organizes other, with other women around good causes and--
Speaker 2: She's always--when I was a kid, she was a public school teacher.  She was amazing.  She was probably, I think, the best teacher in the city of Chicago [Illinois].  And since then, she had a third grade class and she really believed in travel.  And the travel was real important.  When (unclear) her school was in the projects.  She was at Woodson [South Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And the projects were right across the street from the school and that's where everybody pretty much went to school.  I mean, that's the district that it was in, but she used to do pancake sales in the mornings, and all kinds of--beat up businesses as fundraisers to take her kids every year.  If you were in Mrs. McKeever's class, you went, and I was lucky enough to go.  As I got a little older, I went to California, Colorado, Texas, Canada, and take a train trip and--that would be part of the school.  And the parents who would be really excited if their kids got in our class 'cause they--and most of the parents hadn't ever been out of the City of Chicago.  So, as a kid, and this is really third grade, you were getting this wide open, you know, volunteers.  My mother would organize it.  And we'd all get on the train and we'd stay on a dude ranch.  And it was in, in Colorado and, and just see, you know, it was just amazing, you know, eye-opening experiences.  And she would see that there was a need.  She's the type person that sees, you know, see there is a need for something and, you know, go straight at it and come figure out some way to, you know, tackle the problem.

Speaker 1: Well, tell me what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up for you?
Speaker 2: We grew up at 79th and I don't remember the couple parts, 79th and Wentworth.  And I, you know, remember every, you know, from neighbor and the sounds.  We were right off of--very close to the Dan Ryan and right off 79th Street.  So it was a fairly busy, you know, kind of urban environment.  It was, you know, growing up, and Chicago [Illinois] is a really segregated city.  I mean, there were really no, you know, it was no integration whatsoever.  And so, it was a very lower middle class, middle--I think it was a middle class starter neighborhood 'cause there were all new homes and new construction, fairly small, you know, square foot homes and across the street from--the bus CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] bus yard was right across the street.  And--
Speaker 1: Right across 79th, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, I remember, you know, obviously, as a little kid, I'd moved off there when I first graduated from second grade.  You know, I remember, it's the--my world was really that block.  You couldn't really cross the streets and move around.  But it was a real dramatic move to Hyde Park when I was in third grade.  I went to Bret Harte Grammar School [Chicago, Illinois].  And Bret Harte was the University of Chicago's campus and was very integrated.  And they were very liberal, you know, through the '60's [1960s] and, you know, it was the late, this is the late '60's [1960s] where '69 [1969], '70 [1970].  And with, you now, it's the height of the Vietnam War.  There were protests.  I remember all the, you know, how, you know, and it's really funny as a kid, you think your world is how the whole world is.  And we had a really colorful, you know, neighborhood.  And the kids on the block, it's so funny to see what some of them are doing.  Now, (unclear) is a correspondent on CNN now, who was a few doors down.  Some are in PR [public relations].  And then, and where all these kids who--what kind of things that they grew up to go into.  And even though we lived across the street or a block away from the lake, you know, we had parks.  We're at 53rd and Hyde Park Boulevard.  We had parks, you know, in every catty-corner and direction and museum.  Where we played most often was the alley, you know, just the, the alley between, you know, being in the back of the house.
Speaker 1: Being surrounded by all that park, land, and culture and the lake and all, you, you all played in the alley.
Speaker 2: Alley.  And we played, we used the parks definitely, but the majority, we were out, everybody played in the alley.  And it's glass always, and, you know, rode our bikes and jumped the Evel Knievel and did everything, you know, in that, that back alley.  I remember in '72 [1972] the first, and real first wakeup that I didn't live in--the rest of the world wasn't like Hyde Park which is this really liberal, very integrated.  There was--we were the only black family from, both parents were black on the street.  But since Hyde Park was one of the few vestiges where an interracial couple could live, and not get rocks thrown at them in Chicago in that time.  Hyde Park, we had several integrated, you know, mixed couples on our block.  That was normal.  That was actually more normal than, you know, there were synagogues on three different corners.  So, it was a very, very ethnically kind of diverse and intellectual 'cause there were people.  The younger people, the people in their twenties were in grad school in our building, and it was a very--because of the influence of the campus.
Story_ID: 119670
Speaker 1: I remember as I walked to school, I, and in sixth grade, every, every window almost--I remember counting on every window on the way to school.  It was about three blocks, three and a half blocks away--had a [George Stanley] McGovern poster in it.  And I remember actually feeling sorry for this poor guy, [President Richard Milhous] Nixon, 'cause everybody hated him so much.  And people talked about him so bad and not that I knew anything about his policy, but it was just clear that he was, there was--I didn't know and never met a single person that, you know, supported him.  And we had an election in our school and it was 499 to one.  We had 500 kids exactly, and 499 to one--McGovern to Nixon.
Speaker 2: It was '72 [1972], right?
Speaker 1: In '72 [1972].  And the one kid who voted for Nixon, this kind of chubby kid--it gets leaked out.  And he got beat up after school because not a single kid knew anything about what politics, what anybody stood for.  But he got--and one of the teachers had said, oh, well, the TV cameras, you know, we're going to come down if it was--we might, had been a story if the school had went up 500 to 0.  And, you know, oh, because there's this one vote and it's pretty still newsworthy, but there was a rumor that went around, like this one kid blew--they weren't beating him up because of the fact that he voted for Nixon, but that he blew this TV op for everybody to be on TV.  And so, I remember, you said, fast forwarding to the election night and you know, that was the last--I think McGovern won one state or something like that.  And it was--I remember it was the Time magazine cover said, it's a landslide.  I was like, man, this was like, whoo, I live in a foreign place, you know, that, that every place is not like, you know, Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], which I found out I was in very, very quickly, as I started going outside of Hyde Park.
Story_ID: 119671
Speaker 1: But it was a, it was a, you know, remarkable place to grow up.  I mean, we still, you know, had the throwbacks to, you know, in this sort of growing up in the late '60s [1960s], even early '70s [1970s], throwbacks to people who came through the streets to sharpen knives, and do these things that you think of, you know, from fifty years earlier, kind of depression type of professions of older people came through who are, you know, craftsmen and things like that.  But it was clearly, you know, a--to the future kind of a, you know, you know, always sort of future focused environment with everybody, you know, sort of being in college or going to college or, you know, college graduates and lot of grad degrees.
Story_ID: 119672
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there's a photograph of you behind us at Christmas time sitting on a piano--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --in your birthday suit, very happy to play the piano it looks like, or to check out your birthday presents.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, what's the story behind this photograph?
Speaker 2: I, you know, it's, I don't remember that picture.  And that's my son on the lower right there.  But the--I know, I just know that, you know, I don't remember the picture being taken 'cause that was Christmas, a picture from Christmas morning than it's actually a picture that's in color, that, when my mother [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] blew that up, they couldn't blow the picture up in color although at, at that point.  And she blew it up (unclear) when I was in--I started grad school, and gave me as a present.  And they, I--it was, you know, it was a Christmas morning picture 'cause all the toys are, you know, laying around.  And, obviously, it was like it's happy to have the, you know, the piano which is something I've always sort of been a music junkie in my entire life.  And, you know, from the earliest sort of memories I've been through, have been playing, you know, records and, you know, sort of living, you know, really, and being taken away by music.
Story_ID: 119673
Speaker 1: What kind of music first--do you remember first caught your attention?
Speaker 2: Early songs I can remember--I mean, are like the Fifth Dimension like 'Up, Up and Away.'  I think it was--must been like in kindergarten or something when that came out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like '67 [1967], '68 [1968], I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was, and I was still on Wentworth.  I remember that being like one of my, you know, sort of favorite songs and being real excited about it.  And blues and I, and as a little kid, I loved classical music, and I used to have a conductor stick.  And I would stand there and play these classical records and this music for kids like the 'Peter and the Wolf', you know.  I remember having that and it would scare, still scare the, you know, life out of me.  And, you know, I liked, you know, the music of the '60s [1960s] as well like the Beatles.  I was, you know, a big, big, big fan.  I was a little kid.  And, you know, from James Brown to, you know, I was just starting to get more and more conscious about music.  The person that really, you know, took my head off, though, as a kid was like Stevie Wonder.  And, you know, from like, you know, from the 'Music of My Mind' through '71 [1971] and 'Innervisions', and I mean, I wore those, the grooves out of those records.  In fact, it was, you haven't done nothing back to sort of the Nixon, McGovern short time to realize that certain of my political education started coming from, like a Stevie Wonder as well.  But Stevie and Marvin [Gaye] and later, Parliament, and Funkadelics and the, but also Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin and, you know, those bands in the '70s [1970s].  I mean, I just, I've always had a ravenous, you know, appetite for music on all, you know, every, every type.  I just always said there's two types of music, and there's good, good stuff and bad stuff.  And so, you know, that's just the, you know, how I'm really should have been from day one.
Story_ID: 119674
Speaker 1: Now, were you playing--did you learn how to play the piano when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I learned, you know, almost little, probably by ear, for the most part about that age.  My mother [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] put me in some lessons that didn't last a long time.  But the lady, Mrs. Baker, was probably a great teacher and I was--but I know I'm not a great student.  And I got lazy and she used to rap our fingers if we didn't have it there right, so I never learned how to read music or anything.  And I, you know, it was so easy to do by ear.  It was the--it just seemed like a silly process.  I wish I had done it.  I still don't know how to read now, but the--I've always just been, been able to sitting down, and, and play by ear.
Story_ID: 119675
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about grade school and I don't--you went to Bret Harte [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Bret Harte--
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --which is a great, again, super diverse, you know.  It really was a, you know, an idyllic, you know, grammar school.  It was a public school, but there was a lot of, you know, interested, educated parents through the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and things like that, that when the parents, the parents were really involved in the school.  I was a classic--in trouble, pretty much the--almost the whole time I went there.
Speaker 1: Now, what got you in trouble?
Speaker 2: Ugh, it's just, you know, the talking in class, restless, and grades.  If it weren't for, you know, from really from the point, I, 'cause I used to believe when I was a kid, before Bret Harte, I thought that you couldn't be there.  There were two types of kids.  There were the kids that were like really good in sports and, you know, and cool, and played out in the world and everything, and the ones that were good in school.  And in first and second grade, 'cause my mother [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] taught me to read when I was three years old, and I, when I went by--I got, the time I got to grammar school, I was so way, way ahead of the average kid learning sort of A, B, C's--and not A, B, C's--but, you know, how to write and put sentences together that I was a little teacher's pet, kind of, in the first grade and second grade just because of my education.  When I made the switch to Bret Harte and I hung out over the summer, and was good in sports and playing of sports, I was like, oh, I think, and subconscious, like I'm like, okay, I'm one of those kids, because, you know, that played all the time.  And I didn't think about school for the years and was always in, always in trouble, and giving my parents, you know, complete fits.  And parent-teacher conference night was always the, the worst, worst day of the year 'cause I would always, you know, then my parents would come home and I'd be, you know, grounded and punishment after the, you know.  Just more of a class clown and, and, you know, just goofing around.  There was a teacher, Mrs. Harlow [ph.], I had in the seventh grade that kinda, who was a wonderful teacher and kind of really made the, you know, a switch, but it was the standardized tests that were the wake-up call.  And I think that Bret Harte teachers had pretty much written me off as, oh, you know, little silly little guys and everything, you don't pay that much attention and he's not that smart or something's wrong with him.  I'm sure, like it went like a classic ADD [attention deficit disorder], you know, kind of like I see the kids and they were just like, you know, bouncing all over the place.  And the, the standardized test came in.  I think it was like sixth grade or seventh grade.  But I scored on like--and it went up to twelve, like, you know, we were--if you had a 9.0 and grade, it meant you were at the ninth grade, you know, level.  And I think pretty much in all of the grades, I was--the highest it went was 12.0, which is the senior level.  And it was like a big wake-up call at the school--I remember being called down to the principal's office.  And I thought, oh, God, I'm, you know, I'm just familiar being down there (laughter).  And a guy had a completely different attitude and the teachers had a different attitude.  And word had gotten out that I had, had this 12.0 on all these tests.  And it was almost like, oh, you know, flash bulletin, he's not an idiot, you know, he's obviously--something there.  And as the teachers started with that realization--I'm, oh, God, you know, treat you different and expect more of you 'cause if they expect you to be silly, and let you just like waste my time.  That was a complete 180 degree turnaround.  And, actually, as I'd gotten in seventh, it's seventh or eighth grade when they was trying to send me to high school.  I remember getting called down the principal's office again.  And they were like, look, we don't think, you know, your, you got these, you know, tests have been exceptional in all these areas.  You shouldn't go to a public grammar--you--we don't think you should go to a public high school, that you should go someplace, you know.  I was like, yeah, again, these are the same people who wanted to, you know, pretty much lock, lock me up, you know, half the time, but that was a real big turnaround actually.
Story_ID: 119676
Speaker 1: So, where did they suggest that you go?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I don't remember how the suggestions or where it came up.  I ended up going--I remember my parents [Nancy Money Clarke McKeever and HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.] doing some research on schools.  I remember they want, they thought the best place academically was St. Ignatius [High School, Chicago, Illinois] on 12th Street.  And I remember, luckily, I was, I was lucky if we might have that conversation for--with my--the, the teachers were all--it is a good thing for you to do.  And my other alternative, if I went to a public school is Kenwood [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And at the time, at Kenwood, all the guys at Kenwood had to swim nude.  They was some city law where, in public, you know, schools through this period, (laughter) that--I think it was something about the--their bathing suits got bad and people didn't take care of them.  So (laughter), all our gym class, I, I still laugh with friends who were there.  All the, all the gym classes at Kenwood were nude bathing.
Speaker 1: That's something that happened--I mean, there was something--I knew my brother who's seven years older--well, he was born in '42 [1942].  That's the way they swam in the Dayton Public Schools and, and at some point, it stopped, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At some point, I guess in the early '70s [1970s], they stopped doing that, but the--certain schools all over the country then and I don't know why.
Speaker 2: Even then, they were still going on in the, yeah, this was, this was have been sort of--
Speaker 1: I wondered why when I was in school so whatever--
Speaker 2: Oh, and that happened to you?
Speaker 1: Well, at one school.  I moved--when I switched schools, it, it wasn't (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, we, we used to hear high school loomed for us at Bret Harte [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] was all about, 'cause we'd hear about people who got toweled in the groin and all of the stuff that went on.  And it was, it was almost like, you know, the boogie man, this whole idea of going to this high school in, in, you know, (laughter), jumping around nude and, and swimming.  And there's all kinds of terrible stories with the stuff that went on there.  I'm sure that's the only reason I would fight tooth and nail about the idea of going to St. Ignatius or going to another high school, but I could like, really couldn't stand the idea of Ignatius when they, they--my parents told me it was an all boys school, you know, I was like ugh.  And it was like, I wanted to go to this all boys' school that seems like it's nerd you know, city, that's what I thought about before I went there, and it was pretty much true.  But the--or go to this Kenwood, where, you know, and so, that was, I think, almost escape from the--getting toweled, you know, in painful areas by the older kids that, you know, all we had (unclear) stored in plate fights and all this other stuff.  But I don't know where the idea of St. Ignatius came from, but that's eventually where I end up going to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119677
Speaker 1: How did you like St. Ignatius [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Now, this is your first experience in a Catholic School, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, I, I was scared the first year, first semester, because we were so far behind the other kids who had gone to Catholic School.  And I thought that I had, you know, with my mother, had this great education which is true, and it was read and it had, you know.  But they had all had when we--algebra was our first taste, sort of like, you know, high school kind of math.  And every other kid who had gone to grammar school had been through algebra already.  And so, it was clear I was like, whoo, and they all had--so many of them had had Latin in grammar school.  And some of them had French, and so things that we just didn't have in public school were--it was like a complete shock to the system.  And so, I remember working pretty hard initially.  I came fairly quickly to really dislike Ignatius in the sense--while I had good relationships, I had friends.  One, I think there were twelve of us, nine or twelve from my high school that went there.  And they kicked out the lowest percentage in every grade, in every--and it was always sort of the black table, and Ignatius was, you know, it would start off, each class would be like two or three tables.  And by the time of graduation through attrition, it would be very small.  I was the only kid from my high school that went there and started, and actually graduated.  And, but my resentment about the school really came from the disdain they had at the times, it's definitely not that way now, but for the arts.  There's not a single music--I was a music--again, my whole life was about music and, you know, sort of artistic expression in that way.  The only art-related class St. Ignatius had, at the time, was a one art class and which, which the teacher--I didn't get along with at all, who had a very regimented view of what art is supposed to be.  It's almost like a coloring book kind of art--fill in the lines and if you go outside the line and, you know, you're, you're bad.  And no, no music class--idea that was, was insane, the whole idea, having taken up your time 'cause the whole school was geared towards college and doing well on the PSAT's and SAT's and the ACT's, you know, all that, you know, material, which is a real kind of drill sergeant, fairly strict, you know, environment.  I also didn't like the uniforms.  It was not uniforms, but had to wear a collared shirt and no jeans and no gym shoes.  That was sort of the rule so, you know.
Speaker 1: It wasn't exactly a uniform but it was--
Speaker 2: It wasn't a uniform, but it was a code--
Speaker 1: There's a code.
Speaker 2: --right.  And, then, obviously, when you just, you know, really discover girls, the whole idea of going to a school where there's no girls, where it's like--let me get out of here so, you know, as fast as you can.  But, yeah, but it was the art, it was really the attitude they had about the arts.  And even as a kid in high school, my mother was always a big proponent of art and arts, and how important that is.  And I, you know, I used to think that, you know, what--is it just like how important music is to any kid in high school where you're defining yourself and you're learning, and music is your--one of your most important tools of expression.  I always thought that the--it was funny that the music is one thing that actually made people feel good, and how important is that, that music can--I could be sad and music can make me feel better, or I'd have to go in my room, put on my headphones and get transformed, you know, transported someplace else.
Story_ID: 119678
Speaker 1: Well, when you were in high school [St. Ignatius High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you get involved in some of the usual high school activities or clubs and--
Speaker 2: I ran cross-country.  I played hockey, oddly enough, which is very odd for a black kid in Chicago [Illinois], but anywhere, it's in a hockey player--I mean, a good friend there.  Worked really, because I got a job at an ice skating rink in Chicago on the South side, Lake Meadows.  And ran track a little.  But more than anything, it was sort of cross-country at the first part, first couple of years.  And, you know, the ground between junior and senior, between sophomore and junior years, also like when really discovering, you know, girls and stuff, that I couldn't get of school, you know, fast enough.  So, I don't think I probably had--I don't remember if I had any extracurricular activities there, especially, you know, when I--and a driver's license.  I might not have a car or anything but, you know, I was, I was out of there pretty quick (laughter), pretty quickly.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a girls' school nearby someplace or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I actually was going out--I guess when I was a junior--junior, I started going out with a girl that, in college, who was (laughter) completely got--she used to come by the University of, the University of Illinois [Chicago, Illinois].  Our campuses were real close, and just come by and swoop, and pick me up and, you know, from there so.  Well, you know, school was, you know, kinda out of the question, and they at least thinking or dealing about it.  I'm--at least for extracurricular stuff.
Story_ID: 119679
Speaker 1: Now, did you--were you a good student [at St. Ignatius High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was--first year, I was a good student.  I think sort of last year when I knew it was sort of a good time to button down for college.  I think in between there, I was like, you know, all right, you know, or not nothing really exceptional.  And, again, I was--really did not like being--I really liked some of my teachers there and had some good relationships, you know, an amazing social studies teacher named Mr. Ryan.  And I mean, it's some really--there are some exceptional, dedicated teachers in the many different areas.  But again, I was so anti-system, especially with the way the attitudes of the school was about the things that I loved.  I really wasn't, you know, really highly into the school on any level.  You know, what I wanted to do is--I realized, when I was like fifteen, I wanted to be in the music business.  So, my whole sight was that school was almost holding me back from finding out or learning or dealing with anything on, you know, music on that level.
Story_ID: 119680
Speaker 1: How did you first become interested in music, in the music business?  A lot of people like music, listening to music, but how did you start thinking of it as a business and--
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.  I was always interested in business.  As a kid, I always had this kind of lemonade stand.  I had a camera.  I used to take pictures of people in the front of the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois].  And to have like thirty-five cents, and I'd take your picture and mail you the picture.  I had a shoe sign, I think.  I had--I'd gotten a little 8 millimeter [8mm] video camera and projector, and I would have--I got the [Muhammad] Ali-[George]Frazier fight.  And I would charge to come down and watch the fight, twenty-five cents, you know.  It's like an early--I guess, pay-per-view.  And I always was interested in business.  I always, I had these little business ideas, and I'd--we could start this up, so it was the business, you know, aspect was always pretty, just natural of--and I think, I was just fascinated by it.  And I also thought this business that created things like what's going on in the Marvin Gaye's classic album and Stevie Wonder's material, and all these things that were just so incredible that this business was the most noble business that there was.  I was just clueless about how the business really, you know, turned out to be, but I thought this business that created such wonderful fruits and flowers, and these things that made people feel good and things that Stevie used to teach me so much about life and, you know, Earth, Wind and Fire.  And, oh, I was a huge, huge, huge Earth, Wind and Fire fan.  It was the first concert I ever went to go see.  And the, you know, philosophical statements that they would make, and in all of their songs from, you know, where there was, you know, get 'Shining Star' or, you know, 'That's the way of the World', and, you know, all were sort of philosophies that I started adopting as, as true, almost like a religion of--this is how the world works.  This is--karma work this way and things that I would see, you know.  And they really would confirm things that my grandmother would say like, what goes around comes around, would be translated into a song brilliantly by Earth, Wind and Fire, for example.  And so, the idea of how the records were made, I was always interested in the musician side, and but how the records were made and put out--I just had a fascination about.  The idea of going into the music business, even as far back as high school, kind of freaked my parents out.  And it was always education, education, education.  And the music business, at that point, wasn't looked at as a business.  It's, you know, it's an easy thing to sort of talk about now, the music business.  And people look at it or realize it's a, you know, multibillion dollar business and the entertainment business here is our second biggest export.
Story_ID: 119681
Speaker 1: Now, in those days, I suppose black folks were mostly the talent and hardly ever the--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --business executives.
Speaker 2: --never.  I mean, well, not who they were.  I mean, there was--I would see examples like [HM] Berry Gordy and [Dick] Griffey.
Speaker 1: Did you know about him?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I knew about him--
Speaker 1: Dick Griffey and Berry Gordy--
Speaker 2: --I knew, yeah, knew about them.  But where, I didn't know how you'd start a record company out of that.  So I, you know, I think it was like '75 [1975] or something, I saw--'70 [1970] or '76 [1976]--I saw an article on David--I can't think of his last name [sic, David McCoy Franklin].  He's a lawyer in Atlanta [Georgia] who represented Richard Pryor and Earth, Wind and Fire, and some pretty major--all the biggest, these sort of clients, black stars at that time.  And, and he was the big, he was a big entertainment attorney.  And the first time I'd ever heard of that term and phrase, and I remember reading this article.  It was like, boop--that's what I'm going to be because that was going to my way into the business.  In Chicago [Illinois], I had no clue how to get into the music business or how do you do it, or what do you do?  So, I said, look--this way, I'm going to be able to appease my parents on one side, and I will be, you know, 'cause I was interested in the law.  My dad [HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.] went to law school at night when I was in second grade.  And he graduated then I was in the sixth grade.  So, for four years, I saw that process.  He would sit with me sometimes and read law, these, you know, law books.  He asked me to read this case or read this story, and it was like, you know--first, this was gobbledy gook, you know, in that he would, he had this huge Black's Law Dictionary, and like if I didn't know what perpetuity meant, he would say, you know, see, oh, this means forever.  So, I would read the sentence as a, and substitute forever with that concept--oh, it all made sense.  So, it was almost like in a little different language.

Speaker 1: I can't remember the, the thought I guess, specifically, but I know it's some of my dad [HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.], you know, sort of being around him, and sort of the law, and about being what's fair.  And I had the experience of being around the recording studio, PS Recording Studios around this time, a little later in high school.  I was in the reserve, probably somewhere discovering--saw, there was one recording studio in Chicago [Illinois] that a friend of my mother's got married to the owner of, so I got a chance to tour.  And I saw that these were from the 'Fire' cut, and Ramsey Lewis cut all of his records down there and--
Speaker 2: PS Recordings Studio--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Chicago?
Speaker 1: In Chicago.
Speaker 2: Where was it?
Speaker 1: On like 23rd Street.  It was next to this place called Sauer's, a restaurant--
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --and, and it was like in the '70s [1970s].  The hot, hot spot for drum tracks.  Peabo Bryson cut his album there.  The 'Feel the Fire,' his first album.  Earth, Wind and Fire said they do a lot of stuff around the studio.  And the Jackson Five cut some demos in there and it was just a beacon for R&B.  It was like the beehive.
Story_ID: 119683
Speaker 1: And I really got to see that there was this huge need being around the studio and talking to some of the heroes.  Oh, you were talking about how they were mostly African Americans, were mostly the entertainers, the talent--
Speaker 2: The talent, right, not the--
Speaker 1: --but not the, not the, you know, sort of behind the scenes as much.  And those, a lot of the people in that studio were discouraged.  I said, I want to be an entertainment lawyer.  They like, what are you going to do when you grow up?  Oh, I'm going, I want to be an entertainment lawyer.  I'm going to do this and I'm going to be in the business.  And they would--the blacks, they would discourage me, like, oh, you'll never know power in this business because of the dearth of African Americans in, on the business side.  My mom [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] had always said to me by age five, six--I mean, I'm tiny, like you, we talk about how the Greeks had the restaurants and had a sort of a--had to almost come together and taking over industry.  And now, Italians have designed and clothing, and the--and, and how there's a reason that different, like a lot of Chinese immigrants did laundromats and then, you know, put a foothold in certain takeover industries.  And then, her theory was that the Africans and African Americans were born as natural storytellers.  That was her tradition of preserving--doing what you're doing here right now--preserving history and by telling, telling of stories and being entertainers and, and the whole, you know, every American, you know, entertainment, especially every music, American music phenomena, has come from the African American experience and translated some of those artists you were talking about earlier, like Elvis Presley.  And those things are obviously, you know, mainstreamed versions of what was coming out of sort of the black communities.  And because the, these, our experience as African Americans were the seeds that, which, grew the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and rock and roll in general and, and so much about the entertainment business that this should be our business.  So, the whole idea, she never discouraged, like the whole concept of the entertainment business as a business.  And, in fact, the contrary was that we, as African American people, should be really playing a role because she also understood how important the images were, and what kind of lasting effect.  When she was a kid, she thought Africa was run by Tarzan, and that the black people in Africa were buffoons, you know, who threw spears and still wore, even as a, you know, in the '50s [1950s] when she was going to school, you know, loin cloths.  And because of the images that she is, that she saw, the Stepin Fetchit images, and those other images that she saw growing up, were really powerful and persuasive, pervasive actually, and, and we would fight.  I remember going to 'Star Wars' with her and, you know, at the time, technologically, and it was just a great story and the--it was special effects, you know, that no one had ever seen like that in a movie.  You talk about a movie just completely took you away.  I think we went like opening day, not really anticipating, you know, early on, and went to the whole--as a family.  And I remember walking down away from the theater.  And my sister and I, and even my dad [HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.], went like, wow, that was the great, you know, we had just seen this great movie and this new experience when the credits are rolling up.  And my mother [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever] was cursing, and she was like, "So there's supposed to be no black people in the future."  And she only could focus on the fact that we had been to this whole movie, and nobody was black.  She was pissed off.  She was going to write letters and she was really upset, and it was almost worse that we didn't see that, that she knew had some type of an effect.  And we were real excited, so, anyway, didn't mean this long story, but the, the notion of doing this is important work in carrying images and messages out to the community.  At least, my mother always, you know, really understood as being a real important, you know, thing in the community.  And because of that type of encouragement and appeared, I always had a real desire to do that, to sort of, you know, to, and, and I--it's--I always thought I had great, you know, sort of taste in music or, you know, everybody thinks, you know, music is obviously, that their music is good taste, but could tell things before, oh, this is going to be a hit.  This is not--this is what's, what's going to happen and following careers and, but just didn't really know how to sort of navigate to, to the industry.
Story_ID: 119684
Speaker 1: Now, had you met Oscar Brown Jr. at all?
Speaker 2: No, I may, may have met him loosely.  His daughter, Maggie, we, we were in class together at the University of Illinois [at Urbana-Champaign in Champaign, Illinois], and so, we did things where we either performed--I was in a band down there.  I was a DJ at the University of Illinois.  My major was independent plan of study major and entertainment pre-law, so I was so zoned and focused that this is the route I was going to do.  David Franklin was the lawyer that I forgot his name, but I saw the article in Ebony.  And, and so, I knew Maggie and I knew her father was, you know, who he was, kind of, but I didn't really know him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Carl Davis in Chicago [Illinois]?  Did you ever meet Carl Davis?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  There were a few--I mean, there were, there were just a couple of people--I think everyone doing something like that, you know, that a lot came across, you know, but...
Story_ID: 119685
Speaker 1: So, so you were hanging out at the recording studio--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago [Illinois] when you were in high school [at St. Ignatius High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like late high school and definitely in early college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so around that time, Chicago Fest was coming around to, so we do things in our band I was in one summer--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: --I had the gig there and--
Speaker 1: --so you graduate in '78 [1978]--I'm sorry right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I, when I, I had a--I've, in the, in the studio, well, at least an environment around people who were professionals, I became like the jailhouse attorney for because I had read this one book called--(unclear) my dad [HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.] had a book in his office called 'This Business in Music'.  'Cause at one point, I guess he was talking to war (unclear) as a possible client to be is a--it was an accountant, he was an accountant.  And I picked this book up.  I worked there one summer in high school and I read this book.  And so, I knew, you know, a tiny bit about the business from reading this one book.  And either that tiny bit was a lot bit more than what a lot of people who knew who were in the business, because of knowing what the word perpetuity was, which was all in these contracts, and when people would, you know, have their publishing, you know, somebody would try to get their publishing from, or something like that.  I ended up reading some of these things.  Oh, it looks like what they're saying is you're going to--they want you, they're going to give you $500 dollars, and you're going to get the rights to your song forever.  And we're like, oh, thanks, kid, you know, like, whoa, that sounds like this is--they're ripping you.  I didn't really know what the parameters were, what's a good deal, but I could, I wasn't intimidated by contracts or written word just from the environment I had in my house.
Story_ID: 119686
Speaker 1: So, I was hanging out, and I got great experiences there and combined with the stuff I was doing in college, which was, you know, booking these concerts and being around, you know, all these--this music.  And I had my own music series at the time that it was--
Speaker 2: You had on to college campus--
Speaker 1: On the college campus.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then, and in being a DJ.
Speaker 2: Who did you bring in?
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, we--at the time, the school--I was on this thing called this Illinois Student Unit.  And I was on the Student Union Board.  And I was in charge of music, and I had a small budget to do these like coffee house things, and I can't think of--it's so funny.  I want to go back to get the papers out of time 'cause there are the reviews and the series.  I got the, at the end of the series, I got a great review.  It was like no name mentioned for me, but the--had somebody at the paper recognize as these eclectic, you know, groupings of the type of music that I brought in.  And, and but on the big stage, the, the Illinois--I can't think of the name of the organization that ran the huge--at the Illini at the auditorium, you know--had from Chaka Khan, and who didn't show up actually.  But the--like Narada Michael Walden, Earth, Wind and Fire, Bruce [Springsteen], Billie Joel.  I think there was Bruce Springsteen--what's, I can't think of some of the rock bands that--Sammy Hagar.  It came in, in front of like the band as he opened for--
Speaker 2: Was it Van--not Van Halen or--no.
Speaker 1: No, he wasn't a Van Halen at the time.  He was--
Speaker 2: I'm not of my own, but I'm (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, he, he opened for Van. I'm trying to think of what the rock band that was, that he opened, he opened for, but it was, it was, this, this is a big campus, 36,000 students, so we had big concerts there on the way from like St. Louis [Missouri] and Chicago [Illinois] --these, a lot of these bands stop through Illinois.  And so, you know, I was able to get involved--I remember like the Chaka show.  (Unclear) Chaka, I think it was--it was Rufus and Chaka, Narada Michael Walden, and trying to get the--it was a headliner that, that show, but then, we had amazing--
Speaker 2: But you had a chance to participate in the negotiations for these people and what kind of contract--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, and help out 'cause I was doing some of the stuff dealing with the agents, especially with small bands.  And I was involved in the radio station and everything there, and that experience of really playing like the big leagues and talking to real people, we used to go to this booking--once or twice a year we went.  We'd go to like the boonies in Chicago [Illinois].  We stayed in the hotel, and we'd look at bands and this, like travelling road show of bands--we're trying to get booked from colleges.  I loved that experience and, in fact, I really helped pick--(unclear) helped me decide on where I went to grad school 'cause I couldn't decide where I was gonna go to grad school in the worst way.
Story_ID: 119687
Speaker 1: And I had gotten in, I did really well on the LSATs, and had the opportunity to go to pretty much all the, you know, schools that was in the, like in the 90 percentiles for that.  And as an African American kid at that time, especially the time when, you know, I think, affirmative action was in a full swing.  It was a real--got pretty heavily recruited by having this, you know, really high LSAT score, and actually higher than most of the, you know, the white counterparts that I went to law school with.  And the--I had a, you know, from--let's see, established [ph.], had my eye set on going out to the West coast, and coming out to Stanford [University, Stanford, California] or UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] or Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California] just to be until--I was thinking about being in California.  I came out to visit Stanford, which was an amazing program--Stanford paid for to come look at the school and sent a ticket.  And it was like, you know, unbelievable when I was sitting there, you know, freezing in Champaign.  And it was so beautiful and I was headset on going to the West Coast.  And my dad [HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.] was having a heart attack 'cause, you know, I'd gotten into Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and the idea that I would pass that opportunity up.  But to be in something that he couldn't dream about at the time just opportunity-wise was, yeah, beyond him.  I mean, he was walking around almost like clutching his heart.  I think that, that was--we, my family went to Africa that summer, which was a sort of fulfillment of my mother's lifelong dream to go.  And it was supposed to be our last trip as a family 'cause you know, we were growing up, and I learned that all, in all these countries, if you went up and down the West Coast, then I would say like what are you doing when you get back, or I'm going to go to law school.  Oh, great, where are you going to go?  And I'd say, I want to go to Stanford or Berkeley or, or something, I said.  And (unclear), and maybe there's a chance of me, you know, I'd still have Harvard open as a--and we're all--Harvard.  And I would--all these have met African, you know, you know, state officials and people in government.  And so many of them, and one across, halfway across the world, everybody reacted the same way like hmm, Berkeley--I'm not so sure where that is or, you know, big schools and famous, you know, schools with huge rankings and, you know.  And Stanford is just as--almost as prestigious, I guess, as the school, but in Africa, and these small places, I didn't know what it was, but I was amazed that everybody knew what Harvard was.  And it--we had a big effect.  It's like, 'cause everybody's like, oh, wow, that's amazing.  And then I met alumni when I was in Africa, who had studied overseas, and we're now running countries and running banks and these things.  And so, when I came back, it had a big effect, and I remember seeing this thing with the Harvard Law School Forum.  There was an organization that was described in the brochure of Harvard titled with some of the extracurricular activities in the packet that they had.  And it was about how that they had [Fidel] Castro and [President John F.] Kennedy as speakers, and it's a very prestigious speakers' program.  And I'd seen very similar to what I did at University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Illinois], so one of the first things I did when I got to school was when, you know, looked for a way to get into the forum.
Story_ID: 119688
Speaker 1: When I did the forum [Harvard Law School Forum], I--when I got there, there were only seven students participating in the forum.  And the speakers were really small, you know, gatherings like the nuclear disarmament person wrote a book where they would have the coming campus--I mean, thirty, twenty-five, thirty, I mean, real small.  And I had this whole idea about expanding it, and I ran on this like ticket.  I got there and I was just--the first year, just a member, and I ran on being the vice president of programming, but head of programming, so bring a person to decide on who you bring in and, and that relationship of bringing the speakers in.  And I--my whole ticket was I wanna meet Stevie Wonder, and I wanted to use the forum as like almost a joke.  I wanted to use the Forum to open up the doors.  And I--there was one kid on campus that had a word processor in one of the different entryway, but in my same dorm building.  And everything charged, you know, it's like a dollar a page.  Those are funny--to do letters.  And people use this guy--kid--for like, resumes for school to, to print out your resume and print out standard letters.  And we used him to do letters to speakers.  So, normally since these letters was a hand-typed letter that thirty, twenty invitations or some small amount went out--this year, we used the word processor.  We sent out 250 invitations.  And we sat there and had a meeting on who we'd ever want to meet, and we just went through who's who, like we were reading the phone book.  Say, oh, wow, this person seems interesting, oh, this person seems really, you know, and a lot of the famous names, obviously.  And I got messages and calls from like Frank Sinatra, and all sorts of people.  The White House calling my little, you know, home machine, 'cause it's election year, and like [John] Erlichman, and that calling my little apartment, you know, and people want to address the Forum like [Robert] Mugabe, heads of state.  And Harold Washington tried to bring up and (unclear) win an election.  It was--I mean, it was really an unbelievable experience because this Harvard letterhead, you know, as a kid, my apartment wasn't much bigger than this office.  And I was sitting there, you know, cranking these--some of these letters out to people.
Story_ID: 119689
Speaker 1: So, you were in programming heaven at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--I guess in terms of being able to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it was amazing--I mean, the access and the power of that letterhead, and the power of--opened up any door--I mean, pretty much, any, any door.  And to my huge surprise, I came back one day.  And I had a message on my answering machine from--and she's somebody in Chicago [Illinois] now.  She's very funny--Theresa Cropper.  Do you know Theresa?  She's at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].  Actually, she just left, going to a firm, but she was working with Stevie Wonder.  And so, she saw, she happened to be a lawyer herself.  And, but she was like--I don't know if she was running a lot of Stevie's campaign for the Martin Luther King holiday and a bunch of other things, and left Chicago, moved out to California to work for him, and in a pile of all the piles of requests of, you know, Stevie to come speak here, Stevie, to come to speak there.  She noticed that the, you know, Harvard had a very nice letterhead, the Harvard Law School letterhead and, and just blew on a phone call about the request.  And she says, opposed to send in the standard blow-off letter, we can't do it, or just not ignoring it, she want to--it's kind of just being courteous because of--she realized the prestige of the organization, 'cause in our letter, we talked about [Fidel] Castro addressed the, you know, law school forum.  And [President John F. Kennedy] had addressed the forum and this--we had this collection of tapes.  And [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had spoken at the Harvard Law School Forum, so it was a very prestigious, you know, place to, you know, come and address.  And it was (laughter)--it was kind of funny.  It's almost embarrassing to think now--I had, I then had a number to Stevie Wonder's offices.  And my biggest hero in life, he was again the person who taught me so much about life and philosophy and just everything--give me so much joy.  I called him every day, pretty much every day from October, and I think it was like '83 [1983] to March, every business day, '84 [1984], five days a week as part of my job almost.  If I got out of class, go to my place, and make my calls.  And I would call, and I got to know his assistant, Chris James, who was--became my assistant actually very funny.  Theresa became a good friend and it was basically this kid's going to drive me crazy.  And I got that to almost everybody in that, in his organization, where I finally got a date where he was going to come to the school, and Stevie came to the school.  And he--of all the wonderful speakers and people that we had, he was by far the most powerful, the most amazing.  And he not only gave a speech, but he performed and he--it was a week after Marvin Gaye had gotten shot and killed--and he spoke about guns.  And, but the biggest thing he talked about was responsibility, and how we had a responsibility as, you know, students here, with this type of education, to give back.  And it was such, such, just a wonderful, wonderful address.  And he, really from that point, I met him and got to know him.  And I was working with Big Brothers at the time in Boston.  And then, you know, got Theresa, and got hooked up into the Chicago's first celebration of the Martin Luther King holiday, working with him.  And so, I moved to California.  I only had one telephone number, you know.  Theresa was moving back to Chicago for that summer.  And when I moved out of here, I knew I had Stevie's telephone number at least, and people in his organization.  And so, I almost could trace back everybody I knew back then to him.  And he's just a great--sort of spoke in the middle of the wheel, as I came out here to do and worked as--in an entertainment law firm.
Story_ID: 119690
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I guess that was the highlight of your Harvard Law [School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] experience, I guess, without a doubt.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that's kind of an understatement.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, I mean he was--it had, with, you know, it changed so much for me.  It was so funny.  He's a very good friend now.
Speaker 1: Did you learn anything about Stevie Wonder that you didn't know before--I mean, you know, after, you know, talking to him, saw so much.  Did anything surprise you about him that you didn't--
Speaker 2: No.  That's actually pretty--I mean, there's some things I know now that would surprise me.  I wouldn't (laughter), I can embarrass him on, yeah, in, on, on tape of, on some, on some views.  But the--as a person and a spirit, it's funny I talked to him this morning.  And, yeah, so all I, and talk to him a while 'cause, oh, you've been out there trying to help change the world 'cause he was out campaigning for [John] Kerry for the last, you know, right up until election.  And, you know, his--what you hear in his music is who he is.  I mean, he's really just a, you know, the most remarkable spirits, and you meet him and he's, has an aura--people, you know, say all the time.  I remember I jumped on stage when--before he came to the forum, he came into Boston [Massachusetts] and performed.  And I got a front row ticket just by being there first.  And he asked for--he was singing 'Ebony and Ivory', he was getting ready to.  And he says, "I need some black and white up here, I need some people to understand."  What he meant was come up on stage.  I mean, I've never, you know, got, even as a performer, I'm still behind the scenes, and even when I was playing.  I jumped on the stage so fast.  And I'm--that's where I shook his hand and met him the first time.  And, you know, really, just some figure in my life as a mentor and a friend now that's--had to have a really remarkable, you know, influence, even before I ever met him.  So, it's actually very funny that we've been such good friends now for all this time.  I've known him now--it's twenty years.  And he's the godfather to my son, you know.  We work together at Motown.  He's been in here, and he's obviously played this piano here.  And he's hung out and talked to our interns and spent--I mean, he's just a, the person that you think that he is by listening to his music is that who's--that's who Steve is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard he'll show up in Detroit [Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --and pop up in black-owned restaurants and played the piano and sing--
Speaker 2: --oh, he's amazing.
Speaker 1: --for about an hour.  Then, he'll say good night and go, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, he's--that's, that's Stevie.  I mean, it really is, you know, the most, one of the most generous, you know, biggest heart-est people that you can imagine.  You know, but really (unclear), and that was, that experience led to that.
Story_ID: 119691
Speaker 1: Now, any other of these figures have--did any others have a big effect-- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I, I mean, I remember so many.  I mean, we were sitting down and eating dinner with Phil Donahue to, you know, sort of polarizing figures, like Caspar Weinberger to, you know, you know, the speakers that we had that year to--brought to Harold Washington to the--actually, it was the sort of the Kennedy School just won against Bernard Epton.  And we had, you know, really just sort of--it was remarkable.  I mean, we got--every person I met, it was, you know, pretty amazing.  I got a chance to go to dinner, and just got this glimpse of this much bigger world.  And it was, but what it really did was teach this lesson that, you know, nothing is kind of impossible, you know, 'cause you would think it, you know, a twenty-two year old kid to be in, you know, picking up--I'd go, I was, you know, go to the airport and pick up whoever we're, you know, bringing in, and go to dinner before the speech, and you know.  It was this thing where almost anything and after, sort of getting to know Stevie [Wonder], and help him do things with him, and flying to Chicago [Illinois], and helping put this event together, like going where our talent that opened up, was the emcee for the night was Oprah Winfrey where she was the host of Chicago, you know, AM Chicago, and going to the set where they've been doing all these things.  It was just being around and, and being around and joking--let's go.  We got snowed in, in Chicago, so it's like, let's go to the movies in Water Tower Theatres.  And, you know, those--it was just wonderful, sort of eye-opening things about, and creating things and ideas that would come out.  You know, it was a real influence and he obviously a real direct influence on the desire to do what I'm doing right now.
Story_ID: 119692
Speaker 1: Now, how did you know, when did you finish your degree at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: In '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, after '85 [1985], I came out here.  Actually, but I did my last year at, at Harvard at Berkeley [University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, California] in an exchange program, and then came down to California after the bar--I mean, came down to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] after the bar.  And I started--the, the--came down to Los Angeles in 1980, in '80 [1980], yeah, end of '85 [1985].  After taking the bar, I started at Irell and Manella.  It's a firm, it's a major law firm in Century City in the entertainment department, and I was there for a couple of years.  And the department started to break apart with a partner leaving to Paramount Pictures and the head partner and things like that.  And I was trying, they were trying to figure out if the firm wanted me to stay.  And I got courted by a music firm in Santa Monica [California] and ended up going there.  It's like a second biggest, second or third biggest music practice in the country at the time.  We had a bunch, Randy Travis, and the Judge, and Crystal Gayle, but, you know, Kenny G, and a bunch of other action.  I was given a lot of responsibilities.  It was still a small boutique firm and realized that one, the client made me realize once in a series of questions when he asked me, how much is the record company going to get after I explained to him how much he got paid.  And I didn't know anything about how much marketing and how, what went into making a, you know, putting the record together, you know, from that standpoint.  And at the same time, I was--had discovered this comedian named Robin Harris who was a monster--a genius comedian, and had been, had this idea about doing like a black comedy label.  And Robin was going to be the first artist signed to it.  And I went to the same club for two years, and kept telling producers and everybody I knew, to that--this guy is going to blow up.  You should, you know, check him out, and the guy was still in the same club.  And so, after nothing seemed, nothing happened in his career, I finally approached him--this guy, Ronnie Tanksley [ph.], and he, about, I don't know him.  I've never done this before, but I think I knew what to do, and to get a, you get a record deal, and start his career in motion.  Ronnie's girlfriend was Robbie Reed, who is a big casting director--well, actually, she just starting.  We're all in our twenties, and she's working with Spike Lee.  And so, put him, and 'Do The Right Thing' and right before I got him signed as a--I went to PolyGram Records from Motown--I mean, (unclear) background--went to PolyGram Records from Mason, Sloane and Gilbert the law firm.  And got him a deal with PolyGram, where I was going to produce the album.
Story_ID: 119693
Speaker 1: And that was the first album I produced, and there was a, and we basically had a very small budget.  We actually did the whole album for like 17,000 bucks and, unfortunately, he passed away in the process while we were making the record.
Speaker 2: Who, Robin Harris?
Speaker 1: Robin did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but by that time, though, he had really, as you said, he blew up--
Speaker 1: Oh, he was--
Speaker 2: --really.  He had just--
Speaker 1: --he didn't have, it was just a big--there was just the start.
Speaker 2: --the tip of the iceberg.
Speaker 1: He was going to be the tip of the iceberg.
Speaker 2: He just finished 'Be-be's Kids,' the cartoon, I think?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, the cartoon didn't come out till much--didn't get produced till much after.  But the 'Be-be's Kids' was the album.
Speaker 2: But he, he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was, okay.
Speaker 1: He had the, he had the skit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And that's the album I produced was 'Be-be's Kids.'  He, you know, just unbelievable, you know, died at thirty-six, massive heart attack in Chicago [Illinois] where he's from.  And we--I mean, it was a tough, tough situation, and we ended up finishing the record.  I played the record on a Synclavier keyboard, because he was, as he died, it was, first a digital, putting a record together.  We were basically playing the record and, you know, piecing things together.  And I wanted the album to be the experience that he had--I mean, what it felt like to see Robin [Harris] live in concert.  And so, with that record, you know, the expectations of it were very low because, you know, it was an artist who had passed away.  And this was not--nothing was really going to happen here.  And, you know, we sold well over 400,000 records very quickly.  I mean, it was the number one record in L.A. [Los Angeles], and it was a huge sort of word of mouth phenomenon, and it wasn't like a lot of, you know, advertising and promotion around it.
Story_ID: 119694
Speaker 1: And from there, I met Jheryl Busby, the president of Motown, you know, right around the same time.  And it also had gotten sent over to Europe for a summer program through PolyGram for their executive fast track business.  So PolyGram was trying to promote me in some pretty big positions like head of black music--had me, you know, running a publishing division, doing all these things after coming back to this wonderful program, and Motown would, Motown was this wonderful dream for an entrepreneur 'cause it's still an entre-, it was still an independent company, one of the last independent companies.  Actually at the time, it was a few like A and M Island, you know, Motown, et cetera, Virgin, and was one of the--it was the first independent to sort of sell, one level.  I went there and became head of A and R [artists and repertoire] and the general manager, so I was in charge of this ridiculously, you know, historic roster with Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, and Stevie Wonder, the Temptations, but also had a chance to start my own company called Mo Jazz.  And that was really the thing that lured me to Motown, which was the idea if I could start my own company from scratch underneath the Motown umbrella.  And that was sort of an alternative jazz, a kind of eclectic kind of thing that sort of fit my taste.  And we started that from scratch at some--
Speaker 2: So, what kind of music did--would you--well, who was some of the artists that--
Speaker 1: At Mo Jazz, we had like Foley who's a Ohio--was it Dayton [Ohio] he was from?  No, Columbus, Ohio.  Funky, funky, funky played with Miles [Davis] to--Norman Brown was the first act I signed, a guitar player, who's still around now--it's actually making records.  Impromptu, the duet of J. Spencer; Terra Sul, a Brazilian band; Wayne Johnson; and a fairly eclectic instrumental, you know, sort of based, you know, larger--Norman Connors, has a record with, and, but as a--we were actually very profitable as, you know, 'cause our overhead was nothing.  It was me and an intern for the most part, you know, using the backdrop of Motown and all these other people from Motown participating and, you know, sort of helping with the process, but sort of dedicated to Motown.  It was a, just really one kid who worked with me initially.  And we did, you know, Norman Brown's record came out and sold--I think, 270,000 copies.  And the next one sold close to 500,000 copies, so it was a real, you know, expectations in the instrumental world is 15,000 copies.  That's a lot of records, you know--25,000, you're in the top part of the chart; 50,000 records, you're at the top of the chart.  So, we were, by sort of not taking the traditional approach to marketing in how we were doing things across the board.  It did really, really well.  Motown sold in '93 [1993], and things started to change quite a bit when PolyGram bought the company.
Story_ID: 119695
Speaker 1: And I really, really had been--had given up my entrepreneurial dreams on a couple of occasions where my first, my black comedy label--I thought, and the, secondly, this Mo Jazz, I kept the dream, but I did it for a major corporation.  And so, I really started to be fueled by this desire to do exactly what I'm doing now is to have an independent company in the start from scratch, and sort of breaking a lot of the rules that I thought would really work that the rest of the industry may not have been doing at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What kind of the things were those actually?
Speaker 1: I mean, just like one, the big one, the biggest things that fuels this company right now is our internship program.  I had a--the idea when I was at Motown, I wanted this big internship program at Motown.  And international, the president of the company got it, and understood it as a good idea, but the lawyers came in and got nervous, and human resources got nervous about it, and kind of shut the idea down.  And then, they asked me.  Of course, how are you going to organize it?  How are these people going to work for no money?  How is this going to happen--A, B, C, D?  And I didn't have any real good answers for it, you know, 'cause just working things out. You know, after we got rejected for a lot of good reasons that I couldn't really justify how it was all going to work 'cause it was this big idea.  But the mechanisms, you know, weren't there, but also, when the advent of the internet, and things started coming up, but thought that they were really wonderful, you know, oppor-, there were going to be opportunities for labels later.  And that eventually, it's going to be digital distribution, and then we were gonna be able to--music was going to be over the cable, I thought, like in the--when I was in law school.  I thought this was all going to, you know, you're going to be in business that you could push a button.  And I could make something and give you something without having to physically make more of them.  And I had, but was thinking that this day was going to come, and that whether it was going to be ten years from now or twenty years or thirty years from now, but you couldn't wake up thirty years later and say, wow, let's start this and not, you know, of a catalog, and have a situation that there would be a real opportunity for an independent company to do things very differently.  And one of those things was using this internship program as an engine, a fuel for marketing and getting the word out, et cetera.  And the--I, for the first things I did here when I started this company was to start this idea that I had ten years earlier, really about eight years earlier.  And, luckily, you know, sort of time had caught up, or technology caught up with the idea because all the things I couldn't answer very well at the time at Motown, the internet had provided the perfect answer for--how we're going to get in touch with a lot of people all at once, you know.  Email made that very easy--chats, internet chats, as far as communicating to fifty people at once having conversations, the internet made easy, posting work up, you know, on message boards, and having people--all the, you know, sharing music and, and pictures and images all became a very easy thing--not just in the country, but around the world.  And so, that was one of the sort of the many, many ideas that I kept thinking were, wow, the--and a major record company was a little slow to be, you know, adopted, but thought they could, you know, have a lot of success with it.  And that one, I'd been really, you know, fortunate to be right on.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 119696
Speaker 1: Now, where are we now?  Are we like close to where we started Hidden Beach or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's where--I mean--
Speaker 1: --at least (unclear) (simultaneous), okay.
Speaker 2: --that's where I left, I left Hidden--I left.  At the end of my stay of my contract at Motown had five years there that were pretty amazing, but really wanted to do something entrepreneurial from scratch.  And at that time, Motown was owned by a big corporation--PolyGram, actually, and wanted to start a lot of these ideas and test a lot of these ideas out.  I didn't know exactly what was going to be the first step--start a little production company, got good music initially, and signed an artist.  And that was actually now signed here, and then, I hooked up with [HM] Ramsey Lewis.  That's '96 [1996] and I started working, helping him out on some, some of his projects out of Chicago [Illinois], and helped him with this 'Legends of Jazz' radio show, which is now like eighty markets.  And, and I was thinking I really wanted to do this label, really wanted to do this record label.  And out of the clear blue sky, I got a call from this guy, Ron Williams, and picked up the phone.  And he says, "Michael Jordan is a big fan of yours, and he's been listening to all your records, and he would love to meet, to see, you know, wants to do something in the music business."  Ron and Charles Whitfield and this, you know, had this idea of, you know, for them to get in the music business, and to start this company, you know, because they had a relationship with Michael Jordan.  And Charles, who has worked at a record store, had sort of been going through bins and, you know, was a real music jockey.  He had found my name on record after record that he liked apparently and said, well, his brother told him if you're going to do this, you have to--you, you can try to (laughter), do something.  You can't just, you know, you guys have never worked in the business.  You're going to have to try to find some heavyweights and so, they contacted me.  I thought it was a joke about this whole Michael Jordan's a big fan--meetings.  And actually, and what led to, was a real kick in the pants to put all these ideas I had on paper about what this, the whole notion with Hidden Beach in this label that I thought needed to exist from being in the studios with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and, you know, L.A. [L.A. Reid] and Babyface and, you know, amazing Stevie Wonder.  I always heard, saw that the best music that I liked the most was the unreleased music.  And it was unreleased because it didn't have a category.  The stuff that was the most amazing, and Stevie Wonder--that I heard from Stevie is wow, it's just unbelievable stuff and it never came out.  And he had thou-, Stevie had thousands of songs.  I thought--well, there really needed to be a place for this music that didn't--couldn't be easily defined.  And I put--I threw-those conversations encouraged us to put our ideas on paper 'cause there's going to be a formal, there's going to be a formal meeting.  And so, Michael started setting up to be a possible lead investor.  And I really, you know, didn't know sort of where to start out to write a whole business plan, and finally saw this book, 'Growing A Business' by Paul Hawken.  And on page ninety-nine of the book, it talked about, you know, us walking away from the traditional business plan--use their formulas and programs, but writing a long letter that you're passionate about of what the--how you envision the business, and how you'd like to see what you know, what you don't know, what are your ideas, and write this letter to an imaginary friend or a friend that you think is very smart that may not know your business.  And that was sort of the kick that got me to start writing the business plan.  When I started writing the business plan, I was so overwhelmingly enthusiastic about it that I was like, if, whether Michael or not, or anybody, you know, invest, I'm going to do this.  This was the sort of Jerry Maguire kind of moment I had of this--pouring everything out, and the dreams I had from a kid of what I thought the record business should be about and what, what--how, you know, what type of music should be made, et cetera.  And it all was in this, got put in this one document, and that document is what I used to, you know, get investors, and put together a group of investors, and to fund the company, and that putting together that group was literally the hardest thing I've ever done that time.  Then the group wasn't so hard, but putting the deal together and getting it to close, and it was a really arduous task, and got it done, and got the company started--that this process was about a year it took.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the hardest part of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, God, I mean, raising money is tough work.  I mean it's easy to--had great meetings and pretty much everybody I met with came in, but getting the, you know, from the point of saying, yes, we're going to do it, to a check written and deal being done, the worst--the hardest part were lawyers--
Story_ID: 119697
Speaker 1: All right, so, you're talking about pulling together your business and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--I mean it, you know, it was a roller coaster that was--one minute, the deal was going to happen--it wasn't and it was, it was really tough.  And it was the hardest thing I'd ever done in business times ten.  I mean, it was nothing close, you know, just because of the--how much of, you know, from the roller coast ride, the, it was how legalistic, and, and lawyers going back and forth.  We had a bad set of lawyers in the beginning and, you know.  And it was, again, people were--for good reasons, skeptical 'cause all I was, was a guy who had a good track record.  And I, I think integrity in the business and, and, but all I had was a sheet of paper, you know, forty-five so pages of paperwork that I'd put together in my house.  There was no artist.  There was no, you know, there was nothing tangible, you know.  It's not--not an office, not employees, not artists, not recordings.  So, it was just this real, you know, wild dream, that went against so much of what's conventional wisdom in the business said.  We started the company for less money than, or bought the same as a major act gets launched with, and a lot less than a lot of major acts, so the whole company has been run on a very, very, small investment for the music business, you know, standards.  And, you know, I think, in a very short period, we've really begun to build a brand, that has spoken to a lot of people and, you know, people who recognized, but it was with this--the dream was that it didn't take, you know, a $100 million investment to do--that we could do it for, you know, a lot less.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It seems the key to this is probably a taste on some level--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I or but--
Speaker 1: --taste of music and (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, if you don't have that, if you don't have, you know, if you can tell every idea, every marketing scheme, every partner, every distribution, you know, alliance, but if you've got crappy records at the beginning, you're going to end up with a very short time, I think, in the, in the business.
Story_ID: 119698
Speaker 1: Who was your first big hit?
Speaker 2: Well, the first, our first artist, our first was Jill Scott.  Jill personified everything that I wrote about on the business plan about what a Hidden Beach artist was supposed to be like.
Speaker 1: And what is it--I know I've read like, you know, what Hidden Beach is about because you had kind--sort of articulate what Hidden Beach--
Speaker 2: Well, Hidden Beach was always this place I thought was an imaginary place of a, a mythical place that was in your mind that you--if you could go to a hidden beach or a private island, or do you, you--where you could do anything you want, and any of the creative expression that you want, where you can run naked, or draw on the beach or, you know, write a book or read or enjoy art on whatever level without any restrictions, or if somebody putting what your every activity is in the box, so really a place of, you know, ultimate freedom, and that the Hidden Beach artist is an artist that is, you know, in the age of you just saw this Simpson girl lip, getting busted lips, thinking on the Saturday Night Live.  And they're so many artists in today's music business that really aren't singers.  They can't sing at all--I mean zero, and a place for real artists, real performers, real writers, you know, in this--we're trying to get sort of emotion right from the heart, and without worry about what box it fits in.  And that's really the--was the mission when I met Jill in her, her first demos.  It was like, whew, you know, just amazing, and she, you know, as a poet, as a writer, as a performer--
Speaker 1: How did you meet--well, tell us how you met Jill [Scott].
Speaker 2: It was a manager who initially played me a tape that had--he's, it was a male singer, and then she had done a duet with, and I remember saying, wow, what is this girl like?  You can picture the male singer, but it was too early.  I was in the process of this deal, and I was being real quiet about it, and I didn't want to say, you know, oh, I'm interested and want--I mean, I, I did say I was interested.  I may have a situation, but I didn't have the record company set up at that time.  The next thing I did, I had--Roger Patton who's ironically down the hall now, was the attorney for the production company, and heard somehow that I was starting something or getting a company together.  And since it was fairly eclectic--music for what, at the time, you know, not mainstream.  It wasn't like--your credit wasn't like a--it clearly wasn't like a Milli Vanilli, it clearly wasn't a you know, Britney Spears--I think was just really becoming really popular or, you know, x whatever, fill in the blank, Backstreet Boys which is really popular.  Then my track record or whatever, ear--listening of things a little bit differently, thought that I may like it.  He came over, played me the cassette, and I was blown away, and kept listening to his amazing--I felt like I knew her, listening to it.  It's the same thing I was talking about Stevie earlier, that you can to--wow, this feels like the honesty, and I got on a plane and met her, went to go to meet her.  She was supposed to perform in a, like office lobby or something at the time.  And it was just because I knew some security guard, and the security guard was going to let them do this, and they got busted by the police.  And so, they had to perform in the studio.  And when they performed in the studio, it was, you know, one of those remarkable, remarkable moments.  And, luckily, I took a tape and put it in because she was completely extemporaneous.  It felt like watching Sarah Vaughan or Ella Fitzgerald, just riffing, and she was singing to me about what she wanted to do with her career.  With some, one or two musicians, she had never even met before, and those were all off the top of her head, and it was wild and scary how good it was.  When I sat there, I stayed in town for another couple of days, I was saying like, "You are exactly what I've been writing about, and you're--this is what this company is built to do, and to deliver is artist to the public that, like what you're doing", you know, poetry, jazz, hip-hop influence, R&B, you know, kind of all melded together in this wonderful way, but with this powerful honesty.  So that's--it's literally, I was--met her in the beginning of '99 [1999], signed her right after.  And we started marketing the record like in March, April, '90 [1990], April '99 [1999], and came up with the "Who is Jill Scott?" campaign, you know, which either (unclear), and put the internship program in place, which was really the engine of helping, you know, spread the word.  And, you know, put the record out in 2000, in June 18th, 19-, I mean, June 18th, 2000.  We had a huge launch party here June 1st, 2000 with 2,400 people.  And, you know, it was as if we had been real, real low key until right before, trying to put the records out.  And, then, we get--the record got really sort of wonderful, critical, and, you know, public, you know, acceptance, and we sold like two and a half million copies of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Jill Scott really has, as you said before, blown up, I guess, like (unclear) (simultaneous).  I mean, she's a really big--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, so she's really amazing.
Story_ID: 119699
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Who else--tell us who else you kind of discovered along the way.
Speaker 2: From along over here at the Hidden Beach [Recordings] or from--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, Hidden Beach--'cause I've actually worked for, like Queen Latifah and Jhene, and a bunch of acts at previous places.  But here is Jill Scott, Brenda Russell, like I made a record with at the very beginning.  Mike Phillips, a sax player, who's a monster sax player.  It's a group Kindred [the Family Soul] down in Chicago [Illinois], gets a lot of love in Chicago actually, a husband and wife team [HM Aja Graydon and HM Fatin Dantzler].  Jeff Bradshaw, trombone player.  Darius Rucker, from Hootie and the Blowfish.  We put out a whole series of records, three albums, called 'Unwrapped', volumes one, two, and three which were hip-hop records, classic hip-hop records, turned into jazz tunes.  The--
Speaker 1: Unwrapped, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, I have to, I'll load you up before you leave.  But, yeah, there, there have been a great series of albums.  We have a bunch of artists that have never been released yet, like Lena.  She actually came out on Atlantic Records, but we're putting a record out next year.  I have John Densmore from Doors, the founder of The Doors, who's got a jazz album here.  And, it's actually a really full roster right now.  Lee Jones working with [HM] Berry Gordy and his, her son actually, Cary Gordy.  I mean, he's signed by Cary Gordy--I mean, managed by Cary Gordy, signed here, so we've actually have a full--I think we, like fifteen acts right now which was, you know, is a lot for a really, really small company like this.
Story_ID: 119700
Speaker 1: What I read is that you don't really let the radio station dictate the kind of stuff you do or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, not at all.  I mean, it's--
Speaker 1: It's not--
Speaker 2: --that's just not the business that we're in.  I mean, I think we make great records, but we never, you know, listen to radio to try to decide what to make, you know, sort of listening to stations that are doing so much testing and programming, and things like that right now.  We--it really is a real simple test.  I mean, it's just I, if I pull up my sleeve and it's goose bumps, I, you know, it's something I want to put out.  And my theory is if, if I like it, you know, and it really excites me, there's got to be 500,000 people out there that feels the same way, you know, and a nation with 280 million people, you know, we have a pretty small measure of success in this business, you know, although very, very few records get to that point.
Story_ID: 119701
Speaker 1: Now, does it--just, you know, looking at the--it's an observation of the general public.  Some, you know, when, when reggae first was introduced here in the United States, people said, what is that, you know, they didn't want to hear it.  They would--I know I'm, being somewhat of an eclectic person myself.  I had one of the first Bob Marley albums put out.  People walked away and they were turning their nose up--
Speaker 2: You're kidding--
Speaker 1: --same, same people.
Speaker 2: A [Bob] Marley, whose (unclear) I say--
Speaker 1: Some, same people though, three years later.  They, they're dancing to reggae.  You know, so you just--
Speaker 2: That's how it always goes.  It's--
Speaker 1: --did you wonder sometimes about if--if it gives you goose bumps, you know, sometimes will it ever, would get somebody else?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and sometimes yeah, but no--I mean, I think that it's yes, sometimes you're maybe, like you were Bob Marley or head of the curve.  And, and people, you people have to catch up.  Jill Scott was not a record for a lot of people.  I mean, it's funny people were such revisionary history sometimes.  There like (unclear).  Initially, it was like, sounds weird.  And people were, oh, it's like a fake Erykah Badu or X whatever it is.  And, you people, it's hard to sound so familiar, and it's been played so much now that people are like, "Oh, I always liked that record."  And they're people who really didn't, you know, initially.  And, in fact, there was some review on Amazon who was like, "This is terrible," you know.  And he came back later and said I have to revise my opinion.  It is, you know, usually what it was, alternative at one point, becomes mainstream in--of when it becomes mainstream, it doesn't sound alternative, alternative--something that usually sounds very different, you know.  And I've always thought that's the place I'd much rather be, that three years ahead that Bob Marley, and let you, sort of public catch up to that, and that the--a lot of the best music that's ever been put out did not have, you know, initial immediate acceptance.  I mean, Motown turned down initially the 'What's Going On' album.  That sounds so radical, so different, you know.  It's one of the best albums ever made in the history of recorded music, but it sounded different, and definitely different for Marvin [Gaye], and it was a different experience.  I mean, you know, yeah, and I--you can't find anybody now that doesn't like the Beatles, but I remember the arguments about it, you know, as a kid, when people were, you know, umm, you know.  So, no, you're right, it is kind of hard.  It's just funny to hear that you had an early Bob Marley record.  That (unclear) writing is just, it's classic and brilliant as it comes.  And, you know, it's, it's pretty much sort of universal standards now--every, you know, all of his music.  And it's funny to think that you know, think we're, you know, people did not like it, very young--oh, it sounds, you know, bizarre, but that happens all the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might remember that Johnny Nash, in early days, had like played a reggae sound--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but people thought it was cowboy music, so they (laughter), they warmed up to it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But when they found out it was from Jamaica, they--
Speaker 2: Changed--yeah.
Speaker 1: --changed, shied away from it.  I mean, is this this, this is--the public is--I mean, it's a strange, it's strange sometimes dealing with--'cause you--most music you hear in popular culture, you must assume that somebody likes it, or it wouldn't be out there, but, you know.
Story_ID: 119702
Speaker 1: Well, it's tough business.  I mean, 32,000 records get released a year.  Less than 250 records sell more than 250,000 copies than so, you know.  And over 90 percent of records that get released, less than 10 percent of them sell.  I mean, over 90 percent of the records sell less than 10,000 records, so there are a lot of stuff done.  Let's do think that each one of these records has an audience some place, but it's just--the tough thing is how do you find that audience, that it's somebody who's really passionate and feels it.  I mean, there are things, and there are things that are left field, like the monks' Gregorian chants, you know, selling three and four million copies.  So, it's just--I think if people get a chance to, you know, hear and expose that they--there's, you know, there's so much brilliant music being made and produced now, and even much more so now that technology has become so easy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you think the technology and the access is making music more--I mean, different kinds of music more accessible and more digestible for people, some (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I completely think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  There are people that only listen to be-bop from the '40s [1940s], some, and you know--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, some locked in, yeah.
Speaker 2: --some of, that stratified, you know, generationally, or in terms of a category of music.
Speaker 1: But see, a lot of times, it's just exposure.  They only listen to that because they're not going to have someone walk them through.  If you walked into a sushi restaurant, and you've never eaten it before--if you've, and you--just somebody just gave you quail egg or this or that, you'd be whoo, you know.  And sometimes, you know, education, and just like music, and how do you lead up to it is an art.  Just sequencing a record is I think an art to some degree of how a record sequenced poorly will make it, you know, a collection of great songs sound much different than, you know, put in different orders.  So, if you, if you were locked in, like you said be-bop of the '40s [1940s], and you said, oh, listen to some hip-hop--ohh, what are, what are you talking about?  That's garbage, and not realizing all the thousands of similarities between the two art forms.  But if you had somebody, and you maybe listened to some bad hip-hop, you know, or something that's not really good, but if you say somebody, and say, here, listen to this--what do you think about this?  Something really good.  I've had so many people tell me, I don't like straight-ahead jazz.  And I'll play things like, okay, well, here's 'Kind of Blue' album, you know, one of the most classic albums I've ever made--just brilliant Miles Davis.  And oh, I like that--you know, like well, okay.  Well then, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like country music.  Oh, well, yeah, and that's, a lot of people will, you know, make a statement about that.  I don't like classical.  You know, so I can prove you wrong.  You will like, you like--if you have any kind of taste, you'll like this.  Oh, yeah, I like this.  And it just means they don't know and there's not really exposed.

Speaker 1: So, is Hidden Beach [Recordings] sort of a place where people can go to--when they look for your label to learn something new about music maybe, and about themselves or like listen to it?
Speaker 2: I, I hope so.  That's really one of the ultimate goals here.  I mean, it's really, you know, we're a real rare kind of bird right now.  I think we're the only, and we're distributed by Sony Records worldwide right at this moment.  And they--we are, I think, the only distribution--I mean, the only, one of the only, a purely independent company distributed worldwide by, you know, Sony, a major company like that.  The, you know, that is, you know, by being sort of the unique kind of place in the mission that we have in the business across the board, we want to be here--sort of, sort of the Statute of Liberty for people for music, especially the people are like--you're Bob Marley, they're scratching their head.  People are scratching their head about.  You know, it's almost like, if people, you know--oh, this is really good, but I don't know what to classify it.  This is kind of the place, you know, to hopefully, that you'll come and knock on the door first.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, have you ever, now, Jill Scott is a big success story, but have you been intrigued by an artist and really wanted to promote that artist, and somehow it just did not work?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, all the time.  I mean, and I don't believe that there was a failure.  I mean, I stand by--I can--pretty much all the records.  We used to put a record out by Jeff Bradshaw.  I think it's a brilliant album.  I think it's an incredible body of work, and it's some, some super standout material on it.  You know, he's a trombone player.  You know, we took a stab at it and, you know, I think I own now one trombone album, and it's Jeff Bradshaw's album.  And he's my favorite trombone player, but I don't have a collection.  I have thousands of records, and I don't have any lead trombone album.
Speaker 1: No J.J. Johnson or--
Speaker 2: No, I meant no and, obviously, no, but I don't think I, I own a J.J. Johnson record.  Fred Wesley and, yeah, any other major, you know, there's a few trombone players you can even name.  And so, we made a great record, but it just didn't--we--it didn't stick yet, or we didn't get it in the right ears, and all the things that needed to happen, didn't happen.  But we were going to make another record.  And in the old days, Bruce Springsteen had his first album, sold 30,000 records; the second record of 50 or 60,000.  And the second, third thing, third album was like the 'Born to Run' record and, you know, monster, you know, multi-, multimillion success.  But the artists today don't have that opportunity to grow and take the time to sort of find their way and find their audience, so we really dedicated to taking the time to make that happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119705
Speaker 1: When you look back at--now, you've, you're pretty young by the standards of people we've interviewed usually (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But when you look back at everything you've done thus far--I mean, do--is there anything that you would do differently if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a good question.  I'm sure it's a lot of the decisions in things that I would do differently if I knew--I mean, if I knew now what I knew.  I don't think that if, looking back, would I have done things differently with the reasoning that I was having during the time.  I probably wouldn't, you know, set with the same set of facts, you know--probably would have made a lot of the same assumptions and same decisions.  But I've learned a thousand, I learned a lesson every day.  I probably make a mistake every day--see, at some place in the process.  And so, if I could, you know, rewind and say, you know, would I do X or Y again, you know, the answer would be no.  So, it's a, there's a bunch of sort of decisions in business.  There's a bunch of decisions--creatively, I think, by and large, to balance out, made mostly, you know, you know, knock on wood, good decisions.  But it's--I mean, I think there's something I learn every day like, ooh, I wish I hadn't have done that, or I wish and I kick myself, or I wish I had, you know, if I wish, I had known this is how this was done--that whole arduous task of putting the company together.  What I know now would have been a completely different experience, you know, by learn-, that's how I end up learning it.  I learned, you know, I made a bunch of assumptions about how this is supposed to be done, how deals work out, you know, I was getting education.  I, you know, wouldn't have picked some of the same people, you know, in the representation, like the first corporate attorneys that we had, nor would I have made a lot of the assumptions and, you know, how to structure it.
Speaker 1: That was really the toughest part of what you've done so far, right?  Well, I guess it was that, was that--okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no question, no question.  But it's also--it's me swimming out of water to some degree.  I had a real good sense about how to run a business and a real good sense about how to, you know, make a company profitably, and everything else.  But the whole idea of reverse mergers and acquisitions, and how do you put together what kind of corporation.  And, again, I had a good, a basic, you know, 101 kind of education by going to law school, and maybe taking a corporation class. That's not the chess game that I ever played, so all the games of how you put together deals and how do you, you know, how do you spread equity and how do you (unclear) count all those types of things?  You know, I was really a neophyte.  It was the first time I ever did anything like that.  And so, a lot of things I've done here, even being a neophyte, I--we have a CFO [chief financial officer] now.  He's been here six weeks, eight weeks.  He's transformed, you know, how the, the picture I get about the company, and where we are.  I had an adverse action to sort of CFO's, or it's just from some companies I'd been it, so it was something I didn't desire to fill immediately.  I look back now, like how in the hell did I want to be in business this much time without having this type of information at my fingertips?  I've been lucky actually and gotten into trouble on some aspects by not being able to see a real big picture way down the road.  So, one of the things I would do differently--I would be the first people I'd hire, you know, or not one--not first, but one of the early sort of systems being put in place, you know.  I--my focus has always been on what does the company smell like?  What does it feel like--the logo, the look, how does it taste, you know, in your hands, how does it tactile--all that thing about what it is building a brand.  Now, the brand steps--I feel real good about a lot of how all that went down, but organizationally, and things like that, that a lot of lessons I've learned that I would do a lot differently.
Story_ID: 119706
Speaker 1: Do you think you'll branch out to other forms of media and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, definitely.  There's no question.  It's just like, you know--well, I've found what artists who are really talented at one thing.  Jill [Scott] is so talented as a, as a singer, but she's also a brilliant writer, and she's a great actor.  I think creative people--I've rarely met somebody who's really creative that is only creative in one area.  And you take them out of that area, and they, their creativity stops.  You know, Miles Davis, you know, was a very creative painter, you know, but his main canvas was his trumpet and, you know, the recording art form.  And I think that's how I feel about the people we're associated with.  The people in the company are really smart and creative people who, you know, have ideas across the board, you know, in film and TV, and the printed word and, you know, different, and even different forms of recorded music--the live performance art, and so we have ideas of all those things.  It's just one saying that actually, one of the old owners of Motown used to say to me 'cause I had all these thousands of ideas.  He said, "When everything is possible, nothing gets accomplished", so that's been one of the mantras here right now, that we, we could be in 50,000 different things right now.  But we've had to be real sort of laser-focused on trying to get this right first.  But I think we clearly, you know--well, you know, hopefully, God willing, you know, be making steps into, you know, other forms of entertainment, you know.  And it's been a natural, you know, sort of progression--some of the things and ideas that have come up so far.
Story_ID: 119707
Speaker 1: Okay, we always ask this question.  Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, the same thing I was just saying sort of off camera, is really appropriate to that question is that the--I, I ascribe to sort of the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] view that--and there's, when he made that observation there's, you know, optimists in the mid-'60s [1960s]--talk about, the optimist looked at things, and said, wow, we've come so far since slavery, comes so far since, you know, the '50s [1950s] or Brown v. Board [Brown v. Board of Education, 1954], or whatever benchmark, and looked at some statistics that laid out, and while great hopes, but we don't have to do anything, you know.  They said, wow, that's this thing, we're on the right track.  And the pessimists would look at the--dearth of number--I mean, the numbers that shows the dearth of where we are as a people, and how far we have to go and, and so, also come to the conclusion where it's, you know, go out--this is so sad that there's not much that one person can do.  And his view is one of a realist, that it's a real combination between that, between, and there's a lot that an individual can do to make a difference.  When I think about the hopes, it's that, you know, from education to the arts, to our own image in taking control of our lives, you know, really from top to bottom.  The concerns are, you know, in areas it looks like we may be actually slipping in the wrong direction, and where trends, yeah, especially in education that, you know, be--are slipping backwards.  And this--the foes to, you know, a lot of the strides we made have, have actually gained tremendous ground.  This recent election--I think is a really, you know, sad turn for a lot of, you know, things, you know, directly affecting the, the African American in this country.  So, I mean, I have, I have really high hopes, though, because I think that we're still at the very, very beginning.  We were just talking again off camera about how, you know, in 1986, it was Spike Lee as a sort of lone voice as, you know, director of this generation.  And while there are still very, very few, directors can--black directors in the movie business, compared to this one that helped, and I thought that was going to happen when Spike did his movie.  I thought that there were twelve year-olds all over the world and country who were going to get inspired by that, who now saw that there was a way.  I hope that that's what even Hidden Beach is in a simple way that we've done this in a very different way, that the hopes is that what we're doing through the internship program, that we're planting a lot of those seeds of kids who are going to grow up, and say, wow, this can be done this way, or I'm going to try to do this a different way, and I'm going to take--I have a real concern about the images and the messages that we're putting into the community.  I want to emulate or follow the footsteps, like I thought about a [HM] Berry Gordy with Motown or some, you know, some other mentor.  So, as those numbers get spread, you just hope that, that the positive is being spread exponentially as well, when people are sort of reaching back, and, and helping pull, you know, one person, but two and three people up.
Story_ID: 119708
Speaker 1: --In terms of the internship program, how does that work?  Can you explain that?
Speaker 2: It's, it's a program that's internet-based, but the kids are spread into two different criteria.  They're brought regionally in sort of regional groups and then, they're by interest groups.  They're, you know, if they're interested in the internet, 'cause they're interested in journalism or videography or whatever, we try to pair them up.  But what they're doing is sort of doing marketing and promotion in coming up with ideas and participating in their, you know, we have a sort of--somebody runs a program, you know.  So, a den mother kind of situation, we're putting mentors across the board, you know, everywhere else.  And you know, throughout the different regions, and a lot of people you see in the hallways here came up through that program.  So, it's a sort of like a farm team as well for, you know, the next generation of the performer--I mean, that extra (unclear) sort of executives here to have been in, in our company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it starts as a--I mean the initial contact is through the internet--
Speaker 2: The internet, yeah--
Speaker 1: --around the country and then--
Speaker 2: --right.
Speaker 1: --as dialogue progresses--
Speaker 2: They have--you have to apply.
Speaker 1: --there's change.
Speaker 2: There's like two letters of recommendation, two essays, so it's like applying to a school almost.  And that's, you know, sort of the, the process has sort of gone down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 119709
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done so far, you still got a lot to do.  It seems funny to ask this question, but what would you consider right now to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Wow, I just, so it's funny 'cause of this, I feel like I am just at the, the very beginning, but a real, I think, hopefully, a real commitment to quality.  I mean, a real, kind of--I mean stickler to quality, and putting out and, you know, where a goal of making people feel good, that this, like I said, the thing at the very beginning, the thing that attracted me to this business and, you know, trying to be fair and honest, but in all aspects--not just fair in business, which is obviously tantamount importance, but honest and fair with the communication of emotion and not, you know, a lot of the entertainment businesses in, and this is what it is.  And I enjoy, you know, special effects and, and, you know, creative twists and turns like anybody else, but what I've always tried to do is get away from, at least in the music side, necessarily, you know, manufactured images and manufactured emotions and, and really trying to get right to sort of the center of the heart.  And so, if I look back on the recordings and things that I've made, the one thing that I hope is a legacy that's left behind are those emotions that are powerful to people that are left in a bottle that, that's what-the thing that's magic about recording is that a hundred years from now, somebody will be able to listen to the Jill [Scott] album that we made here or any other records, and feel the emotion that we felt at the time, and feel the emotion that Jill wanted the listener to feel, you know.  It's just amazing to me that you can actually take emotion--it's not notes, but take emotions and put it in a bottle and save it.  And you could, just like reading a great book from a novelist by Frederick Douglass, or somebody you're, you know, whatever, you know, someone lived or listened to Beethoven's music--lived, you know, over a hundred years ago, and to feel it here, and put goose bumps on your hands, and that, and that--I mean, on your arms--and so, anyway, that's, and trying to leave behind, I guess, as well.
Story_ID: 119710
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm sure your family--all families are pleased with success, you know, and, you know, usually.  And you come from a background where your parents [Nancy Monet Clarke McKeever and HM Lester Harvey McKeever, Jr.] were successfully--they came from humble beginnings, but they would do a lot with the influences of Mr. Beasley, and other people in the community.  And since a lot of positive stuff going around in your family background (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, I've been so blessed.  I mean, whatever, it's idyllic, you know, you know.  And I, and I could--I have the best parents in the world.  I mean, just, you know, and amazing the type of influences, so you were, there was a question so--
Speaker 1: I'm just asking why--what, what's their reaction to what you're doing, I guess?  They--
Speaker 2: I think they're proud, I think they're very, very proud.  I mean, it was--my mother much more so initially than my father.  I think my father, you know, almost had a heart attack when I left the practice of law to, you know, pursue this dream of music because of just fear of the odds in success.  And I was on a successful track and do, as a lawyer, but it's not what I really wanted to do.  And I think my mother probably recognized earlier the--how important the contribution I could make here versus, you know, negotiating somebody's contract, which is, which I thought honest representation was a very important contribution.  I think that I can now touch millions of people, you know, with what I do now, and I think that they see that.  I thought, I think my dad probably first understood on some level what I was doing when he listened to the--when I came home, I played, and he never heard Robin Harris.  And I was making the record and piecing it together, I came back home and I--we were driving in the car.  I put in the car, and he laughed so hard, he was almost crying, and he couldn't drive 'cause he really, you know, lost it.  And he felt great, and that's what this was all about.  And I think he realized--oh, wow, you know, this is what this, this is what this business is, you know.  I feel really good and I think he, for secondly, understood it when I got my contract at Motown.  He was like, oh, wow, there's actually, you know, financial, you know, benefits to be--you had from this.
Story_ID: 119711
Speaker 1: Now, now you have other siblings, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my sister, a sister.
Speaker 1: And, yeah, and your--okay, yeah, she was involved in dance several years ago?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, she's a big dancer for ten years.
Speaker 1: She was with Garth Fagan's bucket dance theatre [Bottom of the Bucket BUT...Dance Theatre]for--I think for a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had the Urban Bush Women and she worked with--she taught at Jacob's Pillow and Judith Jamison.  So, she's actually--had been, had a very--I think, successful dance career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you got a--
Speaker 2: She's a lawyer now in Chicago [Illinois] and does estate planning, and she's on the Board of NPR [national public radio].  She's one of--I think, the very best supporters of Barack Obama who just won this election, first election--I guess a couple of weeks ago, first statewide--I mean, the nation, you know, Federal office, as opposed to, you know, the Illinois Assembly.  But the--so she's very active in politics and very active in sort of the PBS and the, that type of thing in the community as well.
Story_ID: 119712
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you got a--you're married, too, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you've got a son--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --whose, who is musically inclined.  You want to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is.  He's--his name is Brent and he's a monster.  I mean, he's a, he's a--has an ear, and a musician, and his recall of songs.  And now, he's, he's actually really gifted, and just he cracks us up.  He's only three and a half but he, you know, cracks us up on a daily basis.
Story_ID: 119713
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question seems kind of strange, too, because you're so young, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: It's funny when you get ready to answer that question, it flashes your mind--this tape playing back when you're not here is when it's sort of the most, you know, significant.  Somebody always, you know, was here trying to make this a better place, you know, that, and, really, in every way, you know, I could, you know, not just--just by me being kind to people, but leaving, you know, putting in the world.  And, and I can't think of the French expression for art, you know, but it's like the umbrella to the life's garbage and, and helping build, and put those umbrellas up to, you know, make the, this place, you know, which, depending on your point of view, can be very tough and, and trying existence a wonderful, or wonderful like, and some--and putting joy in people's lives.
