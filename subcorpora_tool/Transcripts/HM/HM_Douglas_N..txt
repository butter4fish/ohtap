Story_ID: 49147
Speaker 1: See, you made it through (laughter), okay.  I'd like to have you start out by telling us about your mother.  I'd like to have her name and what you know about her background.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is for publication or--'cause they always ask the mother's name and stuff?
Speaker 1: Well, we, no we don't really publish it but it goes in--it'll be part of the archive, so--(laughter)
Speaker 2: Which anybody can get to?
Speaker 1: Yes, that part, yes, okay.  Is she still alive?
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No, but they, you know, when--when you do an identity things--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: And that's why I didn't put a lot of that stuff down there.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Oh, I don't know what to do?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Just call her Mrs. Douglas (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but no.  Can you give her first name?
Speaker 2: Esther.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you tell us about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: She was a nurse.  She grew up in Englewood, New Jersey and lived there most of her life.  She was a registered nurse.  Oh, more?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She worked at hospitals.  Her parents were also born in that area and so the roots of one side of my family are strictly along the palisades in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about her growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Not extensively.  A lot of the family is still in that area so a lot of her--her sister was down in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], but all of her aunts and uncles and all that her--still in Englewood and so she didn't have to talk because I could hear them talk about what was going on.
Speaker 1: And was there any--'cause I'm just saying--just focusing on this a little--little bit, because a lot of people we interview, their roots are in the South.
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: And, so you're saying that New Jersey, were, you know the roots--so you don't know how the family got there or--
Speaker 2: They were there at least two generations.  My grandfather, I think, great-grandfather, so, there was a little bit of Indian mixed in there, but they were, they were Jerseyites.  Jersey, excuse me (laughter).
Story_ID: 49148
Speaker 1: And your father, his name?
Speaker 2: Father is John Douglas.
Speaker 1: You know what, you know what--we're going to figure--cause I am--'ware--you know I'm aware of concerns.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I mean but I haven't heard this concern before.  I didn't--a 94 year old who didn't want to give her age.  (Laughter)  (Unclear).  Okay, can you talk about his background or where he grew up?
Speaker 2: He grew up in Grenada.  He, he was shining shoes in the Panama Canal Zone.  He was 12 years old and some U.S. soldier, who was a major, I guess liked the way he shined shoes and said, "How would you like to go to the States?"  And so, he said, well let me ask my aunt, who he was staying with.  His aunt said, "Go, I'll tell your mother that you're going."  So he went with this major as sort of his houseboy and lived in Army camps and then learned how to cook and was a cook.  And when he got of age, the--I guess he was a Colonel by then, or something, but, anyways, said, "I'm gonna send you to school."  And sent him to Hampton [University in Hampton, Virginia].  And so he graduated from Hampton and was able to get a job in a bank, Chemical Bank, down on Wall Street [New York City], as a teller, and this was before the [Great] Depression, so, he was in high society and I remember him telling me experience about the Depression, working around the clock for three straight days, and the--all the gory stuff that went on, but that kind of made a big impression on him and so he was very, very thrifty, very loyal.  Stayed with Chemical Bank all of his life.
Speaker 1: That's somewhat of an amazing story.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What--when he was 12, what, what year was that approximately?
Speaker 2: That probably was about--he was [born in] 1903--so that was--1915.
Speaker 1: And, did he talk at all about the growing up--especially with this Major?  Did he talk at all about that?
Speaker 2: No, I met the Major once.  He ended up living in L.A. [Los Angeles] but no, he didn't go into that in detail but they were fairly close and, obviously, well, the Major liked him because, you know, he really took care of him, sending him to school, that was the best thing that could possibly happen.
Speaker 1: Did he ever mention missing his family?  That's such a long, you know, early age?
Speaker 2: No, because he went back to Grenada when he was in his 50's and I can remember him telling me that--all I could remember was, sure glad I'm in the U.S., with all the flies and stuff down there and but, you know, he did go back and I went back a few years ago to try to trace his roots but I only had a few hours and there were a lot of Douglases in the phone book and I, I found one that owned a liquor store so I figured that had to be the one.  But, I need to go back again.
Story_ID: 49149
Speaker 1: So do you know how your parents [John Douglas and Esther Douglas] met?
Speaker 2: I don't know how they met but they were both living in New York City and doing the social circuit and Dad had--we had a chauffeur's license--that's one thing--he always worked many jobs, beside his day job, so to speak, and I also remember he had, which was interesting, a golf card, you had to pay, I guess it was a lot of money then per year, $10, to be able to play golf.  So, he--he was an interesting person, but he was kind of playing the social circuit.
Speaker 1: Now when you say, playing the social circuit, can you describe that a little bit more?
Speaker 2: Dad was a cool guy (laughter).  He was cool and he was, you know, had that little West Indian accent and a twinkle and--he was--he was good.
Story_ID: 49150
Speaker 1: And, do you--what is--can you give me your sibling's name, you don't have to give last names, in the order of birth, and where you fit in the birth?  Oh, you have just one, right?
Speaker 2: I just have one, so it makes it easy and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Joan, and she's an older sister--seven years older and she was my role model.  She is just--perfect person and just a really neat person.
Story_ID: 49151
Speaker 1: And, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: When I was four, I had a sailor suit--oh--little, going back a little, it's my understanding, obviously, I wasn't knowledgeable about--I was born in New York City but when three days old I was put in a paper bag and transported over to [New] Jersey.  So, it wasn't really that fancy but I got to New Jersey and they were renting a house and that was gonna be our house and they finally ended up buying the house.  So, my earliest memory was running away at age four to join the Navy, they needed help.  And this was during the war years.  So I decided to go join the Navy and I remember getting on the bus, there was this woman who, I guess, worked for someone, and so I just got on with her and I guess they figured I was with her.  And I remember riding on the bus, and after about 20 minutes or so, a half hour, I decided, you know, maybe I'll wait to join the Navy.  So I got off the bus, by myself, and I'm saying, "Hum, where am I?"  And I started walking, what I thought was back, which it actually was, and then, I was picked up by the police and they took me back home.  But that was my earliest memory.
Story_ID: 49152
Speaker 1: So, can you describe what family life was like?
Speaker 2: I was raised by my grandmother who we call, Bambi (ph.), and do you know, I had to actually research to find out what her--her real name was but Bambi was kind of the stabilizing factor and--and so it was--it was a good life.  We were middle class.  Lived in a area that was changing.  It's now entirely black but at the time it was just a smattering of blacks and the same would go to a good school and that was important to my parents.  And, got a good education.  There weren't that many blacks in the grammar school and just a hand full.  But, you know, it was--it was a good life.  I always worked.  Even if I had a paper route and, and then you know, would go to bowling alleys and set up pins, automation kind of took care of that and--I can remember working in a golf course, Englewood Golf Club, and as a caddy and you could never get near the big house--the big white house on the hill.  And my only regret is that now when I am able to go into that course, they had the audacity to put Highway 80 and the freeway right through it, so it's no longer there.  But, it was, it was an interesting life.  Again, my sister [Joan Douglas] was kind of the person who taught me how to dance and, you know, she had her boyfriends, and I idolized the guys and, in fact, we were reminiscing and we never had an argument, which is most unusual, and I couldn't think of one and she couldn't, and it was just amazing.  But, it was good people.
Speaker 1: Now, [his grandmother] Bambi.  How--what was the--is that B-A-M-M-I-E or B-A-M-M--
Speaker 2: You know at that age I didn't spell it so (laughter)
Speaker 1: All right, I know (laughter).  Well, how would--well how would you like--
Speaker 2: It was the spelling of the deer, Bambi, I guess, it was closer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was good person.  Obviously, very good cook.  And, kinda kept us out of trouble.  We had to, you know, always be there around suppertime and, you know, we couldn't dilly dally from school because both parents worked in New York City so, you know, someone had to be, be there.  And, she was good and, grandfather, was also very good.
Speaker 1: Now, is this your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, of course, that's fine, okay, and they--they had--were there--was there any messaging they gave you, you know in terms of what you should and should not do or?
Speaker 2: No, my mom [Esther Douglas] was very encouraging of the need to always push, you know, hitch your wagons to the stars.  And, she was always very supportive unless I got in real trouble, then she'd flip, but where my dad was more conservative.  I used to work with him cutting grass.  We had few houses on the hill up in the rich area that we would cut.  I had the hard part cutting the grass.  There was no power, anything then.  But that was good because, you know, we got out and worked together and so forth and so, you know, I kind of looked at him and saw how he was always working and always had, at least, two jobs.  And yet managed to have, with clothes on our back, and we never had a car.  We didn't even have a TV when it first came out.  So, you know, there were a lot of things we didn't have but we didn't feel deprived.  We had more important things.
Speaker 1: Now, your father [John Douglas]--do you think he felt like he was Caribbean, American or he was pretty much Americanized by the time?
Speaker 2: He was somewhat Americanized.  He still, you know, went over to New York [New York City, New York] a lot 'cause he had his social friends over there.  But he also developed a lot in--in New Jersey.  It was interesting, he was in two different churches so I think he was hedging his bets there and but, no, he was becoming fairly Americanized.  He had a very slight accent then and he was, he was, settling into American.  Really, really loved it.
Speaker 1: You know I often say that because sometimes Caribbean Americans they have a sense of work ethic that's a little different, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hum
Speaker 1: You know a sense of themselves and--but they, you know they message their children--that is different.
Story_ID: 49153
Speaker 1: But, so, what is the young John Douglas like?
Speaker 2: Shy.  Fairly smart.  Good athlete in almost all sports.  Inquisitive.  And wanted to belong.  You know at that age it's fairly important and--and sports was, obviously, a mechanism to belonging.  You know, once you play sports and you're kind of with it.  And leaving grammar school and going to junior high, it was, we had about 10 percent black and, in fact, the person who used to sit next to me is a long-time friend, Carl Drake, who lives in San Francisco.  But, 'cause Douglas and Drake, we were always doing something.  And that was kind of my running partner and we were into cars and then we realized girls existed and that was very interesting.  And, and we also went to parties and so junior high was sort of the turning point where we became a little more social, still somewhat shy.
Speaker 1: Now, you were--you lived in Englewood [New Jersey], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was Englewood like in those days?
Speaker 2: It's a small town.  23,000 with its typical monument and its parades.  It was a very, very quiet town.  It was a town of the have and the have nots.  On the hill you had some very, very, very great mansions, Gloria Swanson, and there were a lot of stars because it was only three miles from New York City.  And then down near the tracks you had the people who were working in those places.  So, it's an interesting city.  The downtown area was, was kind of, little of both.  It was--there wasn't a ton of prejudice.  It was, it was, I don't remember heavy-duty prejudice.  You get it here and there but it wasn't in your face, every day type prejudice.
Speaker 1: And this is for your--your [Esther Douglas] mother's family that lived with for several generations?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, had they been domestics in the--in the--okay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the--okay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 49154
Speaker 1: Now, I often like asking this question.  If you could take yourself back to your childhood, what sights, smells, and sounds remind you, you know, if you would sort of close your eyes and think about your childhood?
Speaker 2: The sights probably would be our backyard 'cause we did have grass and I remember we had a wall which was various shape stones.  And that would be great for playing baseball 'cause they could throw the ball, I didn't know where it would come back and so I could try to catch it.  And you'd smell the grass.  We had a small vineyard to grow some grapes that we would make jelly out of--and we had carrots and we had lettuce and so, the sights and smells would be of that.  It was a home.  Now, we did not have a dog.  We had cats.  We grew up with Gypsy and Boots and all these cats and I remember once I had a dog, Rusty, and he lasted about a week before they said, "Nah you gotta take him back."  (laughter)  So, I was used to cats.
Speaker 1: And, so, it was of--it was--a solidly middle class life?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Really, and okay, in many ways.
Story_ID: 49155
Speaker 1: Now what did you start playing sports?
Speaker 2: Actually, in grammar school, but it didn't have organized sports but, little league--made the Little League All Stars--twelve.  And I do have one memory there that is--we played Newburgh, New York in the polo grounds before the Giants game.  And we were able to go in the Giants locker room and there was Willie Mays.  It was his first year in there and I remember seeing him chewing gum, blowing a bubble and reading a comic book and I said, "Wow."  (laughter).  And I also remember, I was a catcher, and being there and saying, "You know, this place is big."  And I remember turning around to argue a pitch and looking at the umpire, and he looked like he was 10 feet tall.  But, I--I do remember that and then didn't really play other sports.  Basketball in junior high school.  And, junior high was only two years, where high school was four years.  So, I was not the best but I was, like, the sixth person.  And, so, I was good enough to get in and, you know, play a fairly good game.  And, baseball, a better game.  Wasn't active in track at that time.
Speaker 1: Not in high school?
Speaker 2: Not in junior high.
Speaker 1: Not in junior high?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in high school, started in track and did very, very well.  And also played basketball and did fairly well in that.  And in football, finally in my senior year, I started both ways, defense and offense.  I was an end and a safety.  And I remember the coach telling me at safety, "I don't care how far back you have to go, don't let anyone score."  And we didn't.  So that was, that was good.  And we were State Champs.  And in basketball we were very good.  And we had probably the best year for our high school ever 'cause we were good in almost all the sports.  In track, let's see, I remember my--myself being a jumping 17 feet and 19 feet and 21 something.  In fact my, my last year I won the Tri-State--New Jersey, New York and Connecticut long jump at--in New York City, at Randalls Island.  So, I was starting to come along in track.  We had an idol--what's George's last name--but anyway he was Olympian in the hop, step and jump.  I guess they call it the triple jump now, and he used to practice at our high school.  And, obviously, we looked up to him and he was in the '52' [1952] Olympics and the '56' [1956] Olympics.  And, so my greatest thrill was eventually competing against him when I got to college and beating him so, it was, it was a lot of idols at that time.  People you looked up to and respect and so forth.
Speaker 1: Did you--I want to go over your schools.  Elementary school was what?  What was the name of the--
Speaker 2: Roosevelt [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Roosevelt, and then your--your middle school?
Speaker 2: That was Englewood Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, I thought it was--so Englewood went from seven to 12?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a junior high.  There was a separate school
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two years and then the high school was called Dwight Morrow High School.
Speaker 1: Dwight Morrow, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 49156
Speaker 1: And did you--were there other things influencing you at that point--like any teachers or--
Speaker 2: Yes, in grammar school there--there was a teacher that I had twice, I think in second grade and sixth grade, Mrs. Weeks, who was really instrumental in encouraging me.  And, in high school, there was a Physics teacher, Ms. Francis (ph).  And at that time, yeah, I respected Physics and I felt the smartest thing for me to do is get next to the person who is the smartest person and just try to learn as much as I can from that person.  I remember the last day of class, she went around the room asking what do you want to be?  And at that time I was very good in numbers and so I said, "I want to be an Accountant."  And she stopped the class and said, "No, no, no, no, no, no.  You wanna be an Engineer or a Physicist."  And I looked at her with a questioning look and she said, "That's what you wanna be."  And I respected that.  And I said, well, she must know something that I don't know.  And, that's--that was a turning point in my career.
Speaker 1: What does--what do you think she saw in you?
Speaker 2: Again, since I was good in numbers, I think she saw an analytical mind.  And Physics, especially when you take that first year, Physics is very difficult because you're jumping into so many different things so you don't really have a chance to focus on one thing.  But, I was quiet, but still, I guess, you know, I was still analytically working through that and she saw that and, and it surprised me.  But, it was a turning point.  So, from then on I'd--I started thinking about that.
Speaker 1: And with the sports--so you were good--were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and with--and why do you think you were so motivated to be a good student?
Speaker 2: My sister [Joan Douglas].  She was good and she ended up going to Boston University [Massachusetts] and graduating from there and so, you know, I heard all the fun that she had in college, so I took my--so I gotta go to college, there's no question about it.  Also, just the challenge.  It was interesting because when we got to high school [Dwight Morrow High School], high school had about 20 percent black and then we had other students coming in from other cities so it was really a fairly large school.  It was over a thousand students.  And, there, the competition was fairly stiff and you had some very bright people.  And, but I remember I was always taking college preparatory courses and, and, I took, you know, I think it was an Advanced Algebra course and, you know, it's just taking as much--I was just trying to focus on what do I need to get ahead.  And yet at the same time balancing and it's being one of the boys, playing sports and so on.  And so people respected that.
Story_ID: 49157
Speaker 1: Now, what--when did you realize that you were good at--or, you know, had a thing for numbers?
Speaker 2: Early on I could do arithmetic and--and all of that in my head.  And, so, yeah, you could visualize things, multiplication and, and then you start getting to more advanced things.  And, and at least you could picture how they--they go.  No, I was not a genius.  But at least, you know, it came relatively easy.
Speaker 1: How early is early on?
Speaker 2: In grammar school.
Speaker 1: In grammar school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You could add things in your head?
Speaker 2: At least I had an easy time with that type of thing.
Speaker 1: And, did you have--did you like science as well?  Well, science, you don't really sort of take up until middle school, sort of.
Speaker 2: Right, but it was fascinating.  It was interesting and even science at the lower level was interesting, whether it's Biology or Chemistry or Physics.  And then, as you get into more and more things, it still was interesting.  Biology, not as much.  Chemistry, it was okay.  Physics, yeah, that was, that was good.  But I was somewhat set on being an Engineer because I felt that was something I could understand and touch.  I really didn't know what a Physicist did back in high school.  I just knew it was interesting subject.  But, you know, what does one do as a Physicist?
Speaker 1: So, when did you first decide you wanted to be an Engineer?
Speaker 2: Upon graduation from high school, when I was applying for college.  I applied early for Michigan State [University in East Lansing, Michigan] and got accepted early in their Engineering School.  And, so, I was set except they wouldn't give me a scholarship, which is kind of negative, but, I only applied to the one place and that was because my sister lived in Detroit [Michigan] and I went out to visit her and she showed me University of Michigan [in Ann Arbor, Michigan] and Michigan State and I said, "Okay, that's good, I want to go there."  And then basketball season, I was recruited by Bates [College in Lewiston, Maine].  Their coach came down, saw me play.  Again, I was not a starter but I was sixth man and we were State Champs, so, it was good.  And the other five players didn't have the academics.  So, they said they could probably get me a scholarship and, yeah, it sounded interesting.  And one of the alumni, an African American guy, took me up to Bates and it was very nice.  So, I was going to Bates.
Speaker 1: Now this is what year--started 19--
Speaker 2: This is '56' [1956].
Speaker 1: '56' [1956]
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are you aware of things like the Board versus--you known "Brown v. Board of Education"?  Is that in your awareness or not?
Speaker 2: Not at that time, no.
Story_ID: 49158
Speaker 1: And, I also wanna ask you--like when you look at your mother [Esther Douglas] and father [John Douglas], what do you--you know we have, a little, some of both our parents--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But what do you have, you know, attributes you have of, you know, both of them?
Speaker 2: With my father, I think, a little bit of his finesse, and some of his stability, his loyalness, his ease of getting along with people.  With my mother, I get the soft side of me, I also get the vision.  She encouraged me to go beyond my boundaries.  I get the love--very, very loving person, always in my corner.  I think those are some of the attributes.
Story_ID: 49159
Speaker 1: And, what--with--I'm back to sports, just for a second.  You said you first started with, was it, base--
Speaker 2: Baseball.
Speaker 1: Baseball.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But then, by the time you left high school, you were really--was basketball and track?
Speaker 2: It was basketball, track and football and I gave up baseball my sophomore year in high school.
Speaker 1: And you have a talent for all three of those?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did you like about each one?
Speaker 2: Football, I loved 'cause it was the caveman type emphasis, and, and, it was, it was nice.  We had a coach who was an ex-Marine drill sergeant.  And, I can remember practicing, one time, in a hurricane and we thought, of course, this is going to be called off because it's a hurricane.  And he said, "Oh, no, there's no such thing as bad weather."  And, it was fun, you know, you throw the ball and the ball would go the other way.  And, and, and then we played games in the snow and in torrential rains and stuff.  And he was a drill sergeant, Marine drill sergeant mentality, and he instilled that in us.  I mean, we would never quit.  We weren't the biggest but we were the hardest and the fastest.  And, you also got a sense of team.  When you see your buddies, they would stand up for you and you never had to worry about anybody messing, 'cause my buddies would take care of 'em.  And so football was sort of, you know, you against the world and, and can I handle it?  Basketball is a little more finesse.  Basketball is a team sport.  But there's a lot of talent.  There's either you make the basket or you don't.  It's also a very rough sport because you have no protection.  Amazing what goes on under that basket, and I could jump.  I had exceptional jumping skills.  And so even as a junior I got into the varsity games and I remember one game against a toughest opponent.  Coach put me in and it was halftime and I had to jump against the center who was a good six to eight inches taller than me.  And he kinda laughed.  And so they threw it up and it didn't go anywhere.  They threw it up again and I out jumped him.  He was like, "Who is this masked man."  So, it was one of, if you had some skills, you could also use some mind games on people in basketball 'cause sometimes someone's guarding you and it can really play with their mind.  That's what I liked about basketball.  Track was you against the environment.  You against the tape measure.  You against the stopwatch.  And, so, it was, yes or no.  It was almost like Physics, either it happens or it doesn't.  And you could measure the improvement and you could also analyze what you're doing, whether it's the hurdles or the high jump or the long jump.  And, so, for me that was great because then you couldn't blame it on someone else.  It's just you and that tape measure.  You and that stopwatch.  And that was good and that's why, that's why I really liked track.

Speaker 1: Now, and at the same time that this is going on, this great, sort of love and, and--of being able to excel in sports.  You also are--doing well in school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and especially in science and math.  Did you--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You said you took--didn't you take a Physics, a Physics class and--
Speaker 2: Yes, in my junior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In High school.
Speaker 1: And what intrigued you about Physics?
Speaker 2: Physics, at that time, was something new.  The equations, the formulas, why the certain things happen, the--when you're studying about heat or light or sound or whatever, when you talk about, you know, why's the sunset red, or, you know, just different things that you observe but you don't know why.  It answered a lot of whys, so it was very interesting subject from that point of view.
Speaker 1: And, at this point in time, are you sure--do you know what you wanna do?  I mean, you wanna go on to school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: We talked about that.  And, and--but it was really sports that led you to Bates [College in Lewiston, Maine], right?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--
Speaker 2: Now, keep in mind Bates in did not give out athletic scholarships.  So, you could keep your scholarships as long as you kept, I think it was, certain grade average.
Story_ID: 49161
Speaker 1: Now, did you go to Bates [College in Lewiston, Maine], sight unseen?
Speaker 2: No, I did take a field trip up with an African American alumni and so that was interesting.
Speaker 1: This is very different.  I mean, this is 1956.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they had an African American alumni and who was--
Speaker 2: Bates.
Speaker 1: And who was this person?
Speaker 2: It's [Nathaniel] Nate Boone.  He was a graduate of, of Dwight Morrow High School, my old high school.  And he was around my sister's age and a good athlete and yet very smart.  He was a lawyer.  And so he, he heard that I was interested in--he offered to take me up there and to go through campus.  That was in the wintertime so it really was (laughter) totally different going up in Maine.
Speaker 1: And--it's such a different environment, in many ways, you know, to--for--so describe to me--I mean you have been in an environment that was--what did you say, how many--
Speaker 2: About twenty, twenty-five percent black.
Speaker 1: Black, okay.  But you're going to an environment where there's much fewer--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's being kind (laughter).  That's being kind.
Speaker 1: So what did he say while he was taking you up there--about the school and, you know?
Speaker 2: He was saying that one, you won't find any prejudice up here 'cause they haven't been able to define it because it's just not in their vocabulary.  Two, tremendous opportunities for learning and you get to know people.  The time was only eight hundred students, it was smaller than my high school.  And so you get to know the professors.  They get to know you and it's, it's a very close-knit family and also those people become your friends forever, remember you forever.  And he compared it to Michigan State [University in East Lansing, Michigan].  And he said, "You know, there, you're just a number and so forth.  But here, you're going to be an individual."  And it sounded good.
Story_ID: 49162
Speaker 1: And so when you finally went there [to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine], what did you find?
Speaker 2: I went up a week early, before it started, 'cause I was going out for football.  And so, and that was good because I met the football players and they say they bring you in as family.  Okay, so now, when the rest of the school arrived, I was able to--I was, I was very green.  I didn't have a clue what was going on.  And, you know, college was just totally different from high school.  I mean I had to learn how to carry books and things.  You know it was, it was different.  And you're playing football at the same time.  And those Maine-fed boys are big.  And, and they're tough.  So, and it was cold up there.  So, it was, it was an experience.  And there is only eight blacks.  It's a co-ed, about half and half but no women, eight guys.  So, that was an experience.
Speaker 1: When you say, co-ed--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was about 450 men, 400 women.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But no black women.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  That's what, okay, right, right, right.  So, so--but--that's why I'm trying to think it's a very different--so--what, how was life up in Bates?
Speaker 2: It took time because, again, I was basically shy but, obviously, you stand out.  And, as a freshman, you know, you're the lowest of low and so it took time for me to get used to it.  And I remember playing football, and I guess I was a good luck charm.  Bates won the State Championship so that was their first time in decades.  But I wasn't a stand out.  In fact, I didn't even start and so I kept saying to myself, "You know, this football thing, I may have to retire from that", and also the basketball coach forgot to tell me he was going on sabbatical, the one who recruited me.  So, the assistant football coach was a track coach.  And he kept whispering in my ear, "Why don't you come out for track, come out for track."  So, decided to go out for track.  And, occasionally, I would go down to Boston [Massachusetts] on the weekends, which was about an hour and a half to two hours.  And my sister [Joan Douglas] lived in Boston.  She was married with a husband, Cliff, and Cliff was one of my idols.  He was a Omega Psi Phi man and he was very, very sharp guy in terms of having his act together.
Story_ID: 49163
Speaker 1: And, so, would--what was life like, that's what I'm saying.  I mean you, you played sports, okay, I--you did well in--you did well in track.
Speaker 2: Yes, but academically I got a scare my first exam.  I was taking Physics and we had this wild professor who-- everything you've ever learned, you know, it was just out of the window.  His exams would be some animals riding on a rollercoaster with ice cream and did this.  You know everything, you know, was just weird.  And I remember my first exam I got a, I got a seven out of 100.  But, that was before they scaled it and after the scale I had a ten out of 100.  So, I decided to go back to the dorm and start packing, 'cause you know, it's just going to be a matter of time because, you know, I wasn't meant for this.  And then I went in to see him and, yeah, he encouraged me, blah, blah, blah, and he said, "By the way, I understand you want to major in Physics."  And I said, "Well, I--."  And he said, "Stick with it", he said, "You know, don't give it up."  And I was able to get through that semester and then the next semester and do fairly well, but, that was a rude awakening.  I mean I just couldn't coast through college, no.  You had to work and you had to work hard.
Speaker 1: And when did you--did you find it academically more challenging than what--anything you ever experienced in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yup, yup.  Everybody was smart there and it was fun that they were a great group of kids but, you know, they were, they were sharp.  Everybody was sharp.  I also, because I had a scholarship, I had to work on campus and so I worked in the kitchen.  And, as a freshman, you had the worst job, you know, the cleaning the plates and, you know, that kind of stuff and especially if you're doing breakfast you'd have to be up at five in the morning and it is so cold in Maine at five in the morning.  But, you know, it was, it was good.  It was a good environment.
Speaker 1: Did you find--feel culturally isolated?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, not in terms of not being included but I wasn't dating or anything and, you know, so I wasn't going to the dances and stuff, like that.  And so, yes, to a certain degree.
Story_ID: 49164
Speaker 1: And what other things do you think happened during that time--that sort of shaped you?
Speaker 2: Track was big because I was able to make the relay team even though I was the weakest link, truly the weakest link on the mile relay team.  And we were able to go to events in Boston [Massachusetts], and so on.  So I was able to travel and, and we had another gentleman, Rudy Smith, who was also a freshman with me.  And he was a great track star from high school.  He was also African American.  So we were the two stars, so to speak, and it was interesting.  He was a Biology major so, you know, here is a Physics major and a Biology major.  And so we did very well in our freshman year and so people got to know us and so on and at least people knew you and, you know, you kind of know everybody by sight and name.  It was a small college.  So, by the end of my freshman year, I started to feel a lot more at ease.
Speaker 1: And, so are--when are you thinking that you will--you've been--you won--didn't you win a big race and--while you were at Bates [College in Lewiston, Maine]?
Speaker 2: Yes, going into my sophomore year, that's when I finally started clicking and became a national competitor in the long jump.  I think I did 23 feet indoors.  At the time the world's record was 25 eight by Jesse Owens.  So, as a sophomore, I was starting to get there and also starting to go to the circuit, as they say, you know, down to Boston, down New York.  Also decided to join the Q's, the Omega Psi Phi, down in Boston and was able to go over.  So now I had some friends I used to stay with, guys in Harvard [University], and then go to the party.  So, things were looking a lot better then.  And also in Physics, now, was in the Advanced courses and it's a lot easier when you're staying with the subject for a whole semester and then jumping from subject to subject.  So things were starting to fall in place.  Now I was still working on campus but I also use Physics to try to maximize my jumping.  To get to the Physics of the world's center of gravity you have to be, how fast you need to go and just analyze it.  And, and it worked 'cause I'm not the fastest and I couldn't jump the highest but I was able to do fairly well.  So by my junior year, I was--I had the New England record for long jump and also in that year I ended up doing 25 feet in the long jump indoors.  So, I almost beat Jesse Owens' world record.  In fact, it was in the national indoor championships in Madison Square Garden [New York City, New York] and he was the referee with the tape.  And I actually had a jump that was about 26 feet but I just touched the sawdust.  But ended up tied for first.  And, you know, for a Bates first, that was amazing to be the best in the country.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you ever think of the Olympics at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and the Olympics since '60' [1960], the year I was a senior and it was in Rome [Italy] and, I had a good shot at making it and then I got injured in my, in the springtime, so, I didn't get a chance to compete for it but maybe that was a blessing, who knows.  But, at that time, track was a means to an end and I definitely realized that because there was no such thing as professional track.  Now there is.  So, for me it was a way of getting--ended up with two scholarships, getting through school, I still worked on campus.  But, you know, it got me from point A to point B.
Story_ID: 49165
Speaker 1: Now, with that, I'm just tryin' to understand what was happening socially.  Now--and a--and just putting some of this in context, 'cause this is still, let's see, 19--you start 1956 and finished in '60' [1960]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and a couple of questions come to mind.  One, I'm wondering like you--when you said you, you pledged [Omega Psi Phi] and I was thinking, where, not up in Bates [College in Lewiston, Maine]?  But I understand that part.  But, what--what was that community of blacks students like in this sort of Northeast?  What were--what was--what were they like?  Background-wise that--
Speaker 2: In, in Maine or in Boston?
Speaker 1: Maine and Boston, as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The numbers were not that much different in the schools.
Speaker 2: Nah, it was in Maine, at Bates, we started getting a few more, and finally my senior year, we got the first female who wouldn't date any of the black guys.  That's another story (laughter).  But, also, I started dating at Bates and, in fact, my senior year I didn't go down to Boston that much.  So, I found something that on campus that was quite interesting and so, you know, things do change.
Speaker 1: Now, so, interracial, you were in a--dating--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Interracially
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, right?
Speaker 2: Yup.
Speaker 1: And was that--that, that, that was not--it was--was it--what he had told you?  I mean what was his--that you're--
Speaker 2: Nate Boone.
Speaker 1: Nate Boone.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Is that what Nate--is it-was it like--what Nate had told you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, he had married that way.  So, yeah, it was, on campus, even in the city, there was zero problems and there was fairly free and, and hope and so, they had zero problems.
Speaker 1: And, what--so--I'm trying--so--okay, so that was the community there.  What was the community like in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: In Boston, because there was no college campus, so to speak, you just had students coming in from all over.  The thing there was what's happening and you go to the various parties, and so on.  And there I had a good network because running track you get to know certain people.  Through the Q's I knew a lot of people.  And then through my sister, she knew a lot of people.  So, I had a good time in Boston.  Every time I'd go down there, it was like, in fact I even, I even thought about going to grad school down there 'cause it was, it was fun.  I had a great time.
Speaker 1: Now, you've been--did you take time off between graduation and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So now, at your grad--did your parents come to your graduation.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did they know about your interracial dating?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes, yeah I did bring her by the house one time (laughter).
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Esther Douglas] say?
Speaker 2: My mom is cool.  You know, she--I can tell she wasn't overjoyed but at least she was very civilized.  So, she was, she was okay.
Speaker 1: What did your grandmother say?
Speaker 2: Grandmother didn't say anything.  So I know she was a little bent out of shape (laughter).
Story_ID: 49166
Speaker 1: And, so, so you go--you--so what are you thinking?  Oh, wait, wait, I want to touch upon the Physics.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I spent more time on that.  What--you--how--how was your class work there?  And, what were you--were you--did you find that this area was one that you want to continue--
Speaker 2: It was good.
Speaker 1: Be challenged and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it got to the point where we had two Physics professors but I remember having class with just myself and another person.  So you really got immersed in it.  And you really got a good feeling for what was going on, both the laboratory work and the classroom work and my senior year, I became a lab assistant.  So beside, you know, running track, and so forth, I also had to make sure that--that I was head of laboratory of, you know, undergrads.  And, it was--it worked out very nicely.
Speaker 1: Now how did you seek out Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] then to go to?
Speaker 2: I actually applied to two Boston [Massachusetts] schools and two California schools.  Didn't apply to Howard and Howard contacted me.  And they had a Fellowship given by the Defense Department and so they asked if I wanted to apply and was interested in also applying for that Fellowship.  Yeah, I thought about it.  I remember going to Howard when I was running track in the springtime--the Penn Relays in Philadelphia were big.  And then the Quantico Relays in Virginia and and Virginia, I remember going up to Washington, D.C. on the weekend, on Friday and Saturday night with the track guys, and I remember being in a car outside of the dormitories and seeing all those beautiful women there.  I made a mental note, okay, that's an interesting school.  So Howard had at least a good image in my mind.  But, probably the thing that really was interesting was, just before graduation, I was called into the Dean of Faculty Office, I couldn't understand why.  And they sat me down and said, "John, I want to talk about your exams that you took for"--I guess they called it graduate record exam that you had to take, verbal and the math part, and said I had the highest score on the math part of any graduating senior.  So that was kind of neat.  And wanted to congratulate me on it.  So, I think you probably want to ask me, "You sure you didn't cheat" (laughter)?  But it, it--going to Howard was a breathe of fresh air.  I really enjoyed Bates [College in Lewiston, Maine].  I became a Trustee in Bates and so forth but really going to a black school was best thing that could happen.  The first day I was on campus, I just stood in front of the--the library and just--my mouth drawn down just looking at the sights.  And there was--it was great to be there.  Also, for a roommate, I had a guy who went to Bates for one year and then ended up going to Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia].  Keep in mind, Benjamin Mays, who was head of Morehouse for many years, was a Bates graduate.  Yup.  In fact they have a building there for him.  So, and they have a joint exchange with Bates and--and Morehouse.  But, in any event, it was--it was interesting 'cause I had some good roommates.  You were in graduate school so you're on a different level but you have the fraternities so, you know, you immediately can get into the social life.  And, I found, I got two educations out of Howard.  The education in Physics, which was great and education from the social point of view, which was also great.  The professors at Howard, a lot of them came out from industry, from the bureau of standards, from the Naval Research Labs, and so on.  So, they were very, very sharp and we also got equipment that was left over from those places.  It was fantastic.  I had my own lab and my own experiments, and so on. And to me this was, this was quite exciting.  And I decided to do my thesis work and work under the department head, Dr. [Herman] Branson.  For obvious reasons, if you can get the department head on your side, then you don't have to worry about anybody else.  And, so it was working out very nicely.  I was thinking about going for a Doctorate but at least I was working toward my Masters.
Story_ID: 60150
Speaker 1: When--okay--so you get there, do you find that the--how do you find the quality of education between, you know, in the graduate program between Bates [College in Lewiston, Maine] and-and [Howard University]
Speaker 2: Bates was--yeah, a good total package background.  You got a lot of hands-on experiments, things of this nature and then a lot of the, the theory behind it, but not the heavy, heavy, heavy theory, but good solid theory.  And we even had to do a thesis, you know, in undergrad school, but at Howard [University], it was heavy, heavy theory.  All the classroom work was theory and yet for my dissertation, since I had my own lab, it was fantastic because I could really get into good experimentation.  And, so, when I left Howard, I really felt very, very strong in terms of my skill set.  Now, I had nothing to compare it with.  I remember when I was at Bates, taking some job interviews, and I remember IBM [International Business Machines] offered me a job and, so good, I want to work in your research lab and they said, "Oh, no, oh, no."  I said, "But I'm a Physicist."  They said, no, we only go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and take, you know, Masters or Doctorates so you'll be a sales person.  I said, "I don't want to be a sales person."  That was a dumb move on my part but I didn't realize that sales people make what they do.  So, at Howard I was determined to be--get into research and I remember after, after getting my Masters, I was kinda burned out and that summer I had to take my first trip West, as a matter of fact, and we drove Chicago [Illinois], and all the way down to the West Coast, and I can remember going down Highway 101 and seeing Lockheed [Research Laboratories]. So when it came time for job interviews, I had Lockheed, and the whole bunch of job interviews set up.  And I would go in to Lockheed and the first time in my life, there were people saying, "No, come see us first."  They had three divisions.  They had Marietta, Georgia, Sunnyvale, in Burbank [California], and so I went to Sunnyvale only because I remember seeing Sunnyvale and, the guy looked at my records, said a few things.  He said, "Well, I'm, I'm gonna offer you a, I think it was $8,800 a year.  And at the time that was an astronomical sum.  And I, like a fool, said, "I'll take it."  (laughter)  I did no negotiation.  I didn't really see the rest of the--and I just said, "I'll take it."  And I ended up having the best offer of any grad that year but, it just, to me, it just seemed like, "Wow, this is, this was great."  And, and it was in the research labs, too.  So, I was, I was sold.
Speaker 1: So, when did you--what were--so--when you were at--at Howard and when you sought that out after the IBM--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You were saying, okay, I need to--I want to be a research physicist.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, were your thoughts at that point of going to someplace like Lockheed?
Speaker 2: Yes, when IBM Research said, any research lab associated with a major company were some of the independent places, I hadn't really researched it that much but any major company that had a good solid research lab that could use a physicist.
Speaker 1: Now, are you newly married at this point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, you're not.
Speaker 2: I am, I am (laughter)--I'm running hard.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's cute.
Story_ID: 60151
Speaker 1: So you come out to, you know, California.  You--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: You've been all over the place at this point.
Speaker 2: I left, was at a party at Howard [University] and I told my roommate, "By the way, I'm leaving.  And, so, I'm going out West, taking this job.  And, so, don't panic" but I didn't tell anyone, I just kind of left and there were a lot of people saying, "Whatever happened to John?"  So, got out here and didn't know a soul and knew one person, and that was the guy who sat next to me in junior high school, Drake, who was also in high school.  He had relocated to Sacramento [California] with his parents and so I got out there, I stayed at his house for a while and didn't--finally found a place in Palo Alto [California] where Lockheed Research Labs (unclear) and, it was meeting people--was a little tricky but good news about California, almost everyone is from some place.  And so it was, it was an adventure.  And, of course, my first day at work was also an adventure.  You know, you're up against the, the MIT's [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and the CalTech's [California Institute of Technology] and some of these very heavy schools.  And, you know, you're not sure of your background versus their background.  But I found especially on the experimental side, I was hands--I was head and shoulders above them.  'Cause we had a lot more actual work in the theory, they were probably a little bit better.  But in terms of working experiments, the laboratories, and getting things done, worked out very nicely.  So, it--that was my first really job of building my confidence.
Story_ID: 60152
Speaker 1: And what types of things were you working on [at Lockheed Research Laboratories]?
Speaker 2: We were doing work-- things I can talk about.  I was in the Thermal Physics Department and we were doing things, mainly with the space program.  For example, the coatings that they were going to coat the space craft that was going to the moon.  It was a white coating and so we were testing that and we came up with an interesting discovery, such that we stopped the whole program because it would have been a total disaster.  The experiments they were doing, essentially bombarding these white pigments-- there were titanium docks--like pigments with electrons, protons, all that kind of stuff that you find up in the atmosphere.  And then they would take it out of the vacuum chamber and test it.  And say, "Oh, it works."  We did--it sounds dumb--we did the first testing in vacuum and it found out that there was great damage to these surfaces and the space craft went up and all would have been lost.  So, that was--that was nice.  Also, the visor for the astronauts, we had to come up with a material and we ended up doing gold, which I tried to get a little on the side but couldn't.  But gold was perfect in terms of keeping out the ultraviolet and allowing them to see.  But we did a lot of different--a lot of classified things and so forth.
Speaker 1: And this--this is for the--I mean, actually as a time period--this is an expensive time--I mean--important time period especially's relating to the space industry.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a go-go years.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 60153
Speaker 1: And there wasn't a sense when you got to Lockheed [Research Laboratories] that you were a black person?  Was there a sense about that?
Speaker 2: Ah--
Speaker 1: In terms of assignments somewhere--
Speaker 2: Yet, the research labs--I'm guessing, but there were maybe 70 scientists and I remember there were three of us that there African American and it could have been because that was the year they were starting to recruit minorities and so I'm sure initially there was a-- I remember my supervisor, he actually did have a red neck and I remember him saying to me that he had moved from an area because there were too many black folks moving in there.  I'm like, "Oh my goodness."  But he was amazing person 'cause he would tell you just what he thought and so when we got our first house in Sunnyvale [California], guess who moved next door (laughter)?  Yup.  I'm glad we were there first and we ended up, obviously, being very, very close but still, you know, he would tell you like it is.  But he was, he was in your corner but he had a strange way of--of demonstrating that.  So--
Speaker 1: Hum, that's amazing.
Story_ID: 60154
Speaker 1: So did you--what--how would you recap your career there, you know at Lockheed [Research Laboratories], 'cause you held several different positions.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Went up the--the ladder--fairly rapidly in terms of title.  The--in the research labs, the key is to publish.  You have to publish and so I decided on my first paper to publish it by myself.  Well, that's easier said than done and so that was a learning curb experience, but it worked out and I finally published this paper and made the presentation to the symposiums and all that kind of stuff, got it published.  After that, I was always jointly publishing papers but I used to average one or two a year and that was sort of putting stars on your, on your door 'cause each time you published, that was, that was good.  And also going out and getting contracts so you'd continue research.  It was a definite business in the research labs.  The last two years at Lockheed I won the award for the best paper in the whole company back-to-back.  So, I--I felt that I was hitting stride.
Speaker 1: Now, so you worked there from two, four six--
Speaker 2: About six years.
Speaker 1: Six years, okay.  And what--what is not satisfying about that?
Speaker 2: Back in the '60's [1960s], the late '60's [1960s], this--the go-go years of the stock markets, similar to what we had the last few years before the bubble burst and people were making money hand over fist and physicist people in research labs were playing the market 'cause they was there.  And I couldn't understand why I was losing money and to me that was very frustrating being a physicist--I'm trying to analyze everything.  And I remember I had a broker, I called him Deep Throat--you know he would get on the phone and whisper, "Got this stock, it's really hot."  Yeah, right (laughter).  So, I started taking some business courses at nights, in the Graduate School of Business at Santa Clara [University of Santa Clara in California] and took a couple of Accounting courses and a Finance course and I wasn't sure what I wanted to do but I wanted to mix business and research.  To get up to the top of the research labs, almost definitely, had to have a Ph.D. and, and if you left the research labs and went into their main facilities, and that work didn't really interest me.  So, I wanted to get more into something which combined technology and business but I had no idea what it was gonna be.

Speaker 1: And, how did you end up getting to Bank of America?
Speaker 2: I read an article one time in 'Barron's Magazine' called, "Write Your Own Ticket".  It was about security analyst and, and I said, "That's it, that's what I wanna be.  That's perfect."  And this is in '68' [1968].  So, I can remember seeing an ad in the paper about a security analyst and the market was going just through the roof, it was really great.  And I remember calling and, the headhunter saying, "Oh, yeah, you had background from Lockheed [Research Laboratories] and taken some courses in business and, ah, perfect."  And then I went up to see him and he looked at me, and this was when they can tell you what they thought.  They said, "Well, you have two strikes against you.  One, you don't have any experience yet and two you're black and there are no blacks in this industry."  And I said, "Okay."  And they said, "Well, I have two openings but one of 'em, they're not ready."  And I would tell you the name of them, but they're still in business.  It was a brokerage firm.  They're just not ready but he said try Bank of America, you know, see what happens.  And, so, I went for the interview and they were shocked and they made me take an exam.  They've never had any of the analysts take an exam and I think they probably took a vote throughout the whole bank but they eventually hired me and--and--and I was one of twelve analyst in their Trust Department.  At the time they had about 12 billion dollars under management and I was doing the technology stocks and I remember they put me under a guy who was supposed to be my boss and I'm sure they told him, keep a close eye on this guy.  And--and I'll never forget the first week, I was petrified 'cause I didn't understand the language.  I mean, their bankers were talking about these things.  I said, "What in the world are they talking about?"  But once you pick up the language, then it wasn't too hard and my first recommendation to the bank, and it was their fourth largest position that they had was, sell Lockheed.  And I remember presenting it.  You had to get in the conference room, they had all the portfolio managers around and then you're on the speaker with Los Angeles [California].  They have theirs down there and you're laying out why you should sell and--and the stock was in the 50's at the time and I remember two guys just getting up and walking out the room.  And I said, "Oh, geez, did it this time."  Well, they went out and sold their holdings and the stock eventually went to seven.  So, from overnight I went from, who was this guy to, the hot analyst in nine months.  And we got out of all of aerospace and, and so I had a job offer nine months later from a mutual fund.  It was a billion dollar mutual fund in San Francisco, ISI [International Strategy and Investment], and they were going to double my salary.  And the bank, bless their heart, came back and said, "No, we can't double but we'll give you 50 percent increase," which for the bank was really great.  But--and I ended up going with a mutual fund.  And, then I was off to the races.
Story_ID: 60156
Speaker 1: I mean this is--it said--well, let me--let's put this--I'd like putting things in historical context, too.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: The--United States is opening up a little bit at these times.  You're coming along, but still blacks in corporate America hadn't quite--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: They were happenings, sort of, weren't they?  Sound familiar?  But not in the financial--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Area--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: Like this--
Speaker 2: I mean as an analyst, there was no one.  Especially in any kind of major institution.  And I remember my first field trip which I took when my supervisor was down L.A. [Los Angeles] to see this company, Lear Siegler.  And I remember the CEO and the CFO looking at me and saying, "Oh, you're Mr. Douglas, fine."  So they took us to lunch and they took us--I didn't realize it at the time, it was the Bel-Air Country Club and there's, you know, Dinah Shore, and all these stars right around.  I'm trying to concentrate on asking this guy a question.  I'm looking at all these people.  And it was--it was tough.  But it was also another world that I just didn't realize existed and where you had so much power over these companies and also over the brokerage firms, they're trying to get your business.  So it was fun.
Story_ID: 60157
Speaker 1: Now what is your father [John Douglas] saying about this.  Is he delighted or is he thinking, why did you go and become--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: A physicist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he died when I was at Howard [University].
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: So, he didn't get a chance to see this.  My mom [Esther Douglas] did and she was--she was delighted and I always see my sister [Joan Douglas] kind of follow it too.  But, no, I'm sure he would have had, what is this guy doing?  But he probably--
Speaker 1: Might have been happy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was--and it was in his--his footsteps.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 60158
Speaker 1: Now, you work--are we at ISI [International Strategy and Investment], or are we at Bear Stearns?
Speaker 2: We're at ISI and that was a great place because they had a lot of money and ended up with about four analysts.  There'd be six portfolio to manage, so you were doing everything there.  You would just--and, and since they could make decisions quickly, you just say, "Hey, we should do this and boom."  The brokerage liked us because we could make decisions and give, you know, the commissions very easily.  So, I learned a lot and I was very aggressive and--and you really get into the flow of things.  It was smart people there and really learned a lot there.  So, my boss was the research director there and he went to Bear Stearns in New York.  And so he kept saying, "You gotta go to New York.  You gotta get experience" and so forth and so that's how I ended up going to New York with Bear Stearns as a Senior Analyst.
Speaker 1: This is really amazing at the time.
Story_ID: 60159
Speaker 1: So--so how many then-there are no black people anywhere to be found?
Speaker 2: No, you--you're starting--I remember going around, now I'm on the sell side.  I remember I ran across a guy at Prudential, Washington is his last name.  I was a technology person and then there was another guy, a junior analyst at another firm.  But you could count on one hand the numbers, but at least you were seeing when Barbara Boyles [sic, Barbara Bowles]--I remember she was--I think she was starting out then, maybe not.
Speaker 1: I don't think she was--you mean that-[HM] Barbara Bowles?
Speaker 2: Bowles, yup.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now probably not because--
Speaker 1: I don't think--I mean she may have been out of business for a while?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think I remember her later on.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yup.
Speaker 1: Now, when you--so what are you learning--what is fascinating about this area because it's not an area that many black people seen and definitely not at this level?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that greed is the most important factor.  That people could care less.  You could be purple with 10 arms as long as you could make money for a person.  And at--you got to look at, you know, how do you make money.  Where's the action?  What's happening?  Where are the trends and you gotta make decisions quickly and your decisions can--can push stocks up or down and you could be quoted on "Associated Press" and just watch a stock get tanked or go up.  It's just--it was amazing power.  You lived a very, very hard and fast life.  I remember my schedule, I was looking at 'em.  I mean from sun up to way past sundown, you're busy seeing clients, making calls, writing reports.  I mean, when you're on the road and it's just--it's just--you take life--you take years off your life.  But, it's a very exciting because, you know, you know you're--you're a dealer.
Story_ID: 60160
Speaker 1: Now, what is your wife [Hazel Douglas] thinking of all of this?
Speaker 2: "Where's, where's my husband." 'Cause when I used to--I lived in Connecticut and the commute, when everything worked right, was two hours on the train and the subway and then the train and then driving.  And my son was, it's about three years old then.  So, you know, that was the negative part.  We were making good money, lived in a very nice house in Stamford and all of that but the family life was shot.
Story_ID: 60161
Speaker 1: So you go to, okay, so you're, you're back now--you're back on the East Coast.  Do you like being back on the East Coast?
Speaker 2: No, in fact, the moment we unpacked the moving van, I realized I had made a mistake.  The--the pressure, commute, the, you know, rudeness, it was just the way of life, it's hard getting used to when you've been in California for such a long period of time.  What I did like was the challenge and also the people you meet when you finally become friends with you--they're friends forever 'cause it takes awhile to get to know a New Yorker.  Connecticut was nice.  I just didn't have enough time to enjoy it.  The weekends were--were good.  But, again, it took a little getting used to.  And, so, I kept saying, you know, since I was covering the technology industry, a lot of the companies were still out West and so I would get out of here quite often and say, "You know (laughter), if I could figure out a way to get back," but it took three years before I got back.
Speaker 1: Now--did you find your--your background as a physicist helped?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And why?
Speaker 2: Let's say I was going up to Boston and talking to Putnam [Investments] or Keystone or any of the funds.  I know the--and they would surround you with people and so on, and they'd be hitting you with questions.  I mean sometimes you're literally surrounded with people.  And I remember when I would look at something and analyze something, I'd wanna get every little minor detail and so, when people would ask you questions, I'd make a habit of giving them 70 percent.  They'd come back and then you'd throw out the rest of it and they'd say, fine, he knows his stuff and--and at the time I had an unbelievable memory and you could just spit out facts and little--little--little things which they--they would make sense--they'd--and they'd, you know, made sense to the person hearing it because, oh yes, it adds to the picture and the trend, and so on.  But that helped immensely.
Speaker 1: And, there was no--did you feel that any of your opportunity--any opportunities were foreclosed to you because you were black?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bear Stearns I felt--they had this thing where you couldn't go out and talk to their institutional clients until you'd written some massive thing, which I finally did.  And, to me, that was a waste because I knew the stuff and, you know, I had a lot of knowledge and yet I couldn't, you know, go out and talk to their clients.  So, we didn't hit it off and I ended up going to Reynolds [and Company] which was a southern company based in the South but there main headquarters was in New York [New York City, New York].  But all of their offices were in the South and so you would think that that would be, you know, really bad, but Reynolds took me in and I was running through the South.  I was running all over the country and just hitting homeruns, after homeruns.  I was their biggest producer in terms of getting clients.  And so, they just loved me.  And that's when I realized that, you know, they could care less as long as you could make money for a person.
Speaker 1: And why did you leave there?
Speaker 2: I was promised that I could go back to the West Coast and a new research director came and then so, I decided, oh I'm going back and so I took a job here but there was a--it was almost a six-year bear market from '68' [1968] to '74' [1974] and it's horrible time to be in the stock market.  And, so, it got to the point where, after a while, you know, you said, "Is this worth it?"  And, yes, I had worked for Bear Stearns and then for a retail house, which was Reynolds, and then I went to work with the James Capel, which is a British firm.  In fact the oldest brokerage firm in the world.  And I just said, "You know, I wanna get off of this.  I'm tired, I wanna get into a corporate environment that is a little more stable."  And that's when I made my six-year switch.
Speaker 1: To Castle and--
Speaker 2: Castle and Cooke [Inc.].
Story_ID: 60162
Speaker 1: You said that you measure your life in sort of six years (laughter) phases?
Speaker 2: I--it's--it's by accident but I hope there's some rationale there because whenever you get into something new, there's a learning curb and it starts out like this and it goes up pretty steep and then it starts tailing off.  And when it starts tailing off, it just happens to be about six years.  And, so, it's good to look for something new, some new challenge.
Speaker 1: Now, Castle and Cooke--that was--how did you--from James--is it Capel?
Speaker 2: Capel.
Speaker 1: Capel.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: How did you realize your--talk your way into-Castle and Cooke?
Speaker 2: You're right, they were looking for someone to be manager in their planning and development and mergers and acquisitions.  And I, as an analyst, fit that description.  The problem is, my specialty was technology.  And I had consumer electronics but technology.  And so I had to convince them that I knew the food industry.  I told them I eat every day and, you know, etcetera.  And I guess they took a flyer and it--it worked out.  All the new MBAs would come in and be under me and I'd assign 'em to different things that we were looking at.  We were looking at this industry or this company to acquire, or whatever.  And that was--that was interesting.  What was probably--what I liked about it, every quarter, every three months, we got to meet with the Chairman, the President, the two Executive Vice Presidents and my boss, who was the Director of Strategic Planning, and his boss, who was the VP of Planning and Development.  And my job was to keep quiet.  And that's not my nature and so I started right off the bat, you know, making comments, you know, and saying, "Well, you know, blah, blah, blah."  And after awhile they started paying attention and within a year I got an offer from one of the Executive Vice Presidents to head up investor relations and public relations and also corporate communications and corporate advertising and, to me, that was exciting because I was able to leap two levels.  And initially I reported to someone in Hawaii.  That was also nice, you going over there often.  The first time I wore a business suit and then I realized, nah, that doesn't make it (laughter).  But, Hawaiian companies are especially, Castle [and] Cooke, had a--in a way a plantation mentality but I have to give them credit.  They had operations in some of the damnedest places, like in Honduras, and Nicaragua, and Thailand, the southern part of Philippines where, they were fighting.  And yet they managed to stay in business without a--without a problem.  And, it was very interesting how they were running their operations.  And, so, to get in that position where you had to know every little division and you had to keep Wall Street informed and you had to educate them and you had to do things which would never been done before.  I--I actually put them on the map.  It was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 60163
Speaker 1: You know I would like you to just give, you know, just as I had asked, about Castle and Cooke.  Just give some perspective 'cause people don't know that name.
Speaker 2: Um-hum
Speaker 1: I mean outside (unclear).  You know they don't know who--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Castle and Cooke necessarily is, so--
Speaker 2: Castle and Cooke is--is Dole Foods for all practical purposes.  In fact, they're called "Dole Foods" now.  But they are multi-products, international.  At the time they were a couple of billion in sales, back then, they're much larger now.  But they have big real estate holdings in Hawaii.  For example, the island of Lanai is, they own the whole island.  It's on their books for 250 dollars an acre.  That's another thing (laughter).  But they also have major food presence in the fresh products area in, you know, pineapple and lettuce and mushrooms and, etcetera.  But they're also in this, so many different things around the world, insurance, freighters, Coca-Cola things, and just--they even have a pool sweep division.  So, getting my arms around what is Castle and Cooke, all in little groups and divisions.  They were big in fish, Bumble Bee Tuna was their big brand.  And so just when you thought like I know everything there was some operation over here that was different.  Also, when you get out in the fields, especially when you get outside the U.S., it's a different mentality.  I mean you're from corporate headquarters coming out and, oh, they get treated very well but it's just a different mentality and it's very interesting how the company was able to treat their employees--keep everybody happy, stay out of trouble because, I remember in Nicaragua, going there, I mean it was barbed wire around the hotel I was staying at and it is, you know, and then being in the southern Philippines down in Mindanao and Davao and General Santos [City] here.  I remember hearing gunshots up in the mountains--I'm like (laughter).  I felt that I was in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or some place.  But anyway, it was--it was--it was an education.  It was definite education.
Story_ID: 60164
Speaker 1: Do you think of the things that you had done that it [Castle and Cooke, Inc.] was maybe the highest on the list--besides maybe ISI [International Strategy and Investment] or--
Speaker 2: It gave me a chance to peek inside of the tent.  To see what was going on.  I remember I watched Dole [Foods] put a company out of business.  I was just in the President's office and watched him do that and, and that told me personally, never get in the way of a big company 'cause they can squash you.  So I learned a lot of lessons about a big company mentality.  It was a good company and my immediate boss, who was my mentor, had a Ph.D. in Business.  He had taught at Harvard [University]--was the, I think the Assistant Dean of Business School at Stanford [University] and was the former secretary, assistant secretary in the Air Force.  So he was really top-notch guy but he was--he was good.  But I kept him on his toes because we were always coming up with different things.  And--and--and the exposure.  I remember we took management on their first trip to--to Europe to speak to the financial community.  And there were five of us, six of us, and I remember we split up and I'm with the Chairman and the Executive Vice President and myself with the Swiss Banks and the German bankers and the Rothschilds and so on and I'm saying, "This is okay.  This is living."  And I remember I had to go over to Japan by myself to speak to the, not Japan, Hong Kong, excuse me, the Hong Kong Society of Security Analysts.  A great experience.  A lot of travel, a lot of exposure, a lot of different things.  We've been--I was involved in--with the farm workers [United Farm Workers] in, in trying to get them to settle and that turned out to be a valuable experience--Cesar Chavez and so forth.  Go to meet with the bond rating agencies with the VP of Finance in New York and just almost anything.  And so, to me, that was probably the highlight of really gaining knowledge about what's going on.  Also, it completed the circuit.  For example, you're an investor, somebody has to come out with the report to say, here's what's happening in the company.  That report is then looked at by Wall Street, by both the sell and buy side, and they react.  They tell their customers, and depending on where you are in the customer list, then you finally get the information and you decide what to do.  That piece of the puzzle where you create the information about a company completed the whole cycle.  So I had a chance to work in every part of the cycle.  And then it paid off.  It really paid off.
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of these things what you're describing was when you were head of investor--Director of Investor in Public Relations.  Right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did you find--and--and during that time you're also exposed to a multi-national corporation in its, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Fullest sense.  Did you find yourself under any pressure--feeling under pressure, you know, to perform and, you know, mean like you said when, you know, were taking the, you know, the head team over to Europe for the first time?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes, initially I remember my first--first thing that I decided to do--you have to do the annual report and that's a very sacred document and I remember they had a person who was doing it forever and I looked at it and I said, "This is ugly."  And so I took it upon myself to switch the people that were doing it.  I remember making a decision at the TWA Club at the airport and telling these guys, "Go for it, you know, and we're late and we got to have this thing.  Don't let me down or else I'm out of a job."  And I remember when my boss found out that we had switched, he hit the roof and I said, "Relax, take it easy."  You know if I screw up, have my job and we came in with a great report.  Everybody loved it and from then on we were off to the races.  And, again, sometimes you have to take a job, understand your downside but, you know, you gotta be out there.
Story_ID: 60165
Speaker 1: Now, talk also about the meeting with Cesar Chavez.
Speaker 2: That was exciting because I was called on by my--my boss to--to debate the United Farm Workers, I think it was Safeway, one of the big chains, was thinking about whether to honor this strike they were having on the mushrooms.  And this had been going on for three years and there was picketing even on the George Washington Bridge [New York City, New York].  They had banners, you know, so it was one of these long type strikes.  And I remember my boss telling me, "Don't worry about it, just, just show up, you know, nothing to lose and don't worry."  And so when I got there, one, I think they were surprised that someone from the company showed up.  They were definitely surprised that it was a black person and then on top of that, instead of them having Hispanic, they had a Jewish person.  And so I was able to just have a field day and I remember I kept pointing to an empty chair and saying, "Well, we're ready to sit down and talk but you're not."  Just--just having--I had nothing to lose and that's when it's fun.  And so afterwards I was approached and they said are you really serious, you're willing to talk.  I said, sure.  I didn't know but I said sure.  So, well, can you be down the farm, down at Southern California in the morning and we'll start negotiation.  So I called my boss that night and he was, he was shocked and he said, "Well, why don't you go down and see what you can do."  And so I flew down and I didn't realize they had violence the day before and I'm going through the picket line and thank goodness I'm tall 'cause stood over everyone and they couldn't understand who was this masked man.  Who was this person walking through here.  But they let me through and then I had to go back out and I remember they kept pointing to this payphone and so I picked it up and there was Cesar Chavez on the other line.  "Mr. Douglas, I'm glad you had a chance to come down and, and we understand that you do have a willingness to negotiate now."  And I said, that's correct.  Well, let us meet in this church and we will start to negotiations, which we did.  And we had a three-day, around the clock negotiations.  And he was, he would step in but he was mostly out.  And whenever we would present something, they would huddle, they would all go out en masse, talk to Cesar, then come back and then say, "No," or whatever.  But, it was like negotiating against a religion.  It was unbelievable experience and plus we did reach a settlement, so, I was really proud of that.
Story_ID: 60166
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing I wanna ask you is that, isn't this a time that multi-national corporations who are American businesses, are becoming increasingly aware about how--you know other cultures and they're trying to sensitize management about, you know, different cultures and how to handle, operate within the--is that around this time?
Speaker 2: It was and it was always emphasize you're a guest in their country and be sure to treat them that.  Castle and Cooke was very smart to bring up natives from the country, take 'em back to the U.S., get 'em trained and then bring them back in senior positions so that there was good integrations.  For example, Nicaragua, when they had their big blowout, the first boat out was a banana boat because the country realizes it employs people, this is producing money for us and therefore we can't hurt this industry.  Yeah, we got a war going on over here but we gotta protect this.  And that was very smart on the part of Castle and Cooke.
Speaker 1: It was.
Story_ID: 60167
Speaker 1: So, what else do you think you learned there during your time there?
Speaker 2: I was the first black African Amer-- investor relations person in the country.  And so that was a whole new area and we, we won awards.  The best annual report and so on and--and I was also on the board, the National Board of Investor Relations.  People so--I got to a point where before you never have a black person speak about money to your shareholders.  Keep in mind the owners of a company, typically CEO and so forth, that's their wealth.  You know, you going to trust that to a black person?  Now they realize, you know, that could be a smart move because look what he's been able to do and how he works with the street, and so forth.  And so that was very beneficial and, I think, that that opened up a lot of doors.  Because before that was like, no, we couldn't have that.  You know, you got the annual meetings, you got all shareholders, you got the street, you know.  And someone black handling this?  No, in fact it was the best thing that could ever happen.
Speaker 1: To them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Because I understood the street.  I understood shareholders.  We knew how to explain things.  Our annual reports, for example, we explained the growing process of a banana tree.  And, in fact, we did some things that just, you know, were totally different.  We were speaking before the New York Society of Security Analysts, our management, and so I decided, you know what, I think we'll have a meeting afterwards when the banana boat unloads down on the Lower East Side of New York.  Fine, so after that we invited the press and security analysts to come on board and--and see, you know, what happens.  Well, the boat was running late.  I was going to kill the captain, but finally it got there and we gave out little certificates to each person that was on there.  A tree has been planted in Honduras in your name and will eventually bear fruit.  And everybody, you know, really got interested and got excited.  Well, seven months later in the middle of the winter, we had people going around with a box of Dole bananas to these people and they just flipped.  We were on ABC, WABC [New York] station, eating bananas on the six o'clock news, Dole bananas.  I mean it was just a simple thing like that and we would do things for people who will remember the company.  Remember that we're in the fresh fruits.  And that's why I had total freedom.  And after a while I didn't even have to get it approved and just go ahead and do it.
Speaker 1: And, how--what did you learn about building team too?
Speaker 2: We were always short-staffed.  Castle and Cooke had 40,000 employees, in my department, we had something like five or six people and we had, you know, corporate advertising, community relations, investor relations, public relations, and so on.  So we had people doing everything.  Secretary would have to go to New York, fly to New York, work on setting up a booth at the Coliseum [New York], work with the Unions, make sure it's manned, make sure it gets turned down and fly back.  This is our secretary.  Everybody was doing everything.  And so, everybody had job security because there's no way they could get out with doing less.  But, we do things quickly.  If some crisis happened, we jump to it.  But, that was the beauty of it.  We just got a chance to do everything.  It was fun.  It was exciting.  It's not boring, that's for sure.
Story_ID: 60168
Speaker 1: Now, what--why did you end up leaving?
Speaker 2: I was two steps from the Presidency.  I reported to Executive Vice President, who reported to the President.  But I had a better chance of jumping across the Grand Canyon than getting up to the Presidency.  I had been offered the Treasurer's job but, again, that step up to the Presidency was, I didn't think it was gonna happen.  And I started thinking about being an entrepreneur.  And probably I got that from, when I was a security analyst.  I remember helping companies raise funds.  In fact, one of those companies gave me a job offer and they were in Orange County [California] in the heart of the Birches and I remember looking hard 'cause I liked the people, they were great but I just couldn't live in Orange County at that time.  And so I didn't take the job.  But, again, I watch people gain wealth and I felt I have to be an entrepreneur.  And so I was looking for, you know, what to do and I looked at--when I was back in planning and development they had a computer program where you could put in various screens, certain growth rates, certain returns on money and so on.  And at the time the oil industry kept popping up and also broadcasting.  And Castle and Cooke didn't want to get in either one.  I didn't want to get in the oil industry but broadcasting, I started researching it, and the more I got into it, it was like owning a franchise where there wouldn't be any more franchises and yet population was growing and people were definitely communicating and so I wanted to start a television station.  Now, there were no black-owned television stations at the time.  I think once I got started, it was one other black-owned television station [WGPR-TV in Detroit], but we were the second.  So, it was interesting in trying to get a television station.  I remember going down to Austin, Texas and meeting with a person who--who was the CEO of American Stock Exchange Company and they were going to sell their station.  And I remember he--when I walked in, I don't think he realized I was black.  He looked and--and we sat down and we talked about everything.  And I spent the whole day talking about everything.  And his name was Mr. Tippie (ph) and he said, "Douglas, sure glad you come down here and why don't cha you come on down here again and we'll open up our books to you."  And so they did and actually almost ended up buying that station.  We had four MESBICs [Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies] investors and we only needed one point six million.  The total price was four point six.  They were willing to finance three million, the seller, and all the paperwork was done, closing was set for Dallas [Texas] and one of the company's got greedy and went to Morgan Guaranty Bank and they said, this is a good deal.  Why don't we do it.  You know just this John, this Douglas guy just, you know.  Give him some money but, you know, just get him out the picture and the thing fell through.  But it had a UHF station, NBC, Austin, Texas and an FM.  We were on the edge of the University of Texas campus.  Four point six million.  I'd be smoking cigars now if I had that.  So, but, I learned a lot and we still continue to look and right in my back yard, in San Jose [California], there was a station that hadn't been built and one person had applied for the license and there was a cutoff date of about a month and we got our application in right at--just before five o'clock on that day, the last day.
Speaker 1: So, the MESBICs, were one of--was one of them Syncom [Venture Partners] syndicated--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Station.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yup.
Speaker 1: And who were the others?
Speaker 2: Opportunity Capital [Partners] and then--
Speaker 1: Urban Invest--no--
Speaker 2: No, there's one that went out of business.  It used to be out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I forgot their name so--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But, it was mainly Opportunity Capital and Syncom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 60169
Speaker 1: Now--so you were able to get--you got your application in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: For KS-TV.
Speaker 2: KSTS-TV.
Speaker 1: TS, I'm sorry, TS-TV.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you--and you won?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't do anything.  They just sat on it.  And they sat on it.  Now I working at Castle and Cooke so it wasn't so bad.  But we were playing the waiting game and so finally we decided, this was after two or three years, you know, let's just see if we can buy out our competitor.  We offered them some stock in our company, 10 percent, and--and then an offer to buy 'em out, cash later.  And so they went for it and they say probably wouldn't have won so we finally had it after three years.  And then we had to raise the money and that took forever.  We got the MESBICs in and then we had to get a lease for the equipment, two million dollar plus lease.  We ended up doing--at the time it used to be subscription TV--it was a scramble signal at night and so that was good because they would pay us a certain amount every, every month, almost a hundred thousand a month.  And then we finally got the bank to come in.  I think I had some 40 rejections from bank, from one bank plus this Old Crocker Bank [Crocker National Bank], they're no longer in business, came through with an SBA [Small Business Administration] guaranteed loan and that completed our funding.  Now, good news, bad news.  We closed on our bank, December of '80' [1980] and we're probably within five minutes, the all-time high--the prime--prime was 21 and we paid even higher than prime.  In fact, the Mafia was cheaper money.  So, it was--it was tough.  It was tough.  But we did build it and we went on the air in May of '81' [1981] and as luck would have it in July of '81' [1981], the recession started.  So, it was one of those things that, oh, boy, this is going to be fun but, and then the company that had the pay TV part went under.  They were a public company.  They went in Chapter 11 after four months and so we were out there without a life raft, in the middle of an ocean trying to stay afloat and that's when we had to scramble and we also learned that we had general program where we had 'Batman,' we had the old Bill Cosby Shows and so on and so we decided to specialize.  We took financial programing during the day and that's when Silicon Valley was starting to roll and people were interested in what was happening there.  And then at night we did Asian program--announced the start of the Asian Market out here.  And so we kept those two going and it seemed to work.
Story_ID: 60170
Speaker 1: And did you--what--how was this experience, you know, compared to what you thought and what did it teach you?
Speaker 2: It makes you very humble because you have on track shoes and you're running just to stay afloat, keep the thing going.  Being an entrepreneur, you sign every check, you know that money is going out, you gotta get the money coming in, you're out there selling, you're trying to do everything.  And it--it teaches you that it's not like running a Castle and Cooke or major company.  It's like running your own little small, little sweat shop and then--then you really got to make it happen.
Speaker 1: And were you disappointed you had left at any point at Castle and Cooke with all the delays and, you know, the ups and downs and--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: You know that you're bright and you've got a lot of skill level and--
Speaker 2: No, 'cause it was-it was exciting.  I remember the day we flipped on the switch and, thank God, it worked (laughter).  I mean it was very thrilling and at the time we had the most powerful station in the world.  We had the first circular polarized station sending it out on two different planes and it was close to five million watts in every plane so, it was so powerful, the power company every month, they'd bring the bill to us personally.  So that's power (laughter).
Story_ID: 60171
Speaker 1: So talk about--you went to the--you sold, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--we kept it for six years (laughter) but during that period, we did some interesting things.  We started our own morning business show called, 'Business Today.'  It was the first morning business show and it was really good and we had all the bells and whistles.  And--and so we decided to syndicate it, so we had a station in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] taking it, one in Chicago [Illinois], one in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], one in New York and we had a cable system taking it.  We had American Express, Smith Barney.  We had some good advertisers on it too and so that was our first, and I was the news director.  When you're the owner you can be anything you want to be.  But it was great because every morning we had to get up dancing.  "Oh, God, what are we going to do" and--and yet we didn't have big budgets so we had to do things cleverly and yet we did some very good features.  It was well-received.
Speaker 1: Now what did you--you know you had approached the broadcasting industry as an analyst.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And some respects.  You know, remember you said I went through and I looked and there was the oil and there was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Broadcasting.  And were there things that were surprising once you got involved, you know, and had flipped on the switch about the industry and it sort of, idiosyncrasies--
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the things that attracted me to the industry was the fact that UHF stations, the time, this was back in the '70's [1970s], they were just getting on cable, push button tuning, where you didn't have to rotate a dial to get it, made it easier to get and so I thought UHF was the thing to do.  When I got into it, yes, once you're on cable it's great because they can't tell the difference between a VHF and a UHF.  The negative is that we had 65 cable systems in the Bay Area [San Jose, California] and each one you had to bow down to and this was before "must carry" and so that was a rude awakening.
Speaker 1: And were you having to learn a lot about dealing with the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] and the government or participating in those types of groups or--
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: It--it really--we didn't have that much.  We--our original game plan was to see if we could get a CBS or NBC affiliation for San Jose.  San Jose had an ABC station down there, Channel 11, but no CBS or NBC.  And, yes, you had San Francisco which had the stations but San Jose was growing so rapidly and it was getting to be a large city and we did the political route.  We talked to, you know, to senators and congressmen and so on and we did the lobbying at the networks and so on.  We came close but, obviously, we didn't get that.  So, yes, early on I had a lot of contact with the FCC and with government agencies and with networks and so on.  But then after that, not that much.
Story_ID: 60172
Speaker 1: And so 1987, you're out?
Speaker 2: We sold the--we were with venture capitalists and they typically have a five to seven year horizon.  They look at their--their clock and say, "Whoops, it's time to pull the ripcord."  And we had--we had other offers but we had an interesting offer from Telemundo, which was owned by Reliance Group Holdings, Saul Steinberg, was a whiz kid on Wall Street and had this major company.  So we, after heavy duty negotiating, and the venture capitalists were definitely involved in that.  Settled finally on a price that made sense where we made quite a bit of money and yet they got a good deal but we didn't trust them and I think we had three sets of lawyers looking at it because these were sharks from way back and--and I remember the closing was in Wall, it was on Park Avenue, in Mid-Town Manhattan, on a Friday, and we finally closed, signed it and I called my bank to warn 'em that I may have some money in my account for Chase [Bank] and don't panic.  I didn't rob a bank and so when the money was wired in, the venture capitalists took us out and we stayed out all night.  It's a shame you didn't see us that night.  But we had a great time and it was--it was a true celebration.  I remember them saying to me, "John, I know this was like your baby and you hate to give it up," and you really do but you've now completed the circle.  You started something, you built it, developed it and sold it and made money for people.  So now you have a track record.
Story_ID: 49190
Speaker 1: Did we finish the question about investment bankers and dealing with them and what you learned?
Speaker 2: The--with the VC's, I think--
Speaker 1: Right, venture capitalists--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yup.  With VC's, it's--it's really, really interesting relationship because their mind set is to make money several different ways and I see to keep from losing money and then if it's a disaster, to cut their losses short as quickly as they can.  And they also have investors, typically pensions and so forth to look at it, so, yes, they get in your business but they're removed a little bit and--and the good news, they bring a lot to the table.  They--they can be extremely helpful because they have good contacts.  They are seeing it in different perspective.  And sometimes that can be helpful because you're in it.  I mean you're up to here in it.  And, and sometimes they can save your butt.  I remember one time, as I mentioned, we had one of the most powerful stations, TV stations [KSTS-TV in San Jose, California].  In the heart of a TV station is the klystron tube, which at the time back in '80' [1980] was 50,000 dollars each and we had three of 'em because we were circular polarized.  One day, not only one blew out, but two blew out.  And, you know, it's like, "Why me?"  And they only had one manufacturer in this country that made 'em, Varian Associates, down in Palo Alto [California] and the waiting list to get these was long.  I mean, forget the money side of it, was long.  Thank goodness, on the board of one of our VC's, Opportunity Capital, was a person from Varian and we were able to get a tube the next morning and get it installed so we really didn't miss too much or else we would have been, you know, really up that creek.  So, that's one where, you know, they can be unbelievable helpful.
Story_ID: 49191
Speaker 1: Let's put this in, once again, in context in that--so people have some idea of sort of the historical context and that is, in the United States, when it comes to black ownership of media properties, there have been very, very few.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, you know, and Syncom [Venture Partners], who you speak of that's been their focus but even, you know, it's been hard because, you know, there has been a lot of promise with very little that has happened over, I don't know how many years, people have been trying, but over a long period of time.  So the fact that you owned this station was extremely significant.
Speaker 2: Yes, they say we were the second [after WGPR-TV in Detroit] and one measuring stick that I use is if you're getting into something and it's too easy to get in it, there's a reason.  You're trying to get into something and there's so many barriers and they keep throwing these things at, that's a good deal, usually, because they're not going to let you into something that's too good and is so easy unless you just happen to get in there.  And so for us, there were barriers, after barrier, after barrier and as you get in each barrier, you say, this is good.  This is going to make money for you.  And we looked at television as really it's--it's like owning a franchise.  It's like owning the only McDonald's [Corporation] franchise in the Bay Area [California].  It's like having the exclusive niche and that bandwidth, that franchise, that license, really made a big difference and every year would grow and appreciate in value.
Story_ID: 49192
Speaker 1: Now, did you--when you--did you have seller's remorse though afterwards because--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There's a lot to go with.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I mean, there are a lot of, I won't say perks, but when you own a media property, you know--you can--you can control--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: Control a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yup--
Speaker 1: Things.
Speaker 2: I--I did and we had--we had a real tight family.  I remember we had one woman who was from Howard [University], a graduate, just fresh out.  I remember her calling me and saying, "You know, I want a job, yes, yeah right."  Well, if you come out here we'll see what we can do but we're not promising anything.  And we hired her in a low position but she worked her way up and was extremely, extremely good.  Just--just, you know, really makes you proud when you see something like that.  And--and the esprit de corps that we had.  People would work hard and we had a traffic manager, Michelle Mercer, who was switching systems, going from one IBM system to another and, I said, "Well, let us get you some help because we can't have this stumble but it's going to take a lot" and it took her three days around the clock working, just to do it and, I mean, that was--you just can't get that loyalty.  We gave her a trip to Jamaica but, you know, she didn't realize she was getting that but it was just that type of thing was just fantastic.  And that's what you hate to give up.  We had a good, good group.
Story_ID: 49193
Speaker 1: And so what are you deciding after--because you had--did your--your news show--did it stay past that period of time?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't.  And we even had a show which it started.  I remember meeting Robert Johnson in Chinatown for--for dinner.  And I said, Bob, got a great thing, this BET [Black Entertainment Television] thing, but you don't have a news show.  I'll tell you what, why don't you let us produce it, a two minute show, we'll call it 'Headline News' and you sell it and we'll split the profit.  And we just shook on it and agreed and had a contract and we did that for two years with Bob and I didn't realize it was a two-year--that was it 'cause after it was over, you know, it worked from there.  But, it--it worked out beautifully.  Had good advertising.  I remember Mobil Oil was one of the advertisers and IBM.  So we did a lot of things like that.  I remember we had a--music videos were coming in and we got one of the DJ's, a black DJ from one of the urban stations to--on Friday and Saturday night do 'Magic Number Video,' Isaac Stevenson and we had an audience because that was new, videos were hot and then we decided, you know, let's try something.  In the middle of the program, was a three-hour program, we put this little doughnut, of about 10 minutes, called 'College Bounders.'  And it would come in and talk.  It was a call-in show and you could ask questions on how to get into college and so on.  The call-ins we had, it was just unbelievable and it was so big we kept it there.  We also had a full show, an hour show on Saturday mornings on 'College Bounders.'  There's that--that, you know, you feel good about it because the music videos, they're great and so on but at least 'College Bounders' is getting a lot of these kids headed toward college.
Story_ID: 49194
Speaker 1: Now, so, you--I'm just wondering, so, do you take a break after you sell [his tv station KSTS-TV]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: For how long?
Speaker 2: Roughly two years.  I started looking at television and it just didn't make sense because I could see what was happening in cable and with other things.  And so, then I backed off of that and started looking at radio.  And I felt, at the time we were doing a lot of our things in radio and I kept saying, you know, in television, I kept saying, you know, if we were just doing the audio only, it would be a lot easier.  And so, did looking at radio, I found some properties.  An FM in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and an AM in San Francisco [California] and coupled with another FM in Sacramento [California] where we'd be able to package them together and it was gonna cost us 25 million dollars and this is when--this was back in '89' [1989] when you could do leverage buy-outs.  Where you could be highly leveraged and this--these stations were cash flowing very nicely.  So, we were able to get Prudential Capital to put in a, I think, 24 million, roughly.  I put in a half a million and--and yeah, you still ended up with control.  They had some equity but they had a lot of debt in there and we got in business.
Speaker 1: And you got in business with--
Speaker 2: With the PruCapitalist, our investors.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--and so talk about what you've been doing with that.  I mean, now you--I want to lead up to what you're doing but you put together another show that you got syndicated, right?
Speaker 2: A television show or--
Speaker 1: No, no radio.
Speaker 2: Radio.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Not initially.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When we started out, these were stations that were mainly Asian format, in both San Francisco and L.A., and the Asian population was growing and we were running block programming and that is selling it to the individual ethnic groups.  And that worked out very nicely.  So we decided to expand that and we started looking at other markets.  Well, bad news is that PruCapital ran into some problems and they were dissolved into Pru [Prudential] Insurance and so we were without an investor to grow.  And we had to get someone to step up to the plate and Kelso and Company which was a eight billion dollar company, became our investor.  They had about 25 million, the end of one fund that they were willing to put in.  So we were able to get some key stations.  I think we got one in New York City, Chicago [Illinois], we picked up some and so on.  So that was the building of Douglas Broadcasting.  It--it was nice and I had my son [Greg Douglas] working for me and, in fact, he had been at the TV station since he was 12 years old so he'd been really immersed in the business.  And the--the thrust initially was to go after Asian.  And eventually we ended up doing, oh, some 30 different languages.  America was becoming so diversified in terms of languages.  We felt there was an opening.  There was a good market.
Speaker 1: From what did you learn from that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  It's interesting dealing with different ethnic groups.  Sometimes you have a language barrier and especially when you're talking about money.  But as soon as the deal is done, then they start talking perfect English, so it's interesting.  But it--they are very good people.  They're very hard working people and they're very trustworthy people.  Typically, you know, they will do everything possible.  If they say they're gonna do something, they will do it.
Speaker 1: And you're--you're not doing that today still, are you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, but we--
Speaker 1: You did that for how long was this?
Speaker 2: That was another six year thing.  We became the largest Asian broadcaster, outside of Asia, which was interesting because blacks typically weren't in control of Asian things.  And so this was a nice switch.  And--and, I think they respected--I mean we had Japanese programs on there and we did a deal with Fuji TV over in Tokyo and we've had all kinds of relation with various ethnic groups.  With Russian, Polish.  In Chicago, with the Polish groups, another interesting story.  But it--it--in each one, it's--it's interesting and they respect you, whatcha been able to accomplish.
Story_ID: 49195
Speaker 1: So, that takes us to 19--
Speaker 2: We're in the '80's [1980s]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Excuse me, we're in the '90's [1990s].
Speaker 1: '90's [1990s] at this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Point.  Like 1990--
Speaker 2: Three--
Speaker 1: Three--
Speaker 2: Four and we still kept building stations, getting in the different markets.  We got into Houston [Texas], we got in the Dallas [Texas] with a station.  We ended up with a couple of stations in Seattle [Washington].  We started doubling up.  We ended up with four stations in the Bay Area in San Francisco [California].  We had four in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] We had a station in, as I mentioned, Chicago [Illinois].  We ended up with three stations, four stations in Chicago; two in New York; we had one in Boston [Massachusetts]; we had two in Washington, D.C [District of Columbia].  So we were starting to really concentrate on the major markets.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, and, but the industry was starting to change.  When was this, yeah.
Speaker 2: In '96' [1996], you had the Consolidation Act and then all of a sudden, just like that, people started acquiring properties, getting bigger and bigger.  And that was kind of the end of our rein.  We couldn't go public but yet we needed capital to expand to become one of the big players and we were getting near the end with our VC's [venture capitalists] and, again, they started saying, okay, let's see what we can do.  And that's also when Spanish was hot.  I helped start the Z-Spanish [Radio] Network [San Jose, California] which ended up being the largest radio network in terms of number of stations.  We did some innovative things.  For example, in L.A., that first station that we had, it was a good station but it wasn't like the big stations down there.  But we ended up buying a station in Ventura [California] and one down south of that in--near Escondido [California] so that the net result was the first trimalcast.  We had all in the same frequency, 101.7, in three markets and so it acted like a big station where we did it for peanuts.  Well, I took that same idea with this Spanish guy who kept bugging me to buy my Sacramento station.  I kept saying, "No, no, no."  Finally, he caught me on the right day and I say, if you'll do this, this and this, not only will I sell you the station, but I'll get you the funding.  And essentially we came up with the idea of taking that Sacramento [California] station, finding another one in Fresno [California], same frequency, and one in Bakersfield [California] so you had the whole San Joaquin Valley [California], which is the big growing area with a lot of Hispanics.  That San Joaquin Valley had a--the same number of Hispanics as the Miami [Florida] or in L.A. and yet we could get it for peanuts.  And I remember going to Syncom [Venture Partners] and having lunch with them and the first time I've ever had that happen.  Over lunch they said, "We'll do it, we'll do the deal" because it was a slam dunk and they ended up turning out to be a major, major company.  And I was on their board, and we had some stock in their company, and so forth.  But again, there were opportunities but through consolidation, now, a lot of those opportunities in radio have disappeared.
Story_ID: 49196
Speaker 1: So, at--I also want to talk about--when did you start the show, the--when you were talking about the inspir--the stories--
Speaker 2: Oh, the Personal Achievement Radio--
Speaker 1: Right, that's right--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was probably around 1995, '96' [1996].  One day I was in Miami [Florida] and I got off the plane late and it's night and if you're in the radio business, the first thing you do is start scanning the dial and just listening to radio stations.  And I remember hearing this station called, "Winters News Network" and I said, "What is this?"  And some guy was putting on these little motivational things and kind of said, "Now, let me see where I can track down this guy," which I did and--and he was struggling, and so forth and so, I said, look, you know, this may be something that could go big, and if we can get the rights to these tapes.  And so we did get the rights to tapes and I had him work for me and we started this and--and it was 24 hours motivational, how to prove your business skills, success skills, healthy lifestyle.  It was really upbeat.  It was for people who wanted to improve themselves and so the only problem was that in each market, it was very difficult to make enough money to satisfy that market place because it was expensive.  And so, we did syndicate it with the--with ABC radio networks and--and that was very encouraging because they only had one other format that was for AM stations.  That was their Disney Channel so we were their second format for AM stations.  And I think they only had about eight or nine, 24-hour formats that they syndicated.  So, we were pretty proud to be syndicated by ABC radio networks.
Story_ID: 49197
Speaker 1: Now, we're talking to you at a time where you're involved with something new.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's burgeoning called "satellite radio."
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I just would like you to talk about that.  What you saw as the potential there.  You know the market was changing rapidly.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  It was interesting because every time that I'd fly some place, you know, you're in the airplane, I like to sit near the window and look down.  You look at all these houses and you say, "Wow, this is a big country," and yet we had stations all over the place but there's always major pockets, like at Denver [Colorado], a place where we didn't have stations, and I kept saying, the ideal antenna would be one that's 22,400 feet in the air, way up on a satellite.  And so when I heard about satellite radio, I was--merely said, "That's interesting, that's something which I think is going to be big some day" because again, you could get the whole U.S.  And as it turned out it was like satellite TV, you had two companies that had the license and with our Personal Achievement [Radio], both companies wanted to get that so I was able to play one against the other.  And we were able to get on one and then we got some channels on the other and from that we were able to grow and eventually have five channels in that business.  Now, that was the good news.  The bad news is it was a new technology, a new thing.  And people were gonna have to pay for radio, which is like, pay for radio?  Just like they said in the early days of television.  So, it was very hard to get venture money for that.  In fact we're still looking, so, anybody wants to contribute (laughter).  But, I--I feel that some day this is gonna be very, very big.  I think between auto companies being involved and putting it in autos, it's--it has to be--it has to be successful.

Speaker 1: Now, where are you right now when you look back over your career?  Do you do much of that?
Speaker 2: Occasionally and--and it's funny because you pull back experiences and, you know, kinda puts things in perspective.  Obviously, in that growth curve, I'm on this level now--I'm--I'm getting to a point where retirement is interesting and then what do I wanna do in retirement.  Do I want a cold turkey, nah, that wouldn't work.  I am on a few boards and I--I find that very interesting.  So I'd like to dabble but not be in a day-to-day activity.  And yet I'd like to see if I can get one more venture out--one more once.  It's like the football player who's playing in the NFL, he's 40 years old and then get one more season out, especially when they're paying you all that money.  That's--that's how I feel.
Story_ID: 49199
Speaker 1: And, when you look--I wanna ask you a couple of questions.  In terms of blacks in the broadcasting arena, what are your thoughts about that whole thing?  I mean, do you see potential--you know on a timely--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Thing are shrinking.  Opportunities are shrinking.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --there--did emerge of [Robert] Bob Johnson [founder of BET] but, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I think you're seeing a different type of individual.  You're seeing some that are good, solid radio people but more importantly you're seeing some people coming out of the finance side from--from Granite Broadcasting [Corporation].  He [HM W. Don Cornwell] came from Goldman Sachs, [HM] Alfred Liggins, you know, MBA from Wharton [University of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and so that side of it brings a lot to the table because it is a lot in funding.  I mean it's, yeah, you gotta know how to run stations, and so forth, but you also gotta know how to keep your balance sheet so it doesn't throw you out of whack.  And so I think that's encouraging.  You're seeing more and more of that and that to me, you know, will make it (unclear) successful.  And there's still some niches that you can go to, it's just that the landscape has changed dramatically.
Speaker 1: And, do you think that it--that for people for blacks looking to get involved in the industry that it's something that they should look at?
Speaker 2: Yes, people will always be communicating.  And there's like the food industry.  People will also be eating.  And communications will change.  You'll get different means of communicating but I see the trend going from hardware, that's owning TV stations, radio stations, to more the software, the content, and you have all these ways of getting this information to people but what are you gonna be feeding 'em.  So, the content, as I see, the software is now becoming important and that's why with satellite radio we're looking at developing content.
Story_ID: 49200
Speaker 1: Now, in the business arena with blacks in business, you know people are saying now, that we focus on politics and now we, you know, we're gonna focus on economics.  And you did that very early.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You know, at a time when people were just, you know, black community was looking for civil rights and education and, you know, they weren't--business wasn't even on the radar screen.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, I wonder what your thoughts are about, you know, that whole area.
Speaker 2: I--I see it as being extremely positive and not only on the entrepreneur side but also on their personal life, their savings, investing, understanding the stock market, understanding the options that are available.  This all ties together, it's about creating wealth.  You know, it's how do you make money?  How do you protect it?  How do you enjoy it?  I don't think they'll have any problem on the enjoying part but the first two are key.  And people are understanding that.  My mom [Esther Douglas], I remember she had Dreyfus Fund, and I remember, what the heck is this mutual fund?  But she used to keep putting, every month, some money in the Dreyfus and that line coming out of the subway.  And now I can see that that was a very, very smart move because over the long haul, she did extremely well.  And people have to get into their mind set--people have to understand we need to start our own businesses.  We need to have a percentage that approaches the Asians in terms of a number of businesses that they have on a percentage wise.  We have to become in charge of our own destiny.  I remember when I was young, Easter time, my dad [John Douglas] used to take me over to 125th Street and I had my Easter fineries on and we'd walk down the street and I'd say, "Wow, look at all these black businesses."  And he said, "Nah, they are blacks working there but they're owned by somebody else."  We have to be that somebody else.  We have to be behind the scenes owning those companies and having, if necessary, other people out front.  And it'll happen.  So many changes that are happening and it's exciting.
Story_ID: 49201
Speaker 1: Now, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: The black community is going through a change for the better.  Yes, they have their ups and downs and my hope is that they can truly leverage the potential that they have.  If you look at some of the smartest people I've seen in barber shops, where I get my haircut, or on the street corner talking stuff, some of the smartest people are in our community.  But how do you get them to really approach a larger community.  And you're starting to see it in spurts, and so forth.  And communications, the media, television has been a major impact.  Videos, movies and so forth.  That is important.  Now the downside, the negative is, you're almost building two communities, haves and have nots.  Those with potential and those without potential.  And that's the danger point.  You can't have that.  I mean you really got to get that upper, that lower one up.
Speaker 1: Do you have any ideas about how that could be done?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we've heard some weird concepts but, you know, let's say you had, you know, everyone talks about reparations, and so forth.  What if you had something which, instead of giving money, you gave education?  You gave the ability to give a home.  You gave things which would go back into the mainstream community so that, yes, you gotta push in the right direction.  And you could then, you know, go from there.  There might be some creative things that could be done along those lines.  I also think that the historical black universities [HBCUs] are now changing and they have to get stronger.  One of the sad things, in terms of fundraising, Howard [University] --I compare Howard to Bates [College]--it's like night and day.  We have to get stronger institutions.  We have to do more.
Story_ID: 49202
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to read?
Speaker 2: Probably I was out front--I was thinking out of the box this creative--I was on the cutting edge.  I was a pioneer and I wasn't satisfied with the status quo.
Story_ID: 49203
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Obviously, the media is my love.  I probably stayed more in the media than any other industry and I'd like to, at least be known, for doing some pioneering things within the media, helping people, being a role model, always, if at all possible, if someone asks for help I would give 'em help.  I didn't screen my calls, just, "Hey, come on in, see what we can do."  And I think if I can get that across, I'll be very happy.
Story_ID: 49204
Speaker 1: That's obviously, John Douglas, and in the twilight of my career, and I always liked to smile in pictures 'cause no sense frowning 'cause the world is a happy place.  You gotta enjoy it.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, very good.
Speaker 1: One of my loves is--is skiing and skiing is--is a challenge.  It's--it's man against the mountain.  The beauty when you're on the slopes is unreal.  And to me looking up at those peaks, it's--it's like a challenge you, I can get there, except I'm not gonna be a mountain climber.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And quickly, where and when?
Speaker 1: Oh, that is in Europe approximately five years ago, in France, in the Mont Blanc area.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Very good, next.
Speaker 1: We enjoyed traveling.  That's my wife--is on my right, is that right?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  That's correct.
Speaker 1: And we love cruising, we love seeing the world and it--one thing you have to learn is, if you're on a treadmill, you gotta get off it every once in a while and just kick back and enjoy.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and when was this taken?  And where?
Speaker 1: Oh, this (laughter)--this was taken about nine to ten years ago.  We're going through canals in the Greek Isles.
Speaker 2: It says Corinth Canals.  C-O-R--
Speaker 1: Corinth Canal.
Speaker 2: I-N-T-H.
Speaker 1: Yep, thank you.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Had we previously mentioned your wife's name or should we spell it.
Speaker 1: Hazel, H-A-Z-E-L.
Speaker 2: Whoops, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  That's a picture of Hazel taken about eight years ago.  We're at a function, Boule [Sigma Pi Phi] function, in the South Bay and we are Boule members and it was a very elegant function at the--down in Carmel [California] at Quail Lodge.  And Hazel's the one on the right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My other love is golf.  Again, being out there in nature and it's--it's man against the ball.  The ball usually wins.  In this case I was trying to get over on the other side.  You notice that there is no ball down there so I think I was successful.  This was taken in Hawaii on the island of Lanai about 10 years ago.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead when you're ready.
Speaker 1: One--one thing you find out is that you have to give a lot of speeches and I used to be petrified in giving speeches but now it's second nature.  It's just easy.  You don't need notes, you just wing it.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Was this a particular speech or--
Speaker 1: This--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Or particular event?
Speaker 1: This was--this was taken about 15 years ago and I'm--it was a conference but I'm not sure which conference.  I can make up one (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  That's okay.  All right, how about--
Speaker 1: You find as a CEO that you're on the phone almost constantly.  This was when I had Channel 48.  This was around 1983 and this was taken at KSTS [TV] in San Jose [California].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, good, next.
Speaker 1: That's a picture I--in our control room at KSTS-TV at Channel 48 in San Jose.  Taken fairly early in 1982.  I can tell by my hair.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  One second, Julieanna, okay.
Speaker 1: Just putting it--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Nice.  Okay, go ahead at any time.
Speaker 1: This was our media kit for KSTS-TV 48 and in a way the vision of Silicon Valley was also kinda the vision of our company to really be able to take control of the market place to understand it.  This was done in 1984.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: No, I think it's going to be okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Here, let me try it.  All right (unclear) a couple of clothes pins.  There, it's working.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right.  Back to my post.
Speaker 1: Focus on that one, especially in the--in the silver cup.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's good.  When I was at Castle and Cooke, we won several advertising awards for the best annual report.  That was one which we did showing all of our products around the world and putting 'em in two different languages.  And that was done in 1977.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one--
Speaker 2: I'm gonna--I'm gonna do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  You're on a roll, Julieanna.  Sometimes these things we have curled photographs--
Speaker 1: Oh, geez--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Of all the pages.  They won't stay up there.
Speaker 1: That was obviously back in my track days at Bates [College], probably in 1959.  That's Rudy Smith, who was also in my class.  He was an amazing runner, on the left.  I'm getting set to--to run a dash.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: And this picture was taken back in the 1972 when I was at Reynolds [and Company].  Typically a security analyst has a messy desk and files all over the place.  And you notice the old typewriter in the background.  That was taken in New York [New York City, New York], down on Wall Street.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  That's these.  Just give me a second, okay.  Let's see, maybe you could use these clothes pins just to hold--make it stay flat so it can hold so much.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I can get it.  Okay.
Speaker 1: It looks like one clothes pin show or--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, we will--you can--yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, that'll work.
Speaker 1: That, what was her name anyway?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I think--
Speaker 1: Elizabeth Frey, okay.  That was at Reynolds and Company as a security analyst.  I was head of the Technology Department and that was in 1970--1972.  That's Elizabeth Frey who was the--who was our research editor on the right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on Julie.
Speaker 1: That was amazing for a southern company to put that in their annual report.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes, it is--
Speaker 1: Yup.
Speaker 2: Amazing.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next photo, please.
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, I've got it, don't worry--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's when I was at Howard University in 1961.  I had my own research labs so that's down in the basement of their Physics Building and that was my mass spectrometry apparatus.  The mad scientist (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next one.
Speaker 1: And that was a picture of--of Hazel, my wife, and that was our engage--and that was her engagement picture back in 1963.  That was back in Hamden, Connecticut.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead please.
Speaker 1: And that's my picture, my senior year at Bates College in 1960.  That's why I thought I knew everything.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next please.
Speaker 1: That's a picture taken in our backyard.  On the left is my mother, in the center, is her sister, Helen, and to the right is my grandmother, Bambi, and that picture was taken probably in the 1950s or '40's [1940s], '50's [1950s].
Speaker 2: I'm saying, yes, like I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please (laughter).
Speaker 2: That was taken in the back of our Englewood, New Jersey place.  That is me sitting on the throne, as the king, and on the left side is my cousin, Stanley, and the right side is my sister, Joan, and Joan's gonna hate me for that picture (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, very good.  Next.  Hey, hey.
Speaker 2: That's my son, Greg, when he was playing Pee Wee league back when he was, oh, about nine years old, eight years old.  That was about 22 years ago.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: And that was my picture in junior high [Englewood Junior High School] and at the time I was just finding out what the world was all about and that wide-eyed look shows it.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my graduation from high school [Dwight Morrow High School].  My dad is on the left and I'm in the center and my mother is on the right.  That was a happy occasion.  That was Englewood, New Jersey in 1956.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is real nice.  This is nice.
Speaker 1: Well, that one we've already gotten the picture.
Speaker 2: Oh, we have.  Oh, that's so nice.
Speaker 1: Now you can--
Speaker 2: Is that--is--he's--it's called, "Dougie."  His ambition?
Speaker 1: (tape cuts)
Speaker 2: Or it probably won't be.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Would you start again.  I had to shut the camera off fully.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I just got it started again.
Speaker 2: That is--I'm in the long jump at Bates, probably in 1959.  That is buyin' off the dock style.  This is the results of extreme, thoughtfulness and running the physics equations.  However, I notice that style has never been copied again.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next is--
Speaker 2: Wow, that's amazing.  Did we do this one too?
Speaker 1: No, you want to pull that sign (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I got it.  Okay, go ahead, please.
Speaker 1: That's my picture from high school graduation and notice that it says, "Keep track of him."  On my right is my best buddy who--who's with me throughout the junior high and high school, Carl Drake.  He's now living out in San Francisco [California] area, also, so we've remain friends for a period since the '50's [1950s].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, well this is--let me just here--let me just go real quickly 'cause I think I saw a couple more.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) the first couple, the skiing one and the head shot one--
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  'Cause I think the audio levels were not up high at the beginning 'cause I had a couple of the bars--
Speaker 1: Well, they're at the front.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I did them in order.  Whoops.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Let's give them these four (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, well here, let's do this.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, yeah, I'll do that one--those were the (unclear) straightened out.  Okay, so the bottom photo is what we're interested in here?  Is that right?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead, please.
Speaker 1: On the left is Bob Malin who's head of Corporate Finance for Reynolds.  I'm in the center and on the right is Keith Wellin, who's the president of Reynolds.  I was receiving a bonus for the work that I did on General Automation and that was in 1974 in New York City on Wall Street.
Speaker 2: We were supposed to do [HM] Morrie Turner.  I cancelled them yesterday.  Oh, I feel badly.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: I was just thinking--oh, that's too bad.  I was like, that name's looks familiar.  Okay, leave that here.  I'll put these back up.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, we're in the rerun.
Speaker 2: That's a--that's a picture in my twilight year.  That was taken last year here in San Francisco.  I've--we say, keep a smile on your face, no sense frowning your way through the world, just be happy, enjoy it.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next one.  Thank you, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture on a cruise line going through the Corinth Canal in the Greek Isles.  My wife, Hazel, is on my right and that was taken in 1991.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture in France on that's--in the Alps--it's near Mont Blanc and that was about five years ago.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture with Hazel taken down at Quail Lodge in Carmel, roughly four or five years ago for a Boule function and Hazel's the one on the right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on one second, please.  Okay.  Two of the (unclear) corner (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, well
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Do you just want to go straight in on the John Douglas illustration?  Go ahead, please.
Speaker 2: Okay, you don't get the rest of it in there?
Speaker 1: Okay, get the rest of it.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ah, yes.
Speaker 1: I know there's a crease--
Speaker 2: You can take--you can take the paper clips off that way--
Speaker 1: You think so?  No, it's--fold--it's folding.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: It's the crease.
Speaker 2: That was--that was a cartoon that was done in 1984 by Morrie Turner and the first time I've ever been in a comic strips but it is kind of a neat twist on things.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  We do, in case you're wondering, we do put these through photoshop and do any editing or rotation or cropping--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Take place.  Let's just give this one more shot here.  Sir, can you see the monitor.  Have I got that in the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--just over a little bit more this way.  That's perfect.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  That'll help us.  We can--we can take a rule that out.  Okay, is that all the frame?
Speaker 1: Yup.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, try this one (unclear).  And then that's it.  Let's see now.  This was back in there.  Oh, I feel so badly (unclear).  Now, is this.  I hate missing history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you'll be back.
Speaker 1: Just like this--that's like going on vacation some place, you know (laughter) and you're gonna be back immediately.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying and then you--I think  he--like he started in the '60's [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so too.
Speaker 1: See (laughter).  If he was (unclear).  Whatever they got through that.
Speaker 2: That was a picture--was taken in the 1984 era where we were doing our business format on--on KSTS and that's in San Jose, California.  God, look at my hair (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it.
