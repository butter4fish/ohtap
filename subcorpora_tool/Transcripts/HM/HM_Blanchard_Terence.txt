Story_ID: 661214
Speaker 1: So I wanna start with the beginning, with your parents.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Would you tell me your father's name and where and when he was born and tell me about him?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's name was Oliver Joseph Blanchard [Joseph Blanchard], that's what we knew him as all his life and then when he passed we got his birth certificate and his birth certificate said Joseph Oliver Blanchard.  It's one of those things that happens in, in families, you know.  And he was born in Louisiana in a small town called Somerset, Louisiana.  And well, basically, Lake Charles [Louisiana], that's basically where the family grew up.  And he grew up there, lost his parents when he was young and then moved to New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And what, what, we, what did his parents do?
Speaker 2: We never know. I never knew because my dad never talked about 'em, you know, too much, you know.  The only thing that I heard was his, his father died in an accident at a grain, I think in a grain elevator or something like that.  And what was interesting about that was the, the story that I heard was he wasn't supposed to be there, it was his day off and he was covering for somebody else and he was killed.  And then there were three brothers, my, my father, Oliver, his, his brother, William [William Blanchard], and another brother, Francis [Francis Blanchard].  And the mother couldn't take care of the three boys so she gave 'em away and some other people raised them.  And they tried to stick together, and they did, and then the three of them moved to New Orleans.
Speaker 1: They moved to New Orleans as, as young people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As young men, yeah.
Speaker 1: As young men?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know who raised them?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean, my father, my father had a weird side to him when it came to his family, he never talked about 'em that much.  And one of the things that was like really interesting, you know, some of my--my father's family lived in Lafayette, Louisiana, and we'd go visit them and, you know, they spoke that broken French, you know, patois, and he never taught it to me, never.
Speaker 1: And he, he spoke it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the, you know, they would sit there in, in the house and they would speak to themselves all, all day long like that.  And me and my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] would just be sitting there like, "Okay," (laughter), "all right, I'm waiting. Did you say my name? Oh, no? Okay, all right, I'm good," (laughter) and this happened every time.  And I thought it was just interesting that he never, not even a phrase, never just, when we got back to New Orleans, that was done.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Are you hearing that?  I don't know where--
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: --it's coming from.
Speaker 1: It is, you hear it?
Speaker 2: Feedback.  It just went away.
Speaker 1: It's gone. I don't know.  Oh, it must be in the building.  Is it okay? Can we keep moving?  I don't think it's your equipment.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It could be from a, from a cell phone.  Where are the cell phones?
Speaker 1: Mine is over there.
Speaker 2: It's, I think we should keep moving.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you don't know, you don't know much about your father's family?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean, and the other interesting thing about it is that, see my father had me when he was a much older man. So all of my first cousins, they're much older than me so I didn't know them either.  And as a matter of fact, I met some of them in, in Atlanta [Georgia].  Gerald [ph.] and, and Pam [ph.].  And what was interesting about meeting them, they grew up in Lake Charles and Gerald told me he said, "Man, we knew we had a little cousin in New Orleans but you were a little too young for us to come get you so we never came and picked you up" (laughter).
Speaker 1: How old was your father when he had--
Speaker 2: Well, he was, let me see, if he were alive today he'd be in his nineties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm fifty-two.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he was in his forties when he had me.  And, and one of my first cousins, his son is my age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  Yeah, so, I was a late bloomer.
Story_ID: 661215
Speaker 1: What did your father [Joseph Blanchard] do?
Speaker 2: My father, he sold insurance during the day and at night he worked as a hospital orderly at a, at a hospital in New Orleans.  And then on the weekends, man, you know, he sang in church and he would do these recitals. Opera was really his thing. He loved opera, you know, and he tried to perform as much as he could.  That's one of the things that I, I really admired about him and his friends, you know. These were African American males in New Orleans, Louisiana, where opera is not the first thing that comes to your mind at all.  And these guys were really into this music and they would travel around the city doing recitals, you know, at churches and convents and stuff like that.  And they would have rehearsals like, I think, it was every Wednesday or every Thursday night they would meet at Osceola Blanchet's house.  He was the pianist and choral director of the church we went to [Central Congregational Church, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And they would sit there and sing this stuff all night long.
Speaker 1: Opera?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And, and, and spiritually based music as well, you know, but that was, that was their thing. That, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you know how he came to love opera?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was Mr. Blanchet--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, which is B-L-A-N-C-H-E-T.  His first name was Osceola.  From what I have gathered it was Mr. Blanchet's vision to introduce young African American males to the world of opera.  And even though my dad didn't go to high school, my dad met him through the church, I think, as a young man. 'Cause--and he always--I thought he was my grandfather for the longest time, you know, because that's the relationship him and my dad had, you know.  And he taught all of these young men and some of them were bitten by the bug, you know.  And my father, I'm telling you, you know, we couldn't touch his records, (laughter) remember the records with the plastic?  Yeah, we couldn't touch those.  And then it was really funny when I was a kid one of my funniest memories is coming home--and there were two things. My father was a one handed piano player so when he worked on a piece, you know, he would sit there and play, he was brilliant when he did it 'cause he was a baritone so he would play the tenor part and sing the, he'd play the tenor part on the piano and sing the baritone part 'cause he wanted to see how his part fit with everything.  But it was so interesting in my neighborhood wasn't nobody parents singing opera. So when he, you know, I'd come home with my boys, I'd open that door real slow, you know, (laughter), you know, I'm like, oh, man, I hope he's not sitting there.  And if he was, you know, I remember my boy, Peter, Peter Barnes [ph.], he came over to the house one time and I opened the door real slow, he said, "Man, what the--?" I said, "Come on let's go to my room," (laughter) you know, "let's get out of here."
Speaker 1: And with the baritone voice that was really loud?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god, oh, my god.  And then the other thing that, the other memory I have is that, it was pretty funny, man.  My dad would sit in the front and he'd put on his, his records and he'd start listening to 'Carmen' [Georges Bizet] or something and then all of a sudden you'd just hear doors slamming in the house 'cause everybody's trying (laughter) to find some peace and quiet. (Makes sound) (Laughter) That was pretty funny.
Story_ID: 661216
Speaker 1: And tell me who, you- who's your mom and about her (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wilhelmina, Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard, Ray is her maiden name.
Speaker 1: R-A--
Speaker 2: R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mom--how do I describe my mom?  Let me see.  She had a lot of different types of jobs.  When I was a kid she worked in a, like a textile factory, you know, but then after that she became a housewife for a little bit.  And then after that, right around when I entered high school [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] she started working in the school system as a teacher's aide, you know, and then she did that for a number of years, you know, and she loved working with kids and she was working mostly with special ed [special education] kids.  And it's something she had a passion for until she retired.  And now she's just, she's at home, you know, living her life.
Speaker 1: In New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was she born in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Yes, born and raised.
Speaker 1: And do you know about her family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, her father was John Ray, Sr.  I think he was born in the country, you know. Oh, man, what's the name of the city?  It'll come to me.  And my grandmother, Susie Lawson Ray [Susan Lawson Ray], she was also born in the country and they met in the city and they had four kids, John Ray, Jr., my, my mom's oldest brother, then it was my mom, Wilhelmina, then, my aunt, Alice, Joyce Alice Ray, that's another one, I keep forgetting which one is her first name 'cause some people call her Joyce, some people call her Alice, you know, Alice Ray Douglas, she's remarried now, and then my mom's younger brother, Warren Ray.  The interesting, the sad part is that the two brothers are both deceased, you know.  My uncle Junior, well, we called him Junior, he died suddenly.  I'll never--I was--that was one of the roughest nights of my life.  I'll never forget that 'cause my mom was standing at the, at the, at her dresser doing her hair and my dad [Joseph Blanchard] came in and said that Junior had passed and she just dropped everything and she screamed. Boy, I'll never, oh, that was horrible.  And then--
Speaker 1: How old was he?
Speaker 2: I don't, he had to be in his fifties.  He was a young man.  And then my, my, my younger uncle, he developed cancer and he died a slow death.  You know, he was an interesting dude.  That was my favorite uncle, that dude.  Man, 'cause he was (laughter) he was the one when I got a whipping, my mom would beat me saying, "You're not gonna be like your uncle Warren," (laughter) you know.  (Laughter) You know, that, that guy in the family, right, right.  So I loved him because he was the guy that was in the [U.S.] Navy, man, he always had great stories, you know, he taught me how to play pool.  And I remember one time we were playing cards and I said, "Hey Unc, you wanna play cards with us?"  He goes, "Man, I don't play no kiddie games. I just play for money."  I'm like, "Come on Unc, come on."  So I finally got him to play, I never asked him again (laughter).  I mean, he was getting aggravated and slamming cards on the ground. I'm like who is this dude?  You know, he was a serious card player, you know.  I'm like okay.  We're just trying to play pitty pat.  It's not that deep (laughter).  And he was, he was, he was, he was something else.  He was the, he was the guy, okay, he was the guy that forgot children were in the room.  We were watching Tina Turner do a show, which I think it was Ed Sullivan ['The Ed Sullivan Show'], no, no, it wasn't Ed Sullivan, it was something else, but anyway she was on television.  And when she was dancing, my uncle started to say something, my mom, "Warren. Warren. Warren. Just check--stop."  Yeah, I miss him.  I miss him.
Story_ID: 661217
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your mother's [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] family?
Speaker 2: That's about as far as it goes for me, you know, because when--I didn't know much about my grandfather's [John Ray, Sr.] family passed him and with my grandmother [Susan Lawson Ray], you know, that story is kind of sketchy because her father didn't raise her, she was raised by her stepfather, you know.  And I have pictures of them at home.  But again, I just wa- you know, it's, you know, what's interesting about that, I thought about this when I was in England one time.  I was working on a film and the guy who was the--is it coming through?  Okay.  I was working on a film and the guy who was the engineer for the film he took me to his house. And this is in England, this is London [England], and he pulled out a book, huge book, that had his family lineage in it going back to like the 1700s.  And he could--he had something written that he could actually go back and see, you know.  And I remember I felt so cheated, you know, because I don't have that. And I started thinking about how far did I go back.  And even when I talk to my mom and them, they don't talk, again, they, they're kind of like forward thinkers, they don't go back and deal with that, you know.  And I don't know why that is, I really don't.
Speaker 1: And New Orleans [Louisiana] is an interesting place because it's quite a melting pot.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do, do you have, you mentioned the patois.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know if there are any French people in your family or, you know, anything other than African Americans?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, French obviously.  I mean, my dad [Joseph Blanchard] did tell me one time that he met his great-grandfather, right, who he said he was a old French man and he didn't speak any English, you know.  And then I had a, I had a, a, a very interesting interaction when I played in St. Lucia, I got, I got off the plane and there was a guy there named Vaughn, I'll never forget his name, it was Vaughn Blanchard [ph.], and we kind of looked alike.  And Vaughn said, he said, "Man, when I saw your name," you know, he said, "I had to come and be your liaison for the jazz festival." And he started telling me about the, there were three French brothers that went to St. Lucia and then two of 'em migrated to the states.  And I'm wondering if that's part of the, the whole lineage, you know, and there are so many Blanchards down in St. Lucia, there used to be an area called Blanchard.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so it's interesting.  And that's about as far back (laughter) as I can go.
Speaker 1: That would be interesting to research.
Speaker 2: No, it is. And I, I keep--you know, it's one of those things you keep saying you wanna do and, and I just, I just never get a chance to do it.  I have a cousin, Loren Blanchard, who works at the university of, Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana] in New Orleans, and he's done a bunch of this research and he, he can trace it back--so I can get the information to you 'cause he can trace it back to slavery.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, and a lot of people from New Orleans are able to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he's done it, he's done it.  But, and it's, it's so funny because talking to him, he tells me more about stuff than any of my direct, you know, family members could have told me, you know, they--not could have, they just didn't, you know, just so-, it wasn't something they talked about.
Story_ID: 661218
Speaker 1: So how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: They met in church.  And I found it highly ironic because my dad [Joseph Blanchard] was the choral director and my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] was in the choir, and my mom cannot sing, poor thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: I read that in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 1: --in your book ['Contemporary Cat: Terence Blanchard with Special Guests,' Anthony Magro] that she was a--what did they call her a, a, a placeholder, what was--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's some other people say, "Yeah"--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --"yeah, this is a place, this, just sit right there, don't, yeah, don't sing, just mouth, we don't, we don't need anything to come out, just take up some space," that's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she know that she couldn't sing?
Speaker 2: We've never really had that discussion. (Laughter) We've never had that discussion.  No, no, no, no, no, I'm not having it, (laughter) not me, no, baby (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What church?
Speaker 2: I think it was called Bethany [Bethany Baptist Church, New Orleans, Louisiana] was the church, it, it, it was torn down by the time--
Speaker 1: Is it--what denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist, you know.  Yeah, it was interesting.  And they, I guess, fell in love and got married.  But the thing that I found, always found interesting, see my dad wasn't a member of the church where he was a choral director, 'cause he was like, like a lot of musicians, he was doing it at a few churches.  So, you know, when I came on the scene and when I was born the, the rule was if I was a girl I would have went to church with my mother, if I was a boy I went to church with my dad.  And my dad went to a Congregationalist church [Central Congregational Church, New Orleans, Louisiana] and my mom was Baptist. So kind of grew up with this--
Speaker 1: What is a Congregationalist church?
Speaker 2: It's more like Methodist is the best way I can describe it, you know.  I don't see real differences, you know, in beliefs, you know, 'cause I used to go to both churches and listen to both ministers speak.  I didn't detect anything that, that was very different.  I think the only thing that was different is that my mom's church, you know, they sang gospel, my dad's church they sang arias.
Speaker 1: Right and hymns and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That was, that was the only difference.
Story_ID: 661219
Speaker 1: Can you look back at your childhood and what is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Whew.  God, my uncle Will [William Blanchard] and another family member we used to call him Papa Sing [ph.], sitting on the sidewalk, drinking beers while I was running around playing, you know.  They did that on the weekends.  These dudes they worked hard, man, there was, they're, they were the type of dudes that had, they used to get up early, early, I never knew what they did, you know.  I know my, my uncle used to go alligator hunting at, at, at some point, yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But they would get up early in the morning and go to work and co- and you could just tell they were, they were working hard, when they came back they were just exhausted so when Saturday rolled around they were used to getting up so they would get up and sit on the sidewalk and then have the big thing of beer and just talk the day away (laughter) just sitting there chilling, you know.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was about five. Four or five.  You know, I remember, I remember that area.  I also remember that area 'cause it was the same time I experienced my first flood in New Orleans [Louisiana], it was Hurricane Betsy.  And I remember the water coming up to the doorstep, 'cause back then we were living in one of those houses that was built up. And I remember standing on the porch, somebody picking me up and putting me in a boat, a rowboat that didn't have an engine.  I mean, a small boat that didn't have an engine, not a rowboat but a small boat.  And the men, it was raining like cats and dogs, there was another little girl she was screaming and crying and the men were standing in the water pushing us, you know, trying to get us out of there.  And I remember there were snakes in the water, it was a crazy scene.  There were guys with motorboats driving by wouldn't give us a tow, yeah, I remember that.  You know, it was funny I was really young but I do, I remember all of that because it was such a chaotic thing.  And then I remember they--I don't know how we got there--but I remember they took us to someone's home and we had to strip naked right in the front because all our clothes were just soaking wet and the people were trying to give us new clothes.  And I couldn't find my, we didn't know where my dad [Joseph Blanchard] was for the longest time, yeah, it was just me and my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] and, and my cousins and stuff.  And that was, that was really bizarre.
Speaker 1: Now what neighborhood was this?
Speaker 2: It's called the Lower Ninth Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So it's--
Speaker 1: The now infamous--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Lower Ninth Ward.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, and the, and the, and the story goes is that the city flooded back then the Lower Ninth Ward to save Uptown [New Orleans, Louisiana].  So it wasn't like the dams broke or anything like that.  You know--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --they directed all of the water that way.  That's what, that's--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --the story, we don't know how true that is but it's, it's feasible.
Story_ID: 661220
Speaker 1: When you think of your home and your neighborhood back at that time, can you describe the sights, sounds, and smells that you recall?
Speaker 2: Well, we moved around a good bit so the first home was the house with my uncle Will [William Blanchard] that we lived in.  And I remember his wife, that was my aunt Doll [ph.] that was her name, that's what we called her.  I remember her she was, just seemed like she was always cooking.  And always cooking stuff we can't eat now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: Oh, fri- anything fried (laughter).  You know, I just remember just smelling that smell of--of batter, fried stuff, fried chicken, fried fish, you know.  And we had a big yard on the side of the house and me and a couple of my cousins we were always running back and forth.  And then later on, you know, that, that area was an interesting area 'cause it was kind of busy in terms of traffic so they never let us go outside the gate much.  And then we moved over into, on Rosemont Place, I can't think of the name of the neighborhood, I don't think it really had a name.  And when we lived over there we lived in a double house.  That was my first--
Speaker 1: What's a double house?
Speaker 2: You know, where you have two tenants.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: You know, so that was my first time that I can remember having my own room, you know.  And when it was just my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard], my dad [Joseph Blanchard], and me that was it, the, it was just the three of us living there.  And we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because prior to that?
Speaker 2: We were living with my uncle Will.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In his home?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember, it was interesting because when we lived on Rosemont Place we were renting that house (laughter) and I think I was about, I must have been about five, five or six, and that's when I started taking piano lessons from Martha Francis who lived right behind us in the other part of the house (laughter) so I could never miss a piano lesson, never.  Boy, you talk about a drag.  It was like she was right there.  "It's time for you to walk around then," I'm like, "Damn, okay."  And what was also funny too, my--in our--the houses, the house was set up where the one family was in the front and the other was in the back.  And my room was right here and my room was right by their front wall and they loved to sit up and play and sing all night and I'd be like wow, y'all gonna sing that song one more time, oh, my god (laughter).  But it was, you know, it was, it was nice living there.
Story_ID: 661221
Speaker 1: And then my grandmother went blind and when she went blind we, we moved in with her. And that's where I lived in New Orleans [Louisiana] ever since until I left.
Speaker 2: And where was that?
Speaker 1: 3916 Odin Street.
Speaker 2: What neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Pontchartrain Park [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: And is that still in the Lower Ninth [Lower Ninth Ward, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: No, no, that's in the Ninth Ward but it's not the Lower Ninth Ward.  It's more over by Gentilly [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So at what age did you move?
Speaker 1: I had to be around maybe seven, six or seven 'cause I think the--
Speaker 2: You were still young?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  'Cause I think that's when my grandmother went blind.  'Cause see for most of my life she was blind but I do remember periods when she could see when I was real little, you know.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure, I think it was cataracts or, or I'm not sure, glaucoma, I'm, I'm not sure which one.
Speaker 2: And what's your grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: Susie [Blanchard's maternal grandmother, Susan Lawson Ray].
Speaker 2: This is Susie, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Whatever it was, it's stuff that could be prevented now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know.  Which one is the one with the pressure on the nerve?
Speaker 2: Glaucoma.
Speaker 1: That's what it was.  Okay.  But she was amazing though, you know (laughter).  It's funny how things happen in your childhood that help you to develop. See I'm such a creature of habit so when you put stuff in a room for me, it kind of stays that way.  I don't rearrange rooms, I'm not one of them type of people. And I thought about it, you know, why it's probably because of my grandmother 'cause we could never move anything, you know, we had to leave everything where, and she'd walk around the house without a cane, by herself, and she'd cook, you know.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  'Til she, (laughter) 'til she spilled the pepper in the, in some hamburgers (laughter) one time.  Oh, my god, that was pretty funny.  My uncle Warren [Warren Ray] was in town, he came by and took a bite of one of those burgers, oh, my god, his mouth was on fire, he wanted, he drank, he, he threw some cooking sherry in his mouth that's, 'cause that was the only thing near. He was on fire.  Oh, yeah, so right after that she stopped cooking but she was cooking for a long time and doing a lot of things.  I mean, she was still active, you know, going to church every Sunday.  My grandmother was, was really cute because she was one of those, you know, older black women that loved to have the blue rinse, you know, you remember that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and I always thought it was odd when I was a kid my grandmother was blind but she'd get ready to go to church, she'd have her hair done, and she had long hair and she'd put it up in a bun, she'd have her hair done, get her hat, and she had to put on her glasses and I'm like (makes face) okay, so, I guess, it's a look, (laughter) you know.

Speaker 1: As a young boy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what--you were the only child; right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of child were you?  How would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: Energetic.  I, I loved sports, you know.  I, I wanted to, there were two things that I wanted to be. I wanted to be, either be a football player or I wanted to be the first African American motocross champion, you know, that was, that was something I used to talk about all the time.  So I was playing little league football from the time that they let me.  You know, and once, you know, my dad [Joseph Blanchard] bought me a, a mini bike, a Suzuki. A Suzuki 50, I'll never forget it.  I used to take that thing on the park and, you know, I, in Pontchartrain Park [New Orleans, Louisiana] they have a little golf course and I would ride it on, all on the tees, you know, until they chased us off the park. Because I was trying to get my skills together, I thought I was gone be a motocross champion, oh, it was so silly.  But those were my main interests back then.  You know, even though my interests ran the gamut because I, I, I remember--well, I guess, everybody goes through this--I just remember thinking, you know, what am I gonna be, you know, how is this gonna turn out when I was a kid, you know.  I remember, I remember telling my dad I was gonna be like him and sell insurance and he said, "No, you're not, you're, no, you're not, you're not gonna do this, you're gonna do something else."  And I went, (makes face). I didn't get it as a kid, you know, I was like, man, but I wanna be like you, what are you talking about?  And then the weird thing about it was my aunt, my aunt Alice [Alice Ray Douglas], she constantly had me in music programs during the summer from the, from the time I was about five or six.  No, I mean, I was talking about, I'm sorry, fifth to sixth grade, sorry not five or six, fifth to sixth grade. She had me in like those programs at Loyola University [Loyola University New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana] they would have a summer program.  That's where I met Wynton Marsalis, as a matter of fact, Wynton and Branford [Branford Marsalis].  And she would always put me in things like that.  And while she was putting me in those things, you know, my mind was that I was still gonna be a football player, you know, I was gonna be Dick Butkus, that was, that was my hero.  But then slowly the music just kind of overtook things.  And then actually what happened was my father, he saw a documentary back then in the '70s [1970s] and it's kind of funny what we're dealing with now in the NFL [National Football League] but--well, not funny, it's kind of interesting, we start having this debate. But he saw a documentary back then where kids were having head injuries and having issues, you know, playing football. And he stopped me from playing.  Yeah, I'll never forget it.  I had just gotten selected to like this all-city team that was gonna travel around the southern region, play some other teams from other cities, and that was like a, they were, they were called, we had something called NORD, N-O-R-D, which stands for New Orleans Recreational Department [sic. New Orleans Recreation Department] and they were like the, the, the group that did all of the extracurricular sporting activities for kids around the city and they were the ones who developed the football league and everything.  So their team was gonna be called the NORD Saints, you know, and I was really excited about being picked, you know, to be, be a part of that and my dad was like, "Nope."  I'm like, "Dad!"  He was like, "No."  So that came to an abrupt halt (laughter).  And then I--that's probably when music took over in my life.  I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how old were you at that point?
Speaker 2: I was about thirteen, fourteen.
Story_ID: 661223
Speaker 1: Now you said your--you were taking piano from age five?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's pretty young, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, see the thing is the reason why that happened is because I would go over to my grandmother's house, man, and I would sit at the piano, I was, and I would sit down and I would plunk out and I'd try to sing Batman ['Batman Theme'] or any one of those cartoon themes and you know, hitting all the wrong notes.  And see my grandfather [John Ray, Sr.] played guitar, my mom's sister [Alice Ray Douglas], she's a piano and voice teacher, my dad [Joseph Blanchard] sang opera so there's music all around the house and people who could appreciate music so they didn't appreciate what, (laughter) what I was doing (laughter).  They were like, "No, no, no, no, no."  Say, "If you're gonna do that get him some lessons, please."  We don't mind you sitting there but don't do that, you know. So that's why I started at a very age, you know, and started with Miss Francis.  And then, but, boy, my dad was like--you remember 'Mo' Better Blues' the movie?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Remember the scene, the mother and the son?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, that was me.  I remember that--I was there the day they were shooting.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: I was there the day they were shooting it and I had, I was having flashbacks because my dad, he used to wear, he had a, he had a big thing of keys and change, since back then when he was selling insurance he would actual collect, you know--
Speaker 1: The money?
Speaker 2: --the money from people.  And it, and it was a small, you know, policies and stuff.  My dad had this thing about African American people being buried with dignity so he was trying to make sure, he was going to the poor neighborhoods and he was trying to make sure that these people had enough money, money to bury their loved ones so, so the policies weren't really expensive. But he had, he'd always have change in his pocket and you could hear him coming a mile away 'cause he had this nervous tick where he would rumble his hands through his change.  So I remember, man, I'd be in the back like sitting out chilling, watching TV, watching cartoons or something and a door would open in the front of the house and I'd hear that change, I'd be like oh, here he come, oh, god, here he come.  And then, you know, he'd come in the back and he'd say, "Hey, boy, don't you have a recital in two months?"  Well, to somebody who's like seven, eight, two months is like an eternity, you know.  I'm like, "Yeah."  "You need to be practicing.  Come on, come on."  I'm like, "Man."  "Cut that TV off."  And then he would sit on the couch and he would--the only, (laughter) oh, my god.  The only instruction he would give me, he would go, "Hey, that didn't sound smooth, go back, stop, go back and do that again, play that, yeah, play that part right."  And that's what he did to me.  He, he would do that, oh, and I hated it, oh, my god.  I stopped playing music when I was kid like two, two times, yeah, because I, I had three piano teachers, you know, Martha Francis, was the first one, Louise Winchester [sic. Lois Winchester] was the second one, and Roger Dickerson was the third.  And in between both of them I, I was kind of like, you know, I'm done with this, you know, because he wasn't no joke, you know.  And then my dad was also like a very punctual type of dude so he was always like neurotic with like being on time, that's probably why I'm always late now, (laughter) you know.  The church that we, the church that we went to was literally fifteen minute drive, church service started at eleven, my dad had me up at eight o'clock. Taking my shower, "Get ready, get your breakfast 'cause we're not gone be late for church."  I'm like, "I guess so."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Eight o'clock, dude?  We could walk from here to the church and still be early, that's how--you know, but it--that's the kind of dude he was, man, you know, so anyway.
Story_ID: 661224
Speaker 1: So where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: Elementary school I went to Mary Dora Coghill [Mary Dora Coghill Elementary School; Mary Dora Coghill Charter School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Then for, for a year I went to this junior high school called P.A. Capdau [P.A. Capdau Junior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], right, C-A-P, I think it's D-A-U, I think that's how it's spelled.  And I went there for a year because I was trying to get into St. Aug [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], the private school, and they started at eighth grade and I went to Capdau at seventh grade so I got accepted into St. Aug and I was at St. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And St. Aug was the place everybody wanted to attend, right?
Speaker 2: It was one of the schools that a lot of African Americans were sending their kids to.  You know, you know, it was, it would--had a great reputation and it was a, a school that was dedicated to, you know, teaching African American kids and uplifting them.  It was a all-boys school, you know.
Speaker 1: All-boys private school?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I, I read in, in this book ['Contemporary Cat: Terence Blanchard with Special Guests,' Anthony Magro] about you about the school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it was very prestigious?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Expensive, not so easy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --to get in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You went and then what happened?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, man, yeah, so I was there. And they had a good, you know, they had, they had great teachers.  Edwin Hampton was the band director and he had two assistants, one of 'em who has passed on and Mr. Hampton has passed as well.  Lawrence Winchester who was the husband of Louise Winchester [sic. Lois Winchester]--
Speaker 1: Your--
Speaker 2: --who was my piano teacher, he was a trumpet player and he, and he helped us out with that.  And then Carl Blouin who, who played saxophone.  I just did a gig with Mr. Blouin, he's like eighty some years old.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Still playing, he looks great too.
Story_ID: 661225
Speaker 1: The thing that happened was I started to really become serious wi- about music and I knew Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] and Branford [Branford Marsalis] and I remember when I, when I saw Wynton when he, when we were like in fifth or sixth grade, you know, his playing was at a certain level and then I saw him again like maybe three years later or something like that and, no, it was about four or five years, yeah, 'cause it was about--yeah, about three years later, eighth grade.  I saw him again and he was totally different.  I'm like, "Hey, what happened to you?"  And then, you know, they were telling me, "Oh, I--we're going to NOCCA."  I'm like, "NOCCA?"  He said, "Man, you gotta get to NOCCA, you gotta get to NOCCA."  I'm like, "What is NOCCA?"  New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts [sic. New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana], it's an arts high school.  And when I found (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it was new at that time, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  It had, yeah, it had been around like maybe four or five years.  And when I got wind of that I was like wait a minute, I gotta do this.  You know, how you get that feeling like you don't wanna be left behind and you see something and you go wow, I saw what happened to this guy, I wanna get that, whatever that is.  So I started talking to my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] about going to NOCCA.  They weren't having it at first, not at all, you know, 'cause I was going to (gesture) the school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I don't know how, some people at the school got wind to the fact that I was gonna go to NOCCA and, and Mr.--
Speaker 2: Some people at St. Aug [St. Augustine High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And Mr. Hamp [Edwin Hampton] called me into his office and wanted to talk to me about it, I'll never forget it.  And I said, "Well, man," because back then they had a band period, you know, for each class, for each hour there was a band period, right, but the band period was basically study hall until all of the band was together after school then we'd have rehearsal.  And that didn't make any sense to me, you know, and I told Mr. Hamp about it because he's a knowledgeable dude, you know. So he started like giving theory classes and stuff like that but I had already taken theory with Miss Winchester [Lois Winchester].  Miss Winchester was amazing.  She was amazing.  Let me just tell you this.  She was my piano teacher but she also held classes on the weekends for like about four or five of us, theory classes, and we were young kids and she was teaching us theory when we were like real little, you know. And it's one of those things you take for granted as a kid but you get old and you go wow, that's pretty miraculous that she had that kind of dedication.  And she would be on us, give us tests and exams and all of that stuff.  So by the time I was at St. Aug I already knew basic theory, I already had that together, you know.  And by the time I got to NOCCA, the same thing, I, that, that wasn't an issue for me. It was more, I needed more of the trumpet skills that was the thing.
Speaker 2: So at St. Aug they had the marching band?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that was a well known marching band--
Speaker 1: It--
Speaker 2: --right?
Speaker 1: Very, very well known.
Speaker 2: But you describe in the book how they marched but not necessarily were applying the musical skills to it?
Speaker 1: Well, that was the thing.  They had a great concert band and they had a great jazz band.  But those bands were great because, you know, they worked us hard. And like Mr. Winchester, Mr. Blouin [Carl Blouin], they were very smart, and they would do things with us to but I wasn't getting the other stuff, you know, the more personalized attention to detail, which they couldn't do, you know, 'cause they, they also taught class, you know.  St. Aug wasn't structured that way.  And I couldn't deal with the marching thing anymore, I just, I just couldn't do it.  I mean, that, that was taking such a toll on me, you know, emotionally mostly. You know, because while I had fun, you know, when I was in eighth grade, by the time I was in tenth grade I was like I don't know, this ain't for me.  And, and I was learning more about NOCCA.  So I made the, the decision, now the thing that was interesting about it, when I finally made the decision NOCCA was a half day school, so you had to go to another school during the day and St. Aug would not allow us to go to NOCCA so that was another reason why I had to leave St. Aug and I had to go to a public school.  So I go to John F. Kennedy [John F. Kennedy High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], you know, and Lloyd Harris was the band director there and he was another great band director, you know, in that tradition of those marching bands, great concert bands and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Which is a huge thing in New Orleans [Louisiana]--
Speaker 1: Huge.
Speaker 2: --too?
Speaker 1: Huge.  I mean, that was, that's one of the sad things that's happened since Hurricane Katrina, it hasn't come back like that, you know.  And that was, that was major, that was a major source of pride for a lot of young kids growing up, you know.  So when I got to Kennedy, Mr. Harris heard, he knew me, he knew of me and he heard that I was coming there and he wanted me in, you know, all of the bands. And I told him I said, well, I said, "Mr. Harris," I said, "I would love to be in the concert band and the jazz band but I can't march.  I'm, I'm not doing that anymore."  And he understood so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was just too hard physically?
Speaker 1: No, well, well, it was hard physically but just, it, it wasn't where I was emotionally, you know.  I, I felt like I could have been spending my time doing something else more constructive, you know, for what I wanted to do.  And he understood it, and he was, he was very supportive.
Story_ID: 661226
Speaker 1: So I went to Kennedy [John F. Kennedy High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] in the morning and then at lunch time a bus would pick us up and bring us to NOCCA [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana] and my life changed overnight.
Speaker 2: How so?
Speaker 1: It was the first time in my life--and I'm not ashamed to say this--it was the first time in my life I wanted to go to school every day.  I'll never forget, it hit me, you know, really hard because I was sick, I had like a flu and I was getting out of bed to get dressed and my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] was like, "Boy, where are you going?"  I'm like, "Ma, I gotta go to school," 'cause I know we were gonna be learning, I was learning something every day, you know, about music and I loved it, man, I, I loved it.  I, I, I can't tell you how much, Dr. Bert Braud was my theory and analysis and composition instructor and he would challenge us, you know, to no end. And he would do things like, hey, man, you know, he knew I wanted to be a writer and he said, "Well, listen, man, you may be called upon in a session, you may have to write this horn line for five horns, all right, you got five minutes," (snaps fingers), "go do it."  You know, and he would do things like that.  And then he'd say, "Oh, listen, you may be in a session one place where you have to write out something so look I'm gonna give you thirty minutes to write out a whole tune, just give me the lead sheet."  I'm like, "Thirty minutes?"  He said, "Go" (snaps fingers).  You know, and then we would, we would do things like serious analysis, you know, we'd sit down and break down, Liszt [Franz Liszt] 'Piano Concerto No. 2.' You know, and we'd sit down and have to go through the whole thing and break it down, what's the first theme, second theme, transitional phrases, and all of that stuff, what is this, what is the correct form of the piece, whether it's sonata-allegro form, all of those things.  And I was doing that when I was fifteen, sixteen years old, you know.  So I was like in a whirlwind.  And the other thing I felt like was--see I only went to NOCCA for my junior and my senior year and most kids were going from sophomore so I felt like I was behind, so that's another reason why I didn't wanna miss 'cause I saw what it was doing for me, you know.  And I'm, I'm always talking about NOCCA because they didn't sugarcoat things.  They used to tell us.  Well, the- they told us at orientation, they said, "Look around." They said, "After the first half of the year, half of y'all are not gonna be here." 'Cause they put you out if you didn't have, if your grades weren't up, you couldn't go.  And they were right.  My theory class had, when I first got there maybe it was, it was still relatively small, maybe it was about twenty, twenty-five people, at the end of that Christmas break, come back, it was only about ten or twelve of us.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, they were no joke.
Story_ID: 661227
Speaker 1: So who went to school with you there?
Speaker 2: Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] went to school with me there, Lolis Elie, Wendell Pierce, he was there.  And then a bunch of other folks, you know, who were, who were doing their thing.  You know, there was this dancer named Dwight [ph.], he was there.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't just music?
Speaker 2: No, it was a, it was an arts high school.  They had the five disciplines, you know, drama, music, writing, visual, and, and what was the other one?  Oh, I can't think of it now.  Dance, dance, that was it.
Speaker 1: So you mentioned the Marsalis brothers and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that you met them when you were in a, in a summer program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a summer program at Loyola University [Loyola University New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Fifth grade.
Speaker 1: And are, and what are your--
Speaker 2: Wynton--
Speaker 1: --ages (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Wynton, is a year older than me and Branford [Branford Marsalis] is a two year, he's two years older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you competitors instantly?
Speaker 2: Oh, Wynton was (laughter).  Wynton has always been competitive, man.  He was competitive back then.  I mean, not me, you know, I, I didn't know any better, you know.  I was, I was trying to figure it out, you know, first of all like remember I kind of didn't wanna be there, you know, I wanted to play sports but my aunt was like, "No, you're gonna go to this program."  I'm like okay.  So (laughter) but it was funny 'cause he was, he was so, he was, he was a small guy back then, you know, and a small guy with a big mouth, the same, you know, it, it hasn't changed, it hasn't changed.  But we became, you know, really good friends, man, you know, me and Branford especially.  You know, Wynton used to get upset with us 'cause we'd, we'd be in the student center playing pinball machine.  "Man, y'all should be practicing."  "Okay" (laughter) (snaps fingers).
Speaker 1: At NOCCA [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, at Loyola.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is in, in that summer program (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The summer, the summer program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were little kids.  No, no, by the time I got to NOCCA, no, it, it, it got real serious, you know, all of that stuff went away.  Oh, but back then, no, we were fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Like, "Practice? (Makes sound) Yeah, okay.  See you" (laughter).
Story_ID: 661228
Speaker 1: When did you transition from piano to the horn?
Speaker 2: Well, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well, you still played piano but (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was still, I was still taking lessons, I was doing all of that.  I, my weekends were like a trip, you know, because I would have a trumpet lesson at one part of the day and then have a piano lesson another part of the day.  The piano lessons were easier to deal with. Oh, actually, you know, what?  No, the piano lessons were during the week, the piano lessons were during the week because Roger Dickerson lived in my neighborhood so I could make those piano lessons rather easily.  And then my weekends were, you know, when I would do the trumpet thing.  And that, that went on even into college [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] 'cause when I went to college I was studying piano with Kenny Barron and I was studying trumpet with Bill Fielder [William Fielder].
Speaker 1: What made you pick up the trumpet?
Speaker 2: Alvin Alcorn.  Alvin Alcorn.  Man, I was in elementary school [Mary Dora Coghill Elementary School; Mary Dora Coghill Charter School, New Orleans, Louisiana], I think I was fourth grade and they brought us into the cafeteria for an assembly, we didn't have a gym, you know. So they brought us into the cafeteria and they set up this band to play and I was sitting right down front and I had been playing piano and when Alvin started to play the trumpet--the--it's, it's--I, I was telling somebody the other day, I can't even remember--I know that, I know there had to be piano, bass, and drums there but I can't remember anything else because his vibrato and the sound, the thing that he was doing with the instrument, it sounded like, like it had a serious vocal quality to it which is something the piano couldn't do in my mind back then.  And I remember going home telling my dad [Joseph Blanchard], I said, "Man, I wanna play the trumpet."  They had just, and they had just rented me a piano.  Yeah, that was an interesting day.  (Laughter) Yeah.  But anyway, (laughter) I think my, my dad, forget about his religion that day (laughter).  Now I think of us, yeah, it was crazy.  But, but now I think about it, I really love my parents because, you know, that couldn't have been a hard, couldn't have been an easy decision for them but they allowed me to do it and they went out and bought me a horn.  And one of the things they said was--and that's probably why I do both, they said well, if you do this you're gonna, you're gonna keep up the piano 'cause my dad's thing was it doesn't matter what type of music you play, you still need to know how to play the piano.  I think it was just 'cause he rented the piano and he was, you know, "I got this damn thing in the house, oh, you're gonna play the piano."  I think it was mostly that, you know, (laughter).
Story_ID: 661229
Speaker 1: Well, and then can you tell the story about, one of your parents approached Alcorn wasn't it to say--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it was my dad [Joseph Blanchard].
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we were, I was in the car.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were coming down on Claiborne Avenue, you know, off the, off the, well, we call the interstate, the highway, and got down to the light and, and I'm telling you, it's funny, the story, it takes longer to tell the story that it actually happened 'cause, you know, the cars are coming down like this, and I'm going, "Dad, dad, that's the guy, that's the guy.  He's the guy that plays the trumpet."  And my dad goes, "Oh, that's Al."  He knew him.  And I go, "Uh-oh." And I got excited, you know, so they rolled down the window and my dad goes, "Hey, Al."  And he goes, Al goes (nods head), "Hey, Al, how you doing?"  He said, "Hey, man, this is my son."  And he said, "Listen man, he's playing the trumpet. You think you could teach him how to play jazz?"  And I got real excited like I was gonna study with Alvin Alcorn.  And Alvin said, "No, man, he's gotta learn how to do that for himself."  And I was a little boy, I was crushed, crushed, crushed.  I was like what?  (Laughter) And the next thing his car drove off, (laughter) okay.  But, you know, that was the best thing I could have heard.  I, you know, I was just telling somebody the other day about this because I said, you know, being older now I can understand that what that did was it made me immediately understand that you, nothing is gonna be given to you.  You gotta work for it yourself.  You gotta work hard.  And so while it hurt me it was probably the best thing I could have heard.
Story_ID: 661230
Speaker 1: Well, and as you describe in the book, ['Contemporary Cat: Terence Blanchard with Special Guests,' Anthony Magro] ma- well, many people are self-taught.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that is not the route that you chose?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I didn't wanna, I didn't wanna go that route because I just kept seeing the world of music being something different for me.  I was too inquisitive, that's basically what it is.  I wanted to know more.  I'm still the type of person, I feel uncomfortable if I'm, if I'm doing something and it happens to work out.  I don't like that feeling.  You know, I mean, I'll accept it because that's what happens in art, but after that happens I'm trying to figure out well, what exactly happened there, you know.  So I didn't wanna be one of those guys who just played by ear 'cause those guys were limited in terms of the stuff that they could do and what we used to say back then was, well, "Man, you're not gonna be able to do any session work, you know, because you're not gonna be able to read."  Plus the people that I was around they would not allow that for me.  They would not allow me to be that way.  From Miss Francis [Martha Francis] to Miss Winchester [Lois Winchester] to Roger [Roger Dickerson], all of 'em, and, and, George Jansen, my trumpet teacher, and my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] and them, you know, they were not gonna have that.  You gotta remember my aunt's [Alice Ray Douglas] working in the school system, you know, so they were like no.  As a matter of fact, you know, I was one of those kids where I had dual citizenship because I talked one way in the street (laughter).
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know what I mean.  And I had to talk another way.  And sometimes you'd forget, you'd come inside and my mom would be like, "Hey, hey, you leave that out there, you don't bring that in here."  I'm like, "Okay, yes, ma'am" (laughter).  Everything had to be very clear.
Story_ID: 661231
Speaker 1: When did you know that you wanted to be a musician? Like that that would be your life's work?
Speaker 2: It started around the time--it started, peaking my curiosity when my father [Joseph Blanchard] stopped me from playing football.
Speaker 1: And this is at what age?
Speaker 2: I think I was about fourteen or fifteen somewhere in there.  Maybe thirteen, fourteen somewhere in that, in that realm but it was like a quick shift because I had already been playing music, you know, so it just became--it took up a bigger spot in my life.  And it wasn't until when I got to NOCCA [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana] that I felt like I could do it, you know.  I always wanted to, you know, but didn't know where to go.  And I know that feeling, I, I know kids have that feeling and it's a horrible feeling to have when you want something so bad but you don't know where to go to attain the information to help you develop those skills.  And I remember that's, that's why I was so eager to, to go to NOCCA 'cause when Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] told me about it, I went whoa, okay.  I remember, it's gonna sound silly, but I remember thinking to myself there's a school that would teach you how to play music?  Really?  Well, I gotta be there, you know.  And once I got there and I guess I started to display a certain amount of ability to my, my instructors, they start treating you differently, you know.  And when they started treating me differently, I started acting differently.  You know, then I started realizing well, well, maybe I can do this.  And then, you know, do you, have you performed places?  And then when you start performing and people respond you go, oh, okay.  So it's kind of like a gradual thing.  It's something that I wanted but then all of a sudden (snaps fingers) it all, it all, all of sudden it clicks.  I remember from one of the, I was a junior and I was playing the--
Speaker 1: At NOCCA?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this was at Kennedy [John F. Kennedy High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was playing for the, the graduation, right.  And I got up to play 'Feels So Good,' I don't know if you remember that tune, and my cousin, Linda [ph.], she was in the audience and she had never heard me play. Never, never, and she freaked out 'cause she didn't think I, she, you know, she didn't know I could play at that level, you know.  And that was the only thing she talked, she screamed and everybody was like, who is that?  And when I saw her I went oh, sit down, sit down, please (laughter).  And then she came home and that's the only thing she talked about.  She came over to the house, giving me hugs and so she was my older cousin, you know.  She was something else.
Story_ID: 661232
Speaker 1: I'd asked you about when you knew that you wanted to be a professional.  I wanna ask about your family.  You know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a lot of times parents are not excited about their children wanting to be musicians.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now obviously music was in your house and in your family.  When it became clear that that's what you wanted to do, how did they react?
Speaker 2: Well, the, they were always very supportive but they just wanted me to be a classical musician, that was the thing, you know.  They were pushing me down that road.  See, and like whenever I went to musical events with them it was, you know, arias, operatic stuff, you know, what I mean, all, all of that, all of the time, that was their thing.  And they--and the funny part about it was my aunt [Alice Ray Douglas] she went to school with Ellis Marsalis [HistoryMaker Ellis Marsalis, Jr.] and Roger Dickerson.  My dad [Joseph Blanchard] knew a lot of jazz musicians. So they were into the, they were in that world, they just didn't want me to be a part of that, you know.  So there was a little bit of a reluctance there when I said that I wanted to be a jazz musician, that's really what I wanted to do.  I remember I'd come home, man, and I'd, I'd play my Clifford Brown records and my [maternal] grandmother [Susan Lawson Ray] would have a fit.  Sometimes she would, you know, on, mostly on Sundays, you know, and she said, "Wait a--take that music off it's, it's making me nervous."  I'm like, and I remember telling her, "It's supposed to" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: "It's supposed to make you feel something."  I was a radical, you know.  "That's what that music is, it's supposed to make you think," you know.  And then she would come back, "Yeah, but this is the Lord's Day. We only gonna listen to the Lord's music today."  I'm like, "Well, didn't the Lord create these dudes," (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Now, it, also at the time--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --'cause this is the '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Jazz was not--
Speaker 2: Oh (shakes head).
Speaker 1: --jazz was kind of dead.
Speaker 2: Dead?  You know, it was, you know, they were getting ready to put the last little bits of dirt--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --over the, it was so bad--
Speaker 1: Well, even Miles was--
Speaker 2: Miles wasn't playing.
Speaker 1: --wasn't playing--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --jazz.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Miles came back, what in the '80s [1980s], I think--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) or something like that.  But, you know, what was interesting, I remember, this is gonna sound really stupid and silly, but I remember for me to buy my records, I had to go to the store and order them from a catalog.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they weren't in the record store?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, they didn't stock 'em, they weren't stocking 'em. Not in my neighborhood where I was living on the, on, you know, in Pontchartrain Park out in the east side of New Orleans [Louisiana].  Nope, I had to go and look in the catalog and get the number, write it down, say, "I want this one, I want this one." Then like a month later, you know, I get a phone call, "Oh, your records are in."
Speaker 1: What was it about jazz that drew you in?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, the first thing that happened was I was such a believer in the American dream that I thought what I was hearing in public was the absolute best of what could be in music.  And I remember the first time I heard Clifford Brown, I was stunned 'cause I, I was confused and I kept saying, well, wait a minute, how come nobody knows about this guy?  He can really play the trumpet.  This doesn't make sense to me.  Then I listened to Miles Davis.  Then I was exposed to all of this music and I went, whoa, wait a minute, there's something afoot here.  And I don't know, I just became frustrated.  And the more I started listening to it, the more I had to listen to it 'cause I was trying to figure it out, you know. Like I didn't know what jazz was.  I was, I was like what, I don't get it.  So I remember I used to listen to a Miles Davis record for example, I would listen to one track over and over again and I'd listen to it the first time and only listen to the trumpet, and the second time I'd only listen to the saxophone, so I'd play it back and I would only listen to certain instruments, you know, trying to figure out what is this thing, you know.  But the more I did that I didn't realize how much I was learning about communication and how the, the, the music could flow and move. And it just became a passion, you know. It's just something that kind of evolved and I didn't experience that in other musics 'cause I forgot to tell you, you know, I was playing in some R and B bands at the same time, you know, playing piano in some R and B bands and I wasn't--
Speaker 1: And this is around what age?
Speaker 2: Fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifteen, sixteen.  I wasn't getting that, you know, from that.  I was getting something else from that, I had fun doing it but I wasn't getting that.  And I just wanted more basically.  I just, more knowledge, I wanted to be better at it and that's, that's basically it.  I call it a sickness.  You know, it's like you, once you get bit by the bug it's like you, you constantly roll down that, that hill, roll up that hill, (laughter) basically.
Story_ID: 661233
Speaker 1: When you finished NOCCA [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana] where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey].  And the reason why I went to Rutgers was I was gonna either go to Rutgers or Eastman [Eastman School of Music, Rochester, New York] or I was gonna go out to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and study with Thomas Stevens, a great trumpet player there.  I went to Rutgers because of the trumpet instructor, Bill Fielder [William Fielder], who was from Mississippi, African American guy, he's--he's passed on now too.  Bill was a guy who studied with all of the great trumpet players from the Chicago Symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra], Herseth [Adolph Herseth] and Cichowicz [Vincent Cichowicz] and all of those dudes.  And I knew that he knew about this whole breathing thing that was so successful for all of those guys.  And Rutgers was much closer to New York [New York] than Eastman.  Eastman was six hours away.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Right.  And--
Speaker 1: And what did New York mean to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I could go hear music.  I knew I could go hear live music.  I could be right there in the thick of things, you know, so it was an easy choice.
Story_ID: 661234
Speaker 1: But you left New Orleans [Louisiana]. Was--when you were in New Orleans was there a lot of live music there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was.  I mean, there was, there were--on Bourbon Street there used to be a twenty-four hour music policy, yeah, so guys would be playing all day, all night.
Speaker 1: And playing jazz?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And, and in more clubs, some of 'em, you know, a lot of, a good number of the clubs have closed since that time in the '70s [1970s].  And I remember sometimes when I'd come home from school, I went to school Uptown [New Orleans, Louisiana], I lived on the east side of New Orleans and I could have went home by taking the, the bus that way (gesture) and, and then, or I could take the, go home and take the bus this way (gesture), and when I went this way, you know, I was, I had to transfer in downtown New Orleans right there at Canal [Street] and Bourbon, right.  So sometimes I'd be late 'cause I'd walk up the street and I'd go hear music and the guys like Teddy Riley, Emery Thompson, you know, the, the--Wendell Brunious and John Brunious, great trumpet players, those guys would be playing gigs down there and I, you know, a lot of those clubs they would leave the doors open so--
Speaker 1: Teddy was playing jazz?
Speaker 2: Teddy Riley?  Yeah, not the Teddy Riley, it's another Teddy Riley.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm like, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.  I know, as a matter of fact 'cause when I heard him I went, wait a minute.  Is that--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I don't even know if they were related or anything.  No, but this is a, this is a--
Speaker 1: A different.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: A jazz artist.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Wallace Davenport, he was another, he was another trumpet player.  Those guys were great trumpet players, you know, and I got a chance to just stand out on the sidewalk 'cause I couldn't go in. I was too young (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Too young, right.
Speaker 2: But stand out on the sidewalk and listen to them play, you know.  That was a great education too.
Speaker 1: So even though during this period, jazz wasn't necessarily selling--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --nationally--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in New Orleans, the home of jazz--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --artists were still playing every day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they were playing more of the traditional stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were a couple of places where there, there were some more progressive things going on.  There was a club called Tyler's [Tyler's Beer Garden, New Orleans, Louisiana]. That was Uptown.  Then another club, it's now they call it Snug Harbor [Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro, New Orleans, Louisiana], but back then it was called Faubourg, you know, and guys would play there as well.  So the guys that played there, you know, that's when I had to make an effort to get there.  Those, the guys that played there were James Rivers, Ellis Marsalis [HistoryMaker Ellis Marsalis, Jr.], you know, Alvin Batiste, Earl Turbinton, those were the local guys who were more forward thinking, you know.  And those gigs were like at night, you know, so we'd find out somebody was playing and, you know, we'd, when some, when one of us learned how to drive, we'd make an effort to go out and check out, check out those guys when we were kids.
Story_ID: 661235
Speaker 1: Didn't Ellis Marsalis [HistoryMaker Ellis Marsalis, Jr.] teach at your school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, he taught at NOCCA [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana]. He had the jazz program.  He taught us in jazz improvisation and this sight singing method.
Speaker 1: And so he taught you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And his kids?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, yeah.  Yeah, I was in the class with Wynton [Wynton Marsalis], (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that experience (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was an interesting, well, no, they were cool, man, it was an interesting dynamic, you know, going on but I mean, they were fine, I mean 'cause Ellis, you know, he was just about his job, he was just teaching us and Wynton was about learning so it wasn't, it wasn't a big deal, not at all, you know.  It was, it was, I learned a lot in that class.  You know, Ellis used to make us do these exercises, man, you know, he'd make us improvise and then he said, "You can only improvise in this range."  And then, you know, then he would expand the range and so it makes you think a certain way, you know, and it gets your brain operating and making you start--it, it starts--it gets you to start thinking like a composer in a sense.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, so we would do a lot of those things when we were kids.  Again, you know, that's why, sometimes I think about my life and I go, man, I was really, really blessed to run into all of these people who were that dedicated, you know, to, to teaching.
Story_ID: 661236
Speaker 1: So you go to Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] to learn with Bill Fielder [William Fielder]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And can you describe your time with him?
Speaker 2: Man, it was intense, intense.  This was the first trumpet teacher that called me at home to see if I was practicing.  Yep.  He would call me up.  And if I wasn't practicing he made me pull out my horn while he was on the phone and play for him, yeah.  And he was legally blind so sometimes I had to drive for him too.  And in driving for him that was also another music lesson, history lesson 'cause we'd sit down and talk.  We loved to go out on the turnpike and go to one of those diners and he loved spaghetti and meatballs, he always got--and then he'd get a root beer float afterwards, that was, he was a creature of habit, man.  But my studies with him were amazing because he, he was another stickler for discipline, you know.  I'll never forget when he was starting to talk to me about air and how you breathe and how it should be effortless, how it should be one motion.  You know, he said, "Okay, now, we're gonna play this etude." And I'd start to play that, he would count me off and he'd go, "Stop," he said, "you didn't take in any air," you know. "You have to make sure that--." So sometimes, man, and he would stop me, like if I was playing a etude and I would get to a phrase and then I wouldn't breathe for the next one, he'd stop me, he said, "Okay, go back to the beginning."  And (laughter), legally blind, you know, you know, but he was, he was on my case.  You know, and he also was a great thinker in terms of--see this is the other thing I'm telling you, all of the dudes that I was blessed to be around, they were all forward thinking people, all of 'em.  So they all--and he was one too.  He would always talk to me about, "Hey, man, man, you don't wanna play like everybody else, you need to find your own thing, man.  Check this out, ain't nobody," and he would say, "ain't nobody playing like this." And he'd start dealing with this chordal harmony and he would start singing it, you know.  (Makes sounds), "Man, nobody's doing that, go ahead, Terence [HistoryMaker Terence Blanchard]."  And he'd, he'd always, and he'd get excited, (makes sounds), "Play, play this, play this, play this.  Go to G to C, B flat, F, E flat, A flat. Go ahead, play it, now play it real fast (makes sounds)."  I'm like, "Oh, okay."  "Ha, ha, that's it, we need to work on that."  So I would--I've always been around guys who never rested on just being able to do something, you know, there's never that. It's like okay, you got that. Next, what's the next thing?  So that's been my orientation since I was a little kid.  I'm thi- I mean, it's coming to me now, I'm talking to you about it, it's, it's making a, making sense, you know, but when I start thinking about it everybody that I worked with was like that.  Roger Dickerson, my composition teacher, the same way.  You know, the first thing he said to me my first lesson?  He said, "What do you see yourself doing in ten years?"  Nobody asked me that, I was sixteen years old.  Nobody had never asked me that.  And, you know, what I told him?  I said, I, I had to come up with an answer, I was trying to be hip.  I was like, "Well, I'm gonna have my own band, I'm gonna have a jazz band, and I'm a have people in it from around the world and we're gonna play a lot of different types of music influenced from around the world." And that's exactly what I've been doing.  That hit me one day when I had Lionel Loueke in a band, had him in the band, and then I later on I had a Cuban piano player and I went whoa, this is freaky, (laughter) you know, it's really freaky, but it's fun though, it's fun.
Story_ID: 661237
Speaker 1: You talk about breathing--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and you mentioned earlier artists who had learned a style of breathing and then you just mentioned Fielder [William Fielder].  Obviously, with a wind instrument the breath is really important.  Can, can you talk about the breath and, and--
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, the thing, the thing about it is, is that for some reason, man, some young kids will pick up a, a wind instrument and don't understand it's a wind instrument, you know, that's the, that's the fundamental part to creating sound on it.  And we don't realize like anything new to any of us, you don't realize the level of, of support, wind support you need to create a sound, you know.  So you pick up a horn and you just go in and not much happens.  Well, there's a spiritual and a physical component to it.  The physical is developing that ability to take in air and to support air in a very short period of time, right.  So that's, that's the physical part.  The spiritual part is that most people believe that the breath is spirit, you know.  So then that's why playing to me sometimes, you know, it, it, it can get like really emotional, you know.  And I think it has a lot to do with, with, with all of that inhaling and exhaling because in my mind, you know, you, you're kind of releasing demons, you, you're, you're, you're kind of dealing in a whole 'nother realm.  You know, it's just that the notes are kind of like a melodic representation of all of that stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: So I wanna break that down a little bit more even.  So just on, on a physical level--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it takes a lot to, to find the breath.
Speaker 2: Find it.  Perfect, perfect, perfect way of describing it.
Speaker 1: What do you have to do physically to--you know, people have to do exercises for all kinds of things, what--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what does a trumpet player, what do you have to do?
Speaker 2: Well, well, let me back up and tell you that I found this because, you know, when I started playing music I stopped playing sports but I was always kind of athletic.  And I was doing things and I was in my third, well, it had--there were stages, okay.  So I started jogging like in my twenties and stuff like that and I saw my sound like open up.  Somewhere around the time when I was in my thirties, early thirties, I started boxing and when I started boxing, my sound went to a totally different place, totally different place.  You know, and then I started realizing, you know, when you're just playing your instrument that's only gonna take you so far. So sometimes with my students I ask 'em, I say, "Do you exercise, do you play basketball?"  Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] played basketball, you know, avid.  If he could play all day, every day, he would, you know, that's how he was. Probably still is that way.  Freddie Hubbard played basketball, Miles Davis boxed, so all of these guys were doing, then, then it hit me and I'm like okay, well, I'm, you know, I've continued to do that and I still do it 'til this day and it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You still box?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I, and I think that, that it has helped me to develop wind capacity.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, and I think that's one of the things that helps with sound. Because the thing that I tell my students all the time, volume is not the size of your air, volume is the speed of the air, you know.  Like you, when you, when--so I'm always trying to play with the same size air column so that means that I always have to take in a lot of air so if I take in a lot of air and I'm playing soft, I'm still blowing the same column but the, I'm blowing it at a slower pace.
Speaker 1: So it's called an air column?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  (Exhales) 'Cause sometimes it's, it's just a mental thing.  Playing a trumpet is 90 percent mental, you know.
Story_ID: 661238
Speaker 1: So then going to jazz, which is very soulful and your music is very soulful and you mentioned the, the notion, people think that the breath is spirit.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can, can you talk about what that means for you, and I know now you are a Buddhist.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the breath is very important in eastern spiritual--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --thinking.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's, it's, it's the--I--well, there are so many ways to think about it 'cause I think through the repetitive nature of breathing heavily, you know, it puts the mind at a certain state that allows you to, you know, receive things.  I mean, people believe it in their own way.  I just know when I'm chanting, you know, it does two things, it relaxes me and then it allows me to open my mind up to other possibilities in the universe and it, it just puts me in another place, you know.  It, it can be healing to me in a lot of ways.  When we were playing last week, you know, sometimes, you know, you get to the point where you're exhausted, you've been working a lot, doing interviews, and doing a lot of things, and you, you, you can't believe that you have to play, you're so tired, you don't know how you're gonna get through it.  As soon as you start, the energy just takes over and, you know, and it's one of the things where I tell my students, you have to practice, you have to practice because you wanna get everything down to the point where it's second nature because when you hit the bandstand, you don't have time for all of that.  You know, the, the, there's an energy that can overcome you and if you're talented and you're lucky enough you can ride it, you know, and enjoy it, you know, and then when it's done, you move on. But you only get that by practicing.  You know, it, it, most of us thinks that the divine guidance is just gonna come down and say, okay, be great, boom. You know, no, it's not that.  You have to work hard at it just to receive that.  So, I mean, you know, I think, the, the, the, for what I do the breath is important.  Even for piano players, Mulgrew Miller was a great jazz pianist, who recently passed away, and Mulgrew used to talk about it.  He would sing and breathe and when you watched him play (inhales and exhales) you would, you would see him breathing and getting into this rhythm, this panting, you know, when he played.  And it's an interesting thing we don't talk enough about though, I think.
Story_ID: 661239
Speaker 1: This is slightly out of order but I just wanna stick with this a little bit longer, what--is it [HistoryMaker] Herbie Hancock who introduced you--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to--so can you just tell me when and, and just give me a, a sense of that story of your learning about Buddhism and including that in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I had talked to Herbie about Buddhism years before this happened.  And I remember he sent me a couple of books to read and, and I looked through 'em, I skimmed through 'em, but it wasn't until I went on tour with him and--
Speaker 1: Which was when?
Speaker 2: Was when Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] got elected the first time.  So--
Speaker 1: Oh, 2008 [sic. 2007].
Speaker 2: Yes.  'Cause I remember we were watching in, in Europe.  We were in Europe the date of that election and I had voted, I already had my vote in.  But I remember we were on the road, I was on the road with him for ten weeks and he would chant before every show and he opened it up for anybody who wanted to join.  And I started joining and we started talking about the benefits of it.  And at first I just looked at it, just from a mindset of like just centering myself, you know.  And then you start to feel other things, you start to see other things happen in your life and then you go, wow, well, wait a minute, this reminds me of, it's, it's like praying, the same thing, you know, just a different form of practice.  And I saw so many common elements to stuff that I had heard when I was growing up, you know, in the church. But this was something physical that I could do every day.  And it turned my life around.  I mean, it, it, it, it, it was such a powerful thing.  It allowed me to open, like I said, it allowed me to open up my, my heart and my soul to receive, you know, and not be judgmental, you know, and just relax and joy, and enjoy the life, enjoy this life.
Speaker 1: How did it change your music?  Or did it?
Speaker 2: No, it did.  I mean, the, the best way that I can say that it allowed me to receive the energy that's present at any given time and it's, as opposed to me ignoring it and having my ego say this is what I've been practicing so I'm gonna play this got damn it, no matter (laughter) what happens. You know, so, I, I think that's probably, the, the biggest change that has happened to me.  It's like, you know, when I step on a bandstand right now, I'd step on the bandstand not fearful, that's not, that's not the word but I try to clear my thoughts, you know.  Like for example, sometimes, you know, when we're doing a show and the saxophone player might be playing a solo and the solo is just like amazing and great and the guys are getting into this rhythm and they're doing this harmonic thing and it's like really cool, and I'm enjoying it too, and I'm telling myself stop because when it's your turn to play, we gonna be someplace else, you know, what I mean?  So stop, don't think you're gone be there, right.  And sure enough, it happens every time.  So when it's my turn to play, the guys break it down, boom, and then they go into something different and then I gotta find my way and once I find my way we start to respond and have a conversation going back and forth and I just try to let it happen, you know, it takes on a life of its own.
Story_ID: 661240
Speaker 1: I took us out of order, I wanna go back to--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --when you were at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you're studying music, are you, is it, are you studying everything else too? Is it a traditional degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, not much.  Yeah, I had like creative writing classes, I had a few other things but most of my stuff was music based, you know.  And, and, and I was there on a scholarship.  Man, I can't remember this brother's name. Oh, man, he, he taught me creative writing.  It was interesting, that class was eight o'clock Monday morning, damn. Oh, my god.  And I used to play with Lionel Hampton, so we would--
Speaker 1: While you were--
Speaker 2: While I was in college.  So and I had to catch the bus back from New York [New York] to New Brunswick [New Jersey], man, so sometimes I was getting home at six A.M., you know, and I would be falling asleep in his class.  Man, I forgot this brother's name, he had dreadlocks, tall dude, man. But he was really cool because he knew what I was doing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Quincy?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was it Quincy Troupe?
Speaker 2: No, not Quincy, I would've remembered Quincy. Yeah, no, it wasn't him.  But I remember--'cause I, I met Quincy, me and Quincy, we're cool.
Speaker 1: He's, yeah, he's cool (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cool people, yeah.  When, when he found out what I was doing, my assignments were to write about my, my experiences playing with Lionel Hampton, you know, that was the thing and then he would critique it and stuff like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Now how did you come to play with Lionel Hampton while you were in college?
Speaker 2: I got to school, I got to Rutgers a week early.  I--well, remember, I applied late 'cause like I said I was gonna go to Eastman [Eastman School of Music, Rochester, New York]. So I applied late and when I applied all the housing was taken up.  I get to Rutgers a week early, I'm staying with Paul Jeffries [sic. Paul Jeffrey] who is the band director there. I'm staying at his house.  Paul played with Lionel Hampton.  So that first weekend he had a gig with Lionel Hampton and we were living in New Jersey so he would, he would drive up to, from New Jersey to get on the bus with the band.  He told me, he says, "Hey, man, you should come, bring your horn."  I'm like okay.   So--
Speaker 1: And you knew who Lionel Hampton was obviously (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, definitely.
Speaker 1: I mean, he's iconic at this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm like cool.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean, I didn't think nothing of it, I was like cool.  I get on the bus and I'm hanging out with musicians, hanging out with some young trumpet players.  We drive down to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and it was a outdoor gig, I'll never forget it.  And one of the trumpet players said, "Man, well, let me hear you play something."  So they're doing, they're setting up the stage and I'm over there just doing stuff and they're trying to give me pointers and stuff, you know, I'm, I think I was like eighteen at the time.  And Lionel Hampton comes up behind me--and he calls everybody Gates--he goes, "Hey, Gates, let me hear you play blues with the piano player."  So they brought me over where the piano player was, Zeke Mullins [Reynolds "Zeke" Mullins] was his name, and I played the blues with the piano player and Hamp said, "I'm a call you for some gigs, Gates."  I went, "Wow."  And the next week I was on the road with Lionel Hampton before I started school (laughter).  Yeah, it was fun.  I felt bad 'cause one of the dudes I was talking to, the guy that asked me to pull out my horn was the guy I replaced.  Yeah, I felt bad, for that first weekend (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how long did you play with him?
Speaker 2: I played with him for like a year and a half.
Speaker 1: So this was every weekend was--
Speaker 2: Just about, it seemed like it was just about every weekend.  And it was great, man, 'cause I was on financial aid, you know, I got a scholarship, you know, and that money was very, very helpful, you know, for, for a kid with college pockets back then, you know.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And plus the experience was great because that's where I meet Curtis Fuller, a great trombone player, I meet Frankie Dunlop, a great drummer, you know, and I would be on the bus with these guys.  Man, Oliver Beaner was a great trumpet player in the band, he took me under his wing, you know, and he was, he was the guy, you know, he just kind of, just said, "Hey, man, you come here," he called me little brother. "Hey, little brother, you come here."  And I learned a lot from those guys back then.  It was a great--I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
Speaker 1: Now at age eighteen playing in Lionel Hampton's band, you're getting paid.  What, what's the money like then?
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't much.  I, I think, we were getting paid a hundred dollars a show, you know.
Speaker 1: But for an eighteen year old--
Speaker 2: Well, for me, it was a killing.  Are you kidding?  I didn't have no responsibilities.  Are you kidding?  Rent was paid, I was like holler (laughter).  You know.  But the funny part was I wasn't big man on campus 'cause I was like my dad [Joseph Blanchard], my dad was cheap.  So all my money was going into the bank.  And I was like, yeah.  They say, "How's the gig?"  I'm like, "It's cool.  Yeah, it's good.  Right, don't ask" (laughter).  Yeah, but no it was great.  I remember I bought my first stereo with the money that I had saved 'cause I had, there was a stereo store I used to go in to and they had the great equipment and I love sound and I'm, man, I'd be in there.  And there was a guy in there, man, he was really cool, he was into jazz too and he knew what I was doing so, you know, he, he, he helped me buy this system that you can add on great stuff, you know, you don't have to buy everything at one point, at one time, and that was my first system (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Components.
Speaker 2: Components.  Yeah, it was really cool.  And that's what I did with my money.

Speaker 1: So when did you graduate college?
Speaker 2: I never graduated college.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So what's--tell me more about Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And what, how do we go from, where do we go from Lionel Hampton--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Rutgers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) right.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Well, I was at Rutgers in 1980 and I was playing with Lionel Hampton.  I was the first one in my immediate family--my aunt [Alice Ray Douglas] went to college but my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] and my dad [Joseph Blanchard] didn't so I was the first one to go to college.  And they were--and I went to an Ivy League school [sic.]? Please, you know, they wanted me to be a classical musician remember so I'm going, I'm going to Rutgers, "My son is at Rutgers," you know, that was a big thing.  Had to come back with all the paraphernalia for everybody.  And I was playing with Lionel Hampton who they also knew. And that was like--he was--I remember Ebony magazine took a picture of Lionel Hampton at some place and I was a speck in the corner of the picture, I think, I bet you Ebony sales went up that month 'cause everybody was buy- in my family was buying the magazine.  So they were cool with me doing that.  That was about a year and a half.  All of a sudden Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] calls me up and he goes, "Hey, man, I'm leaving Art Blakey's band and I want you to audition."  I'm like, "Cool."  I go up and audition, didn't tell my parents, I got the gig.  And I'm like oh, killing.  They say we're gone leave for Europe for ten weeks and I went, "Uh-oh."  So I had to call my parents and I had to tell 'em, I said, like, "Guess what?  I got this gig playing with Art Blakey."  "Oh, well, that's nice, that's nice."  And I said, "But I think I'm gone have to leave school."  (Makes sound) It was like the piano thing but even worse (laughter).  Yeah.  My father told me, he said--I'll never forget it--he said, "You're not my son."  Yeah, that hurt me.  He said, "You're not my son," he said "'cause my son wouldn't do nothing that stupid."  'Cause he didn't know who Art Blakey was, you know.  And it didn't make sense to him, I was playing with Lionel Hampton on the weekends, making money and still in school and I'm gonna leave that to go play with some dude they don't know? You know, oh, man, it was, it was really, it was--it was amazing.  But the thing that was cool about it, you know, me and my dad had a great relationship because at that moment he didn't talk to me for a little bit but I'll never forget when I made my first record with Art Blakey, right? Art--they called the album, they used my song as the title track, 'Oh-By the Way,' which is something that I had written when I was in high school, right.  I come back with the album and I give it to my dad, like, "Man, see this is what I've been doing, this is, I'm, I'm telling you, this is the guy," then they got a picture of us on the back, you know.  Like, "This, this is what I've been doing."  My dad was kind of like, "Yeah, all right, whatever."  But you gotta remember my dad had some jazz friends, right.  So (laughter) I don't know if it was like a month, or a little while later, I get a phone call from my dad, I'm back up here in New York [New York] and my dad goes, "Hey, I was talking to Clem." Clem Tervalon [Clement Tervalon] was a trombone player in New Orleans [Louisiana], great trombone player.  He said, "Yeah, I was talking to Clem and Clem told me this Art Blakey is somebody," (laughter).  I said, I said, "Well, I was trying to tell you that," (laughter) you know.  And that's when things started to turn around for, for me and him.  And I'll never forget it--boy, I don't know what, how we got in this conversation.  My dad was talking to me one day and he goes, "I'm proud of you." And I'm like, "Well, thank you," and, and he goes, "No, you don't understand."  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "If you would have listened to me," he said, 'cause he wanted me, he didn't want me to go away to school--he said, "if you would have listened to me you would have been in New Orleans, probably not doing what you wanna do, and you'd probably be bitter."  He said, "And I'm proud of what you turned into."  That was huge, that was really huge.
Story_ID: 661242
Speaker 1: Ten weeks turned into what?
Speaker 2: (Exhales) Four years with Art Blakey.  That was ten years [sic.] of like just serious life changing events damn near every day.  I was a country dude, you know.  I'm sorry, I'm still thinking about my dad [Joseph Blanchard] (crying).  Anyway.  I don't know how to explain it other than to say that everything in my belief system was being challenged.  I grew up in a church, I started learning about other types of beliefs, you know.  I was experiencing other cultures 'cause we were in Europe for ten weeks.
Speaker 1: And you'd never traveled out of the country before?
Speaker 2: No, once, I went to, we had a high school trip, we went to Italy for, for a few days but that was about it.  But to be in all of these different countries, you know, man, (laughter) didn't know how to eat the food, didn't know how to order the food. And then all of the words were like, what you mean champignons, what is that?  I don't drink--what is this, you know, it was, it was just one of those things.  I could speak Spanish, you know, a little bit of Spanish and that helped me out a great deal but then also I was meeting all of my heroes.  I met Dizzy Gillespie, you know.  And when I met Dizzy we were playing a show some place, I can't remember, and we was--outdoor concert and when we played the first half and then we went into the dressing room. And when we go into the dressing room, Art Blakey tells Dizzy, he said, "Hey, Dizzy, you know, he plays piano too."  And Dizzy goes, "Yeah?"  And he said, "Well, listen, man," he said, "well, we gonna go back out and it's just gone be me and you."  I'm nineteen.
Speaker 1: Dizzy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm nineteen years old.  And he goes, "You're gonna play piano for me on a ballad, and then I'm a play piano for you on a ballad."  And I went, "Okay."  And I was nineteen years old, hands shaking at the piano playing with Dizzy, you know.  Sad part about technology if it were today somebody would have that video (laughter) some place, you know.  So things like that were happening to me the entire trip.  Met [HistoryMaker] Wayne Shorter, you know.
Story_ID: 661243
Speaker 1: Few years later I played Jacksonville Jazz Festival and it was televised.  We go back to Europe, I'm with Art Blakey, this is 1983. I joined the band in '82 [1982].  It was '83 [1983], we're in Perugia, Italy, and I'm coming out of the Hotel Rosetta [Hotel La Rosetta, Perugia, Italy] where we would stay, and as I'm coming down the steps, like three or four journalists they run up to me with microphones and they go, "What do you think about what Miles Davis said about you?"  And I go, "Well, what did he say?"  (Laughter) You know, I don't--with Miles it could go in any direction, you know, (laughter) he has a--'cause he don't hold back.  So I'm like, okay, well, just tell me what he said first.  And somebody asked him about up and coming trumpet players and he liked me because he saw me play at the Jacksonville Jazz Festival, he saw the broadcast.  Now for me that is my hero, that is my dude.  So when I heard that I didn't even wanna do the interview, I'm like well, what are you talking about?  I'm like I don't know what to say to that, I mean, it's a great compliment obviously, you know, but I was floating on air, man, for the rest of the day.  And then Miles came to the area to play a concert and they had a bus. It wasn't right there in Perugia but the promoter--it was, it was all part of the same festival. So the promoter arranged for a bus for us to go to Miles' concert, it was out in a football stadium some place.  No, no, the, no, the first one was out in a square, it was a square.  And, man, I was backstage in the back area outside his dressing room and Miles comes out and he goes and does his show and I knew Al Foster, the drummer, and when they came back they went back in the dressing room, you know, Al saw me looking at Miles and he goes, "Hey, man, you never met Miles?"  And I go, "No."  He said, "Man, come on let me introduce you."  I was like oh, shit, (laughter) oh, shit.  So I walk in the dressing room and Miles is fumbling in his pockets. He had on red leather pants, I'll never forget it.  And he was fumbling in his pockets, man, and then he looks up at me and he goes, "Terence [HistoryMaker Terence Blanchard]."  I went, "Hey, man."  I'm like, "Hey, it's good to meet you."  He said, "Keep doing what you're doing motherfucker."  (Laughter) You know, that was, oh, man.  And then every time I saw him after that he was cool.  Every time.  He was so fun. I'll tell you a funny story though.  He was always cool but he never liked to have opening acts.  That just wasn't his thing.  So we're in Spain and I was leading a band with Donald Harrison and--
Speaker 2: And when is this now?
Speaker 1: This is, this has to be maybe '87 [1987], '88 [1988], somewhere around that time.  So I'm leading a band with Donald Harrison.  (Laughter) We, the promoter, young guys, take the young guys and have them open up for Miles Davis, that was his intent but he didn't know, he, I guess he forgot or didn't know that Miles didn't like opening bands, he thought Miles would like us.  We started playing the first tune, we barely got into the second tune and the promoter was like (gesture).  I'm like what are you talking about?  We just started.  He said, "No you, no you, you got, you gotta cut it."  So we cut the show.  Miles comes on and plays, right.  (Laughter) He was always a character, man.  So he didn't see me and I didn't get a chance to speak to him, you know.  So we go from that city to another city, we're all on the same plane, right.  We get off the plane, I walk up to Miles at baggage claim he goes, "Man, what you doing here?"  (Laughter) I said, "I opened up for you last night."  "No shit, that was you?"  (Laughter) I'm like, "Yes" (laughter).  He was a funny dude, man.  A funny guy.
Story_ID: 661244
Speaker 1: Where do you go from Art Blakey?
Speaker 2: Well, after Art Blakey I was in the band with Donald Harrison.  And George Wein signed Donald Harrison and myself to a recording contract.  Now we, we, we made two records for George and the first record we actually put out while we were still in Art Blakey's band.  And we were a little nervous about jumping up and trying to have our own band 'cause we saw that it's, it's a rough deal, you know, it's--you have to be on your game and you, you can't just jump out there, you gotta have a lot of things set up, people have to know that you have product out, and, you know, all of those things.  So we were getting ready to release the second album with George when Columbia Records called and said that they wanted to sign us to a deal, and they did.  And when they signed us to a deal we got a lot more support and next thing you know we made the decision just to go out on our own.  And I had been in Art Blakey's band for four years and me and Donald had that band together for about three years.
Speaker 1: So now this is what, this is in the late '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: I was in Art Blakey's band from '82 [1982] to '86 [1986], and then me and Donald had our band from like '86 [1986] to '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: So at this point in the '80s [1980s] jazz is coming back?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no, jazz is like--yeah, oh, yeah, 'cause you gotta remember with Wynton's [Wynton Marsalis] success, you know, he, he was, he was the guy, you know, that kind of just shot, you know, into the stratosphere.
Speaker 1: And when, and about what time did Wynton blow up?
Speaker 2: Oh, he blew up like in the '80s [1980s], the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Early '80s [1980s], right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, like '80 [1980], '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Around that time.  So then, then there were a lot of companies trying to find some young talented jazz musicians. We just happened to go to the same label as Wynton on Columbia and it was great because Columbia had Wynton, Branford [Branford Marsalis], Donald Harrison, and me, then they had Harry Connick [Harry Connick, Jr.], so they had like a whole little New Orleans [Louisiana] contingent, you know, on the label, and then, and when it was, it worked out great for us.
Story_ID: 661245
Speaker 1: In the early years you were also getting accolades for your work, I mean, there--you, early on, with Art Blakey you got your first Grammy [Grammy Award], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or was it with Art Blakey?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, there was a, I forgot the name of the album ['New York Scene].  It was a, it was a live album that we had recorded on the West Coast [sic.].
Speaker 1: Right.  And then, then you, you just started making album after album?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, you know, I--we had this thing of just trying to be prolific, you know, because one of the things we saw in the business is that the shelf life in terms of marketing a record is my, maybe two months, you know.  And in order to keep your name out there we just thought it was, we thought of it as a--I thought of it as a strategic move to constantly have product out there so people could talk about us, you know.  Because back then we didn't have enough money to afford a publicist so we were trying to do it all ourselves.  Plus, you know, we were learning a lot.  You know, we just had a lot to say musically, you know.  It seemed like we would do an album, soon as we do that album, that album would spark some idea for something else and it just seemed to constantly move like that back then.
Speaker 1: How would you describe the, the sound, what, what you were creating because you, you mentioned earlier your teachers and your mentors were all forward thinking people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now you're not making the music that other folks have made, it's different. So at, in, in all that composition that you learned back in high school [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana] and even earlier, is now coming to play in--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) these albums you're making--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --every year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  No, I, no, it, it was a conscious thing.  It, you know, we looked, Don, Donald [Donald Harrison] and myself we looked at our band as kind of like a, like a little lab project.  You know, we figured--'cause I, you know, we constantly talked about how we should use this as a platform to try things, to see what works, see what doesn't work.  So we were constantly trying to come up with ideas of how to displace rhythm, how to use this rhythm, what about harmony, how do we shape the tune, the structures of the tune, what are we gonna do with this, well, you know, what this thing is actually, man, we're gonna take that rhythm and play it backwards and see what--we were doing stuff like that all the time back then and just trying to learn, just trying to see what we could come up with.  And, you know, we didn't wanna just play just straight ahead, we didn't, didn't wanna do that.
Speaker 1: And where are you playing?  Is this in a studio, are you recording as you're--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --creating?
Speaker 2: No, we wish we, I wish we were recording.  We'd, I mean, you know, back then we had the little Walkmans and stuff that we--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --would do but we didn't have the resources that like Miles [Miles Davis] and all of those dudes to have recording equipment on the road. But we, we'd go out on the road and basically just hash out a lot of these ideas. And then we'd go in the studio and, you know, we'd book some time and we'd book five days and we'd just try to record five days.  And the thing about back then, man, we'd lock the studio out for five days and, you know, for us that was a big luxury 'cause a lot of jazz records were being made in two days, just straight recording, there were no, hardly no breaks, you know.
Speaker 1: Because it was expensive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause it was expensive.  But, but the deal that we had at Columbia [Columbia Records], George, Dr. George Butler, he, he, he gave us a lot of room where we could sit down and kind of figure things out 'cause sometimes we'd record some stuff and we'd listen back and say okay, well, that's not really hitting it, let's go back and try something else and it was a great time, it was a great learning experience for me.
Speaker 1: Is--I'm thinking of your high school teacher who said you have five minutes or a half hour.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: How were you developing these ideas?  I mean, this, you're starting from scratch.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: One album is different from the next?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is that creative process like?
Speaker 2: Well, you gotta remember there was just, there was a sound out there back then with all of us being on the same--with Smitty Smith [Marvin "Smitty" Smith], Jeff Watts [Jeff "Tain" Watts], Branford [Branford Marsalis], Wynton [Wynton Marsalis], Kenny Kirkland, Mulgrew Miller, Lonnie Plaxico, the list was endless with the number of musicians that we were all in the same age range.  Kenny Garrett, you know, Wallace Roney, you know, we were all trying to learn and we would all hear each other's performances.  And you find inspiration some, from something somebody was doing and it's not that you wanted to do what they did but it would (snaps fingers) spark an idea in your brain. Like, well, man, if he did that what about if I went and did this?  And it, and it came from a lot of different places, you know.  It came from the music that we were listening to, sometimes frankly it would come from stuff that the guys would play, you know.  I had a r- I did a gig one time with my band with Kenny Barron, and Kenny Barron came to my apartment and had a rehearsal and I did record that rehearsal, right.  And in the rehearsal he played a phrase, just playing a solo that became a tune that I made into a full composition later on.  I don't, I don't know if I ever told him that, I think I have to, gotta call him up and tell him that, you know.  So, so and that's the thing that, about composition that I think it's important to have as a skill because you never know where the ideas are gonna come.  They can come from anything, you know.  The--the issue is how do you do, develop it and what do you do with it.
Story_ID: 661246
Speaker 1: And what kinds of messages were you--were you thinking of, consciously, messages that you were trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --share?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were some of those messages?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was a little bit of a militant back then, (laughter) man.  The album 'Black Pearl,' you know, I was, I was, that was basically for my son [Terence Blanchard, Jr.], you know, and I was trying to look at the word black as being something more positive, you know.  After, you know, growing up in New Orleans [Louisiana] and hearing Malcolm X talk, you know, I got tired of the connotations of the word.  So there was another tune that was written called "Worth the Pain," you know, talking about the suffering people go through, you know, and the resolution you can find through faith and all of that type of stuff.  Oh, I can't even remember all of the, all of the tunes but the, we were always trying to be socially conscious.
Speaker 1: And so was this a conversation that you would have?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You, you all would talk about these messages and then go and make the music?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, yeah, we would talk about 'em, just in, just in general conversation.  We never, we didn't necessarily talk about it in terms of this tune this, 'cause the titles are kind of self-explanatory for us once we all knew where we were coming from.  You know, but we were always having political discussions, social discussions, you know, all the time, you know.  It's just, and I'm the same, I'm still the same way now.  You know, with the band that I have I, I love those guys 'cause they're socially conscious, you know, and to me that's, that's a big, big thing because when, in order for you to create your art that's meaningful it has to be of the community, it has to be of your world.  You know, and I look at what we do as kind of like being a documentarian so to speak.  You know, we're sitting down documenting our impressions, you know, of what's going on in the world.  When you look at Stravinsky [Igor Stravinsky] and you look at all of his music, that music is based on Hungarian folk songs because that's where he was in his life and that, that, that, those folk songs had meaning for him.  Well, the same thing occurs with me through the social justice system.  You know, I mean, even now I've been thinking about, you know, writing something for Ferguson [Missouri] and all of the things that have been happening.  It's just, it's just part of who I am.  And I, and, and a lot of it has to do with the stuff that I listen to.  You know, you listen to John Coltrane's composition "Alabama," I cried like a baby. I--I couldn't, I--it was uncontrollable because when you think about those little girls and the way he played it was so mournful you could hear his pain and you could hear all of the suffering from a large group of people through his instrument and that blew me away because I'm like wow, you can help heal people through this process of creating something so beautiful and powerful.  You know, so that's always been my mission, you know.  And it's frankly something I'm, I'm trying to release a little bit of, you know, because I, I also wanna create music that's fun to listen to but I've been in this mindset for so long, you know, sometimes when I do something just for fun I feel guilty, (laughter) you know.

Speaker 1: You mentioned your son [Terence Blanchard, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --at what point, now are you married and having children?
Speaker 2: I got married when I was twenty-three.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was very young.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: My son was born in 1988, you know.  What, what was funny about that, man, is the day my wife went into labor I was supposed to be playing in Baltimore [Maryland] (laughter) at the Left Bank Jazz Society.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they, the guys pull the car around up to the apartment, and I came out and I said, "Bro, I can't go," (laughter).  "I'm sorry, y'all go on without me."  And, you know, what was funny?  So I took my wife to the hospital, we had the baby.  I went back to Baltimore the next year (laughter) and those guys were like, "Hey, hey, hey."  They weren't like being like happy, they were like, "Baby pictures," (laughter).  "We wanna see him.  Where are--pull 'em out."  I'm like, "Oh, no, I got 'em, now here, here he is, you know, here he is, here's right there."  They wanted to make sure I was, oh, man, that was pretty funny.
Speaker 1: So married at twenty-three.  That's very young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're on the road all the time so what, what is life like being married, baby, travel?
Speaker 2: It was rough.  It was rough.  You know, it was, it was hard because I hated coming home seeing my son looking different every day, every time.  And I could go away for like a week, come back and he looked like a different kid, you know.  And that was really hard, you know, but at the other end of it, though, once he was born, man, I felt like I had to--you know, I always tell a joke 'cause I remember I had him one, one day by myself and I, he was sitting in the car seat and I had him on the table and I was feeding him and he was looking at me and just in my mind he just said, "Now, you know, I'm here, you need to go practice.  You see these diapers, you see all this stuff," and he's just looking right at me, you know, (laughter) and I'm like no, dude, I got it, I got your back, don't worry.  So in a weird way having kids made, made me work harder, you know, because I didn't want them to suffer, I didn't want them to have to, you know, go through anything silly because of me.  You know, so I just tried to stay on my game.

Speaker 1: Where were you living?
Speaker 2: I was living in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was living in Brooklyn in Fort Greene.  You know, and it was great.  Oh, yeah, it was great 'cause I--I don't know if you know this story but I, I met this woman from New Orleans [Louisiana] and she was a little older than me and her and her husband befriended me and my first wife, right, we became really close, we, we were at their house all the time, they were very successful.  You know, she was a real estate attorney and he works on Wall Street, he's a lawyer too.  Years later I'm divorced from my first wife, married to my second wife [Robin Burgess], we had lost contact with them, she calls me up and she comes on, she said, "We need to talk."  And I go, "Okay."  Come to find out she was my sister.  Yeah.  We didn't know.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: We didn't know.  Yeah, she, she was talking to her--
Speaker 1: Whose child was she?
Speaker 2: My dad's [Joseph Blanchard].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was talking to, I think it was her sister and she was talking about how what she thought was her father and why she was treating him a certain way.  And then her sister goes, "Well, girl, you know, that's not your daddy."  She said, "That man that sing the opera that's your, that's your, that's your daddy," and said, "that little boy that play the trumpet, that's your little brother."  And everybody knew.  Well, my dad didn't know, he didn't know, but they all knew and never told anybody.  So we're grown, and we kept, we, we, and, and every now and then we talk about this how freaky it is that we wound up moving in the same neighborhood, becoming friends, you know, the whole nine, it was just, it's very bizarre.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Right.  So that's when earlier, when you asked me, you said, "You grew up an only child?" I go, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ish.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 661249
Speaker 1: The '80s [1980s] were filled with making a lot of music, a lot of touring, and then you were invited to perform on 'Mo' Better Blues'?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And in 1990, you're, you're still in your twenties. You're age twenty-eight.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did that come to be this, to, to be in Spike Lee's film?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think it was Harold Vick who was a saxophone player I think he was putting together the musicians for that. And so it was that which coincided with something else at the same time.  Lenny White was producing this singer, I can't, I can't remember the name of the singing group, but he was producing a singing group and he wanted a trumpet solo and he, he told me, he said, "Man, I wanted to get Miles [Miles Davis] but we can't afford Miles."  He said, "You mind playing on it?"  I said, "Cool."  And I put in the harmony and I played the solo.  And, and, you know, they loved it.  The song wound up being in the movie, in 'School Daze' or one of those, is, yeah, I think it was 'School Daze.'  And here I am on a session, Spike remembered me because I walked into the first session, I was proud, you gotta remember this is back when the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers] was hot so I had on my purple and gold Converse, I had my T shirt, I had my hat, I was sitting there like what, what's up?  I didn't know that he was a big basketball fan, I did not, 'cause I had never met him, you know.  So I'm standing there, he walks by, he looks me up and down and he goes, "Lakers fan, huh?"  I go, "Yeah, man, what's up."  (Laughter) So, you know, he remembered me from that and then--
Speaker 1: From 'School Daze'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then, you know, I, it was just by sheer luck we were doing 'Mo' Better Blues'--well, then he called me back to, we did 'School Daze.'  I can't remember which one came first, 'School Daze,' 'Do the Right Thing,' but we did--
Speaker 1: 'Do the Right Thing' was the first one.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So we did 'Do the Right Thing,' that's when that happened on--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'Do the Right Thing.'  And then I did 'School Daze.'  Then he called me back to do 'Mo' Better Blues' and Branford [Branford Marsalis] was gonna do the music for the band and I was gonna play in the band, I was gonna coach Denzel [Denzel Washington].  So we had to record the music and when recording the music, I'm sitting at the piano during a break playing something that I'm, that I was writing at the time, another socially conscious song it's called "Sing Soweto," it's written for the kids that were killed there. Spike comes by and he hears it and he goes, "Man, what is that?"  And then he asked me if he could use and I said, "Sure."  So he, we recorded it just as a solo trumpet thing and when he got it back to the editing room he put it up on the machine and he was looking at it and it just felt dry to him, he kept, he kept trying to add things to the scene and, and then he asked me he said, "Man, you think you can write a string arrangement for it?"  And I said, "Sure."  Never had done one before, you know.  Okay, that's one of them things, but, he called me, he asked me to do it, I said, "Sure." Went home, "Hey, Roger [Roger Dickerson]," (laughter), "man, what do I do," you know.  And then I wrote the arrangement, came in the next day, not the next day, a few days later with my arrangement and I hand it to Spike's dad [Bill Lee] 'cause he was conducting and he was, you know, and Spike's dad said, "No, no, no, no, you wrote it, you conduct it."  I went, "Huh?"  Okay.  Immediately my mind goes back to NOCCA [New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, New Orleans, Louisiana]. Okay, (conducting) one, two, three, four, (laughter) and I never studied conducting.  So I got, I stood in front of the choir, I mean, the choir, stood in front of the orchestra and we did the scene.  And Spike afterwards, man, Spike is a, he's, he's an interesting guy 'cause he's always testing you and never telling you, never.  You know, so he comes up to me and he goes, "Man, he says you have a future in the film business."  And I went, "Thank you." You know, but I--okay, cool.  And next thing you know he called me to do 'Jungle Fever' and then we just kind of--
Speaker 1: So this, that's in 1991, you're just, you're still in your twenties, you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --twenty-nine years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this began a very long--
Speaker 2: Relationship.
Speaker 1: --relationship.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So Spike Lee is a man of few words.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I know, I know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But when he speaks--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) it's intense.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and now you are a musician who's been playing all over the world, composing with your band and this is a different role now.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, definitely.
Speaker 1: This is musical director.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 661250
Speaker 1: For me it's really interesting because you constantly wanna tell kids, "Listen, man, if I'm doing this, you can do this."  I--and you wish you could have a time machine to take kids back to when you started and say, "Look I'm just like--the way you're sitting in this classroom, I sat in a classroom just like this, no different, I'm no different than you."
Speaker 2: So I, I wanna go to your relationship with Spike Lee.  And, and the shift for you because going from musical direct- from artist, composing, making your own music, performing all over the world, to then making scores for movies. It's a very different--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --skillset.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Can you describe what that experience was like for you, like the first time and--
Speaker 1: (Makes sound).
Speaker 2: --how it's grown?
Speaker 1: Well, the first time it was, it was, I was overwhelmed.  The first time--well, the first time doesn't really count.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because when I did 'Jungle Fever,' Spike--there was a, there was the, I don't know if you remember back then but there were a lot of piracy issues with films that were coming out before they were released in the theaters so Spike was a little nervous about giving me a video, giving a lot of people videos so I didn't have the video to work from when we did 'Jungle Fever.'  But when we did 'Malcolm X,' I did and--
Speaker 2: And 'Malcolm X' is the very next year in, in--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --nineteen ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: And that to me is like my first film that I score.  And that process was daunting. 'Cause first of all, I felt like a fish out of water.  Actually, first of all it's 'Malcolm X' and everybody knew Spike was making the movie and everybody knew I was writing the music. So tapes were coming to my house, all kind of craziness was going on.  And, you know, we all lived in Brooklyn [New York], and walking the street was just like, "Man, you know, when Spike do the movie, man, he better have this 'cause, you know, Malcolm--." So just trying to get to the music was, was hard enough, you know, and then I was still playing shows.  So and I wasn't used to shifting my brain back and forth. So that, that part was really hard.  And it was, I was exhausted, you know, but just mentally.
Story_ID: 661251
Speaker 1: How physically did it work?  He'd finished filming everything and then you got the tape?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He finished it and then he gave me the tapes.  And I had to learn how to set up my computer, which I had never done before, to sync to the video and I was going through all of this stuff at one time so I was staying up long hours, long hours at night, not getting any sleep. But I, I--my thing was I knew Spike [Spike Lee] took a chance on me doing this because anybody could have scored this thing, he could have went to anybody and I didn't wanna let him down so I was--I, I did a lot of homework.  But, you know, the thing, it's like anything else, once you start to train yourself you start to get accustomed to it.  So, you know, I got accustomed to like when I'm out on the road throw that away, let it go, think about what you're doing on the road, think about what you're doing with this concert and soon as the concert's over, (snaps fingers) boom, my brain goes back to this, okay, now what do I have to do here?  And, and my life is still like that now, 'til this day.
Speaker 1: So what are you doing when you, when you are scoring a film--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --like what are you doing?  You're watching a scene and then--
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing, the first thing is to, is to try to get a feel from the director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, how he wants to tell the story 'cause there's a ton, there are tons of ways of doing it.  And Spike, we don't, we don't have those conversations much, we basically had 'em like once because his--his style is, is, is his thing, you know.  He likes very strong melodic content.  He loves orchestrally based music.  He doesn't like for the, the, the music to like hit certain things even though I do in some moments but he doesn't need a lot of that.
Speaker 1: When you say hit certain things, you mean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the scene, you know, like, you know, like if, if the scene cuts to something else and (snaps fingers) and sometimes the music like really hits the cut, that's not really his thing.  You know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he doesn't, he doesn't, he's okay, with that not happening, you know.  So once we had those conversations then the next part of it is for me to find some melodic content for him. And that would be the hardest part of my job with Spike, 'cause Spike loves melody.  You know, so I would send him all of these melodies and then he would pick one and when he would pick one, then from there I'd go back and I'd start to say, okay, well, let me deal with the scenes and I'll start to organize myself, get a, get a list of all of the scenes and start, you know, I was kind of anal in that regard.  I get a list of the scenes and then I'd start to plot out what theme was in what scene, how many times I've had- we're gonna hear this theme in the movie, how many times we're gonna hear this.  And I'd think about how to develop those themes even though they don't play back to back, you know, based on what the film was like.  I had to do a lot of prep work 'cause, you know, I knew 'Malcolm X' was going to be big, you know, and I didn't want nobody to sit down and talk about, "Well, who is the dude who wrote the music?"  (Laughter) You know, because everybody working on that set was doing a 150 percent.  'Cause I'm in one scene, you know, and I was on set a lot and I saw those guys working. So when it came time for me to work I, I was busting my tail trying to get it together.
Speaker 1: And so you wrote all of the music for the film?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then did you create the band to then record or orchestra to--
Speaker 2: Well, well, generally the way it works, we hire a contractor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the contractor will go out and, and put together an orchestra.  Now what, what tends to happens now because I have experience, there are certain players, you know, that you like. Like for example in, in, in 'Malcolm X' we were just lucky, this woman named Katie [Katie Dennis], she was the French horn player so when you hear the French horn in the beginning of the film it's a woman playing that, she's awesome.  So when she did that I'm like, you know, I knew if I was gonna write another film, Sanford Allen who was my contractor here, he's one of the first, he's the first African American to be hired as a member of the New York Philharmonic. Yeah, so, and he's amazing musician.  Sanford, when he knew that there were certain players that I would like he'd take mental notes, you know, like if I said, "Oh, man, so and so, man, he sounded great," boom, those people were always there. Yeah, 'cause he knew that I liked their playing style.  So once he did that then the rest of it is just us booking the studio, getting the time, trying to be organized, and get--finding the right engineer to make sure things sound great, you know, and having Spike there to make changes if he wants to, to anything in the scene.
Story_ID: 661252
Speaker 1: Was it, what did it feel like, you know, that, that first time, so with 'Malcolm X' and--
Speaker 2: (Makes sound).
Speaker 1: --doing something you had not done before, at least in that way?
Speaker 2: There was so much tension and energy because Spike [Spike Lee] was killing himself making that movie.  There were death threats, people forget that.  They look at the movie now and just think, oh. No.  When I did my scene, the day that I did my scene, this is how I knew things were different because I had been on 'Mo' Better Blues' the scene, I've been there.  When we were on the set for 'Malcolm X,' we took a break and they had FOI doing security.
Speaker 1: Fruit of Islam?
Speaker 2: Yes, Fruit of Islam.  And those brothers walked us to the restaurant which was right up the street.  And he said, and I remember he told me he says, "Listen, when you finish, just call, tell So and So and they'll come, and we'll come and get you."  I said, "Man, no, I can walk back."  He was emphatic.  He said, "Don't you walk anywhere."
Speaker 1: This is the guy from Fruit of Islam?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He said, "Don't you walk anywhere." 'Cause I had my, I was still in my tux there, 'cause I was in a, you know, I was in my costume, you know.  He said, "Don't you walk anywhere.  You tell them and I'll come back and get you."  So that's the type of energy that was on set.  That started to carry over into what we were doing, you know.  And it died down because people didn't know where to go, you know, for us, so we didn't, we weren't worried about that so much but the tension of making the movie and making sure that the movie was right and all, that stuff was weighing on Spike, you know, and it weighed on me because of it.  And, and, and I remember Robert De Niro showed up, you know, Marvin Worth showed up, you know, all these people would just drop by.  And this is, this is basically my first film I'm scoring and I'm out there nervous trying to make sure that all the notes are right and everything, I'm waving my hands.  And Sanford [Sanford Allen] had my back 'cause Sanford would say, "Hey, man, maybe we should phrase this thing like this." So I had a lot of people who were helping me make sure that things were, were cool.  But when that thing was done, oh, my god, it was like whew, and, you know, we were very proud of what we did, you know, for Malcolm [Malcolm X] 'cause I thought Spike did an amazing job with--with that film.  I thought Denzel [Denzel Washington] was incredible.  Angela Bassett, everybody, you know, the actors were just off the chain.  And it was funny 'cause Wynn Thomas, the guy who does the sets, you know, Wynn--I'll never forget it, the day that I was shooting, I, I saw Wynn, man, and I said, "Man," I said, "you," I said, "you guys are busting your ass off."  I said, "Man, this looks great."  I'm saying, "I'm a little nervous about what I gotta do."  He said, "Man," and he said, "listen, we all wanna do what's right but for order--in order for us to do what's right, just do your job."  He said, "Just do your job.  Don't try to do anything more than that, just do your job."  And he calmed me down 'cause it was, it was welling up in me because I saw the work that Denzel was putting in, you know, I saw how, 'cause he was a different dude from when we did 'Mo' Better Blues,' you know, he was focused, man, when we did 'Malcolm X.'  You know, I saw him in the trailer, I'm like, "Hey, D, what's up?"  And he's like, "Hey, man, what's happening?"  He was cordial, he was nice but, but he was, he was centered and he was focused on what he was doing.
Story_ID: 661253
Speaker 1: Now Spike Lee is legendary for starting people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and now you're one of them--and, and sticking with them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is a risk in and of itself.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But you worked with him on how many films?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  It's about twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, so over the course of this long relationship--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how has your relationship evolved?
Speaker 2: He's--he's become--trusting is not the word.  I think he's become more comfortable, you know. Because at the beginning, like I tell you, we started out with 'Malcolm X' so we were having issues, you know, sometimes with the way things were recorded, you know, we were all young and we're all trying to figure this stuff out, you know.  So--and he was, and he's, we could tell, he's, he's a very focused dude, a very driven guy, so he was there on top of all of it.  Now my responsibility as a composer I felt like I needed to take some of that weight off of his shoulders but he had to see that for himself.  You know, so with--and it only happens over the course of time.  So, you know, with each film I just try to make sure that there were nothing, that no balls were gonna be dropped.  So it got to the point, man, (laughter) and I think we were doing one film in London [England]. And Spike used to be at everything, every day he'd be there on time.  We, we did something in London, I forgot which film, I think it was '25th Hour,' we started mixing the music, I come in to the studio, Spike's not there, I'm like, where is Spike?  Spike ain't been there all day and all of a sudden Spikes comes in, he was at the game, man, 'cause Ronaldo [Cristiano Ronaldo] was in town playing, you know, Manchester United [Manchester United Football Club] or something, man.  He come back with all of this soccer jerseys and, (laughter) he was out chilling, you know, and I'm like good, man, good, good.  I'm glad you--and to me that was a compliment, you know, because he felt comfortable enough, he knew that we were handling it and everything was gonna be fine.
Story_ID: 661254
Speaker 1: Now as a result of, you know, the, the--so many eyes on 'Malcolm X,' doors open for you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for other films?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me some of those projects?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, the--man, I can't even remember 'em all but the thing that happened that was interesting after 'Malcolm X' hit, agents started calling me, so I got an agent.  And then when I got my first agent, Richard Kraft [Kraft-Benjamin Agency], I'll never forget it, I got eleven scripts sent to me.  Eleven.  And some of 'em were things I, I couldn't do, you know, I just wouldn't do because of who I am.  And then other ones I just didn't get, (laughter) you know.  But then things started to fall into place.  I started working with Kasi Lemmons.  I started working with a lot of other people as well.
Speaker 1: And what film?
Speaker 2: Kasi Lemmons, I think the first thing we did was 'Eve's Bayou.'
Speaker 1: That's a beautiful film.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then I started working with Michael Cristofer, we did 'Gia' and then 'Original Sin.'  What's her name?  Oh, man, I'm looking right at her face.  She's gonna kill me for not remembering her name but we did--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'Love and Basketball' together.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, Gina. Gina Prince (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gina, Gina Prince-Bythewood, yeah.  Even worked with Peter Bogdanovich on a small thing one time.  Yeah, so I started working with a lot of different people.  Man, it was, and it was really amazing, you know.
Speaker 1: So this is now the '90s [1990s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when, when, I mean, you've got, I'm looking, you've got 'Clockers' with Spike Lee.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, even before, so in, in '94 [1994] 'Sugar Hill.'
Speaker 2: Oh, right, Leon Ichaso was the director, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Trial by Jury,' 'Inkwell' ['The Inkwell']--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which was a big--
Speaker 2: 'Inkwell' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) movie.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Crooklyn'--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Spike Lee, 'Random Hearts,' that's Sydney--
Speaker 2: (Makes sound).
Speaker 1: --Sydney Pollack.
Speaker 2: Yeah, man, well, I didn't, I didn't write that, I played on that one.
Speaker 1: Oh, you, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, played on that one.
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Then 'Clockers.'  And in the midst of this you're making albums?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Touring.
Speaker 1: And touring?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is where you say you're compartmentalizing--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --on tour, you're on tour.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Well, when you're on stage.
Speaker 2: When I'm on stage--
Speaker 1: And then you--
Speaker 2: --it's like okay, there's nothing you can do about it right now so when you're on stage just stay there.
Story_ID: 661255
Speaker 1: In the same year, '97 [1997] that you did 'Eve's Bayou' is when you did '4 Little Girls'?
Speaker 2: (Exhales) Yeah, that was a tough one.
Speaker 1: And this is when Spike [Spike Lee] is now doing documentaries.
Speaker 2: Documentaries, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, this is a shift in his career as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was a very intense--
Speaker 2: Yeah, film (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) film and story and historically important story.  What was your process?
Speaker 2: Mainly to not get in the way.  You know, the same thing when we did, when we did 'Requiem' for Katrina ['When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts'].  Spike is a great documentarian.  He's great at it.  You know, he knows how to get all of the information and he puts it in a very concise form, you know, that makes so much sense.  So with all of those interviews and all of those important words, you know, and expressions on people's faces, I didn't want the music to take away from any of that, you know.  So my main thing was to think about how to carry this thing forward, 'cause like again, like I told you earlier, Spike loves melody.  Well, sometimes melody can be a little distracting.  You know, and Spike his mantra to me, man, it's been scientifically proven that the brain could do two things at one time. That was his thing.  So I just tried to enhance all of those.  So like if, if you watch the documentary stuff that I do with Spike it's different from the film stuff.  The film stuff, you know, the music can swell in certain spots, you know.  In a documentary, the, the, the music and swell may be like just for a visual thing for like a hot second and then it's back underneath, you know.  And the thing about that is, you don't want it to, to become a mundane drag so the music has to lay there but it also has to evolve.  You know, and, and it's a tedious thing to pay attention to because sometimes your inclination musically is to have the music break out but you have to say no, no, no, listen to what she's saying right there, what she said right there in that statement was really important to the overall story so back up and stay out of the way.
Speaker 1: So is, is it as if the, the, the speaker is almost like the lead singer in that sense of--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: --is, is, is that how you look at it when you're--
Speaker 2: Well, the speak- whoever is speaking is taking the lead in the entire thing.  I'm--I'm there to support them.  I'm--I'm there to help them get that story across.  And in that mov- in that documentary when that woman hold, held up that rock, that blew me away.  You know, I mean, just to, to still have it, you know.  And, and the thing, and the thing about that story to me is it's one of those cornerstones in our lives where you look at the people who were involved in it and they were still effected, grown people, and this happened how many years ago?  And it had a profound effect on their life.  And I thought, I thought Spike was brilliant in the way that he did it.
Story_ID: 661256
Speaker 1: And I have to just tell you this, that's why when Hurricane Katrina hit we were doing the music for 'Inside Man,' right. And normally Spike [Spike Lee] would fly me up to New York [New York] to have a spotting session, right.
Speaker 2: What's a spotting session?
Speaker 1: Where we sit down and go through the film and we spot where the music should go, right. We go--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --through the film scene by scene and we decide if it, if it needs music or not.  Well, Hurricane Katrina hit, me and my wife [Robin Burgess] drove to Atlanta [Georgia] with the kids, we realized we couldn't go home, so we sent our niece with one of the trucks to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], parked one car, parked the other car there, we had an apartment in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], 'cause that's when I was teaching at the Monk Institute [Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz], flew out to L.A., couldn't find, couldn't find my mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard] for two weeks, you know, finally found her, and then all of a sudden now I'm supposed to be working with Spike, right, in the midst of all of this craziness.  So Spike (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now what year is this now?
Speaker 1: What was that, 2005--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when, when the hurricane hit.  So all of a sudden Spike calls me up, he says, "Man, I know we're supposed to have a spotting session."  I said yeah.  He says, "We gotta do it."  He says, "I hate to do it."  He said, "You stay there, I'm coming to you."  He said, "We're gon- we're--I'm gonna come to you, you know. You stay with your family."  Spike flies into L.A. and he--he gets to the apartment complex, I buzz him in.  He walks into my apartment, he doesn't even say hi, he walks in and says, "I'm a do a documentary about those levees." He said, "People need to know what happened down there."  And I went, "Good.  You're the perfect person to do it."  I was, it was a very powerful moment.  That's why my respect for him went sky high, you know.  I mean, 'cause he's a conscious dude, man, he's--he's always thinking about how to better people's lives and what can he do to make people conscious about certain things, you know.
Story_ID: 661257
Speaker 1: I remember seeing you and your mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened to her home?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we were actually recording the music for 'Inside Man.'  I had my two older kids [Terence Blanchard, Jr. and Olivia Blanchard] with me too so I had all my kids with me, and I had found (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you have four children, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I found my mom, we got her an apartment that was right across the courtyard for us, our girls were little at the time so they could run over there and play with grandma and they loved it, and grandma's apartment was kind of empty, you know.  So we were at the studio and I was trying to give my mom a mental break 'cause it, my mom was doing something interesting.  They were having fellowship on the phone, you know, she was on the phone with some of her church members and they would, they would get together on the phone 'cause I walked in on her one time and they were just sitting on the phone like four or five of 'em, you know, having fellowship.  So she comes to the studio and she's in the booth, she's in the control room with Spike [Spike Lee], I'm out there with the orchestra doing a scene, I walk back in to listen to a playback and Spike goes, "We're gonna film your mom going in her house."  I went, "What?"  He said, "Yeah, we're gonna film your mom going in her house."  I said, "You okay with that mom?"  She goes, "Yeah."  And I went okay and I let it go.  But when we got back to the apartment, I said, "Mom, do, do you realize what that entails?"  I said, "There's gonna be a camera crew, there's gonna be a bunch of people around."  She goes, "Yeah, I know."  She said, "But people need to say what we're going through."  And I gotta tell you that was one of the hardest things other than my father [Joseph Blanchard] dying and me having to go and look at the body with my mom, that was one of the hardest things I had to do because I wasn't gonna be shocked.  So the night, but Spike doesn't know this, but, well, he knows it now, but the night before I went to the house, and when I went to the house it was crazy 'cause I'm driving in my neighborhood, there's no power, the whole neighborhood is black.  I hit the major corner up by the, by the highway and when I turn the corner there are Humvees [high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle] right there with military guys standing out on the corner and I thought they were gonna stop me but they didn't, so I just kept going.  I go all the way down to my mom's house, I had to drive up on the lawn and put the lights in the house and, and so I could get through the house and I was floored at what I saw.  Everything just totally messed up.  So the next morning I'm trying to get my mom prepared for this. And she was still holding out hope.  And the, the lake is over here, (gesture) my mom's house is here, (gesture) we were driving from here, (gesture) from the highway (gesture). You could see the water marks on the houses on this part of the, the thing (gesture), eleven feet high.  My mom is still saying, "Well, I hope my house didn't get flooded."  She's still saying that in the car, he, I don't know if he showed that part of it [in 'When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Parts'], I can't remember.
Speaker 1: You had, so you didn't tell her?
Speaker 2: I tried to.  You know, I was, I was, I was like, "Look you need to get prepared 'cause, you know, this is really bad."  And she goes, "No, I think, I'm gonna be fine."  And I'm like, wow.  You know, and, and I couldn't break it to her.  It was, it--I didn't want to, you know, but then so you saw her reaction when she got out, that was real.  That was really real (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I could tell.
Speaker 2: No, I know, it was, and you know what was the, the craziest part about it?  Spike didn't come in the house.  He stayed outside.  He couldn't do it.  He stayed outside.  It was hard for everybody, you know.  And I can't e- I can't explain to you, my mom had a china closet that was in the den, okay, it wound up in the hall, way in the back of the house, on the floor, and at first it looked like it was all intact.  And I said, "Well, well, this is not--we can get--." I went to grab it, it was like brittle. It just--everything, photos, the house looked like a spaceship because the, the ceiling had disintegrated and then all of the piping was just hanging down.  It was crazy.  Then I was worried about, 'cause some people told me they went in their homes and said the floor was moving, it wasn't the floor, it was snakes, you know, 'cause they had a lot of other stuff going on.  We found a deer leg in the yard, a deer leg, just the leg, in the yard across the street.  So it was, it was craziness, you know.  And, you know, Spike had a great sense about heartache and what people should see, you know.  And I'll never forget when he was cutting that together, I had to come up for a screening, and my mom's thing was in the second half of what we were watching, and we were taking a break from the first one, I was like, "Man," I said, "dude, this is powerful."  He goes, "Well," he said, "well, get ready," he said "'cause you're up next."  He said, "I'm, I'm just trying to prepare you."  He said 'cause it's hard for them to watch it, 'cause they knew me, you know, what I mean.  And it was hard to watch.
Story_ID: 661258
Speaker 1: It was, it was, 'til this day, man, it, it--I get pissed.  I get so pissed because, you know, it's something that didn't have to happen, and that's what pisses you off.  When you start to think about the hurricane [Hurricane Katrina] did not hit New Orleans [Louisiana], people forget that.  The hurricane went to the east of New Orleans, it was the back part of the hurricane that breached the levees, you know.  So that means that they were in badly--they, they needed a lot of repair, you know, and nobody was on their job.  And for all of those people to lose their homes like that, oh, my god.  I was, I was livid.  I was livid.  For them to lose their jobs, for Bush [President George Walker Bush] and, and Kathleen Blanco to be arguing over jurisdiction, you know, in terms of who is supposed to--I remember I ran into one dude, man, there are so many stories I could tell you, I, I run into, ran into one dude who told me he saw the Canadian Mounties [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] at the, at the border of Louisiana and they were turned away, they were turned away, they were right there ready to come in and help.  Another guy, I was at a jazz fest in Detroit [Michigan], I run into this guy, and he told me, he says, he's talking about the documentary ['When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Parts'], you know, and he said, "Man, I was in the [U.S.] Navy at the time."  No, he says, "I was in the [U.S.] Air Force," he said, "and we had one of those," what do you call the ships?  Like the destroyers.  He said, "We had one of those right out there in the Gulf [Gulf of Mexico], could have housed five thousand people and it--we--they didn't let us bring on anybody."  He said, "We were right there."  It was just like, there was just like, I can't under- I can't say nothing, there was just fuck up after fuck up after fuck up.  And it, and you sit there and you say these are people's lives, this is--you can't mess around.  Bush came down there and went to look at something and he put up the binoculars and he brought his head down and he was shaking his head, and the caps were on the binoculars, yes, that's how silly it was.  That's why I get angry when I start thinking about it.  We were in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], couldn't get our kids in school, right, and he was, he went, he went and did a press conference talking about how, you know, what we were doing for the kids.  Man, I was calling CNN.  I was, I was hitting redial 'cause I wanted somebody to--I was, I was gonna say, "No, that shit is not true.  It's not true.  We can't get kids--," people are talking about it's a liability.  This is in L.A.  Finally there's this one woman, she's, she knew who she wer- who we were, and she said, "Bring your kids here."  And it was a great school, and my kids had a great time, and they were, and those people were wonderful, you know.
Speaker 2: And there were many people who were welcomed by other communities.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But many lower middle class people--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --welcomed into communities where they had never, there were no black people, never had been any black people--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and it didn't work.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, think about this, think about this.  You take people and you don't even tell 'em where you're taking 'em. People may have families in certain parts of the country, it may be easier for them to go someplace else to stay with a family member, but you just herded them out of the city.  You could have brought 'em to any other place in Louisiana, another stadium, we have athletic departments all over the place, housed them there, and constantly just said, "Okay, where would you like to go?"  But there was that frantic thing, you know.  And even with that it wasn't, it wasn't done right and it was just--oh, man, there were so many things that--that was going on it made me become a bit of an activist, because you started to see where people, I--my, my thing that I kept saying back then was that don't take the job if you really don't wanna do it 'cause something like this could happen, you know, because I felt like a lot of people were taking public service jobs for what happens after you leave the public service job.  You know, 'cause that's the big thing, you hear people talk about that all the time.  They're making their little contacts with this law firm and that firm and the, and then by the time they leave they're all set up and it's like, no, dude, do the job, do the job. That--you're here for this, there are people who are depending on you.  You know, a friend of mine, his father died in the Superdome [Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana] because he couldn't get his medication for his di- he couldn't get insulin, he died.  You know, what I mean.  Another friend of my mom's [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard], this guy, he came home and it's what the--and I was worried about my mom with this, this guy stepped out of his car, saw his house, had a heart attack and died.  That's real, that, that, you know, this, that ain't a campaign slogan.  That's real people suffering, you know.  And when I saw the video of my man being warned about the hurricane before it hit, oh, my, god, again, I--I wanted to scream.  And, and it's one of those things, that's why you can relate to those people in Ferguson [Missouri] because when you see something happen and you scream and you had a legitimate beef and nobody responds, you sit there and you say to yourself, this is all bullshit, this whole thing about being in America, the land of the free and the brave. It's--no, man, don't give me that mess, I don't wanna hear that, you know, because when something really happens--and then a lot of people don't know this to, like after all of that went down, after the hurricane has passed us, the recovery was an issue because Haley Barbour was tight with Bush, Mississippi was up and running, we had a Democratic governor, we still struggling trying to get the funds and trying to figure out where--where are they?
Story_ID: 661259
Speaker 1: You get the real story, and you go, what?
Speaker 2: Now there was a voice that was screaming--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on behalf of the people, Ray Nagin.
Speaker 1: Right, (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And now?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, right.  Well, listen, that's one of the things I was trying not to talk about, you know, because in the midst of all of this, you know, I knew a lot of policemen, I know a lot of policemen, you know.  When he went to Dallas [Texas], during all that they sent him to Dallas because he wasn't making any great decisions about what was going on during the hurricane [Hurricane Katrina].  He actually asked, "Can we walk the people to Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?" The people that were at the Superdome [Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana] and at the convention center [Ernest N. Morial Convention Center; New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, New Orleans, Louisiana].  So the police and all of the other security people there, those, those, those special op [special operations] people that nobody wants to admit was there, right, they thought it best that he not be there, you know. And that was around the time when General Honore [Russel L. Honore] showed up and things started to--
Speaker 2: Turn around.
Speaker 1: --turn around.  But then for this dude to do what he did and to end up where he is now, it's a travesty.
Speaker 2: Which is just for the record, where is he now?
Speaker 1: Well, he's in prison now, you know, for, for I don't, I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Embezzlement, I believe.
Speaker 1: Embezzlement, yeah.  And, and, you know, the thing about it go- it goes to show you that--it's called public service, that's the term.  Public service not serving yourself, public service.  And it's, it's such a twisted thing now because these guys become, they become rock stars, you know, you see 'em at Essence Fest [Essence Music Festival], jockeying for a position to sit and be seen.  And it's like no, man, I'm not trying to be seen, I wanna see the acts, you know, what I mean, that's my thing.  So that, that, that, that event just pulled the scab off of, off of everything that was wrong with not only New Orleans [Louisiana] but the country and that's what people forget.  It wasn't New Orleans, it was the country. Because if you remember back then, the citizens were the people who were stepping up.
Speaker 2: The screen is gone, oh, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the citizens were the people that were--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Let me stop for a second.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, it was just, you know, when you--it was the citizens they were the ones that stood up because if you remember what happened in New Orleans, people were coming together to help each other.  I li- when we drove to Atlanta [Georgia], I, like I said I gave my niece the truck to drive to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] but I, I wanted the truck to be okay, so I took it to Goodyear [Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company] and I had 'em check the brakes and check the oil and all of that stuff 'cause she was driving, she was a young girl, she was driving it by herself, I didn't want anything to happen.  So on the television was CNN, the CNN coverage, remember they were running it 24/7, right.  And the guys were just milling around doing their thing, I'm sitting there waiting, nobody is paying attention to me (unclear).  The guy hands me the bill and, and I give him my credit card and he says, "Well, I need some ID."  I give him my driver's license and he look at it and he goes, he said, "You're from New Orleans?"  I said, "Yeah."  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You're up, you're up here?"  I said, "Well, yeah, yeah, we had to come up here."  He says, "Hold on man, I'll be right back."  He came back and gave me a, a zero balance bill.  And he said, "We can't do much but this is what we're gonna do to make our contribution."  That's just everyday people and that was happening all over the country, right.  So it angers me when I see that happening and then you turn on the news and you listen to people talk about what people are feeling around the country. I'm like please, don't give me that, that's not true, it's not true, it's not true.  Because in time of need we don't give a shit about Democrat, Republican or any of that stuff. People didn't care, they didn't care, they were helping people, they was extending a helping hand for just a fellow American, period, or just a human being, you know, and that's what people forget, man, so.
Story_ID: 661260
Speaker 1: And you are--this is happening in your hometown?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your mom [Wilhelmina Ray Blanchard]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --you know, your life. Spike [Spike Lee] is making this film ['When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts']--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you have to make music to a documentary. So as you describe there's a certain, a different type of restraint--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that you have to apply?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How do you do that seeing the emotion that, that you were experiencing?
Speaker 2: You know, there, there are films that I've worked on that were technically hard, you know, just because of the nature of the storyline or whatever.  That was the most emotionally draining thing I had ever had to do and I'm gonna tell you why, because when I started writing it I had moved back to New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  So here it is I'm writing this music and like when I did '4 Little Girls,' those scenes would get to me at times.  And when those scenes would get to me, I'd take a break and I'd, I'd go hang out with my kids, go grab lunch or do whatever, I'd just get away from it for a second.  I couldn't do that with this because soon as I took a break, I stepped outside, no traffic lights, some places still don't have power, the military is still driving around the neighborhood, you know, what I mean? There was no way of getting away from it and it was rough, it was really rough because seeing dead bodies in water in streets that I frequented is an unbelievable thing you don't want anybody to ever experience. Because you don't believe what you're seeing.  You can't believe it.  It's like wait a minute, that's, that's a few blocks from here, what are you talking about?  You know, and to think that people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is days after [Hurricane Katrina].
Speaker 2: Days after.  And to think that people had suffered like that.  And the--I had friends on the police force [New Orleans Police Department] was telling me, he says, "Listen," he said, "man, there's a lot of violence going around," he said, "because we ain't average citizen. When a shot is fired we gotta go to where the shots are fired," and that was happening every night.  They don't wanna talk about that, but that was happening every night.  So there was an unstability in the cit- it was crazy, it was a crazy existence.  You know, but at the same time I felt like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The music.
Speaker 2: Well, I felt like the music was the, the, the thing that helped tell the story so I wanted the music to be universal 'cause what Spike did was I thought was amazing, he covered New Orleans musically with a lot of things with, with--in the scene.  I didn't want the score to be that, I can't think of a word, homogenous, I guess.  I wanted the, the music to be universal.  I wanted it to touch people in Europe, America, Canada, all over the world.  So in order to do that, you know, I know Spike, I had to come up with a melody that was very poignant, very simple, and wouldn't get in the way, and, you know, we just kind of went from there.  And then there was a couple of things where we took some string things from another film that we had done, 'cause he wanted the strings to be (gesture) really big but we had a different type of budget.  You know, we basically did that, everybody did that for free because when, and I don't know if people know this but they gave Spike two hour, money, you know, for a two hour documentary and he wound up with a four hour documentary on a smaller budget but we all did it 'cause we knew how important it was.
Story_ID: 661261
Speaker 1: You described that that turned you in a way into an activist?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How does that activism show up in your craft?
Speaker 2: Well, it shows up when I'm teaching, it shows up when I'm working with students, it shows up when I'm trying to show them the importance of being honest about what it is they need to do and what it is they need to say, because like I said we're documenting, you know, the time that we're on this planet, our impressions of things, you know. So you have to be really honest about that.  And I'm very, I'm very hawkish about that with my students because, you know, we all learn from the things that have gone on before us and, you know, musicians, we tend to get influenced by a certain piece of music and then that music if we're not careful would just run through everything that we do and that's not us being conscious.  But see I always tell people that's just a stepping stone and once you learn your craft, then you have to become aware of the world.  And when you become aware of the world that, that emotional impact is gonna find its way and it's gonna direct you in a, in a way that I can't describe, you know, 'cause when you get that certain type of feeling, there's a certain type of emotion that comes over you, to me that starts to conjure up notes, a pace, a tempo, a rhythm, a harmony, and then it all starts to come together but you have to be open to that, you can't come to it and say oh, (snaps fingers) it's gonna be this. No, I, I never work that way.
Speaker 1: And where are you teaching?
Speaker 2: Teaching at the Henry Ma- Hen- I'm teaching at the Henry Mancini Institute of Jazz [sic. Henry Mancini Institute] which is housed at the University of Miami in Florida [Coral Gables, Florida].
