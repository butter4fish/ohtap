Speaker 1: Okay, and, now, tell me what do you know about your ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, I just know how many were in her family.  I don't know too much about my, my parents.  My mother's--she had, my mother--there were three aunts and two brothers.  How many is that?

Speaker 1: Did they grow up in slavery, in--I mean your grandparents?
Speaker 2: They probably were 'cause there were slaves at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about those days that they tell or--
Speaker 2: All I know that, the name "Dial" came from a senator of South Carolina [Nathaniel B. Dial, 1862 - 1940].  That's as much as I know.  That's where--so he must have owned slaves [sic], you know.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was a--that was something that must have taken place back in the mid-1800s, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes, I guess so.

Speaker 2: Okay, was he born in Laurens?
Speaker 1: Laurens, he was probably--now, (unclear) from Laurens.  I remember that, that much about where they lived.  They lived, must have lived there a long time because the street was named after them, "Dial."
Speaker 2: Okay, so the street they lived on was actually named "Dial."
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You say your father's ancestors were owned by a man named Dial, right, who became a governor [sic]?
Speaker 1: Dial [Senator Nathaniel B. Dial, 1862 - 1940].
Speaker 2: He became the governor [sic, senator] of South Carolina?

Speaker 2: Okay, some political, some politician in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 2: Where what?
Speaker 1: Where he was taught to be a brick mason?
Speaker 2: My father was a bricklayer.
Speaker 1: Yes, but where did he learn that skill?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I really don't know.  My father was a bricklayer for many years, I guess, before I was born maybe.  I don't know.  All I know that he was a bricklayer.  And as I told you, with this contractor.  T. C. Windham was a contractor.
Speaker 1: Can you spell "Windham" for us?
Speaker 2: Spell Windham?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Maynard, spell Windham for him, Windham.  It's Win--W-I-N-D-H-A-M.

Speaker 2: WILLIAM MAYNARD HEWLETT:  I thought it was "Y," [sic] but it might have been--
Speaker 1: T.C. Windham [Thomas C. Windham].
Speaker 2: And he was a millionaire, black contractor in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Yes, he was a millionaire.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he owned slaves [sic].  He was a black man who owned slaves.
Speaker 2: Well, that was after slavery, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How could he, you know, he didn't--I mean he owned slaves when slavery was going on?  And that was like fifty years before your parents got married.  So, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I guess so.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: So, I don't know, yeah.
Speaker 1: All I know, my father said he owned slaves.  That's how I know.  I don't know no more than that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So your parents were married in 1899, right?  That's what I read in the--
Speaker 1: My mother said she had four children, but she had two miscarriages before I was born.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that means that she must have--they celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary in 1949.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that means that she must have married in 1899, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am, right.  Okay, well, so your father moved to Birmingham to work with Windham?  Is that why--
Speaker 1: Yes, not to work with Windham at first, no.  My father had a meat market there in Birmingham.
Speaker 2: Oh, so he had a number of different occupations then, right.  So he had a meat market and he was a bricklayer.  Did he do anything else?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Did he do anything else?
Speaker 1: No, that's all I know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They had a meat market there, and they went to 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama].  That's the famous church that was bombed [1963], you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, and they were deacon and deaconess there in that church before they came to live with me here in Jamaica [New York].
Speaker 2: When did they come here?
Speaker 1: They came here in 1959.
Story_ID: 132759
Speaker 1: Can you tell us--now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Ma'am, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Early childhood memories, no.  I know I went to school there in Birmingham [Alabama] until I was, entered high school, and then I went to Spelman [College] there in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a part of two years.  And I had problems with my eyes.  And after that cleared up, I went to school there and finished the high school there in Birmingham, as I told you, Brooks Academy.
Speaker 1: Now, ma'am, what was the name of your grade school in Birmingham that you attended?
Speaker 2: Industrial [High School, later Parker High School, Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Industrial?
Speaker 2: You mean from first--I can't remember.  You mean before I went into high school?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't--all I know is I went, I was--I can't tell you the elementary school.  I started high school at Industrial High there in Birmingham.
Story_ID: 132760
Speaker 1: Can you think back to when you were a little kid, to when you were a little girl and tell me what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: Yes, could you reflect back to when you were a little girl, and give an idea of what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: All I can tell you that I loved to sing, and I sang in the--growing up, I sang in the, in the church choir.  I went to Sunday school at 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama], the same church I told you that was bombed [1963].  And I went to Sunday school.  That was one of the "must" that my mother [Mary Lou Young] and father [John Henry Dial] insisted on my sister [Marie Dial] and I attending Sunday school.  And I always tried to be (laughter)--I don't know.  I was secretary of the Sunday school in growing up.  I've always wanted to, I guess, be a secretary.  Even when I learned the fur industry, I worked for a man and became the secretary in his, on his job.  I don't--all I know that I was a, it was a must that we would--my sister and I would go to, go to Sunday school [phone ringing] and stay for church.  My life is not, is not so, so much that was going on, I guess, because my parents were very strict (chuckle).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, give us some idea.  Now, this is a historical interview, you know.  And so what we're trying to, you know, you're 102 years old now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the things that happened to you when you were a little girl are not happening to little girls and boys now, not the--some of the same things are.  But it looked a lot different in Birmingham than it does in New York [New York City, New York].  It smelled a lot different and probably is a lot different.  So, if you can tell us what the difference is, that would be instructive.
Speaker 2: The difference is that the children didn't run around on the streets as they do here in New York.  They were very strict.  You had to be home at a certain time.  When you went to school--well, my parents would tell me, when she would send me some place, "Don't stop for nobody. You come straight home."  I have a scar in my head now.  She had sent my sister and I on an errand.  This is in Birmingham.  And there were, you know, they were prejudiced.  And this Negro girl--of course, you know, they didn't call 'em Negroes, they called 'em black, was playing with these white people.  And we called them white trash.  So we didn't pick up the ball.  They started throwing rocks, and one of them hit me the back of my head.  And, of course, the doctors said had it been a little bit lower, it would have broken my neck.  Now, that's one of the incidents.  As I said before, when my mother sent us a place, we dare not stop.  Come straight home, and I remember one of the (chuckle), one of the things--I didn't know no better.  I was in school.  I believe I was in high school.  And one of the girls says, come on, we're going to the show.  I'd never been to the show in my life.  And I did not know that it was going to be dark when we came out.  And when we came out of the show, it was dark.  And my mother was working.  "Where have you been?"  I didn't know anything to say but I was kept in school.  My father was working in Texas at that time.  And when my father came home, my mother told him that.  And they called the teacher and she told them she did not keep me in school.  And I remember the only beating that I ever got from my father on my neck and back, is I said to them now, if that happened now, my parents would have been arrested because you are not allowed to beat your children.  But that's one of the incidents, and I never, I never--I'm very careful about how, what I say because I didn't wanna lie about anything.  That was--that taught me a lesson.  I try to be as truthful as I can.
Story_ID: 132761
Speaker 1: I sang in the choir [at 16th Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama] and (unclear) my mother [Mary Lou Young] would tell her neighbor, Mrs. Mason, coming home at night, look after Lilliette and Marie, my sister.  They didn't wanna be bothered with us.  So the next morning the lady said that they left us.  We didn't leave her.  They slowed up (unclear).  So we told mama that we didn't wanna and go and stay at, sing at church at night.  So we didn't unless my parents were with us.  I remember one time that we were, we were (unclear) with my parents now.  And we went, just before we got to where we lived there on Third Street there in Birmingham [Alabama], we ran into a tornado.  And I've never before nor since been in a tornado.  And my mother had chickens, and I guess all the chickens must have drowned because of the heavy rains.  And I remember that my--at that time, they were allowed to have pigs within the city limits.  So they raised pigs.  And when my, after I married and my older son--this [William Maynard Hewlett] is my younger son, was born, mother would get milk from somebody on the street.  And the lady didn't wanna sell her milk.  My mother bought a cow just to have milk for my son there because mother took my son and kept him for a while because I was pregnant with younger son.  And I, as I said, I went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Now, before we leave, before we get to Spelman, I just wanted to ask you about, what did your neighborhood look like?
Speaker 1: A neighborhood like an ordinary neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well, for--
Speaker 1: Ordinary houses, not brick houses--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, but I'm just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Not brick houses.  My father [John Henry Dial] built the only brick house on that street for us.  That's the only brick house on that street today.  How I know, my niece and her sister were there a few years ago and went through the street and saw the house.  My father built it.  It was the only house on the street that had a bathroom in the house 'cause in those days, you may have bathed in a, in a wash tub, but we had bath there.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did you all have sidewalks?  Did you have sidewalks in those days?
Speaker 1: You had a sidewalk, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't paved.
Speaker 2: What was it made out of?
Speaker 1: Clay, like any other sidewalk that's not finished.
Speaker 2: Well, we don't know about that in New York [New York City, New York] in--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --2004.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and how many cars were on the streets in those day?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: How many cars were on the streets?
Speaker 1: Not many.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell you how many.  My father had an old piece-a T Ford [Ford Model T].
Story_ID: 132762
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And my mother [Mary Lou Young] didn't get a cow and she--until after my son went to live with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because she had chickens, yes, and I can tell you a story.  My father [John Henry Dial] was away working.  My mother--this is in South--in Greenwood, South Carolina, 'cause that's where my father and mother moved after they got married.  My mother raised a turkey.  She's gonna have it dinner for my, when my father came in.  And I, she was so naive, when somebody stole the turkey, and she went to--I guess it was a fortune hunter--fortune teller rather.  And he told her the turkey [phone ringing] would be coming, flying over the fence (unclear), trying to get over the fence, 'cause he told her that to satisfy her.  I guess my parents must have--my mother must have believed in, what do you call it, fortune-telling?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.  Okay, well, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Did I like school?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I liked school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had to--when I was in Greenwood, I met one of the, my childhood friends, lived through the years until a few years ago, and she had moved to Cleveland [Ohio], Vivian Felton.  And we would play.  The houses were built high so we could play up under the house.  That's one thing I remember there in Greenwood.  My sister and I would--and Vivian, Vivian--what is, what is Vivian's first [maiden] name [Vivian Richardson]? I don't--anyway her name is Vivian Felton now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's dead, so it doesn't matter.
Story_ID: 132763
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers?
Speaker 2: I don't remember names.  The only name that sticks with me is the president of Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time I was there.  And she was Miss Tapley [Lucy Hale Tapley].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's in Spelman.
Speaker 1: So you started high school in Birmingham [Alabama]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I started high school.
Speaker 1: --at Industrial High School [later Parker High School, Birmingham, Alabama], you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And then you went away to school?
Speaker 2: And I went to Atlanta, and I was in Atlanta, at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], a part of two years when I had trouble with my eyes.
Speaker 1: So you went to Spelman to finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I didn't finish.  I went to Spelman for two years, a part of two years, but I said, I had problems with my eyes.  So I went back home, and after my eyes cleared up, I went to Brooks Academy [Birmingham, Alabama] there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Birmingham.
Speaker 1: Do you know what was wrong with your eyes?  What was wrong?
Speaker 2: I had bad tonsils, as I said, and it affected my--my tonsils were blue.
Story_ID: 132764
Speaker 1: Okay, ma'am, can you tell us about your high school activities?  What kinds of things did you do in high school [Industrial High School, later Parker High School, and Brooks Academy, Birmingham, Alabama] when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: Nothing (laughter), nothing.  I loved to sing.  I've lost my voice, but I still love to sing.
Speaker 1: Did you join any committees in high school or--
Speaker 2: Not in high school, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You weren't even the secretary of anything in high school?
Speaker 2: Not in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you--do you remember any of your teachers in high school or any of the--what were your favorite classes in high school?
Speaker 2: I had no favorite class.  It was just ordinary studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said, whenever I had a chance to sing, whenever I had a chance to sing, I would sing--did you find it?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No.
Speaker 2: No? Well, I don't know where it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, did you like Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]] when you were at Spelman?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I liked it.  I liked it, yes.  As I said, the--(unclear) experience for me being away from home--I'd never been away from home before.  And the little incident--don't put this in your tape though (laughter)--when, once when I was having my dinner, it was the greens that they cooked were full of sand.  And my mail was censored.  So I wrote my mother [Mary Lou Young] and told her about the sand being in, and, of course, and I couldn't eat it.  So the president of Tap--of Spelman [Lucy Hale Tapley] sent for me 'cause I told you before, the mail was censored and my hall mother gave the letter to the president.  So the president sent for me, and she talked, and, of course, I don't know.  Maybe that's an attitude of having (unclear) having another way of (unclear), that I was looking this way and that way.  I wasn't paying very much attention to her, in other words.  So she asked me the question, "Do your parents pay for your education here?"  And I said, yes, they do.  She said to me, it's a good thing that they do because if they didn't, you would be in the kitchen washing greens all day long.  I never shall forget that expression.  So shortly after that I had to go back home because of my eyes 'cause the hall mother took me to the eye doctor there in Atlanta.  And he told me to ask my mother to send for me and see an eye doctor.  And I was out of, out of school for a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: What year did I graduate?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: From high school?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: What year--I got married in--what is the year I got married from twenty--1922, I guess, 1921.
Story_ID: 132765
Speaker 1: All right.  So you got married the same year you graduated from high school [Industrial High School, later Parker High School, and Brooks Academy, Birmingham, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Was it anything special?  No.
Speaker 1: No, I said you got married right after high school?
Speaker 2: I got married before school closed (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before I graduated.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you meet your [first] husband [William Hewlett]?  You wanna tell us about that?
Speaker 2: I met his sister.  The family lived across the street from me there in Birmingham [Alabama].  The street at that time was called West Street.  And I told you before, it's called, it's now Third Street.  And his sister's name was Leona [ph.] Hewlett, the same as my son's [William Maynard Hewlett's] name [sic].  And he'd just come out--he was in World War I.  I met him.  And we eventually got married.  And then we lived in--where are your parents from, Montgomery [Alabama]?  Maynard?
Speaker 1: WILLIAM MAYNARD HEWLETT:  Huh?
Speaker 2: Where is your dad from, Montgomery?
Speaker 1: WILLIAM MAYNARD HEWLETT:  Montgomery.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then we moved to Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, why did you move to Cleveland?
Speaker 2: He had a sister living there.  I guess he was following his sister.  And I guess he was trying to lay brick too-- his father, their father was a bricklayer.  And then I went back to Birmingham, and that's where my, my older son was born in Birmingham, Alabama.  I was having a problem with my sister-in-law because we were living with her.  And she had me crying all the time.  She was a little on the mean side.  And after my son was born, I didn't wanna go back to Cleveland.  And my father [John Henry Dial] said to me, "You made your bed hard, now, you lay in it."  So I had to go back to Cleveland.  And eventually, we moved away from the sister and lived in a two, two-family house.  We lived upstairs.  The sister lived downstairs.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Then we made a move in a one-family house on 142nd Street there in Cleveland.  And my husband, worked in the post office there in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Now, that was a pretty good job for those days, right, from what I understand?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: If you can work in a post office.  Even today, it might be a good job for a lot of people.  So.
Speaker 2: I had a picture of the children's father in one of the Masonic souvenir journals till yesterday.  I don't know.  When she was cleaning up, I guess she moved it, of my son's father.
Speaker 1: So he was in the Masons [Freemasons].  He was a--

That's affiliation of the Masonic Order also and a past president of the American War Mothers.

Speaker 1: Yeah, so nothing happened in Cleveland [Ohio] that was very important?
Speaker 2: Nothing important, no.  I went to church.  I didn't work.
Speaker 1: What was the community like in Cleveland?  Did all black people live together or was it integrated?  Was everything okay?
Speaker 2: Was it integrated?  Well, it was integrated to an extent, but not fully integrated as it is now.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it now?  I mean I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: Now, he [son William Maynard Hewlett] could tell you.  He lived in Cleveland--(laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right.  I think some people in Cleveland would say it's not integrated yet, but (laughter), but what was it like when you lived there?
Speaker 2: What was my life like?
Speaker 1: No, what was Cleveland like for you when you lived there?
Speaker 2: For me?

Speaker 2: Than Birmingham, yes.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I had more freedom.  I was married then (laughter), had more freedom.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long did you live in Cleveland before you moved?
Speaker 2: How long did I live in Cleveland?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Until 1931.  I came to New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what happened that you came to New York?  Why did you come to New York?
Speaker 2: My husband and I were separated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he stayed in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: He worked there in Cleveland.  He worked in the post office there in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay, so why did you come to New York instead of going back to Birmingham?
Speaker 2: I showed you, well, they showed you a picture of my aunt.  I lived with her.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came to New York to live with your aunt, and--
Speaker 2: And then I moved away to my own apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did--okay, go ahead.  What were you gonna say?
Speaker 2: What is it?
Speaker 1: No, what were you going to say?  You started to say something, and I didn't wanna stop you, but--
Speaker 2: I don't think I understood your--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what did you do for a living in Cleveland--I mean in New York?
Speaker 2: In Cleveland?
Speaker 1: No, in New York, in New York?
Speaker 2: I learned--at first I started (unclear), I didn't know anything about working.  I didn't work.  But I tried to, like other black girls, I guess, I tried to work in a doctor's home there in the apartment complex that my aunt lived in.  It didn't work.  So I was looking for a job on 30th Street here in New York.  And a man came to me and says, "Are you looking for a job?"  And I said, yes.  So I went to his shop on 30th and started out working in the fur industry.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do when you started?
Speaker 2: I worked--I don't know whether you know what a dog fur looks like, but it's pretty tough hide, learning how to--
Speaker 1: Dog--
Speaker 2: --finish collars, and then you finished them for some manufacturer of coats.  And they put the collars on the coats.  And then I got into the union, and into a mink house.  And that's where I retired from, a mink house.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your union?

Speaker 1: Okay, so that's seven years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was it tough working on your own?  Did you--or did you like it?
Speaker 2: I had to learn to like to work (laughter).  It was tough going in the beginning.  And in those days, it wasn't a lot of money.  A little experience I had.  I--see, the fur industry is a seasonal job.  And I didn't have a job at this time.  And I went to a Catholic church at 160--about 165th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, it was a Catholic church with my neighbor to make a novena.  She talked me into it.  And I went to this church and made a novena.  I came back home.  My doorbell rang, a telegram, come to work at eight o'clock.  And that's how I got a regular job, and I'm not Catholic.  I'm Methodist.  I was born a Baptist, but I'm Methodist.  But, I don't kick the Catholic religion at all because I do believe that had something--that particular telegram had a lot to do with my starting out in the fur industry.  And I retired from the fur industry.

Speaker 2: The organizations that I belong to?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.

Speaker 2: That's more, getting more things for black people, getting the people, black people to, one of the things to tell them to take advantage of the opportunities that presented them.  But then the Council of Negro Women, you know, but the--Mrs. Bethun-Cookman [sic] organized a school down in Florida there.  And you have your office of [HM] Dorothy Height there, and I think she's retired now, in Washington [D.C.].  She was the president of the Council of Negro Women.  And that's all I--except my church.

Speaker 1: --Memorial--
Speaker 2: Brooks Memorial [United Methodist Church, Jamaica, New York]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, United Methodist Church.
Speaker 2: --I started going to Brooks Memorial in 1952.  I belonged to St. Marks [Church in-the-Bowery] in Manhattan [New York] before I moved out here.  And I--Brooks was a small church on Pinegrove [Street] at that time.  And I said, I don't want to belong to a small church.  I'm going--and I kept going, taking the bus and two subways to go to my church, St. Marks there in Manhattan.  The last time I went, the minister was pronouncing the benediction when I got there.  So I said, this is it.  So I joined Brooks, and Brooks moved into their new building where they are now.  They were on Pinegrove, but they're now on 109th Avenue and 143rd Street.  When I joined Brooks, as I said, I liked, always liked to be a secretary.  One of the members of--it was this Women's Society of Christian Service--and it was just Brooks.  It wasn't United, said to me, we need a secretary.  So I started out being the secretary of the Women's Society of Christian Service.  And then I became the past president of that organization, and then when the, they, the Methodist went into United Methodist, I was a vice president with--not the first president.  The first president of the United Methodist Women was another person.  But the vice president of, the vice president at that time and who became president, was Shirley Pettiford.  And I worked as her secretary, I mean her vice until they elected a new president.  And I really haven't done any work in the church since I became--since I came out of office as the vice president.  But I've attended the meetings, and whatever functions that they had until I became handicapped.
Speaker 1: Okay, how long have you been a member of Brooks?

Speaker 2: When I remarried, which--you're talking about Council?
Speaker 1: ROSEANNE RODNEY:  No, we're talking about Litt [Littleton Rose].
Speaker 2: Litt, he was a jazz musician.  That's all.

And he was working in a, what do you call it, a container there in Long Island City [New York], cans.  I don't know--I really don't know much about that job.  But I know he worked down there.  And then he came home one day, and he was sick.  He went to the doctor.  The doctor asked if he had been eating lye.  So he died from cancer.  And now [Ernest] Council was a patron of my chapter, Euclid Chapter Number 48.
Speaker 2: Chapter of what?
Speaker 1: Eastern Star.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Euclid Chapter Number 48, Order of the Eastern Star, Prince Hall affiliation [Freemasons].  You have to put all of that on there.  You put Chapter Number 48, Order of the Eastern Star, Prince Hall affiliation.
Speaker 2: We've got it.  As you say it, it's being recorded.  So we've got it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Now, after his wife died, he--I had joined that chapter.  He met me through one of my friends.  She wasn't a friend at that time, but he had asked them to introduce me to him.  And we finally got married.

Speaker 2: Volunteer work?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Really, it actually would be anything that they asked me to do, the nurses would ask me to do.  I fed patients.  I saw that they had ice water beside their beds, and you write letters.  And at one time I was down in, in--I don't know what called, a room, making--you see them--when the doctors get ready for the operation, you have those big pants on them with all the things that they to work with, wrapped.  I did that.  That's when--one of the rooms that they did work like that.  But on the ward, that's what I did was, I fed the patients, saw that they had water, maybe take them to, for a walk up and down the hall, whatever they asked me to do, that's what I would do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did a lot of volunteer work.  I see you have some awards from the City and some awards from the church and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I have five thousand hours of volunteer work in the veterans' hospital.  It's really over five thousand.  I was trying her to bring the pin to show you.  I don't (unclear), they--I don't know where she is, but I told her to get it so you could see it.
Speaker 1: Well, that's all right.  We can see afterwards.  But, now, tell me, now, you did all this volunteer work, what did you do for recreation?  What did you do for fun?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: What did I like to do?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: I joined the bowlers after I moved in over here [Jamaica, New York], from my house.  I sold my house and I came to this apartment.  And I joined the bowlers.  You see some of my trophies up there.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: I was an old bowler.  But I loved it.  It was something.  And another thing that I loved, I said before, I--at that time, I had a voice.  I loved to sing, but I don't have a voice now.
Speaker 1: Well, what--did you have a favorite song?
Speaker 2: Favorite song?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: "If I can help somebody as I pass through, my living will not be in vain."

Speaker 1: All right, ma'am, I heard that you were a swimmer, that you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --that you could, that you're a good swimmer?
Speaker 2: How long?  I wasn't a good swimmer (laughter).  I just did it for exercise.  How long?  I couldn't tell you whether--what are you talking about, in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 1: WILLIAM MAYNARD HEWLETT:  Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, here when I was in the Atlantic Ocean, a man stepped on me.  I don't think I ever got back in the, in the ocean after that.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a good story.  I mean it's not a good story, but it's a, (laughter) just an interesting story.
Speaker 2: ROSEANNE RODNEY: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Yes.  Tell me when you look back on everything that you've done, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: When you look back on your life and all of the things you've done, all the volunteer work and other things you've done, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't think so.  You know that I've been quoting, (unclear) this quotation, "Let me live in my, in my house by the side of the road and be a friend to man."  I somehow never--that has been in my mind for the last few days because one of the persons I was talking to said to me, at the center, (unclear) Center was in Springfield Gardens Center [Queens, New York].  The people whom I knew then are dead in that center.  But they said I was stuck up.  I can't see that.  I tried to be a friend to everybody that I met.  I was taught to treat people as I would them--treat me, treat them.  I have no regrets in my life.  I tried to do the best I can.  When I had my children with me, what I did for one, I did for both.  I never showed any difference in the children.  If I gave one, one thing, the other one got the same thing.  And I've tried to be that way all my life.  I have no regrets.  I'm just, some--I said I have no regrets, but I would have to go back and say I do have one.  I was young at the time, and I regret that my children's father [William Hewlett] and I could not have lived together until he died.  But it wasn't in the books, I guess.  That is the only regret that I have in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a secret--now, you're 102 right now.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You're 102 years old, and you know that already.
Speaker 2: I'm 102, yes.
Speaker 1: What is the secret of reaching 100?
Speaker 2: What's the difference in the years?
Speaker 1: No, what's the secret?  How do you do it?  How did you do it?  How did you live this long?
Speaker 2: It was God's work, not mine.  Oftentimes, I was despondent, I guess, and like any other person, I wished that I wasn't here.  But God has let me live here.  For what reason, I don't know.  I don't do nothing special.  I get up in the morning and have my bath and breakfast and sit in a chair all day long, but God is letting me do that

Speaker 1: Ma'am, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: What are my concerns about what?
Speaker 1: I said, shat are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: The black community today, oh, well, I (laughter), I say that, you know that I'm--I really don't know how to word what I'm saying because I think that we should try to do the thing that's gonna make the community better instead of going around doing things that are ugly.  And we bring things close to home when we find that this--I'm gonna quote something that happened in my complex here.  I don't know whether it was last year or this year when these two black boys held this (unclear) boy in building eight. Why weren't they in school if they were age, school age or why weren't they at work?  It--black people should learn to do things to better themselves instead of downgrading themselves.  That's the way I feel about it.  We should do something to make our community better.  And we should be proud of it.  Don't you think so?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, now did your--your parents [Mary Lou Young and John Henry Dial], you brought your parents here [Jamaica, New York] to live with you?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, my mother and father wanted to come to live with me.  And so they sold their beautiful home, the only one on that street like it--today, I'm talking about, and came to live with me.  And my father only lived here a year or so before he died in Queens General Hospital.  And my mother, the first of June in 1959, I think it was--my father died in '59 [1959], '57 [1957] rather.  Nineteen fifty-nine [1959], my mother went to church.  She was a deaconess--this is 19--it was 1959, 1966.  And she didn't come back home.  I took her to church that morning and went to my church which is Brooks [Memorial United Methodist Church, Jamaica, New York].  When I came out of church, somebody--my mother belonged to Bethany Baptist Church, here at 157th and 111th Avenue [Jamaica, New York].  And the people were running around trying to find me there at my church.  Your mother's sick.  And they had taken my mother down in the basement.  And she died there in the basement of Bethany Baptist Church.  So, naturally, I--we expected the minister to come to the house, but he was too busy.  The minister's name was [W. Leo] Hamilton.  He was too busy to go to the cemetery when we buried my mother.  A minister from my church went to the grave site with the family.  It was Miller, Reverend [C. Leonard] Miller went with us.

As I said before, my favorite song, "If I can help somebody as I pass along, then my living would not be in vain".  And I would like to live that life.  I would like to be able to, for them to say that she really did what she could, while she could.
