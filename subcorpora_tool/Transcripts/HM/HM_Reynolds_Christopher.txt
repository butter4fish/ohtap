Story_ID: 670882
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I want to, Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], have you start out by, I'd like to have you tell me what you know.  Give me your father's name and, and I know you have your father and your stepfather [Garfield Graham] but--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --give me your father's name, and what you know of his background, his--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and his, his year of birth, too.
Speaker 2: Sure.  We'll have to come back to the year of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Don't worry about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was seventy-nine--we can do the math--he was seventy-nine when he passed in 2007.  So, that makes it 1920, whatever that was, probably 1926 [sic. 1927], it sounds like, if my, my math is correct.  So, here, here's an interesting perspective.  His name is Lee Holmes Reynolds, Jr. [Lee Reynolds, Jr.].  The reason why I don't hold his year of birth in my head is, was he never really talked about his past as a child because it was a difficult one.  He was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but being, I think he was the third of three children, the youngest, the only boy.  And soon after his birth, my grandfather [Lee Reynolds, Sr.] died.  The, the family legend is he died of a, of an accident moving a piano, but it appears as if he had some sort of infection like pneumonia.  And so, imagine at that point in time, early '20s [1920s], Philadelphia, single mother, three kids.  So, my grandmother, Gussie Mae Reynolds [Gussie Reynolds], went to work as a maid in white families' houses in, I believe, Main Line Philadelphia.  And there, she learned and taught all of her children all the rules of deportment.  So, it was one of the rigorous things in my, my father's life where he always knew what fork to use, and what appropriate table manners, manners were because his mother taught him.  And the back story of that was when I ate at his table, you know, I could tell you some stories.  I lived in terror of, you know, a mistake I might make in my, in my culinary skills, but he, but he schooled me on it.  He started work when he was ten.  He, he was one of these African American men who knew how to do fifteen or twenty things. So in the course of his youth and career, he was a, a general, sort of sailor's mate.  He learned how to be a ship's electrician.  He was a ship's cook, so he toured on many cargo ships in Africa and in the Mediterranean.  He was a car salesman, a house electrician, and then he found his career in New York [New York] in law enforcement.  He was a motorcycle cop in New York, and then worked for the New York City Police Department for many years.  He worked as Jimmy Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], one of Jimmy Carter's employees in what was called the Law Enforcement Minority Manpower Project [National Urban League Law Enforcement Minority Manpower Project] from 1976 until 1980, where he would go into southern states and look at the credentials and qualifications for people who were, black people who were applying to be state troopers, but were kept out because of hair regulations, or other regulations designed to keep black applicants out.  And he would come up with consent decrees to allow African Americans to become members of law enforcement state troopers.  After that, he was a New York City marshal, and then he retired, and spent most of his life based out of New York City.  So, because my parents divorced when I was very young, my experience with him was mostly in, during these summers and holidays in New York.  So, I actually count myself sort of, you know, you asked where I grew up.  I would say two cities, Detroit [Michigan] and New York City.  Wonderful man, stylish, impeccably dressed, was probably one of the first brothers to have a Mercedes in New York City.  He loved Mercedes--ironic now that I work at Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation].  And incredibly driven, got his bachelor's degree in his forties because he decided he wanted to finally get a college degree, and could recite every '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] show tune and pop hit you could possibly name, so my love of jazz came from him.  And 'cause he could, you know, you, you name the song and he would start singing the lyric. Wonderful man.
Speaker 1: So, how could he get from, do you know the story of how he got to New York from Philadelphia where he grew up?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, no problem (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know the, yeah, no, I don't know that story.
Speaker 1: And, then, the other thing that I found interesting, how, what, do you know how he got on the police force because, you know, this would have been a time when people were integrating in the police force, right, in New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, so my understanding is he got on the police force in the mid to late 1950s.  At the time he was an electrician for the New York City transit system [New York City Transit Authority].  He worked on the subway electri- electrical systems.  And as I recall, you know, there was a push in the late '50s [1950s] to bring African Americans onto the force and he saw the test and he took it.  He was always a good test taker.  So, you know, by his, by his account, he did really well on the test, and that's how he got on the New York City police force.
Story_ID: 670883
Speaker 1: So, how old were you when your parents [Phyllis Todd Graham and Lee Reynolds, Jr.] divorced, do you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe a week, two weeks.
Speaker 1: Oh, so that's--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes--
Speaker 1: So, that's right.  So, their--let's talk about your siblings, and then I want to go to your mother but--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your siblings in age order?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, my oldest brother, and these are my, my biological siblings.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my oldest brother is Lee Holmes Reynolds III [Devamrita Swami], but we call him Pip.  He was, is mostly out of Philly and New York [New York].  By the time I moved to Detroit [Michigan] as a kid, he was out of the house.  He was one of the first African Americans to go to Holderness prep school [Holderness School, Plymouth, New Hampshire] in Philly.  I think it was in Philly, or it might have been--sorry, New Hampshire.  And my mom managed to get him tested into that through, I think, one of the early prep school affirmative action programs.  He went from there to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], graduated from Yale, and then wound up in the--and this is, by the way, 1971, 1972--the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.  And he's been with the Krishnas ever since.  He is now a Swami.  You can find his website on the web.  And he travels the world, basically part of the executive body of the International Society of Krishna Consciousness.  Brother lives in New Zealand. I see him from time to time.  His passport is about as full as mine is. Can translate Sanskrit, has written about ten books, interesting guy, a monk (laughter).  That's the oldest brother.
Speaker 1: And I saw that, you know, 'cause there are not many people that you know of as a monk, you know, but I saw that on your--okay.
Speaker 2: So, the next one, biological, is Dr. Lawrence Reynolds.  He went to, I believe it was Roeper prep school [The Roeper School Middle School and Upper School] in Detroit [sic. Birmingham, Michigan].  Again, my mom got him in, wound up at Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], went to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], came out as a pediatrician and, basically, practiced medicine for many years, emergency medicine, then pediatric medicine.  And then, his last stint was being the CEO of Mott clinic [Mott Children's Health Center] in Flint, Michigan.  And he was one of two doctors to have pulled the alarm cord on the lead poisoning of children in Flint.  So, he and the woman that practiced across the street from the clinic, they were the ones who basically alerted the health authorities.  He was able, through his clinic's patient base, to track the impact of lead poisoning, and he served on the governor's committee to remedy it.  He just recently retired and, you know, after, I think, a well- a well deserved retirement after a very impactful career, though I don't think he's going to stay retired for too long.  People like that don't really retire.  You know, my, my memories of Pip as a kid, the oldest, basically involved collard green eating contests 'cause he, he could eat some collard greens.  My memories of Larry growing up were roughhousing.  He loved to just throw me around the house when he was, when, when he was the older brother.  He tells me all the time, even now, he introduces me to his friends as, "I used to change his diapers."  He does that to me even now, so that's Pip and Larry.  Pat, Patricia Susan Reynolds Hill [Patricia Reynolds Hill], she is a physical therapist who, who actually teaches and runs the physical therapy assistant program at Washtenaw Community College in Ypsilanti, Michigan [sic. Ann Arbor, Michigan].  She is, she's my big sister.  You know, the memories I have of her is she used to have the task of walking me to primary school.  This is when she was maybe ten or eleven in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And I have the distinct memory that she would not hold my hand 'cause she was so disgusted that she had to walk this kid, this little boy to school.  She had other things she wanted to do and, instead of holding my hand, she would grab me by my neck, and basically pull me along by my neck to make sure, you know, I wouldn't walk out in the traffic to, you know.  I'd, I'd tease her about this now 'cause she always says, "I'm really sorry."  And I say, "No, no, it's--I'm, I'm here, I'm alive, you got me through," but she's always been a very loving and, and wonderful big sister.  And then, there's me, so that's on the, on the biological side.
Story_ID: 670884
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.
Speaker 2: Please.
Speaker 1: And can you give her name and what you know about her family background?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, her name is Phyllis Marie Todd Reynolds Graham [Phyllis Todd Graham], so her, her current name is Phyllis Graham.  She is eighty-nine years old.  She is what, what they used to call back then the second of Irish twins.  Her, her sister is just one year older than she is, and they--and pictures of her childhood in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], they would show pictures of her and her sister always together.  I think they even got married to, to their respective first husbands on the same day.  They, you know, dressed in the same clothes.  I mean, they were, they were, and remain that close.  Her family, my, my grandparents were born in Bermuda.  My grandmother [Amy Todd] was born in Bermuda, and then went to Ocala, Florida as a child where there was a large community of entrepreneurial black folk.  I think one of my great uncles actually started a bank.  And then, when she was in her late teens, she went back to Bermuda and along the way, met my grandfather [Austin Todd] who was from Bermuda.  And then, they immigrated to the U.S., I believe, in the early 1920s, and then had my uncle, my aunt, my mom, and then the little boy, the, my other uncle.
Story_ID: 670885
Speaker 1: She [Reynolds' mother, Phyllis Todd Graham] always excelled in school, wanted to be a doctor, but at that point in time, nobody was encouraging black women to be doctors.  So, she went for the next best thing, which was to be a nurse. So she studied at a nursing school in the Bronx [New York], Lincoln, I think it was Lincoln School of Nursing [sic. Lincoln School for Nurses], and it was a nursing school for black women.  And she became a registered nurse, New York City [New York, New York] public health nurse, where she made the rounds in Brooklyn [New York] checking on kids at home, back when they had a functioning health system.  She later herself went back to school in, in her forties, and got her bachelor's and her master's degree, was flirting with her Ph.D., but told me recently she's decided not to go for that.  And she wound up as a director of nursing at a nursing home.  I, I worked at that nursing home for a couple of years as a kid, and rehab nurse, where she spent most, most of her time dealing with young gunshot victims whose spines were severed by gunshot wounds in Detroit [Michigan].  That was a thing.  It was a medical phenomenon, and her rehab work focused on that.  And she actually got drawn into discussions about how to prevent gun violence because as a medical professional, she drew the connection between spinal cord injuries and violence caused by guns.  So, very, very smart woman, taught me all sorts of things about God and faith, and reading, and Scrabble, a mean Scrabble player, very disciplined thinker, a very gentle woman.
Speaker 2: So, you know, both of your parents were very smart then really in their, you know, and very at, you know, you can speak of a very aspirational, you know, family.  Now, I want to ask you, because of the time that your mother was a nurse, you know, that was a very laudable profession, you know, and especially, 'cause sometimes you couldn't become a registered nurse.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 670886
Speaker 1: But I want to ask you, your earliest memory of, you know, of growing up.
Speaker 2: Earliest memory, we lived on Catharine Street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], my mom and I and my brothers [Devamrita Swami and Lawrence Reynolds].  By that time, my parents [Phyllis Todd Graham and Lee Reynolds, Jr.] had separated.  And I have this memory of, as a very young child, finding my way down the steps in the early morning hours, and watching the back of my mother.  She was backlit by the TV.  She was sitting in front of the TV taking televised French lessons.  So, I remember she didn't know I was behind her.  I remember just seeing her sort of outlined by the light coming from the TV, sitting on the floor saying words in French.  And that is, that is my earliest, sort of coherent memory.  I'm sure I've got fragments of others, but that's the one I remember.
Story_ID: 670887
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents [Phyllis Todd Graham and Lee Reynolds, Jr.] met? Bef- you know, your, do you know how they met 'cause they're both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were high--they met in high school.
Speaker 1: --so they're both from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but they end up in, you know, they, they meet in high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --then they go to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, then, your mother goes back to Philadelphia--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when she gets, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, the community that you lived in at that point, where're you living, you know, when your--
Speaker 2: When I was born?
Speaker 1: Yeah, when or, or, I'm sorry, when you moved back to Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Well, so, I was born in Jamaica, Queens [New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but that was for a hot minute.  And then we lived in, well, people tell me it's West Philly [West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], so it was Catharine Street.  And if I remember the address, most people from Philly will say well, that's, you know, West Philly, 54 something, something Catharine Street.  I was there from really about less than one year old until I was five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I have plenty of memories about that.
Speaker 1: Can we, can we talk about some of those?
Speaker 2: Sure.  You know, the houses in Philly in that neighborhood are very close together.  So, I remember being in one of my--I could think it was my sister's [Patricia Reynolds Hill] bedroom--throwing oranges and apples across the, the alleyway to the house next door, to the family next door.  I remember ripping and running up and down the street with my friends.  I remember the next door neighbor, this girl who's about my age, had kittens.  I remember attending a, a preschool in the basement of a nearby Lutheran church, and running around with, you know, black kids and white kids.  We were all together in this preschool, and just having a blast.
Story_ID: 670888
Speaker 1: A lot of my time, though, was spent with my [maternal] grandmother who lived maybe twenty-five miles away from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in a little town called Williamstown, New Jersey.  And so, a lot of my memories of that period are around living with her in a little house on Winslow Road in Williamstown, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: So, now, when you were living with her, your other brothers and si- one, are they, your brothers and sister, are they living with her 'cause--
Speaker 1: No, by that, that time, my, my oldest brother, Pip [Devamrita Swami], had gone off to prep school [Holderness School, Plymouth, New Hampshire].  And then, my, my brother, Larry [Lawrence Reynolds], I think also was going in boarding school [The Roeper School Middle School and Upper School, Birmingham, Michigan] for most of that.  So, my sister, Pat [Patricia Reynolds Hill], I remember being there, but I was the only one not in school.  My mom [Phyllis Todd Graham] had to work, so, you know, the alternative was put me in daycare or have me stay with my grandmother.
Speaker 2: So, were you staying with your grandmother during the week or, or you were staying with her just until your mother could pick her?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I, I was there as long as both of them wanted me there.
Speaker 2: So, describe, describe your grandmother to me.
Speaker 1: Very--
Speaker 2: Her name?
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Amy Winifred Todd [Amy Todd], a stone cold Bermudian in that she spoke with a, a almost a British accent.  You know, she was not the, everybody's southern cook grandmother.  But if you wanted some Bermudian food, she could, she could burn, but, you know, there was not collard greens.  It was Hoppin' John and other, other things that came out of, out of Bermuda.  I think she even had a picture of the Queen [Elizabeth II], you know, in her, in her house.  Just a very affectionate woman, very gentle, but she brook no nonsense.  She could use that British accent to cut you if, if you were doing something wrong.  And for a period of time, I remember my grandfather [Austin Todd] was still living.  They had a garden, a large garden next to the house, and I would join him in the garden.  And, you know, he had strawberries and other kinds of fruit that would grow in New Jersey at the time.  And I loved going in that garden because I could work with my grandfather who I adored and, at the same time, have some strawberries, you know, fresh off the vine.  Even after he passed away, my, my grandmother, I think I was kind of like a comfort to her.  And she used to call me My Christopher [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds].  That was never Chris or Christopher.  It was My Christopher.  And, you know, even know, my, my siblings tease me about how I was grandma's favorite.  You know, I don't deny it.
Story_ID: 670889
Speaker 1: So, what are--you know, you did a very good job just now of describing sights, you know, of childhood.  And I would, we usually like to do the three senses, so can you tell me about sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, during this part of my childhood?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, you know, when I was in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I remember the sounds of the cars going up and down the street.  I was always fascinated with cars, so I would stop and watch, you know, the cars go up and down the street.  I, I had a deep fondness for the song, 'Charlie Brown,' "He's a clown.  Why is everybody always pickin' on me?"  That song, apparently I loved so much, I would play it over and over again to the point where my, my brother would call me Charlie Brown.  You know, in terms of sounds coming out of Williamstown, New Jersey, I remember there opposite our- my grandma's house, my [maternal] grandma and grandfather's [Amy Todd and Austin Todd] house was a horse farm.  And so, I remember hearing the horses, you know, whinny and neigh from across the road, the crickets at night because it was out in the country.  Those are the sounds I remember.  I also remember, oddly enough, the sounds of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.  Benjamin Franklin Bridge, as you drove over it, had steel sections or something, and so going over that bridge, you could always hear the clunk, clunk, clunk, as the car wheels went over that bridge.  I used to love that sound.  Smells, little, little more difficult.  I remember the smell of my grandmother.  She had, she had a very nice pleasant sort of smell. And I never knew what that was, maybe some sort of perfume or powder.  And also, the smell of her cooking, her kitchen had a distinct smell to it which I really liked.  Beyond that, and that's all I can remember now.
Story_ID: 670890
Speaker 1: What is the difference in age between you and your sister?
Speaker 2: Pat's [Patricia Reynolds Hill], Pat's about seven years older than I am.
Speaker 1: So, you're really almost like the only child.  You're, I mean, in that, 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  My, my mother [Phyllis Todd Graham] cheerfully called me an accident (laughter).  My dad [Lee Reynolds, Jr.] said I was, I was planned for, meaning, you know, my mom told him I'm coming, and he started planning.  So, that was, you know, you hear these things and like, you know, that really isn't very supportive, is it, Dad?  But I mean, you know, that was the truth, it was the truth.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It's not, it's not supportive (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was the truth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, you, you--how long is it that your mother is--you're being raised by a single mother?  How long is that?
Speaker 2: That was until 1968, so that was five years.
Speaker 1: Five years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--oh!  So, the five year period, yes, that's the five year period that you were there.  So, so, how--what happens?  How does your, who is your stepfather?  How does he come into your family's life and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.  Well, his name is Garfield Steven Graham [Garfield Graham].  And--
Speaker 1: That's a novelty name.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And his people are out of South Carolina, and settled in New Jersey.  So, the connection is my mom and my [maternal] grandmother [Amy Todd] had some near and dear friends who lived down the road in Egg Harbor, New Jersey, Egg Harbor, New Jersey [Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey].  And one couple, Aunt Connie [ph.] and Uncle Larkey [ph.], now they were not really our aunts and uncles but, you know, in, in our community, it doesn't matter.  They're Aunt Connie and Uncle Larkey.  It's very odd.  At the same time that my mom and dad [Lee Reynolds, Jr.] split up, my aunt, the, the aunt who was next, is older to my mom, her first husband passed away.  And Aunt Connie and Uncle Larkey took it upon themselves to marry off the Todd girls, and they did.  They found a husband for my aunt Joy [Joy Crenshaw], who lived until he was ninety something years old.  That couple was hilarious.  They had a good time.  And they found a husband for, for my mom.  They told her to come on by the house, there's someone we want you to meet.  And that was Garfield Graham.  He was a widower with four children, was living and working in Detroit [Michigan] at the time, and they, they got together, they got together.  There's a story.  I don't remember this, but, apparently, Garfield took Phyllis out on a date, and I was not happy.  And I chased the car that they were in down the street, down Catharine Street in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], very upset, that this man was taking my mother away.  My, my stepfather, my dad--I call him my dad--my stepfather remembers that clearly.  I, I tell him, I have no recollection of chasing a car down the street, but he insists it happened, as does my mom.  I was just being protective.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, boys can be very protective.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And I mean, and that's, that's very typical.
Story_ID: 670891
Speaker 1: I, you know, I have one question to ask you though (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --is in this five year period before your parent- you know, your stepfather comes into, and your parents [Phyllis Todd Graham and Reynolds' stepfather, Garfield Graham] get married, how much are you Caribbean or affected by, you know, Caribbean lifestyle and your [maternal] grandmother [Amy Todd] who was from Buda- Bermuda?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, first off, people from Bermuda do not consider themselves Caribbean.  Bam (laughter).  And the people in the Caribbean don't consider people from Bermuda part of the Caribbean.  So, funny story, very quickly.  I, I go to Jamaica.  I, I met this girl [Arlene Ford Reynolds] from Jamaica.  We were in love.  She takes me back to Jamaica to meet her family, including her grandmother.  And her grandmother lives up in the country, in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica.  We go visit her, and her grandmother basically says, "Well, you know, where are you from?"  And, and my wife jumps in and says, "You know, well, he's from the Caribbean, too, he's from Bermuda."  And this country woman in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica says, "Well, that's not the Caribbean."  So, no, there, there was, get it straight (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, what did they consider it, part of the United S- because it's--
Speaker 2: It's a British territory.
Speaker 1: It's a British territory.
Speaker 2: They are, they are probably the island, to this day, most closely aligned with the United Kingdom than any other island.  I think that even though it has its nominal independence, it's still a protectorate of the United Kingdom so, you know, God save the Queen.  So, how much of my lifestyle was, or life was affected (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, or affected.  You know, how sometimes people would--well, see, I can't say Caribbean but--you know, of Caribbean back- a lot of times, they may just say they're different from other black people.  There was none of that?
Speaker 2: There was none of that.
Speaker 1: Just the difference in food?
Speaker 2: Just the difference in food, also the difference in accents.  So, you know, I grew up with two sides of my family where nobody, you know, spoke, dropping the N and G's at the ends of their sentence or, you know, use typical, what's viewed as typical black speech.  Now, we all know there's really no such thing, but I'll tell you, when I went to Detroit [Michigan] as a kid, they thought I was from London [England] because I, I spoke like a New Yorker with a heavy dose of, you know, British pronunciation 'cause listening to my grandmother, you know, you, you, she was speaking with a British accent filtered through Bermuda.  But, but, no, there was never the sense of we're apart from other black people.  You know, around this time, here's what I do remember.  Of course, it was the time of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and Malcolm X.  And I remember my brothers [Devamrita Swami and Lawrence Reynolds] talking about that even when I was very young.  And we considered ourselves kind of a part of that, not, not away or, or distinct from it.
Speaker 1: Of the, of the movement?
Speaker 2: Of, of the black experience.
Speaker 1: Of the black experience (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't--right, all right, 'cause you have some of that in New York [New York], you know, right.
Story_ID: 670892
Speaker 1: --Preparing for the interview and going over your photos.  There's this wonderful photo of your family, your blended family--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the day of your parents'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --wedding.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?  I mean, so what is happening that day?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, this was in 1968.  You know, in that photo, I'm in, I mean, old fashioned knee pants.  And that day, my mom [Phyllis Todd Graham] and her four kids--she and my stepfather have decided to get married.  And they're, they're doing it in Maryland where you can get married quick.  And with him are three of his four kids.  And we're all, somebody is taking the picture of us at the justice of the peace, and we're standing there.  And the only two people smiling, remotely smiling, are my mom and my, my dad, my stepdad.  And everybody else has a surly expression on their face 'cause we, we don't know who these people are.  Who are these people?  And, and, you know, we didn't sign up for this.  And, and nobody, none of the kids looked happy.  You know, there was--my, my stepfather had four children--Calvin [Calvin Graham], who is, became a Detroit [Michigan] police officer; Marilyn [Marilyn Graham], who's a homemaker; Victor [Victor Graham], who's a cook and chef in Detroit; and my sister, Rhoda [Rhoda Graham Carter] who's an occupational therapist.  But then, they were all, we were all strangers to each other, and, and our faces showed it.  Y'all may be happy, but we, we didn't sign up for this.
Speaker 1: So, how--you know, because that's a blended family before--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's almost like 'The Brady Bunch'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --before 'The Brady Bunch' came up with (unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Before 'The Brady Bunch.' We were pioneers (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, so, how long before had you met each other before that, and what was, what was, and then you're going off to Detroit, right?
Speaker 2: I don't recall meeting them before, before the wedding.  I have no recollection of meeting them--I may have.  I just don't have a memory of it.  I remember that day, I do remember that day, but I don't remember meeting them ahead of time.
Speaker 1: And then, what happens then?  You go to, you move to Detroit?  Is--
Speaker 2: Within a couple of months, we moved to Detroit 'cause my dad [Reynolds' stepfather], Garfield Graham, had to find a house to house these, these seven out of the eight kids, actually six.  By that time, the two oldest boys were, one, Calvin had already married.  In fact, the joke was he made sure he got married and out of the house before we all arrived.  And then, my oldest brother, Pip [Devamrita Swami], was already off in either boarding school or, or college, I forget which.
Speaker 1: So, that's, that's somewhat traumatic though, you know, for a change like that to come into being.  So, there's six, there's six, six of--eight, eight.
Speaker 2: Including, including the parents.
Speaker 1: Parents in the house.
Speaker 2: Oh, but come on now--trauma.  Nobody's talking about trauma in 1968.  I mean, it was just life.  So, I never thought, I never, you know, even looking back, do I, did I consider it trauma?  No, it was just something that happened, and I got a whole bunch of other people to call me the little baby.  And some of them actually spoiled me, so I was, I was fine.
Speaker 1: Well, because you are, I mean, really the, the, your stepbrothers and sister, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They were older--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --pretty much.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, it was an older family merging into a younger family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. Yep.
Story_ID: 670893
Speaker 1: So, where do you live in Detroit [Michigan], 'cause Detroit is where you grow up then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, I lived in northwest Detroit.  And, you know, people who don't know Detroit, when I say I grew up in Detroit, you know, they have the typical media view of Detroit of being, you know, tough, rough town.  And it is, but, you know, that must have meant I grew up in, you know, some horrible circumstance.  The neighborhood I grew up in was full of black folk where both parents worked, single family homes, front yard, backyard, dog in the backyard, two cars.  Some folk had, had little cabins and, up in Michigan.  And, you know, thanks to the auto industry, you know, if one or both parents worked in or around the auto industry, they got some good wages.  My dad [Reynolds' stepfather, Garfield Graham] worked, you know, double shifts at Ford Motor Company.  You know, we weren't, we weren't by any stretch wealthy.  And I think by, by, you know, today's measures, we would be working class, but I never felt that we lacked anything.  Everybody went to school.  You were expected to go to college, at least in our house, you were.  And, you know, across the street was an engineer and a teacher.  Two doors down was another auto worker and her family, so there were some women who were auto workers.  Nurses, teachers, police officers, you know, homemakers, bunch of kids, we would rip and run down the block.  That was, that was sort of Detroit, the Detroit I knew.
Speaker 1: So, what was your address?
Speaker 2: It was Woodingham [Drive] and Margareta [Avenue], Woodingham and Margareta so, you know, for those who know Detroit, just off of Seven Mile [Road]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very close to the University of Detroit High School [University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy, Detroit, Michigan].
Story_ID: 670894
Speaker 1: This is a time of, a lot of, a tumul- tumultaneous time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in our nation's history.  And you had said, you know, earlier that, you know, there was identification with Malcolm X.  We had '68 [1968], Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know, dies or assassinated, and then you're moving there.  And Detroit [Michigan] is going through--well, you have two things.  Detroit is going through a lot of changes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but, but there are--so I just want you to describe.
Speaker 2: Well, sure.  So, by the time I moved there in 1968, the Detroit riots had already occurred, which I believe was 1967.  And, and the neighborhood that my dad [Reynolds' stepfather, Garfield Graham] and his kids lived in over by, oh, the name of the street will come to me.  I want to say, Gratiot [Avenue], but that neighborhood got pretty much destroyed by the riots, so that's my, that's my memory of it.  And I remember there were parts of Detroit, even as a kid, where we would drive through, and it was clearly, you know, the city had gone through some turmoil.  It was also the period where there was, there was, you know, a significant amount of white flight from Detroit into the suburbs.  So, I remember that there was a distinct dividing line between where we lived in Detroit and the suburbs, and that was Eight Mile Road.  I remember, as a kid, rooting for Coleman Young, who was elected mayor, I think, in 1972.  I remember that.  I remember his predecessor--
Speaker 1: I think it's 1974.
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  That's--
Speaker 2: Well, close enough, but I remember I was eleven.  I remember before that, that there was a huge controversy about plainclothes police officers gunning down black men.  And, basically, the then Mayor Young's opponent, a guy by the name of Nichols [John F. Nichols] was the police commissioner.  And, you know, black people got together and denied him the mayorship, and voted in Coleman Young, and part over--I think it was called STRESS, stopped something, something, ensure safe streets [sic. Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets].  Well, it was basically hunting parties for black men by white police officers.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of discussion going on in the household, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And among--now, what, what church are you belonging to?  Are you a churchgoing family?
Speaker 2: Oh quite.  You know, every Sunday morning, we got up and went to church.  There was no, no question about that.  We went to New Prospect Baptist church [New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan] were Reverend Samuel Leon Whitney [S. Leon Whitney] was my pastor out of, I think, Tougaloo, Mississippi.  Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] got his theological degree now.  I know all this 'cause he talked about his degrees.  But, really, sort of our consciousness about what was going on in the neighborhood, if you remember, I had two older brothers, three older brothers at this point.  My, my older stepbrother, let's just call my brother, Victor [Victor Graham], was still in high school.  But my oldest brother, Calvin [Reynolds' stepbrother, Calvin Graham], was a rookie Detroit [Michigan] police officer, so he would come home and tell us what was going on.  My older brother, Pip [Devamrita Swami], was a black revolutionary at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He would come home and tell us what was going on.  And my brother, Larry [Lawrence Reynolds], you know, the joke was, what, what, you know, black liberation movement was he not a member of?  So, he was, he has a Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] red file, you know, the surveillance files that the Michigan State Police took of, you know, suspected, you know, bad black folk who had the nerve to think and talk at the same time.  He was a member of the Nation of Islam, and he went from the Nation of Islam to the United Negro Improvement Association [United Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League], so he was a Marcus Garveyite.  And he also, there was also another group that was very Afrocentric, and he would bring home, you know, I forget the paper.  That was the Call or The Final Call.
Speaker 1: The Final Call--
Speaker 2: The Final Call, I would read that.
Speaker 1: --the Muslim paper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would read that.  I would read the manifestos of Garvey [Marcys Garvey] 'cause he would leave them lying around.  So, I had a pretty high level of consciousness.  I love to read, but a pretty high level of consciousness for a kid, thanks to the propaganda of my brothers.
Story_ID: 670895
Speaker 1: Well, you know, that's why I wanted to ask you about what you were as a little kid.  I mean, in this way, because this is, by this time, you know, I often find that people are formed in that seven to nine year period, but what were you, because this is a lot--I mean you're sort of taking things in, you know, but I'm just trying to get a sense of--
Speaker 2: You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) how you would self describe.
Speaker 2: --that's a very interesting, very interesting question.  I guess the first thing I could say was I was a reader.  I, I started reading very early.  My mom [Phyllis Todd Graham] actually sought to train me to read very early.  So, when I was in elementary school [John J. Bagley Elementary School; John J. Bagley Elementary School of Journalism and Technology, Detroit, Michigan], I was actually reading a couple of grades above my level.  They skipped me twice.  I skipped first grade, and I skipped fifth grade, largely because of my reading level, so I would, I hate to say that I was a nerd.  I, I read the encyclo- 'World Book Encyclopedia' for fun.  You know, I'd come home, pick out the letter M, open it up and start, you know, reading articles that interested me in the letter M.  I was one of those kids who could recite every president in order.  Don't ask me to do it now, but it was just fun for me.  I knew the top ten largest cities in the world and the top ten largest cities in the U.S. in order, and kept track of their population.  I mean, you know, I was, I was, I liked detail.  I could, I could tell you by looking at a car, not only what, who is the manufacturer, and what was the name of the car, but what year that car was.  So, I could distinguish between a '73 [1973] Impala and a '74 [1974] Chevy Impala, 'cause I studied, you know, the shape of the, the tail, the, the highlights.  But I think the most important thing was I was a reader.  I, I read everything I could get my hands on and I was encouraged to do that.  You know, my parents really didn't push me into sports, but they sure loved it when I went to the library.  So, I had a membership at the Detroit Public Library, Sherwood Forest Branch [Detroit, Michigan].  I wore that library out and I would come home with, you know, big satchel full of books I took out from the library.  In terms of--I guess I was kind of a goodie two shoes.  I didn't get into a lot of trouble.  You know, I, I, when I went to church, I participated in whatever my parents pushed me into.  You know, I, I was a junior Sunday school teacher, a junior deacon, member of the choir.  I now realize this was a parenting strategy, being a parent myself.  Keep me occupied, busy, you know, I was a Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America], so I, I never had any free time.  No, I didn't mind, but I now realize again what my parents were doing.  They just made sure I was occupied.  Now, remember, during this period of time, I was also spending summers and holidays, many of the holidays with my dad [Lee Reynolds, Jr.] and my stepmother in New York [New York].  So, you know, my dad by that time, was a detective sergeant in the New York City Police Department.  His wife, my stepmother, Bess [Bess Reynolds], came from a long line of black teachers, so she was a teacher.  Her two sisters were teachers.  And so, she would take me to Bank Street [Bank Street School for Children, New York, New York] which was the experimental school attached with, I believe, Columbia University [New York, New York] at the time.  And I guess my point is when I went to stay with my, my dad and my stepmother, I was expected to read.  He had a shelf full of books.  He would let me read any of the books on the shelf.  I had, you know, same age cousins, I would rip and run with and, you know, we, we had a set of expectations there that were very similar to the expectations of my, my mom and her husband, my stepdad [Garfield Graham] in Detroit [Michigan].  Their lifestyles were different, you know.  He was really not a churchgoer.  My mom and my dad in Detroit actually were, but, you know, there were some things that were very consistent.  He lived in a, an apartment building in the Upper West Side of Manhattan [New York], and then moved, was, was one of the first blacks to move in an area called Holliswood [Queens, New York], right around the corner from where Mario Cuomo grew up.  Of course, being my dad, he had to get the biggest house on the block in Holliswood because that's, that was how he rolled.  That's what I remember.
Story_ID: 670896
Speaker 1: So, this is--so I--okay, so this is, this is your formative period and, obviously--what were teachers saying?  Were they saying that you were o- you know, what are they saying to you?
Speaker 2: I remember I--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you, you, Bagley is where you--
Speaker 2: Bagley Elementary School [John J. Bagley Elementary School; John J. Bagley Elementary School of Journalism and Technology, Detroit, Michigan].  I remember one teacher.  I think her name was Mrs. Polk [ph.], and I remember her telling me, "You're very, you're very smart, and here's what I want you to do.  You see those two boys in the back of the room.  I want you to teach them how to read."  So, by this time, I remember I was in fourth grade.  And so, I was already younger than everybody, and smaller than everybody, and I was getting picked on a little bit.  And, but, you know, being the, the--you know, what- whatever the teacher said, I, I would do, and I know I was probably driving people crazy.  I went and taught these, helped teach these, these two really big boys how to read.  And we got along so well that at some point during the process, they took me aside and said, "Look, if anybody messes with you, you just, you just come let us know.  You will not be messed with again."  Sure enough, someone tried to mess with me.  I went and told my new friends.  That did not happen again.  First lesson about, you know, how you don't necessarily need to be the strongest one, you just need to have strong friends (laughter).  But so, so, but the teacher encouraged me to, you know, help others, you know, teach them how to read.  That was kind of around fourth grade.  By sixth grade, my teachers were entering me in whatever contest came up.  If there was a poetry contest, you know, they wanted me to be in the poetry contest.  If there was a speech contest, you know, "Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], you're going to be in the speech contest."  So, so, I had a lot of encouraging teachers at Bagley.  At Hampton [Hampton Junior High School; Hampton Middle School, Detroit, Michigan], which was my junior high school, my mom [Phyllis Todd Graham] got me out of there after one year because she didn't see them as very encouraging, and sent me off to a Quaker school, Friends School of Detroit [Michigan], for eighth grade.  Really had fun there, but my teachers told my mom, didn't tell me, but told my mom, "High school here will bore him.  You got to send him to a much more challenging high school."  And so, I went to Cass Tech High School [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] right after one year at Friends School of Detroit.  And, and I had great teachers there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And describe Cass Tech 'cause it's a, it, it was and not so much now, but it, it still exists, but it was a, it's, it's, it was the black high school, but it was also a, it's a famous school.
Speaker 2: It is.  So, so Cass Tech at the time was a citywide school, which was a, which I think there may have been only one or two others in Detroit.  You had to test into it, or you had to have a specific interest in a vocation.  So, imagine a school about a block long on every side, nine stories tall, freight elevators moving students up and down between floors.  I mean, they don't build them like that anymore.  And the school had an aviation lab and automobile maintenance lab, a full woodworking shop, refrigeration.  I mean, if you wanted to learn a skill, you could graduate from Cass Tech in one of these vocational programs and walk out and get a job.  They also had a, excuse me, science and arts program, which was a college prep program. and a chem [chemistry], bio [biology] program.  And, you know, the students that wanted to go on to college would be in the science and arts or chem, bio program.  And I was in the science and arts program.  And I was twelve when I started high school, 19--1975, 'cause I had skipped two grades.  So, by that time, I was twelve when I started.  Sixteen when I graduated.
Story_ID: 670897
Speaker 1: You know, at that point in time, they weren't doing that as much as--you know, we have stories ear- you know, of people who are older, you know, skipping grades.  But I--so, so let me ask you--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --because this is 1979, you graduate, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And how are you, how mature are you at this point 'cause boys are not supposed to be mature.  They're supposed to lack, let's see--follow behind women who are supposedly more mature.  So, I'm just wondering how you would describe yourself and--
Speaker 2: I was a kid.  I was old enough to recognize that there were girls in high school and I liked them, but too young to be anything, but their little brother, which drove me nuts, drove me absolutely nuts.  So, I didn't get into a lot of trouble because they would actually deal me out, you know, "Hey, where are you guys going?"  "Oh, we're--Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], you can't come, man, you're too young.  Don't, you know, you stay here."  So, I got, I, they watched out for me.  They kept me out of trouble, my classmates, 'cause I was a kid.  And, I, I think, I kind of reminded them, if they had siblings, of their little brother, and they just didn't want to have that vibe.
Speaker 1: So, how, how many other students were in school who had been skipped like that?  You don't--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember, I can't imagine--
Speaker 1: 'Cause--
Speaker 2: --there was--I was the youngest in my class, every class.  Now, there may have been students who skipped a year.  I think one of my neighbors, a girl, woman now, by the name of Susan Wilson [ph.], I think she may have skipped a year.  That was the daughter of the engineering teacher who lived across the street, and she may have skipped a year, but I think, I think I was the youngest.
Story_ID: 670898
Speaker 1: Now, were there discussions between your, your mother [Phyllis Todd Graham] and father [Lee Reynolds, Jr.] about your development, and what were the right things to do, you know, or is there just general pride and the fact that you're smart?
Speaker 2: No, my mom was very intentional about my education and, you know, I think she discussed it with stepdad [Garfield Graham] from time to time.  He, he just, his, his view was my job, I had only one job, I had only one job, and that was to go to school and get good grades.  And I remember him saying, "This should be easy, this is easy, you have one job, one thing to do, that's it."  Now, of course, I had chores, but that, that didn't count as a job.  That was sort of part of my obligation.  You know, my, my dad in New York [New York] and my stepmother [Bess Reynolds], their expectation was why should I not make all A's and that was my mom's expectation as well, but she was famous for her trips to the school to make sure that every teacher knew that they were teaching a brilliant child.  She would go to every teacher in every school I went to until I was about in tenth grade where she felt maybe she had laid this groundwork, and folks could take it from here.  She left nobody with any guesses about how they should view me, that I was a brilliant child who had to be, you know, taught in every way, and not to be messed with, or she would be back.  There was one incident where--this was in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan].  I was taking a course in some form of--it was a course in oratory, so I was interested.  I wanted, I wanted to take a course in speechmaking oratory.  And this teacher just was not interested in teaching.  She would come in late.  She would, you know, have us do these assignments that made no sense whatsoever.  And I got so mad, I started to basically take down in a notebook every day how many minutes she was late.  I was on time for the class.  The teacher was late, fifteen minutes today, twenty minutes the next day, thirteen minutes day three.  And I had a record in my little notebook that I was supposed to be taking notes for, for the class of every day that she was late.  I had a date and a time.  And one day, she came in and I looked down, looked at, you know, the clock, made a notation, and she happened to see me.  And she said, "What are you writing down?"  And I looked at this woman and said, "The number of minutes that you are late for our class."  She reached down and ripped the pages out of my book, pulled me up by my collar, and told me, get out of her class, and go to the principal's office.  And I had never been thrown out of anybody's class.  Now, I remember being really angry.  In fact, I'm getting angry even now, like here I am.  I'm on time every day.  I'm here to, you know, everybody wants me to learn.  I'm here to learn.  This teacher is coming in late and, and has the nerve to throw me out of her class.  And, you know, I, I had to go home that day on the long bus ride home, the Hamilton bus took an hour to get home, and think about what I was going to tell my, my mom and dad when I got there that I actually got kicked out of class for noting how many minutes the teacher was late for about the fiftieth day in a row.  So, I told this to my mom, and she, you know, kind of nodded her head and said, "Well, you know, you should always make sure that you treat teacher, a teacher with respect."  She, she didn't really give me much room like, oh, you, you did the right thing.  It was like, you know, "Did you talk to the teacher respectfully?"  And I said, "I, I didn't do anything.  I, you know, didn't raise my voice, but I got kicked out of class."  "Well, I guess, I'm coming to the school tomorrow."  And I never knew exactly what she said to the principal and that teacher.  The teacher was never late to her class again.  And, you know, she later, as, and in, you know, we'll talk about this 'cause it was a, you know, it was a significant memory.  I got kicked out of class, it never happened.  And she just said, "I just explained to her that it was in her interest if my child was in her class, to come to class on time, and that it would really, it would really be good for her if she let this notation of lateness go, and I'd," and she told her, "and I'll tell my son not to take notes like that on you as long as you're in class on time teaching my son."  And she describes it calmly now.  And my mom, I'd never heard her, very rarely ever heard her raise her voice, but she had a reputation for saying very tough things very quietly and firmly, particularly at work.  And I'm sure she used that voice with this teacher.
Story_ID: 670899
Speaker 1: So, what other--I know you had also a love of comic, what other things are you, are you a typical boy? Sports, comics, books?
Speaker 2: I--well, I'll, I'll tell you the thing, I was not into, sports.  And the reason for that largely is because, remember in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], where you had the most opportunity to engage in, you know, organized sport, I was a runt, I was a kid, you know, twelve year old--
Speaker 1: Sorry, sorry.
Speaker 2: --versus fourteen year old, playing football, no, basketball, too short.  So, so I wasn't getting a lot of, I guess, I guess, the psychologist would call it, positive reinforcement for sports, but I was getting a ton of positive reinforcement for reading and doing well in class, so that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I, I was, I loved comic books.  I had a comic book shop I would walk to every day with my saved up allowance.  And I would buy, you know, five cent, ten cent, or twenty-five cent comic books.  The price kept going up, but I would buy my comic books and read them.  I read every fantasy, you know, fiction series the library had, so I was reading 'The Lord of the Rings' [J.R.R. Tolkien] series when I was very young.  I was reading C.S. Lewis, the, the series, 'Lion the Book and the Wardrobe' [sic. 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,' C.S. Lewis], or I forget the precise name, and about three or four other series.  I would tear through them at a clip because I loved reading.  You know, I had, I had a favorite baseball team.  I liked the Tigers [Detroit Tigers], but I didn't, I didn't play much organized sports.
Story_ID: 670900
Speaker 1: So, when it comes time to go to college, what, how is that decision made then?
Speaker 2: Well, as I tell my children who made their decisions about where they were going, I, I'd, at that point in time, and I think this is true of many people of my generation.  You, you went where your parents could afford to send you, and where they felt comfortable for you to go.  So, you know, I'd done well in high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] and, and I was a National Achievement [National Achievement Scholarship Program], I think National Merit Scholar [National Merit Scholarship Corporation], whatever, whatever those tests were.  And so, I applied to all these schools outside of the State of Michigan.  I applied, the one I remember getting into was George Washington [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.].  I remember applying to, I think some schools in New York [New York].  I wanted to go to New York and go to college.  My mother [Phyllis Todd Graham], remember I'm the youngest, she had now by this time, 1979, experienced an, an older boy [Devamrita Swami] going off to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and joining the International Society of Krishna Consciousness.  Another boy, my brother, Larry [Lawrence Reynolds], going off to Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] and Howard [Howard University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], and, you know, doing stuff she didn't approve of.  So, this one was not escaping her clutches.  And even though I was getting accepted into all of these schools, her, her point was, "You're going to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], or some other school in, in the State of Michigan, like your sister."  My sister, Pat [Patricia Reynolds Hill], went to the University of Michigan.  My sister, Rhoda [Rhoda Graham Carter], went to Eastern Michigan [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan].  "You're not going too far away from home."  I was very angry, but I, I, my counselor suggested I look at the school that we could not afford called Kalamazoo College, a four year liberal arts school in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  And, you know, they had some scholarships available, including their writing scholarship, and some other scholarships, and I competed for them and, and got them.  And we found through loans and other things we could afford to go to--I could afford to go to Kalamazoo College.  So, so my choice was University of Michigan, Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], or Kalamazoo College. And I liked Kalamazoo College, and that's where I decided to go.
Speaker 1: So, Kalamazoo is how far from Detroit?
Speaker 2: A hundred and forty-two miles.
Speaker 1: So, you're away--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but you're close enough.
Speaker 2: Close enough t- close enough for them to put the arm on me, exactly right.
Story_ID: 670901
Speaker 1: So what are you--talk about your experience there.  How large an institution is--
Speaker 2: Kalamazoo College [Kalamazoo, Michigan], at the time, was about twelve hundred students.  And the funny thing was--not so funny when I was experiencing it--when I went there my freshman year, 1 percent were African American.  There were twelve black students there, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause this is, this is a little, I mean, a little unusual, given the time, because it's 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy-nine [1979].  So, can you talk about the nature of the institution?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, Kalamazoo College probably, not probably, I think is the best, and at the time, was the best four year liberal arts school in Michigan.  And it had a, a great program where they were on the quarter system, and so you went to school during the summer, except during your freshman year.  They had a career development program where you would go off campus during your sophomore year, and work as an intern in some area of your interest.  Your junior year, you spent mostly overseas in a school where you had linguistic ability.  And then, you had a senior thesis, an SIP [Senior Individualized Project], where you could, again, go off campus, and write your thesis on, you know, a topic within your major.  And that really attracted me to the school, especially the foreign study part, 'cause the only foreign country I'd been to by that time was Bermuda and Canada.  So, I was really attracted by that program, by the small classes, by the fact that the course work looked interesting and challenging, and they gave me scholarships.  I mean, you know, it was actually at that point cheaper than going to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] with the scholarships.
Story_ID: 670902
Speaker 1: But, you know, there were, there were some challenges going to a school where they didn't really have a lot of black folk at the time.  And let me put a pause there--skip forward, I'm on the Board of Trustees [Kalamazoo College Board of Trustees].  The current president is the, a Mexican American.  The previous president was a sister who was there for ten years, beloved.  They have about, out of twelve hundred, they're, they're one of the most diverse liberal arts schools in the country.  But back then, you know, in 1979, you know, no one was talking about diversity.  So, I remember, you know, a couple of things that, you know, had never happened before.  So, when I took the tests to, to try to get that English literature scholarship, it was an essay test, and there were only two black students in the whole room.  It was a big lecture hall taking this essay writing test for the scholarship and, naturally, the, the other black student, a brother, sat next to me.  I mean, we were the only two black folk in the entire room, like room full of sixty people, and we sat next to each other 'cause, you know, someone who kind of looked like me, that was nice.  The proctor, the professor, who was managing the test, made us get up and sit apart because he thought that somehow we were going to cheat on an essay test which always blew my mind.  So, I remember that, that he kind of thought, well, two black people together, they're going to cheat.  That same professor, I actually remember his name, but I won't call it out.  That same professor was head of the introduction to American literature class and I, I did papers for his class, and I was getting A's on his papers, and he couldn't believe it.  He couldn't believe that a black kid was getting A's, so I actually learned later that year that he told his colleagues that I must have been a mulatto because only, because being partly white would explain why I was acing, acing his, acing his classes.  He was a piece of work.  You know--
Speaker 2: Is this, what year is this?  Is this your--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: So, no, but this, oh, this is in all your freshman year?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So, and you hadn't had that experience up to that point?
Speaker 1: Well, no, because Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], by the way, was a multiracial school.  My best buddy was Giancarlo Gasperoni [ph.] from the Republic of San Marino.  His, you know, parents came from Italy, the Republic of San Marino, separate country, he was careful to say, worked in the auto factory.  And Giancarlo and I went to, went to high school together.  Now, Cass Tech High School, you had black folk, you had, you had Asians, you had Latinos, you had white folk, and it was, it was a really diverse school.  So, I, I was used to being in a diverse environment, didn't really know the words, diverse environment.  And then, I go to Kalamazoo College [Kalamazoo, Michigan], and there's only twelve of us and, and you know, people are asking me questions, like, "Do you need to put on suntan lotion?  I didn't know you tanned." Or, "How do you," you know, they would touch your hair, and, "how do you, do you actually cut your hair or comb your hair?"  And I remember somewhere around my freshman year, I developed the stock response which is, "I'm not here to educate you.  I'm here to get an education.  You can pick up a book and read about black people, but I'm not, I'm not the ambassador of the black race, and I'm not your professor unless you want to pay me."  And people kind of stopped bothering me with that stuff after that.
Speaker 2: So, did it get easier?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It, it did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it got a lot easier.
Speaker 2: Did, did the school get more diverse during the time or not?
Speaker 1: You know, yeah, it did.  By the time I graduated, you know, I think there were at least thirty black students, you know, predominantly in the, in the younger classes but they, they were, this was now bleeding into 19--early 1980s, and so the school had gotten a little more with it.  But, it got easier, it got easier in part because I really enjoyed my classes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had a lot of support from professors that, that I worked with.  I was on the, the college presidential search committee my senior year and, you know, everybody was supportive.  Now, at the same time, I knew where I was.  You know, I was one of few black folk at the school.  There was a black students organization.  I was part of it, and we actually developed a strategy, which was I was the inside guy so, so, and then my, my buddies from the BSO were the ones who would protest outside the student union or outside the president's office.  And then, my job was to go in afterwards, and say, "You know, here's what, you know the Black Student Organization really wants.  And I think if you did this, you know, maybe the protests would stop."  And, and so, we would, we would sort of play that tactic of external pressure and internal pressure.  And, to this day, I, I don't think they ever figured out that we actually had strategized about it beforehand.  And were basically running a, running a tactic.  I guess they didn't think we could run a tactic, so we worked it as often as we could.
Speaker 2: I wish there was more of that (laughter) going on just period, but that, no, that was, that's--
Story_ID: 670903
Speaker 1: So you, you had, now your junior year--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --you went to the university--
Speaker 2: Yeah, University of Strasbourg [Strasbourg, France] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Strasbourg.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and then, talk about you becoming a Harry S. Truman Scholar, because that's--
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, you know, remember, you know, my, my parents [Phyllis Todd Graham and Lee Reynolds, Jr.] really couldn't afford Kalamazoo College [Kalamazoo, Michigan].  And so, so it was incumbent upon me to either find more scholarships or, or borrow money.  And I don't know, I think one of my, my professors actually said, "You should check this out this Harry S. Truman Scholarship."  And it's, you know, two, two people from every state, plus a number of at large winners, and if you win this scholarship, you get the last two years of college pretty much paid for, plus the first two years of any graduate school, and it was great, it was great.  So, I applied for it and I got, I won it.  I get an at large scholarship, and I remember getting sent off to Independence, Missouri for the ceremony.  It was a very hot day.  There was one other black student there, Jacqueline Berrien, and we, she and I became fast friends from that day.  But I got to tell you, from a financial perspective, it really was helpful to my parents to have that scholarship for, you know, the last two years of college, and the first two years of law school.
Speaker 1: That, you know, that's amazing that the two of you came together at that point because, you know, she's a part--I mean, you both ended up at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] together, which is--
Speaker 2: I was very happy to see her my first year, my first day at Harvard Law School.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, you just met there at that program, right?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You didn't, but you said you became fast friends 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, you know, the, the--she and I would, by then, they didn't have email, but we, we'd write letters to each other, or keep up with each other.  You know, what are you doing after college?  Where are you going?  I think I knew that she was headed to Harvard Law School, so, you know, it was good to see her when I got there.
Story_ID: 670904
Speaker 1: So, when did law, or the thought of law, become a thought for you 'cause I don't, you know, I hadn't--and you, but you majored in, in poli sci.
Speaker 2: I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And we didn't even talk about that, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, so when I, when I applied to college [Kalamazoo College, Kalamazoo, Michigan], I thought I was going to be a doctor.  I wanted to be a doctor like my brother [Lawrence Reynolds], and so I applied to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], six year medical school program, called the Inteflex Program [Integrated Premedical-Medical Program].  And, you know, I was sure I was going to get in because you know I had great grades and, you know, I, I just knew I was going to get in.  And I didn't, and I found out later that I didn't get in because the University of Michigan six year, you know, undergrad med program kind of made a, I think a wise decision.  I didn't agree with it at the time.  I was too young.  How could I know at sixteen that I wanted to be a doctor, and then commit myself to that, so that I would graduate at twenty two with a medical degree?  And that kind of said, you know, maybe they figured, he just wants to be a doctor 'cause his brother is a doctor.  I don't know what it was but, so, in, in almost in reaction, I decided, well, if they won't, if I won't become a doctor, then I'm not taking any pre-med program.  I'm going to do poli sci and try that.  There was no real deep thought, like I want to be in poli- it was actually, I'm mad, you know, they didn't let me into the medical profession.  I'm sixteen, right--didn't let me into the medical profession.  Well, I'm going in the opposite direction, going to be poli sci.  So, so, I'm now a poli sci major doing pretty well, senior fellow. So I'm a senior fellow in the poli si department.  I, I like the classes.  Professors and I are getting along famously.  And I decided I want to be a political science professor.  So, I go home, you know, sometime in my sophomore year right after I get back from foreign study, and announced to my mom [Phyllis Todd Graham], my mom in Detroit [Michigan], and my dad [Lee Reynolds, Jr.] in New York [New York], that my plan is to go get a Ph.D. in poli sci.  Man, you should have heard, you know, my Depression era [Great Depression] parents read me the riot act about how--and one reaction was, "Oh, no, you're not."  The other reaction was, "Let's--great, why don't you get something practical first, and then once you have that to fall back on, you can always go get your Ph.D. in political science, and become a professor."  But I know they were hot.  They were like, this was not, this, you know, poli sci professors at that time were not well paid, and they didn't seem to have much job security at that time.  And they were not interested in me going to college and coming out, going into an uncertain job market.  Remember, this was 1983, Reagan era [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].  You know, jobs, jobs were scarce.
Speaker 1: And, and inflation rates going out the roof, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything, every--yeah, so they, they were not interested in anything that was, in their view, insecure.
Story_ID: 670905
Speaker 1: So, one of my, one of my father's buddies--my father, a police officer in New York [New York], had one of his buddies talk to me about being a lawyer.  The buddy in question was Judge Neil Blackshear [Cornelius Blackshear], one of the first black bankruptcy judges in the Southern District of New York [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York].  He was a former police officer, and a buddy of my dad's.  And he and a couple of his similarly situated friends kind of sat me down and said, "Well, you ought to try for law school."  So, you know, I said, okay.  I took the LSATs.  I tried for law school.  I applied, based on my scores, to a whole bunch of law schools.  My scores were pretty good, and I got into almost every law school I applied to, including Harvard, University of Chicago [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois], and a few others.  I decided that I wanted to go to the University of Chicago because there was this girl I was interested in at Kalamazoo College, still back at Kalamazoo [Michigan], and I wanted to sort of be within distance, reach, of this girl.  And so, my mom [Phyllis Todd Graham] was fine with that. 'cause as far as she knew, I was going to the University of Chicago in order to be close to Detroit [Michigan].  That was great.  I made the mistake of telling my dad the real reason why I wanted to go to the University of Chicago, and he got, again, the same group of friends together.  And these four or five black men jumped on my neck, over the course of a couple of hours, and told me what a fool I was to give up going to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] for some girl.  And now, and, and these are black men who are former police officers, so they were actually being pretty, you know, they were using some pretty strong language.  And, you know, the conversation ended with my, my father in New York, Lee Reynolds [Lee Reynolds, Jr.], looking at me, and saying, "No son of mine will get into Harvard Law School, and turn them down, full stop here, and you're going."  That's it.  And, you know, he rarely issued a directive like that to me.  And, but that was, that plus the, the, you know, the advice (air quotes) from my father's friends, I, I decided, okay, maybe I can kind of stay with this girl, and go to Harvard Law School.  So, I, I agreed with Harvard that I should go to Harvard.
Speaker 2: Now, that's a lovely story because a lot of male influence--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in, in your life.
Story_ID: 670906
Speaker 1: The thing I want, 'cause we just actually interviewed Blackshear [Cornelius Blackshear] just probably within the last month [sic.] 'cause he was the first bankruptcy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How's he doing?
Speaker 1: --bankruptcy judge.  Why, I didn't do his interview, so I'm not sure, but I think--I'm not sure, you know, I don't, I remember trying to prepare the other interviewer for it because David Corehead [ph.] had been a bankruptcy judge, so I was trying to, you know, do that part.  But so that, so let me ask you 'cause this is 19--you enter [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1983, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the fall.  And so, who, what, who is in your class?
Speaker 2: Jim Johnson [James E. Johnson], Jim Johnson, one of my best buddies, former deputy assistant secretary of the treasury, currently candidate for governor in New Jersey.  I met him on the first day.  He was in my class.  Gosh, so many others, they're, they're kind of flooding my brain, but who else was in that class came out in '86 [1986]?  Loretta Lynch was there, but came out ahead of me, so I knew Loretta well, while, while she was there, but she, she graduated ahead of me.  You know, if I thought about I, I could come up with more names--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but there were so many.
Speaker 1: So, Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], who is on, who, who do you have for your first year classes, like who's teaching you contracts or civil procedure or--
Speaker 2: Freeman [ph.], Freeman was my contracts professor.  That was interesting.  Funky Duncan Kennedy was my property professor.  The foundation of all property is blood.  I remember that from his property class.  Don't ask me about the rule against perpetuities, but I remember that the foundation of all property is blood.  Gosh, who else did I have?  I had a great professor, his name I do not remember, who was visiting from Toronto [Canada], later became the dean of the University of Toronto law school [University of Toronto Faculty of Law, Toronto, Canada] for torts.  I did not have any of the then, on campus black professors, so at the time, Ferguson, Professor Ferguson [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.] was still there.  I think Randall Robertson, Robinson, I think--
Speaker 1: You mean, [HistoryMaker] Randall Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Randall Kennedy.  Randall Robinson was the--
Speaker 1: That's okay, that's okay.
Speaker 2: Randall Kennedy, I think may, he may have been there for his first year at some point during my, my three years.  [HistoryMaker] Charles Ogletree was an adjunct.  He was not yet tenured or on the faculty.  David Wilkins [HistoryMaker David B. Wilkins] showed up at some point during that point in time, but I don't remember exactly when, but he was, he was on campus by the time I was there.  There was a sister who, who passed through.  I don't remember her name.  That's what I remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Derrick Bell had left but, but his departure was still reverberating through the campus, so there were a number of campus protests around, you know, Derrick Bell.  And also around at that time, the anti-apartheid movement, so that was pretty big on campus, but that was, that was 1983, 1984.
Speaker 1: That's good.
Story_ID: 670907
Speaker 1: How do you take to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] then?
Speaker 2: Hm. It (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, since your thought wasn't, that--wasn't that, I mean, you were wanting to have a career in the academy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, by the time I go to law school, I think I want to be a real estate developer who rebuilds my City of Detroit [Michigan].  So, I'm going to take that law degree, and then use it to become an urban developer, and come home to Detroit, and turn it around by, you know, building cities.  I've always loved cities, so this, this new ambition fell in line with my love of cities.  Of course, law school, first year has nothing to do with really nothing.  I mean, it's, it's a, it's a winningly process.  It's a hazing, and I got hazed.  I mean, this was the first time in my entire academic career where I felt, I mean, challenged to the point where I was wondering if I could make it.  I lived in, in a dorm.
Speaker 1: Which, which dorm?
Speaker 2: Gropius dorms [Gropius Complex], Hughes [sic. Holmes Hall].  On one side of me was a third year from Atlanta [Georgia].  On another side of me was a third year from Cincinnati [Ohio] who, each of them, literally cried themselves to sleep at night.  I kid you not.  One would cry to his mother.  The other would, would cry on the phone to his parents.  They, they lived on either side of me and, you know, those cinder block walls carried a lot of sound.  And I remember just thinking, man, these are third year students, and they're literally sobbing into the phone about get me out of here.  How did you, how could you send me here?  Third year students.  So, so the, it was tough, it was tough.  I didn't do as well as I wanted in my first semester.  The tests wore me out.  I worked the hardest I'd ever worked, didn't see, you know, the, the return in terms of the grades that I thought I could get.  I joined study groups and, you know, I, I met people who I thought, well, they're, they're actually smarter than I am.  That's, you know, that was new. And so it worked a number on me my first year.  I got a job for my first year summer at Dykema Gossett [Dykema Gossett PLLC], this law firm in Detroit, so I went back to Detroit.  And that was an important summer because I was basically taken to hand, taken in hand, by Kathleen Lewis [Kathleen McCree Lewis].  Kathleen Lewis, who was Judge McCree's [Wade H. McCree] daughter, and she basically persuaded me that my career was not in urban development, or municipal finance, which was something else I was considering, but that she thought I was a natural litigator, natural trial lawyer.  And she persuaded me that I could be a great, a great lawyer, and she showed me, you know, how to write, and how to think like an actual lawyer.  And she did probably the next, one of the most important things anyone has ever done for me, and that is, she introduced me to Damon Keith, [HistoryMaker] Damon J. Keith.  So, she walked me over to Damon J. Keith's chambers, and I'll never forget it.  I'm meeting this judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit judge [United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit], one of the few black judges at that time period.  And he sits me down, chats with me for a while, and then asked me, "What are you doing after law school?"  Like, "Well, you know, I was thinking about becoming a municipal finance lawyer, maybe work for Dykema Gossett," you know, I don't know, I don't know.  So, "I'll, I'll tell you what you're doing after law school.  You're going to be my law clerk."  So, so I go back to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and guess what?  I've got a job with a Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals judge.  And I kind of know what I want to be now.  I want to be a trial lawyer, and it was very funny.  Once I relaxed, law school became a piece of cake, so, you know, I remember, I remember, I've always been very competitive academically.  First year of law school was a problem for me.  But I was going to compete to be on law review [Harvard Law Review].  So, I was, you know, you could either get on by grades.  You could get on by writing called the writing--I mean, you know, writing under law review.  And I remember when I actually decided for the first time, I'm good.  I don't have to write on the law review.  I'm actually quite okay finishing up law school, going to clerk for this judge, and taking it from there.  And, and I don't need to kill myself. You know, I'll put in--I, I actually went from treating law school like a, you know, academic exercise, and I began to treat it like a job, you know, twelve hours a day, five or six days a week.  And then, one day, I'm going to, you know, play around and have fun, but I would clock my ten to twelve hours a day.  And whatever I could get done, you know, including, you know, classwork and study in that ten to twelve hours, I was all over it.  But when that was done, I stopped worrying about it.  I did great, you know, pretty well in, in law school, and it got easier for me, simply because I think I reframed the approach.  I felt I had somewhere to go.  I had, you know, a goal to get to, and that it wasn't uncertain, and plus it helped I, I met this girl [Arlene Ford Reynolds] in law school, too, so.
Story_ID: 670908
Speaker 1: So that's your second summer with the- with Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith], or is it--
Speaker 2: First.
Speaker 1: That is highly unusual.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I, now if he--
Speaker 1: I mean, that is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) if he, if he sees this videotape--
Speaker 1: --that's highly unusual.
Speaker 2: --he will be upset because, you know, I kind of learned later he wasn't supposed to give me that offer (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's highly unusual.
Speaker 2: But Judge Keith does not mess around with, with talent, particularly when it comes to students of color, law students of color.  If he can get them, he'll get them.
Speaker 1: That is so fabulous.
Speaker 2: And, and, yeah, and he--
Speaker 1: --'cause they're, he's highly, highly regarded--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --highly regarded.
Speaker 2: Oh, I consider him kind of like a third father.  You know, he, he had a tremendous influence on how I view, view, not viewed, view myself as a lawyer--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --and what I consider my obligations are as a lawyer.
Speaker 1: --so that summer, you worked with him.  I mean, you're--
Speaker 2: No, no, so the first year summer, I was at Dykema Gossett [Dykema Gossett PLLC]--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --and I worked with Kathleen Lewis [Kathleen McCree Lewis].  She introduced me to him.
Speaker 1: To him, so that's the first summer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then, the second summer--
Speaker 2: Second summer, I was at Hughes Hubbard and Reed [Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP] in--
Speaker 1: In New York [New York].
Speaker 2: --in New York City.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's where you end up, okay, but you got that, you have the job even before you interview with Hughes Hubbard and Reed, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Wait, no, Hughes Hubbard--wait a minute, hold on.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so--
Speaker 1: So, you come out to, you know, there, the people are even clerking differently these days, too.
Speaker 2: Well, just remember then, if you'd followed the traditional clerkship pattern, you knew at the end of your second year if you were going to clerk after your third.  I knew at the beginning of my second year that I was going to clerk after my third.  And I, you know, even though there was that rule that kind of said judges shouldn't poach early, Judge Keith, I, I know, believes that if he has a good student of color in his grasp, he's not letting them go.  So, there are so many Keith clerks who are doing interesting things.  We're kind of, like a club, a mafia some people have called us, and we all have one thing in common that we recognize.  There was our career before Judge Keith, and our career after learning from him.  So, I'm glad he did it but, no, by the time I went to Hughes Hubbard, you know, I made it clear.  If I, if I get that offer from Hughes Hubbard, you know, after my second year summer, that's what you wanted.  You wanted the offer for the second year summer in order to start third year after you graduate in the fall.  I said, "I'm, I'm clerking for a year, so your offer, if you make one to me, is post clerkship."
Story_ID: 670909
Speaker 1: Well, see, the other thing, I don't know, Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], when I was there, I mean, you, a lot of times if you were on law review [Harvard Law Review], it made it easier to get a clerkship.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause--so those were--now, what were you thinking at that point that you wanted to do?  You know, you, I know you said, I first wanted to do urban real estate, but once you got, and then you said--
Speaker 2: Municipal finance (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) then came along Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what are you, like that first summer, what kinds of things are you working on?  And then, what are you working on your second summer?
Speaker 2: So, the first summer, you know, Kathleen Lewis [Kathleen McCree Lewis] basically fed me most of my work.  So, she, she was primarily an appellate lawyer, so she taught me how to write briefs and analyze cases.  She also turned me over to the firm's litigators.  They had a product liability practice, so I worked on motions and things related to litigation.  I did very little transactional work.  So, that was my first year summer.  Second year summer, you know, Hughes Hubbard [Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP], like most New York [New York] law firms, large law firms, had a rotation program.  So, I remember going to the printer and working on deals.  And I also remember working on briefs, but by that time, I had pretty much decided I was going to be a litigator, if not a trial lawyer.  So, you know, I kept trying to impress, you know, the, the partners in the litigation group.  There was a class I took in my second year of law school, federal litigation, and I cannot remember the name of this professor, but he had a mock trial program that I had so much fun in.  I said, I kind of want to do this for my career, so I really focused on, on trial lawyering and litigation.
Speaker 1: He had a mock trial program that was--is, 'cause this is, I think they're changing them at the law school then.  So, he had that as a course? Or, or was--
Speaker 2: It was part of the course, so you would learn principles of federal litigation, you know, jurisdiction evidence, but you'd also go through an argument, and do mock trials as part of the class so--
Speaker 1: So, was this your second, was this your third year?
Speaker 2: Second year.
Speaker 1: Second year, okay, okay.  And how do you think the experience changed you at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Let me ask that, and what, what are you learning?  I mean, I know you--oh.
Story_ID: 670910
Speaker 1: What did you learn, and how did it change you and--
Speaker 2: One of the--you know, remember, I went to Kalamazoo College [Kalamazoo, Michigan], twelve black students, freshman year, maybe thirty by the end (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Time--
Speaker 2: --by the time I graduated.  But at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], there're like what, a hundred, like and maybe even a hundred in each class.  And so, it was great to be in a community of smart, black folk from around the country, from around the world, and just, you know, be in a group of people who were unapologetically smart, and intense, and motivated, and ambitious, but were still, 99 percent of them, you know, unapologetically black.  I mean, you, you, by that time, I was twenty, so I started law school when I was twenty, but most of my peers were twenty-three, twenty-four so, you know, most people had gone through whatever identity issues they had about who they were, they were coming out the tail end of them.  And so, it was really instructive to be around those people, and particularly, you know, some of the third years.  When you're a first year, some of these third years were just, just amazing people--the things they had done, the things they were planning to do, and so, it was really encouraging to be in that group.  Now, I mean, I don't mean to slight my white classmates either.  There were some wonderful people that I met there as well, smart, doing interesting things, and I guess what it did was it really expanded the sense of what was possible, which I think is one of the things that Harvard does best.  It sort of shows you things, or puts you into places, and the way Harvard does it is it's kind of assumed like, of course, you're going to do this.  Of course, you'd like this.  And, you know, this kid from working class Detroit [Michigan], you know, working in a big law firm, getting paid, you know, the going rate for a summer associate in New York [New York].  Well, of course, that's what Harvard second year law students do.  It was just, it was just a mind blowing experience, so I think that's principally how it affected me.  It gave me a sense of, of how wide, you know, the possibilities were.
Speaker 1: What courses did you take to, the most, though, during your time that you found memorable there?
Speaker 2: That federal litigation course.
Speaker 1: The federal litigation.
Speaker 2: There was also an urban, urban law course that I took.  I think Charles Hoss [sic. Charles M. Haar] was the professor.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: We studied the Massachusetts Bay clean up authority [Massachusetts Water Resources Authority] as a sort of interesting construct, and I remember that and, and enjoyed it.  Those were the two that I, I remember the most.
Speaker 1: So, there was never--then once you got on, sometimes I call it a conveyor belt, but once you got, there was no question about that this was meant for you, or was there, was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, first year, no, first year, I was--
Speaker 1: I mean, after first year, after first year?
Speaker 2: After first year, you know, I, when people tell me they had a great first year and it was a wonderful experience, I actually question their sanity 'cause I haven't met very many people who enjoyed first year.  But once I got through first year, you know, the, the--what Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] gave me was a gift of certainty and calm.  I, I was going to clerk for African American court of appeals judge.  I was, I was cool, I was great.  And then, again, once I relaxed, everything got easier, and I did better.  That was, that was the interesting part.
Story_ID: 670911
Speaker 1: So, now, when did you meet Arlene [Arlene Ford Reynolds]?
Speaker 2: I met Arlene in the fall of my third year [at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And she was a second year law student.
Speaker 1: So, okay, and how did you meet?
Speaker 2: You really want that story (laughter)?  How much time do you have?  Folks who know us have heard the story, but the short version--I'll try and make it short--is I remember sitting out in front of Langdell [Langdell Hall, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And this vision crosses my, my field of vision.  She's dressed in a white poncho blouse, white capri pants, and those Espadrilles with the little cork soles, white, and she's walking with this big grin on her face, swinging her arms, and by the time she got to the other edge of my field of vision, I was done.  And so, I began to kind of track her, you know, now that I knew that she existed 'cause I really didn't, had not seen her before.  I wondered how she had passed through without me seeing her.  And she was filling in for a classmate of hers as a receptionist at the law school library [Harvard Law School Library, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And the reception desk at the law school library at that time was a circular wooden desk.  So, if you can imagine, she's sitting inside the hole of the desk, unable to escape.  And I took it upon myself--and I was kind of shy--I took it upon myself, I'm going to ask this girl out to lunch, so I asked her out to lunch, and to my amazement, she accepted.  And so, we went out to One Potato Two Potato [Cambridge, Massachusetts] for lunch.  And now, you must remember, you know, I was and remain basically a nerd and so, I must have said or done something during that lunch.  And, actually, I know what it is, and Arlene knows what it is, my kids [Melissa Carr-Reynolds, Lovinia Reynolds and Austin Reynolds] know what it is, but I'm never putting this one on videotape.  I said something, or did something where she said, as she recounts it, "Either he's very, very confident, or he's an idiot," but either way, she--I couldn't find her for the rest of the semester.  And, and I was looking for her 'cause, you know, she was, she was and is fine as hell.  And I just thought, I really need to like see this girl, and, and woman by this time.  And, and, just before the Christmas holiday, you know, those tunnels underneath campus between where the copy center used to be, back when they had copy center and Harkness [Harkness Cafe].  It's winter.  Here she comes in the tunnel, and she has nowhere to go.  She's coming towards me, I'm coming towards her.  And I'm like, "Where have you been?"  You know, and like, I was putting notes in her mailbox, you know, trying, and somehow I wasn't getting a response.  And, "Where have you been?"  And, "Oh, you know, I've been around, too busy," and, and so, I asked her, "Well, what are you doing for the holiday?"  "Well, I'm going to see my dad [Clifton L. Ford]."  "Oh, great, I'm going to see my dad [Lee Reynolds, Jr.].  Where is your, where is your dad living?"  "He lives in New York [New York]."  "Oh, my dad lives in New York, too, what part of New York?"  "Well, my dad lives in Queens."  "Oh, my dad lives in Queens, what part of Queens?"  "Oh, you may not have heard of it.  It's this neighborhood, neighborhood called Holliswood [Queens, New York]." Like, "My dad lives in Holliswood.  What street, what street does your dad live on?"  "He lives on Palermo Street," at which point I lived on Palo Alto Street, which when you Google it, is literally around the block from her dad.  So, in this neighborhood, where there were so few black families, there were two black families in that neighborhood--my father and my step-mother [Bess Reynolds], and around the block, her dad.  And a part of me kind of said, brother, if you can't pull this one off, you might as well just hand in your card, you know, and, and call it a day.  So, I asked her out, had our first date Christmas Eve, and I told her I would marry her by, by January 10 or so, I told her, "I'm marrying you."  And all she said in response was, "You're not supposed to say that."  She didn't say, no, but she just said, "You're not supposed to say that so early."  And that's how I met my wife.
Speaker 1: It's a lovely story.  That's lovely.
Story_ID: 670912
Speaker 1: You meet her in your third year [at Harvard Law school, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and she's two- she's a 2L?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, you then get this job, so you're going to Hughes Hubbard [Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP], right?
Speaker 2: No, I'm going to my clerkship.
Speaker 1: Clerkship, oh, that's right, sorry.  That's right.  You have the clerkship, first and you're, okay, so, you go to Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: She's in her third year.
Speaker 1: And she's in her third year?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And so, she finishes, and you have a one--is it a one year clerkship?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] wanted me to stay for two years, but by that time, Arlene [Arlene Ford Reynolds] had made it clear that while she liked Detroit, I would only be getting, you know, short visits because she was a girl from Jamaica, and could not appreciate that cold Detroit winter.
Speaker 1: I see.  So, in that year with Judge Keith, can you talk about that--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and how he worked with his--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --his, you know, his clerks and--
Speaker 2: It would, yes.
Speaker 1: --how many, would he have two?
Speaker 2: Yes, so there were three law clerks.
Speaker 1: Three law clerks.
Speaker 2: I was the, I was the one year law clerk.  There was another clerk, who was on the third, the second of his two years, and another clerk who was on the first of his two years.  So, the senior clerk was Gailon McGowen, who's now a judge in Wayne County [Michigan] in Detroit, amazing lawyer, and a wonderful man.  My other co-clerk was--let me go back--what name did I mention?  It was actually--
Speaker 1: McGowan.
Speaker 2: --Gailon McGowen.  They're going to kill me, so you have to edit the part of this thing.  So, Galen McGowan was the junior clerk.  He's a BMW dealer now in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Ed Ewell [Edward Ewell, Jr.] is the, is the judge, both amazing brothers, and they were my clerks.  And, basically, Judge Keith--
Speaker 1: Wait, there were three black clerks?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Males, wow, that's very special.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, the judge basically ran a, a postgraduate course on how to be a black male professional, and he was rough on us.  He insisted on absolute excellence in everything we did as a law clerk, but he also taught every one of us some basic principles about how to deal with people.  One of his favorite sayings, which I remember, and he still uses, is do not mistake my kindness for weakness.  So, he was always kind to people, you know, he, he rarely got angry, rarely raised his voice, but he conveyed power and integrity and authority through his personality, and how, how he just carried himself.  But, but don't think that you could roll him over.  He would make sure you understood that just because he was kind did not mean that, that you could take advantage of him.  He gave us actually the gift of self confidence.  He was always affirming, you know, even when he criticized our work, it was always, you know, never, like you're dumb or you can't do it, but, you know, this is great, but here's, here's how I want you to focus, and do it better, so that by the time I got to a law firm, where, you know, the purpose of a partner with a junior associate, I think, in particular, a black junior associate, is to really, you know, look at your writing, and tell you how bad your writing is.  And, and I, I, got criticized for my writing, but I actually didn't take it to heart. A, because I knew it was the job of the partner to criticize the associate for the writing, but, second, I knew I was a good writer.  Judge Keith told me.  You know, I helped write, you know, parts of the opinions that he offered.  So, no one could tell me that I couldn't write.  And so, all the harsh criticism that, you know, associates would typically get from senior associates and partners, you know, I, I sifted through the, the rhetoric, and tried to get, you know, what were they really criticizing me for, but it certainly can't be because, you know, I'm an inferior writer.  I clerked for Judge Keith.  I know how to write.
Story_ID: 670913
Speaker 1: So, when you went to Hughes Hubbard [Hughes Hubbard and reed LLP] in 1987--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, wait, can I ask one more, one more thing about Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you're, you're in control.
Speaker 1: No, I, where was he in his career, and what were the kinds of cases that you were exposed to, coming before him, and, you know, the appellate court is also, you know, where appeals are, you know, come in?
Speaker 2: Sure.  He was kind of, he had already been on the appellate court for, I'd say ten years.  And before that, he was a Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], he was a Johnson appointee to the district court [United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan], and a Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] appointee to the appellate court [United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit].  He actually took Wade McCree's seat when Wade McCree [Wade H. McCree] became solicitor general, I believe, under I want to say under Carter, but I'm not sure.  So, so, I, I got the full gambit.  I got the habeas, habeas petitions.  There were a couple of employment discrimination cases, social security cases.  I mean, you know, many of the cases that come in front of any court of appeals are actually pretty mundane.  I, I don't remember the specifics.  I had some pretty exciting cases, a voting rights case. But really, the most significant thing I worked on for Judge Keith, he was chair of the judicial Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.  And so, he was in charge of a committee of a group of judges that were, that were supposed to get together, and help create the celebration for that bicentennial, which was 1987, I believe, that year.  And he made me his chief of staff on that, on that committee, so I had to coordinate all the meetings.  I had to write his speeches.  I had to put together the agenda.  I had to keep contact with the committee members, and I basically learned to function as his aide, even apart from the, the clerkship.  That was a large part of my function.  And one of the most significant things we did is--I'm sorry--he did, was if you go to any courthouse in the U.S., you'll probably see a plaque on the exterior of the courthouse that has the U.S. Bill of Rights, and Judge Keith's name on it.  And that's the legacy, one of the legacies of that commission.  And I worked on that for my, for my year.  It taught me how to write fast because when you're drafting a speech that has to be given the next day, you know, you need to write fast.  Taught me a whole lot.
Speaker 1: And so, you--I, that's, that's--do you think he often had that many black male clerks at one time?  That seems very, that seems like the luck of a draw, sort of.
Speaker 2: You know, he, he probably throughout his years pulling clerks, and even now, if you went to his chambers, you would see at least two clerks of color, but, but he was always about making sure that, you know, the populations that were underrepresented in the legal profession, that he would, he would get the best of them to become his law clerks.  And African American men and women, Latino men and women, you know, he would have white clerks as well, but he made it clear that what he wanted to do was make sure that he found the best talented law students of color to become his law clerks, and he was unapologetic about it.
Story_ID: 670914
Speaker 1: So, when you, when you go on to Hughes Hubbard [Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP], tell me about, because you had said that you really wanted to be a litigator.  You, you--so tell me about the firm that you come into and, and even learning how to be in a firm because it's not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's not, and you actually made partner in the firm (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, not that firm, but a different firm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not, not, but an active member of another firm.
Speaker 2: Well, so --
Speaker 1: And then, so you and Arlene [Arlene Ford Reynolds] come, you come to New York [New York] together, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she, by that time, she had graduated from, from law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and was working on Wall Street [New York, New York] for a Wall Street firm.  I was working at Hughes Hubbard, a Wall Street firm.
Speaker 1: What firm was she in?
Speaker 2: Stroock and Stroock and Lavan [Strook and Strook and Lavan LLP].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, she went from there to Weil, Gotshal [Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP], which was Midtown [New York, New York], but for the period of time when she was at Stroock, you know, just imagine, we would work from ten o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the morning, go grab dinner at the all night cafe, you know, that was downtown, and then, you know, go home, and then, repeat.  And I think the thing I, I was experiencing at the law firm was the typical law firm hazing, you know, a ton of work, a lot of criticism, a lot of red ink on my, on my emotions.  But one of the things that, that I got into was there was an aviation liability practice in the firm at the time, and I got assigned to that practice.  And at the time, the, the, one of the clients of that practice was the national airline of the Dominican Republic, Air Dominicana.  And Air Dominicana could lose some luggage, let me tell you.  The Dominican immigrants flying home from New York would put their furniture on the plane and, you know, moving whole households, and that furniture would get lost or their bags would, would get lost.  And it was my job to go into civil court, Bronx [New York], and Brooklyn [New York] and, and Queens [New York], and Manhattan [New York] civil court, and litigate lost baggage cases for Air Dominicana.  And, and actually persuade these, these civil court judges, you know, their jurisdiction stops at about ten thousand, that they had to be held to the Warsaw Convention, which limited liability of international carriers for luggage to a particular level.  I think it was the Warsaw Convention.  And so, even early on, at, at Hughes Hubbard, I had the experience of standing up in front of court.  Now, for little stuff but, you know, you've got to actually experience being in court speaking to judges.  And sometimes, I went to night court.  I had to represent the airline, and just get comfortable with being in a courtroom setting, standing up in front of a hostile judge, and saying, you know, "Judge, I know you want to award, you know, this plaintiff, you know, what they say is the value of their luggage, but actually under this international treaty, you're capped at ten thousand dollars, your Honor."  And (laughter), and that was fun.  It was a great learning experience, and it was actually viewed within the firm as sort of, you know, well, that's not, that's not a prestigious assignment.  You should be working on the XYZ class action, you know, as sort of the document clerk.  I did that, too, but when this opportunity came along, you know, I was, I raised my hand for it.  People were shocked, like why would you be the, the associate working on this little client?  And the reason was, it got me into court.  And it was my client, my--no one had the time, and the client couldn't afford the, the fees for a partner's time.  This was what I did, so I learned how to be responsible for a client, and what that meant.  And that was one great experience out of Hughes Hubbard.
Story_ID: 670915
Speaker 1: Now, who was, who else was at black--what, who was also there, was black at Hughes Hubbard [Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP]?
Speaker 2: Renee Chenault [Renee Chenault-Fattah], Renee Chenault, the now, I think she's still an anchor woman at a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] TV station [WCAU-TV].  She started off as a lawyer at Hughes Hubbard.  Now, she wasn't there when I was there, but they surely mentioned her name every chance they could.  Amalya Kearse [Amalya Lyle Kearse], judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit [United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause she had been there, right?
Speaker 2: She had been there.  Those were, those were two that I remember the most.  Burlette Carter [W. Burlette Carter], Burlette Carter is a professor at George Washington University [Washington, D.C.], a wonderful legal scholar, particularly as it relates to African American history. She's a, she was a, she was a Hughes Hubbard and Reed associate when I was there.
Speaker 1: But so when, oh, she was an associate, so both of you were associates together?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Well, she was, she was more senior.
Speaker 1: So, she, so how--that's what I'm trying to understand.  How large is Hughes Hubbard when you're working there?
Speaker 2: Oh, my.
Speaker 1: --'cause this is the--
Speaker 2: This is 1987.
Speaker 1: --seven [1987].
Speaker 2: I think they were in, like the three hundred, two to three hundred.  They were definitely below five hundred.  Weil, Gotshal [Wiel, Gotshal and Manges LLP] was about five hundred, and that was huge at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  You know, I had actually clerked at Weil Gotshal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during one of my summers, but so when I saw that about your wife [Arlene Ford Reynolds], you know, going to be--but this, those are large firms at that point in time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then, they're not in, like now, they're in the thousands--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but that was, that was a large firm.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, but you, Hughes Hubbard was also known as what we call a silk stocking?
Speaker 2: White shoe.
Speaker 1: White shoe, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, firm, and--
Speaker 2: Well, yes--
Speaker 1: And, culturally, also, you know, can you talk about it culturally 'cause I would say even it's very, let's see, patrician, or very Anglo, sort of, no (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what, Hughes Hubbard was not--
Speaker 1: It wasn't?
Speaker 2: --Hughes Hubbard was not like White and Case [White and Case LLP] or those other firms.
Speaker 1: It wasn't.
Speaker 2: It, it had an interesting mixture of WASPs [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant], Jewish partners--
Speaker 1: I see.  I wonder why I thought--
Speaker 2: --you know, Irish American partners.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, by the, by the time I got there, it, it was, I think it had the reputation, sort of a mixed reputation of being both very patrician, but also with what New Yorkers, at, at that time, would call strivers, people who weren't born into money, but were very good lawyers.  Yet and still, you know, I remember the, the firm outings at that time were at country clubs where, you know, blacks were not admitted.  And the black associates, you know, threw a fit one year where we finally got them off of that, but it was, you know, still at the time where if you were a partner of a certain age and stage, you could leave midway through the day of a given week and go play golf.  You know, nobody does that anymore, at least not in New York [New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: So, they were, they were part of, that, you know, sort of cultural context, but they weren't, they weren't like, you know, the, the firms where, for example, you couldn't make partner, because you were Jewish.  We had Jewish partners.
Story_ID: 670916
Speaker 1: Now you were there until what year then?
Speaker 2: Until 1989.
Speaker 1: So, oh, okay, so, that's the year you got married, too, right?
Speaker 2: That's the year I got married [to Arlene Ford Reynolds].
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So, two years and you're out.  You're like--it, all right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, where, what are you thinking, well, where are you--
Speaker 2: I went to the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York].
Speaker 1: You went in, that's right, because you said you wanted to get, you want--no, someone recommended that for you, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, no, this, so I was at, at Hughes Hubbard [Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP].  And in the context of that law firm, I guess I was progressing because I had been offered my next assignment within the firm, which was to be the chief document person for a lead paint class action.  And this was going to my, my plum assignment, and my future, and my pathway to partnership at Hughes Hubbard.  At the same time, one of my father's [Lee Reynolds, Jr.] friends, a brother by the name of Dwight Greene [Dwight L. Greene], who was at a time, a law professor at Hofstra [Hofstra University, Hempstead, New York], and a former federal prosecutor, took me aside and told me about the U.S. attorney's office.  I didn't even know what the U.S. attorney's office was.  And he said, "You really should get actual trial experience because once you get trial experience, which you can get at the U.S. attorney's office, then no one can take that away, and you have actually a marketable skill, but you're not going to learn how to be a trial lawyer at a big law firm."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: "You've got to, you've got to go to a prosecutor's office to do it."  And he, you know, took me in hand, and sponsored my application to become a federal prosecutor.  And that worked, it worked.  I left the firm in '89 [1989] to become an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York.  At the time, Rudy Giuliani had just left.  It was his interim successor, Benito Romano, and then after Benito was interim, the, the actual U.S. attorney under which I spent half my time, was Otto Obermaier [Otto G. Obermaier], and then he was succeeded by Mary Jo White.
Speaker 1: Now, what are you learning in that?  So, you know, the one thing, Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], I'd like, I'd like you to say.  I mean, this, the case that you were going to be assigned to at, you know, the document production.  That often people would work at those firms and they would, one case would be--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) all that they were doing for years even.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then, and then, you know, the--
Speaker 1: And so, then, if you want to make a lateral, you might, it might be difficult.
Speaker 2: Well, not only would it be difficult but, but as, as, you know, by this time, the law was changing.  Law firm practice was changing.  And I could already see that unless I had a marketable skill, I would come out at the, you know--the best thing I could hope for was that this case was so big that I would make partner on the basis of being the document guy for this lead paint class action.  But in doing so, I would be always subject to the control of the partner who actually had the case.  And I would never be sort of an independent partner.  And I knew, even in 1989, that if you were going to be in a law firm, you had to have your own book of business.  And that was preferable to being a service partner, not that being a service partner was bad, but it was far better in the law firm ecosystem to be a partner with a book of business, which I would not have if I just focused on document production for, you know, a lead paint class action.
Speaker 1: That's, now, when you, you're getting married, but you also, in going to U.S. attorney's office, you're making less money, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, fortunately, I was marrying a mergers and acquisition lawyer at Weil, Gotshal [Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP], so, I married up.
Story_ID: 670917
Speaker 1: Now, talk about the office you come into, though.  I mean, at that point, because Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani], you said had just left (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: And so, what shape was it in, and where, did they have a way of putting new attorneys into rotation or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, the office was in pretty good shape.  I mean, Giuliani had left and, you know, his reputation was as a very tough prosecutor.  So, the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York] reputation was, was at a high point.  The--so the office had a high reputation.  At the time when I went in, I went into the office at the same time as Jim Johnson [James E. Johnson], again, my friend and brother, who I started law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with.  When I arrived there, Jeh Johnson was already there, who's, who's a former secretary of homeland security.  Bill Pollard [William B. Pollard III], a wonderful mentor and, and a senior African American prosecutor.  So these, these people were, were already, already there, or arrived around the same time I did.  You know, the environment was a very New York [New York] environment.  I mean, you know, you, you had agents, federal agents and New York City [New York, New York] police officers.  And it was a colorful environment, you know, sometimes people act consistent with stereotype, and there were a lot of, you know, pretty aggressive and fun to be around agents and prosecutors at that time.  We, meaning the new guys, got put into what's called the general crimes unit, so we would handle, you know, simple cases, but we learned on those cases.  And usually the way you got taught was you're sitting at your desk, and then, a senior assistant walks in and drops a redweld on your desk, and says, "You have to be in court in the next twenty minutes to do this sentencing, good luck."  And off you go.  So, you had to learn how to do for self, right, and you, how to adapt.  Sink or swim, I mean you got some support and training, but there was really on the job training.  And that was a great way to learn, and it was fun.  It was, it was always fun, always exciting, tough, but, but exciting.
Speaker 1: Now, those are the beginning Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] years, too, right, is it, or yeah?
Speaker 2: Yes, so--
Speaker 1: Papa Bush, I mean.
Speaker 2: --yes, so Dick Thornburgh was the attorney general that signed my certificate.  So, that was Bush I, that's right.
Story_ID: 670918
Speaker 1: What are the things that you did there that you were, are proud of during that time 'cause you talk about, you know, being thrown into things [at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But is there a system of training and bringing people through other--or are you expected to--
Speaker 2: Well, there, there is a system.  The system's called your general crimes stint, and that usually lasts about a year.  Now, you can get accelerated if you demonstrate, you know, strong acumen, and get put into one of the more advanced units like narcotics, or major crimes, or public corruption, or securities.  Those are the units at the time.  And so, that's how you, you progress.  You did a stint in general crimes.  You might wind up in narcotics 'cause there are always narcotics cases, and then move to public corruption or, you know, securities or, or major crimes.  What, what was I proud of?  I was, I was proud of the fact that I worked on a few gun and drug cases, where in both instances, there were some very dangerous people.  There was a drug gang that was running out of Harlem [New York, New York] that was carrying around what were called street sweeper guns, basically these shotguns that had a rotating case, so that you would pull the trigger, spray the street with shotgun pellets, and instead of chalking it to reload it, you just press the trigger again 'cause the, the stock had rotated.  It's sort of like a machine gun shotgun, and that was the least of the issue.  They had uzis.  They, they basically held entire blocks of a particular neighborhood in Harlem in thrall.  And I was part of the team that, that prosecuted that group.
Speaker 1: What was the group? The group, what was the group?
Speaker 2: Thy didn't really have a name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A name?
Speaker 2: --but the, it, they didn't really have a name.  I know the name of the defendant.  I don't want to call it--
Speaker 1: Okay, sure, sure.
Speaker 2: --but it was, it was a significant case for that neighborhood.  And I felt in prosecuting the case with my co-counsel that I was defending that neighborhood.  The other thing I was proud of was I was able to, I think, demonstrate, or hold for the principal, that, you know, black people could be on juries and listen to evidence, and actually convict black defendants if they felt that there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  So, there was a view, not everybody held it, but there was a view at the time that you didn't want black people on your juries because they would not believe the police, and they would, they would strive to acquit.  My view was the job of a good advocate, including the prosecutor, was to take your juror as you found him or her and, you know, often black folk did not have good experiences with the police.  But that doesn't mean that they could not look at evidence, and reach a conclusion that somebody maybe that lived in their neighborhood, or the neighborhood where their mom or dad lived, was running drugs out of the apartment next door and, therefore, making their environment safe.  And the one thing I would, I would say to, you know, some of my white colleagues is, you know, you don't, you don't have to talk down to, you know, a black juror because if you show a sister or a brother, you know, the right evidence, that someone in their neighborhood is running drugs or guns, you will not have a stronger advocate for conviction 'cause we don't play that, you know.  If you victimized people in your own neighborhood, you know, somebody's daughter or son got shot or injured by your gang, and you prove that to that postal worker on the jury, let me assure you, you'll get a conviction.  And it was, it was interesting how difficult it was for, you know, some of the, particularly white prosecutors to accept that, that we actually had a stake in the system as jurors, and that we wanted our communities to be safe as well.  But you, you can't talk down to us.  You can't make broad assumptions about us 'cause we pick that up, and we punish you for it.  I mean, and, and so, what I was most proud of was I felt I could talk to anybody on the jury and, and do it in a very credible way, not trying to sell them something, but just be, be authentic and not, not try and, you know, assume that they wanted to hear this, or they wanted to hear that.
Speaker 1: So, what was your caseload like though during that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, it was, I, I don't know, many, many cases.  I mean, it was, it was--I always thought it was huge.  You know, the first couple of years, it was more trials and court proceedings, and then the last, I guess, half or a third, it was more investigative work--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --in the public corruption unit.
Speaker 1: That's fun.
Speaker 2: That was fun.
Speaker 1: And so, that, that can be fun.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it actually talked me out of politics.  I used to think I would, I would want to have a political career, but being a public corruption prosecutor changed my mind (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 670919
Speaker 1: So when you--why do you decide that you want to go back into private practice?  And what happens?  And is that the typical time 'cause it was about five years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you make a three year commitment when--at the time you were making a three year commitment, when you were in the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York].  And then you, then you can leave without--
Speaker 1: Re-up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) without feeling like you cheated them or something.  So, I was there for five years, and I think the primary reason why I decided I needed to find a job in the private sector was because my wife [Arlene Ford Reynolds] told me that she was pregnant with our first child [Lovinia Reynolds].  And, you know, I, I had been gladly, happily living off the revenue stream that my wife provided by being at Weil, Gotshal [Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP], now senior associate in the M and A group [mergers and acquisitions].  She, she was doing great.  I think they wanted her to try for partner, but, you know, when she said that we were having our first child, I knew I had to give her the option if she wanted to stay home with our kid so, and plus I knew I couldn't be in the U.S. attorney's office forever without advancing, and I didn't see a pathway to advancing.  Most of the people in senior positions had a pretty good grip on them.  So, I decided, okay, now I need to leave the office, and the only place I thought I could go was back into private practice.
Speaker 1: And so, how did you end up choosing Morgan, Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP] and--
Speaker 2: That's another story--you have time for it?  So, I'm interviewing at various white collar law firms.  I won't name them, but a couple of white collar law firms.  Went back also to Hughes Hubbard and Reed [Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP].  I don't think they had room for me in their partnership because one of the things I was asking for was a track to partnership.  And so, I'm looking for a job.  I'm pounding the pavement.  I'm interviewing with this white collar group.  I'm interviewing with that white collar group.  Now comes Christmas of 1993 and, you know, I'm sort of in this interview process.  I go find my wife a gift for Christmas at Barneys New York downtown store.  It's actually a particular kind of Swiss lingerie called Hanro and I wanted to find her a, a nightgown.  She's going to kill me with all this detail, a nightgown by Hanro, and, and the only place that sold it was Barneys department store downtown.  So, imagine, it's Christmas Eve, 5:30, the store is about to close.  I am rushing to the cashier with my purchase.  There's this other guy in the store, older guy, holding something also, rushing to the cashier.  And he gives me a New York [New York] hip check, basically pushes me out of the way, very New York style, so he can get to the cashier first before the cashier closes, you know, he wants to get to that cashier first.  I was so mad that I decided to do the thing that New Yorkers hate the most, which is start talking to him.  You know, if you live in a bubble when you're in New York, don't talk to me, so the way you get back at him is I talked to this guy.  "Oh," you know, "that's a very nice piece of lingerie, kind of looks like it's more for your taste than it is for your wife."  I mean, I, I went at him.  Instead of, you know, growling at me, this guy turns around and starts laughing, and we start talking.  And his name is George Stohner [George A. Stohner].  He's a labor and employment partner at Morgan, Lewis. And we start talking and he asked, what do I do?  "I'm a lawyer."  "Oh, where are you a lawyer?"  "I'm the federal prosecutor."  "Oh, let's exchange cards, let's have lunch sometime."  So, I forget about it, you know, nice interaction.  I got my Christmas present.  He got, you know, his wife's Christmas present.  Sometime around January, February, I get this call.  It's George Stohner.  "Why don't you come to my--come up, and we'll have lunch."  So, I'm thinking, here I am, you know, young government worker.  I think I'm going to get a wonderful lunch by some high end partner at some ritzy restaurant.  I wind up in the Morgan Lewis conference room.  George Stohner brings in sandwiches, and basically, while we're eating, everybody in his practice group comes through, shakes my hand, gives me the onc -over.  And I realize by about the third out of the tenth people, ten people who come through, I'm being interviewed, I'm being interviewed.  And to compress all that, he basically persuades me that I should not do white collar.  I should come to employment litigation where my trial experience could be very useful because now employment civil rights trials are all tried by jury.  And he lays out a pathway where he thinks I can be successful.  And that's how I owe my Morgan, Lewis career to the lingerie department in Barneys department store.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty wonderful story.  So, what, what, how large is Morgan, Lewis when you joined them?
Speaker 2: The New York office around that time was two hundred, but I think they were probably close to seven hundred or eight hundred by that time.
Speaker 1: See, firms are starting--they changed in that period of time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, they did.
Speaker 1: They're starting to grow and there's mergers and--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --things happening.
Story_ID: 670920
Speaker 1: Did you--now how long did it take you to, how long did it take you to make partner [at Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP]?
Speaker 2: The, the joke always was: far longer than I wanted. But I had joined in 1994, and I made partner four years later in 1998.
Speaker 1: And did they have two tier partnership that--
Speaker 2: At the time, no.
Speaker 1: They didn't, so once you made partner, you made partner?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Was that, was that the making of partner complicated in, in some respects?  I mean, people, this, it's a hard process, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it's a hard process.  I always felt that, I felt at the time that they should have made me partner within a year of my arrival, and if not a year, then two years.  I mean, nobody, I don't think you ever meet a partner at a law firm who felt that they made partner right on time.  You know, most people felt they were delayed.  But, you know, it, it actually worked out.  You know, God has a plan in the following way.  By the time I made partner, I had two significant clients, two national clients.  I'd, I'd brought them on as a senior associate.  I, I got put on TV to talk about harassment prevention in the workplace on 'Dateline' so the, at the partner meeting where they were announcing where they were considering who would they consider for partner at the following quarter's meeting, the night of that partners' meeting, they had TVs on to watch my interview as a senior associate on 'Dateline NBC.'  So what, what I later learned was, you know, making partner at a law firm is tough, no doubt, but I had already had a book of business, and I had national media exposure, and it was--my partners tell me not really much of a tough decision.  There were, there were not too many senior associates at that stage who, who had a book of business--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --and I was blessed to have that, even before I made partner.
Speaker 1: So, how did you develop that book of business?
Speaker 2: I got out there.  I, I did a lot of speaking at conferences, and someone would come up to me and say, "That's a great presentation, or I have a question."  I would collect their card and I would, I would hound them.  I was famous for telling people, you know, if they were in Seattle [Washington], "Oh, I'm coming out to Seattle next week, just happened to be in Seattle.  Can I grab you for coffee?"  "Oh, sure, you know, what's coffee?"  Now, I was actually flying all the way to Seattle from New York [New York] to go to coffee with you.  I did not have a preexisting appointment in Seattle, but I wanted just to make it so easy for you to say yes to me 'cause I figured if I could get you in a face-to-face conversation, at worst, I would learn more about what your needs were, and then I could try and develop my pitch.  At best, maybe I could get you as a, as a client.  So, you know, I started doing that, and I was actually encouraged by George Stohner [George A. Stohner] and others at Morgan, Lewis to do it.  They didn't really stand in my way.  They encouraged me, and I was able to persuade a number of people to hire me.  And, and only later, did I realize what a big chance those clients were taking on an associate, particularly an African American associate, to, to give them, you know, huge hunks of business.  And I've always remembered that it was their generosity and forward thinking that allowed me to succeed, and I've tried to replicate that.
Story_ID: 670921
Speaker 1: Now, was there another black partner at the time that you were there, 'cause--
Speaker 2: There were several, but not in New York [New York], so I was the first black partner in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Grace Speights [Grace E. Speights]--
Speaker 1: Grace.
Speaker 2: --who is the, the firm's chief lawyer in the Washington [D.C.] office, she was a partner there at the time.  And there was a brother who was a former U.S. attorney in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I cannot recall his name unfortunately, but he was a partner in--
Speaker 1: And then, there had been, do you know James Potter [HistoryMaker James G. Potter]?  He's a HLS [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] grad.  I think he had worked there earlier before you.  He's older (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) May have.  Yes, he, he, yes, so I met him because--was he not the general counsel at Heinz [H.J. Heinz Company]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I met him--
Speaker 1: No, Del- Del Monte [Del Monte Foods, Inc.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Del Monica--
Speaker 1: Del Monte.
Speaker 2: --Del Monte, yeah, I met him eventually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He also took a chance on me when I was a partner and hired me for some work and, and made it clear to me that he viewed it as his obligation, to provide opportunities to lawyers of color.  Again, something I've tried to replicate.
Speaker 1: Perfect.  And then, now do you know Ken Standard [HistoryMaker Kenneth Standard]? He--
Speaker 2: I sure do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I sure do.  And he was, he actually arrived at Morgan, Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP] after I made partner.
Speaker 1: After you made--
Speaker 2: And he was, I forget he, what law firm, whether he was at a law firm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He, I forget where he was before.
Speaker 2: Right.  No, he was at, he was actually at a company and he--
Speaker 1: A company, maybe even a bank or, right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, in-house, yeah, and he came on board as an employment lawyer.  And then, did well with us, but after a while, left, and went with Epstein Becker and Green [Epstein Becker and Green, P.C.].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: But, but even though he came after me, he was a really good mentor, and someone I could talk to and bounce stuff off of 'cause, honestly, everything I was doing, he had done, you know, and he could always point me in the right direction or, you know, shift my attention, or tell me to calm down or, you know, he, he was a great mentor.
Speaker 1: You know, that is, I, you know, I want to say about your career, Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds], is that you appear to have been blessed with some good, you know, good mentors.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm not saying, it's been all rosy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, I'm not but, but it appears that because a lot--
Speaker 2: No, there's no question, no question.  I mean, I can, I can point to a whole bunch of people who took chances on me when they didn't have to.  You know, Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith], Professor Dwight Greene [Dwight L. Green], George Stohner [George A. Stohner], Ken Standard [HistoryMaker Kenneth Standard], a number of folks and clients who, who were--Jocelyn Hunter at Home Depot [The Home Depot, Inc.], lead employment lawyer at Home Depot, took a chance on me, hired me as one of their regional lawyers, didn't have to do it.  You know, I'm, I'm forever in her debt.  Debra Hunter Johnson, lead employment lawyer at American Airlines [American Airlines Inc.], took a chance on me, didn't have to.  I became one of their regional lawyers.  Judy Kester [ph.], employment lawyer at an investment banking house, took a liking to me, kind of felt, felt she could work with me.  I really surprised my partners when I walked in with an investment bank as a client.  So, you know, the, oh, gosh, the general counsel of Neiman Marcus [Neiman Marcus Group], I did a employment, a couple of employment matters for him, and then Neiman Marcus decided to go private, and get bought out by a private equity firm.  He asked me to walk that transaction in, to the firm's transaction practice.  And, and I brought in, you know, a transactional matter, huge transactional matter to the firm because he took a chance on me.  And, and he was a believer in, you know, making the careers of diverse attorneys and, you know, not all of these are African Americans, right?  So, it really spanned the gambit and, and you're right, each, each point in my career where I, where I advanced, I can always identify someone who did not have to take a chance on me, but did.
Story_ID: 670922
Speaker 1: But you obviously were performing, and not everyone can get books of business.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that's black or white.  It doesn't matter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's not--lawyers sometimes are not suited--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --personality wise.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But so, what made you suited?  That's what I want to understand.
Speaker 2: I liked, I liked the thrill of the chase.  And I really enjoyed persuading people to do something that they might not otherwise do.  That went from getting a verdict in a jury trial to persuading you to give me your work, and pay me money for it (laughter).  So I, I really enjoy the sales aspect of the legal practice.  I thought it was fun, and sometimes I thought it was more fun than the actual legal practice.  And, and what I find is in law firms, where you meet people like that, they actually tend to be the better business developers because they know they can get the legal work done by their colleagues, but the skill of relating to people and persuading them that, you know, your expensive service is worth buying.  That's a, that's a skill, a distinct skill, especially these days.
Speaker 1: And did you find that--'cause in some firms, those are called rainmakers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But did you find that there was a, you know, that people were competing with you also, like people talk about, that it's, can be a dog eat dog world--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --within a law firm environment and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I guess I was fortunate because I was in a group, the labor employment group, where there was a, there was a view that we all had to work together, and that we should not compete with each other.  Were there instances where someone would say, well, you know, "I, I deserve origination on that client, and you shouldn't get it?"  Yes.  And most of the time, when the partner was senior to me, and the rare times that happened, you know, I was fine with it because I knew that the, you know, the all important compensation committee of the firm actually was aware of what my role was, and I would get fairly compensated.  That's what I thought, and I didn't want to waste my time battling a senior partner.  I would lose that battle.  So, instead of fighting over that, I would go and get another client and, you know, just divert my time and energy elsewhere.  I didn't really feel, particularly with the labor and employment group, that I was in competition with anybody.  I felt I was part of an enterprise and, and that was a credit to Morgan, Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP] for creating a mindset that this was a business, and you were part of an overall enterprise, and whatever someone else did worked to your benefit.  Whatever I did worked to your benefit.  So, and that was the meeting of the partnership, so why compete?  We're all going to benefit.
Speaker 1: That, okay, just no comment about--except law was changing into, the law firm was starting to learn to operate--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a business.
Speaker 2: Yes. And, and I think, you know, the thing about labor and employment practice--and this is probably way too much detail--but it's always on the verge of being a commodity practice.  So, you had to have a clear sense of what your, what your business model was, you know, at what point would you be profitable?  At what point would you not be profitable?  That what, what volumes of work could account for perhaps work that was otherwise marginal in order to support the, the sort of baseline expenses and overhead for the practice.  So, if you were working in Morgan Lewis's labor and employment practice, you knew these numbers, you knew the break points, and you had to, you had to think like a business, and not think like a solo practitioner.
Speaker 1: I remember, she's dead now, but Cheryl, Cheryl Albright [sic. Cheryl Blackwell Bryson], she was in employment, and she talked about that, the, the book of business.
Story_ID: 670923
Speaker 1: So why do you go in-house?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's--I mean, how does that happen because that, you spend, let's see, 1994 to 2004 so, really, thirteen, thirteen years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, thirteen years.  Why go in-house?  You know, Morgan, Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP], at that time, was and remains a great firm.  I looked at the lives of folks who were sort of ahead of me in the, in the queue, right, who were more senior, who were advancing in the firm--
Speaker 1: At the firm.
Speaker 2: --at the firm.  And while they were great lawyers and great people, I did not think I could maintain a successful family life, knowing the amount of sacrifice that was required to be successful, ever more successful in that law firm.  And that was not any to Morgan Lewis.  I think if you talked to any partner in any big law firm, they will always talk to you about the sacrifice, you know, the work life balance that really isn't a balance.  And, you know, by that time, I had not just one kid, but three kids.
Speaker 1: So, you had--
Speaker 2: I had Austin [Austin Reynolds].  I had Lovinia [Lovinia Reynolds], and Austin, and then Melissa [Melissa Carr-Reynolds], who we adopted as our daughter.  And, you know, I wasn't spending as much time as I should have at home.  I was doing trials and arbitrations and, you know, becoming so absorbed in doing trials and arbitrations.  I was developing business, and I was working on the firm management committees.  And I just got to a point where I felt I couldn't do justice to all of that, and be a good husband and father.  And so, I tried to, essentially, I began looking for a way to break that paradigm, so I could try and readjust my life to spend, you know, more time with my family.  At that time, Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] was a client and I had, through a former Morgan Lewis partner, who is even now, a Toyota lawyer, you know, she had retained me to be Toyota's outside counsel.  And through a couple of matters, I got to know the company very well.  They asked to come in-house once, and I turned them down because I did not want to move from New York [New York] to Los Angeles [California], and neither, certainly, did my wife [Arlene Ford Reynolds].  Then I got a few more management roles at my law firm.  And they asked, Toyota asked me again about a year or so later, and by that time, I'd kind of figured out, I need to, I need to make a transition if I wanted to have the ability to balance my work with the rest of my life.  And so, then they asked me the second time, I persuaded my wife that we could move to L.A., and we did.  And I came on board as the sales group's number two lawyer.
Story_ID: 670924
Speaker 1: And you've had a, a somewhat meteoric rise.  So, can you talk about the organization that you came into?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And have there, at that point in time, what was the, the legal struct- you know, the in-house structure?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, at that time, Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] itself was divided into two to three groups.  There was the manufacturing group, headquartered out of Kentucky, the sales group based in Los Angeles [California].  The sales group had to come first.  And Los Angeles was not, not by chance, it's the first big city as you fly over from Japan.  And it's less expensive than San Francisco [California], so there are a lot of Japanese car makers that started off, in, in L.A.  Honda [Honda Motor Company Ltd.] is still there.  Toyota started there.  Mazda [Mazda Motor Corporation] is still there.  Nissan [Nissan Motor Company Ltd.] started there.  So, that, the group that I went into, is very focused on, you know, sales and marketing, on product liability, and all the other, and all the other legal issues that were focused on sales.  The manufacturing group had its own legal group.  The R and D [research and development] group in Michigan had its own legal group.  So, so, we were focused on sales primarily, sales issues.
Speaker 1: Well, that's totally different from what you have been doing before, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Legally.  So, this is all, this is sort of refreshing in a way--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was thrill, it's a thrill so, yeah.
Speaker 1: --because it's a whole different--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) yes, so I went from being, I went from being a labor employment specialist to a true generalist--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --learning as I went, hoping not to make too many mistakes.
Speaker 1: So, who was, who was general counsel at the time?
Speaker 2: Dian Ogilvie.
Speaker 1: And how large was the legal team?
Speaker 2: About that time, it was about--I'm going to give you rough numbers, about fifty people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is literally ten years ago?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is 2007.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, what, so who else, how, how many African Americans are in the--you said how many, how many lawyers?
Speaker 2: It's about fifty.
Speaker 1: Fifty.  So, it's relatively--
Speaker 2: It's relatively small, yeah.
Speaker 1: --small for a corporation that is as--
Speaker 2: Right, right, but remember, that's just for the sales group.
Speaker 1: For the sales group.
Speaker 2: And there, there was, there were more for the, more--not more, but additional lawyers in the manufacturing group.  And to answer your question at the time, there was one other African American lawyer, Jane Howard-Martin, who was the chief employment lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what she was, okay.  But she was in a different group.  No, she was in your group.
Speaker 2: She was in my group.
Speaker 1: She was in your group, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And she had been there how much longer before?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think she had been there four or five years before that, and she was the one who hired me as outside counsel.  And so, so, I worked as deputy to Dian Ogilvie, and the idea was that Dian would be general counsel for two to three years.  I would learn the company, and then when she retired or moved on, I would become general counsel of the sales group from 2007.  So, so around, you know, the plan was 2010 or so, once, you know, Dian decided to do something else or, or retire or, or move on to another position, that then I would become general counsel.  What actually happened was I arrived in July of 2007.  By October of 2007, Dian got called to take the place of a Toyota executive who jumped ship, and went to Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC].  And so, she was asked to take his spot in New York City [New York, New York].  And I'll never forget, Dian is sitting down with me at a--we're having coffee, and she's saying, "Okay, well, I'm going to New York."  Okay, this is my boss.  And I say to her, "That's great, you know, what are the things you want me to watch over while you're in New York on your short business trip?  And then, you know, I'll be happy to give you the report when you come back, so that things can keep moving forward.  You know, I'm your number two."  Said, "No, I'm, I'm going to New York.  I'm actually going, I'm leaving this job, and going to New York, and you're going to take over in the next two months."  And I had not expected that.  And I was actually conflicted because I came to that job thinking that I was going to have two to three years to kind of get to know the company and, you know, sort of do a second education in how the auto industry worked.  And, oh, by the way, have the time to adjust that work life balance, right?  So, I was kind of looking forward to two to three years of manageable work while I paid attention to my family.  And she tells me, two or three months in, you know, "You, you don't have that luxury.  You're going to be the sales general counsel in a couple of months, so get cracking."  And that's what happened.
Story_ID: 670925
Speaker 1: So you never had that?  Or did you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not really.  I mean, so I will say that I was able to get control of my weekends.  So, as a outside lawyer, my weekends were times to actually get some work done that I couldn't because I was traveling or doing cases.  And then, I also got back being in-house counsel, my evenings, so I started actually showing up for dinner, which was novel and new.  So, those were huge things for, for me and for my relationship with my family to actually be home for dinner, and to actually be present, both physically and mentally present for the weekends.  That continued for much of the time I was general counsel at the sales company, but around 2009, 2010, the economy tanked.
Speaker 1: Big, big tank (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The auto, yeah, big tank, big tag.  The auto industry kind of went with it.  And then, that was also the time that Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] went through its unintended acceleration crisis and, basically, any sort of notion of--I wouldn't call it a relaxed schedule, but a manageable schedule, kind of went out the window around that time.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the, the acceleration crisis?
Speaker 2: Sure.  It's, it's pretty much covered publicly.  Basically, we went through a situation where a number of congressional committees looked very intensely into whether or not we had a product defect that resulted in a number of crashes or incidents.  And we were--
Speaker 1: And I think even a hundred deaths or something--
Speaker 2: Well, well, that was the allegation--
Speaker 1: That's the allegation, okay.
Speaker 2: --but actually, those, those deaths had to do with pedal misapplication.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it--but it was a crisis.  I mean, regardless of whether, what you point out is in certain aspects of the media coverage, the notion was there are a hundred deaths.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Not true, but when it came to brand management and reputation, that meant this was a crisis.  And among the things that, that we had to confront was having our president at the time, and it was our current president, Akio Toyoda, testify in front of [U.S.] Congress, a Japanese speaking executive, testifying in front of Congress, and it was my job to actually help prepare him for that.  And that was, that was a very intense time, and it remained intense for the next four years or so because there were several ongoing investigations and lawsuits, kind of like what British Petroleum [BP P.L.C.] went through, or what GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] went through with its ignitions or what VW [Volkswagen Group] was going through.  Well, we had our own version--Toyota did--and it was a very intense time.  But over the course of that time, a couple of things happened.  We learned to work better with the Japanese legal group.  We actually came together as one legal team in North America [Toyota Motor North America, Inc.].  So there was no longer a sales group and a manufacturing legal group.  We came together as one group, kind of forced to do it out of necessity.
Speaker 1: Why, why are you saying that?  Why force to do it out of necessity?
Speaker 2: 'Cause we had to coordinate.  We, we recognized that, that Toyota's legal issues did not break down into legal issues or manufacturing issues.  They were brand issues.  They were Toyota issues.  And so, if we were going to face them and meet them, we had to face them as, as one company.  And that's now even carried over into the company as a whole.  So, you're sitting in our temporary headquarters in Plano [Texas], temporary because in two months, we're opening up our first consolidated North American headquarters, where both the sales and manufacturing groups are coming together, as well as the research and development teams.  The executives are all coming together in one place as one company, as opposed to two or three different companies.
Story_ID: 670926
Speaker 1: So, you know, I had read also, Chris [HistoryMaker Christopher P. Reynolds] that--and I wanted to ask you about this.  How, how long did it take you to transition, even at this increased, you know, rate? Like how do you learn to be in-house counsel versus--and what's the difference, as opposed to outside counsel, who's advising clients, what, what, what were the, the lessons along the way?  I mean, 'cause companies move real quickly.
Speaker 2: They do, they move very quickly.  I think one big difference is that as in-house counsel, you've got to communicate with a company in the context of its own culture.  So now, as outside counsel, you have the luxury of communicating usually to, to other lawyers who are inside in the language of the lawyer.  Well, I have to take that legal issue and its solution and communicate it to my client in the language of an automotive engineer, with the language of an auto sales guy, or the language of, you know, someone who's dealing with dealers.  And I've got to frame what I'm saying, so that it's understandable and persuasive.  That's a, that's a big difference.  In-house counsel have to do it.  Good outside counsel should do it, but let- it's not, it's not a skill that many outside counsel have unless they've been with the same client for years and years.  But if you're in-house counsel, you have got to explain, and explain cogently and clearly in a language and a context that your client understands.  And as in-house counsel, you ought to be the person that knows how to do that very, very well.  So, that's one lesson I learned, and I learned pretty quickly.  The other lesson I learned is that, you know, in the in-house--in the outside counsel experience, you're actually being brought to bear on a particular issue.  You know, this issue has a, it's in a box.  It has four corners.  Your, your, it may be a huge issue, but it's an issue.  If you're in-house, you actually have to look at a continuum of issues, and how they link with each other, and how they affect the client, the brand, the reputation, the product, and you've got to think around these boxes because they're all kind of connected to an enterprise.  So, you have to develop your enterprise mindset, and that helps you first make a priority of which problems are the biggest and deserve your time, but at second, it gives you a sense of what you really, what your goal is.  So, I've had situations as in-house counsel where winning the case actually is more costly to the overall company objective than doing an early resolution that might allow the company to move on to its, its business.  As outside counsel, I'm paid to win.  As in-house counsel, I'm paid to keep the business going, keep it focused on what it does best.
Story_ID: 670927
Speaker 1: So, how, how much then are you exposed then to the operations side?  And how much are you meeting with people and, and how are they viewing you, you know, how, how is, how, here in Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] as in-house--'cause some, some places, it's like all the lawyers.  And then, it's other places, you're, you are part of the business, you know, structure?
Speaker 2: A good question.  I think it really depends on what part of the business you're dealing with.  So, you know, I think that, and it also depends on where you are, if where, are you in Japan?  Are you in the U.S.?  Are you in Europe?  Each view of lawyers is shaped by how each of those jurisdictions or cultures deal with lawyers, so in, in Japan, lawyers are few and far between.  And the notion of managing conflict has nothing to do with lawyers.  It's deeply cultural.  You do it through consensus building.  In Europe, lawyers are there to answer specific legal questions.  In, in the U.S., good lawyers are expected to have a deep understanding of the business and, and manage, help manage the business if they're good at their job as an in-house counsel.  So, I think in answer to your question, how do you deal with them, it depends on where you are, but my, my overall approach has been we in-house lawyers are servants to the business.  We have a multiplicity of clients.  They're not all the same, though they happen to be within the rubric of Toyota.  And we ought to be able to adjust our approach, depending on who we're talking to.  So, if we're talking to that automotive engineer, he thinks or she thinks in a very sort of engineering style framework of X follows Y, you know, or Z follows Y, whereas if you're talking to someone from the sales group, what she always wants to know is how does this affect my number 'cause I've got to make a number this month.  And you've got to learn how to speak that language.  The funny thing is if you had Akio Toyoda, my ultimate boss, sitting here, he would honestly tell you, and he has no problems saying it to my face, "I don't like lawyers."  He doesn't like lawyers.  My boss does not like lawyers.  So, every day, I wake up knowing that I'm, I'm working for a guy who doesn't like my profession at all, so I'd better show some value in what I do.  Lately, he's amended that slightly to, "I don't like lawyers, but I, but I like you."  So, I'm grateful for that, believe me, and, and I think what it, what it means is he understands the job I have to do for the company.  And while he doesn't like the, the, you know, the controversy that lawyers have to wade into, he understands that we have a purpose, and I appreciate that.
Story_ID: 670928
Speaker 1: So, that's the other thing.  You work for a company, a Japanese company, who has a U.S., a strong U.S. presence--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that is also a global company.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what--how complicated is that and--
Speaker 2: Oh, very.  It requires you and anyone to have a high level of cultural flexibility and sensitivity, so you can't be the typical arrogant American and assume that everything you say has to be, has to be listened to because you're an American.  You know, Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] has been marvelously successful by, by coming out of its Japanese roots and context.  You know, the Toyota production system is a Japanese construct.  The Toyota business practice is a Japanese construct.  We've adapted it in the U.S., but the roots of it are in Japan.  So, you know, they've been meaning that the Japanese have been successful at rebuilding their company.  They call it a scrap and build.  They rebuilt their entire country after World War II [WWII].  You've got to give them tremendous amounts of credit and, and respect for having the acumen, business sense, drive, and ambition to do that in industry after industry.  So, showing other cultures respect and being sensitive to their history, I think it's absolutely essential if you're going to be effective in a global enterprise like Toyota.
Story_ID: 670929
Speaker 1: You know, on that one case that you talked about, the, that sudden acceleration defect was what it was called.  Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] ended up paying a $1.2 billion settlement.
Speaker 2: There was, yeah, there was a class action settlement, as well as a fine imposed by the [U.S.] Department of Justice.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, that meant from that point on, that there--would that--that would affect the manufacturing in some respects, and how things were done going forward, no?
Speaker 2: No, the, the, what it really affected was our view of, of how we communicated to our customers about quality, about recalls.  And it, and it really forced us, compelled us to get much better at that than what we did before, to be more transparent, to make sure that customers knew and understood what the actual impacts were of particular issues or defects.  And I think it really gave us an opportunity to improve that, not just in the U.S., but globally.
Speaker 1: You know, and then I want to also understand about Toyota's growth during this time period, even though that--you know, 'cause remember in 2008, the U.S. auto industry is, has to be rescued.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Toyota didn't, I mean Toyota--
Speaker 1: But you didn't, I'm, I'm not saying you, I'm saying, the Detroit [Michigan] where your home, from--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --had to be, had to, you know, they and the banks had to be rescued.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I think, the reason why I immediately said Toyota didn't, was because we have, the company has a very sort of steady as, as she goes, you know, growth philosophy.  Akio Toyoda refers to it as tree ring growth.  You know, we have to have growth that's sustainable over a long term 'cause we intend to be here a hundred years from now.  So, what we're looking to do in everything that we do is grow in a steady measured way.  We think there's, there's risk in sort of wild sudden growth.  We think the, the growth has to be steady enough for the company to absorb it and plan for it, and manage it.  And that's, that's how we operate.  You know, does it make us a hot stock in the auto industry?  No, not like a Tesla [Tesla Motors; Tesla, Inc.] but, you know, stockholders don't buy us if they're looking for Tesla like returns.  There are other reasons why we, why we have value.  And we think it's, again, in this long term perspective.
Story_ID: 670930
Speaker 1: In 2015, you are named managing officer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: What does that mean then?  What, what does that position represent?
Speaker 2: It represents one of about forty to fifty people at the top of the company.  That's what that represents.
Speaker 1: That's pretty huge.
Speaker 2: That's pretty huge.
Speaker 1: Now, had--so you get promoted beyond general counsel?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are you, are--okay.
Speaker 2: Well, here's what happened.
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: Managing officer, in and of itself, is a, is a management title at Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation].  I'm both managing officer and global general counsel, plus I have a couple of other, two other functions, one in human resources, and the other in what's called governance management.  At least, that's current.  April 1 of 2017, it actually changes a little bit, but I was, when I became managing officer, I was the first African American to be managing officer, and only the third or fourth American, and one out of maybe six or seven non Japanese to be managing officer.  And I was the first global general counsel ever.
Speaker 1: And why did they decide they were going to do a global general counsel besides (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause we, well, well, for the same reason that we decided to merge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we kept having these understandings and realizations that the legal issues that were facing have global impact, and not all of them, but many of them, and that we had to have a global perspective in order to deal with them and, and serve Toyota well.  So, we couldn't have a situation where something happened in Brazil, but headquarters in the U.S. or Japan heard about it months later after, you know, disasters happened.  It's much better to be collaborative and communicating about issues that could have a global impact right from the get go.  And that's, that's why we have a general, a global general counsel position.  My job is to facilitate that, build structure for that, build support for it.
Speaker 1: But in doing that and making you managing director, it elevated the role, the legal role within the, the company--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which is not always the case.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so managing officer, it also meant that I had to essentially do a variant of what I did as an outside lawyer, which is sell the legal function to a bunch of perspective clients, so I spent, you know, a couple of months, and I still do this, persuading internal stakeholders that, that we in the legal function have something of value that we can offer.  We can help you accomplish your business objectives, so I'm kind of back to my old job of developing clients, except they're all internal.
Speaker 1: So, how, how large is, is the legal team now?
Speaker 2: All told, we're, we're talking now about 200, 250 people, scattered around the world.  Not all lawyers either, so in Japan, where the lawyers are few and far beteen- between, most of the people in Japan are non lawyers, but with extraordinary legal skills.  That's the context in Japan.
Speaker 1: I see.  That's a fascinating context.  That would be threatening to the United States and the legal--
Speaker 2: It, it would be--
Speaker 1: It's, it's--
Speaker 2: --it would be.
Speaker 1: Okay, and especially the way the legal community is going right now.  Okay.  So, the other question I have for you is how much--because you also in this position, you are in the, from the outside legal community, they're not, I mean, the ability contract out and to have people who, you know, law firms who would be seeking business from you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that, so what percentage, I mean I don't know if you could, can give numbers, but what percentage of your, of your legal business, is handled internally, and how much, what percentage is contracted out?
Speaker 2: Well, I think those are, I think you're actually talking about a continuum.  There's very little legal work where we just hand the whole thing, kit and caboodle, to outside counsel.  So, what we typically do is we manage outside counsel where needed--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --to, to provide support for us.  But there's almost always someone internal to Toyota, basically holding the whip hand, you know, holding the handle of that particular legal matter.  So, by that description, I would say, close to 80 percent of our matters involve a combination of in-house legal person teamed up with outside counsel.
Speaker 1: So, you would be highly sought out there. Okay, I see, I--I didn't know that.
Story_ID: 670931
Speaker 1: I want to ask you, during this time, though--so can you talk about your recent promotion?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, because this is, I mean we're here on March 23rd, and this was, this happened this this--
Speaker 2: Beginning of, it was announced the beginning of March.
Speaker 1: March, so it's just--
Speaker 2: It's just, just recent (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) not even a, right, just recent.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, sure, and, again, I'll try, I'll try and shorthand it.  Up until now, I've had a TMC [Toyota Motor Corporation] global role.  So, I did not really have any North American functions reporting directly to me.  I was managing the legal function globally, and also I had these HR [human resources] functions that had some global aspects to it.  I was here in Plano [Texas], or before I moved here in August of last year, I was in Torrance [California] almost as a matter of geographic convenience.  I'm, you know, American, I'm living in the U.S.  I could have done this job anywhere, but, you know, I needed to be here in my home country.  Effective April 1, I've picked up what's called the corporate resources role where, as an executive vice president in North America, I'm responsible for nine different functional groups, all of which have the following thing in common.  They're corporate support services.  They're not dealing directly with the making, the design, or the sale of the actual car.  So, tho- that would be things like legal, public relations, government relations, human resources, accounting and finance, corporate strategy, a, a piece--what I call a piece or sliver of Mexico--what's called corporate services, which is sort of the facilities aspect of what we do.  And I always forget the ninth one.  My short term memory can't hold, can't hold nine things, but--ah, social innovation, so that's the--
Speaker 1: That's (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --philanthropy, community engagement, and those would be nine groups that report to me, all told about a thousand five hundred people, nationally.
Speaker 1: So, who has a structure like that?  Is this similar to other company structure 'cause it seems not but--
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's--so, you know, a, a, it is not similar in the sense that very few companies have people in these roles that are dual capped--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --but that's very common for Toyota.  And the other thing that's, that might be unusual is the, you know, parent company subsidiary relationship between Toyota Motor Corporation and Toyota Motor North America [Toyota Motor North America, Inc.].  That tends to be unique and differs company by company, but once you get within the structure of say, North America, the notion of having a CEO who we have, someone in charge of automotive operations, someone in charge of manufacturing, someone in charge of R and D [research and development], someone in charge of what we call, what I would call, automotive support services, like quality or, or other things.  And then, this corporate services pillar, corporate resources pillar, that, that's not uncommon in U.S. companies.
Speaker 1: So, so someone like David Wilkins [HistoryMaker David B. Wilkins], who has now grown to be, grown (unclear) at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] to consult with general counsels.  What, how would he categorize your role in the world of, you know, general counsels?
Speaker 2: Well, he, I think he would categorize me, if I could guess, as a global general counsel.  What he may not be able to grasp is that in addition to that, I have this operational side that I'm now responsible for (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, see, and it's almost like a new, I mean, there are so many people who would like to, you know, run the business and they don't get the chance, you know, because I'm even thinking of when you started though, it was real estate.  You know, that was a business function and you're actually going to be--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --doing that.  That's very, that's very exciting.
Speaker 2: It's very, it is very exciting, and it is an opportunity and by focusing on it as an opportunity, it kind of distracts me from the fact of how am I doing to do all this (laughter), but the answer is easy.  You know, at this level of any company, you only do stuff based on the support you have from your team members, so the, how do I do it?  I rely on the expertise and support of everybody that reports to me, and we, it's a team effort.  I, I can't possibly manage in the full sense of the word, everyone, or even one of these functions.  I've got to be able to glide across them, the top of them, and understand what the key issues are.  And the only way I do that is by working effectively with whoever is the day to day manager.
Story_ID: 670932
Speaker 1: So, how are you--so what do you want to do next and, and what do you see--I mean, you're still, you're young.
Speaker 2: Thank you (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know (laughter) because you were young already.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: You know what?  I got--
Speaker 1: You are, you know what?  You are fifty-four years old.
Speaker 2: I am, I am, proud of it.  My, my children tell me I'm old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm--
Speaker 2: I'm glad, I'm glad to hear the young part, but, you know, my children tell me I'm old.
Speaker 1: But what do you see as your career path here [Toyota Motor North America, Inc.], and what would you like to see happen?
Speaker 2: I'm going to tell you something very--that may sort of go against that question.  If you, if, you know, we've walked through my career, and it's kind of been interesting thinking about it.  I've never really had a career path.  I've never taken a job thinking, all right, I'm going to do this and then my next job will be--. What, what I think happens to me is, you know, I, I am blessed with an opportunity, and the good Lord makes provision for me.  And, you know, as a Christian, I actually believe that my life is charted by God, and so, these opportunities that come my way, they've been put in my way.  I mean, how, how could I meet the guy [George A. Stohner] who hired me as a partner at Morgan, Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP]?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Why, why was, why was that Dwight Greene [Dwight L. Greene] felt it necessary to tell me about the U.S. attorney's office [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]?  Who could have told Judge Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] that I should be his law clerk?  I mean, all these points, they didn't happen the usual way, but I think they happened for a reason, and I really do believe that it's God's provision.  So, having kind of upset- accepted that a couple of years ago, I don't really talk about in terms of career path.  I just think of life path.  What is my life's path?  And, you know, you know, it's a, honestly, as a Christian, I don't believe I have to know what my next step is.  I just have to have faith and believe that, that I'll be blessed as long as I stay faithful.  And that actually makes life very simple for me.  So, you know, what's my next step in, in my career?  Honestly, I'm trying to get my head around April 1 (laughter).
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: And if I, if I do a good job on that, if there's something else that comes along that, that manifests itself--because in my career, that's how it worked.  I haven't ever really gone after any of my recent jobs.  Something will manifest itself and, hopefully, it'll be exciting and challenging and a blessing.  And all I'm actually beginning to look for now is an opportunity to leave a legacy so, you know, my, my definition of what makes me happy has shifted from, you know, never be bored.  That, that still makes me happy, but now, it includes, and I need to help other people, like those other people helped me.  They took chances on me.  They didn't have to, so I want to do for other people and I've tried to do in my last couple of positions.
Speaker 1: So, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to, to kind of be like what Judge Keith's legacy is.  You know, he's still alive and kicking at ninety-four as we tape this.  And he can look back on his career and see so many people who, he put his hands on so many people who are now doing amazing things.  You know, Judge Eric Clay [Eric L. Clay], also on the U.S. Court of Appeals [United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit], is his law clerk.  Judge Mimi Wright [Wilhelmina Wright], U.S. district court judge in Minnesota [United States District Court for the District of Minnesota], his law clerk.  Ron Machen [Ronald Machen], who used to be a U.S. attorney in District of Columbia, his law clerk.  Connie Rice [HistoryMaker Constance Rice], an amazing civil rights lawyer in Los Angeles [California], who I hope you've done a HistoryMaker [The HistoryMakers] for.  That's a Judge Keith law clerk.  Well, at the end of my career, I want to look back and say, that's somebody that I helped and he or she is being successful.  You know, that's somebody that actually saw me do these things and even though I may not have affected them directly, I've already had people tell me, and it's actually a very scary feeling when you realize people are watching you and modeling their view of what's possible after what, after what you're capable of doing.  When, when you figure that out, it actually puts a tremendous, in a positive way, a tremendous burden and a sense of obligation on you to get it right because now you've got, not just your own aspirations, but other people are looking at you, saying well, if he can do it, I can do it.  If he can make that step, I can make the step and, and this is the complete opposite of a boast.  It's more like a, it's a burden.  It means, I got, I got to do well because I've got to demonstrate to, you know, people who may not see themselves as successful in these contexts that absolutely you can be successful.  In this regard, you know, that's why I think that, you know, our forty-fourth president, you know, Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], was so important.  My children have grown up in a context where they know it is absolutely possible to be the president of the United States, to lead a country, to do amazing things, regardless of their skin color because, well, you know, Barack Obama did it.  And, and the great gift that we get from an experience like that, is for them, for my children, this is normal.  It's, it's sort of, yeah, what's, what's the big deal?  You know, we who are older, we know what the big deal is. But he was able to model to an entire series of generations what's possible.  In my own little niche of the law in business, I want to do that, too.  That's my legacy.

Speaker 1: And your wife [Arlene Ford Reynolds], you've had, you've had this partnership with her now.  Is--did she continue to practice?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, the short version of my wife is I think her goal was to get more degrees than I had.  So after, after she had our two children [Lovinia Reynolds and Austin Reynolds], and before we adopted our, our third child [Melissa Carr-Reynolds], she saw a crying need to address the shortcomings in urban education for children of color.  And so, she started to talk about that and quickly found out that nobody in the education sphere paid attention to her because she had a Harvard Law [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] degree, not an education degree.  So, my wife being my wife, decided okay, I'm going to go back and get an education degree.  So, she went and got her master's in education from Columbia, Columbia Teachers College [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York], and then got her Ph.D. in urban education reform from UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], all this while dealing with me and raising, you know, our three kids.  And now, she has her own consultancy in teaching education leadership in charter schools about equity, systemic inequity in education, and how to promote equity.  Busier than ever now, even with all of three kids out of the house, so she's, I almost hesitate to say it, but she's bad ass.  And, and so, I consider her actually kind of more like a model than a partner.
Story_ID: 670934
Speaker 1: You know, and I, I just have two more questions.  One, what is your hopes and concerns for the black community as we sit here now, and it's 2017?
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for that question.  You know, 2017 is very different from 2015 and 2016.  We're, we're operating in a different political environment, but also that political environment is sending out signals that, that put, I think, all communities of difference and color in, in a sense of unease and, you know, some of those signals are very loud and clear.  Some of them are subtle.  My main concern is that the, the black community, or even black communities, 'cause we're not monolithic, knows and understands how we're supposed to persevere, and how resilient we're supposed to be that this is not, you know, the situation that we're in, is not nearly as bad as situations we've been in.  But it still demands that we step up, that we push, that we persist, and that all of us do that, so that we're not broken along the divides of, of income and education.  I can't be happy as long as those Detroit [Michigan] public school kids--I used to be part of a Detroit public school system [Detroit Public Schools Community District].  I can't be happy and successful if they're not being educated, and they're not.  I can't feel right about that.  My own kids, they're doing great, but that's just my own kids with significant investment of, of time and effort.  But, you know, my fellow Detroiters, the city I grew up in, don't their kids deserve to go to a public school that could launch them in the way that Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] launched me?  The answer is yes.  And so, we need to make sure that when we talk about the black community and other communities of color that, that if we don't have wealth, and that's a whole other discussion.  Why don't we have wealth, but if we don't have wealth, the one thing we should have is opportunity through education, and we need to make sure that there's access to that, full, equal, rich, robust access to that.  And that's a challenge because we don't have that, we don't have that.  And it's, it's a crime against our community and it's a loss for the country.

Speaker 1: So, your mother [Phyllis Todd Graham] has, she's seen this?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: She, and she's still here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I wonder what you think when you think of your [maternal] grandmother [Amy Todd], and your father [Lee Reynolds, Jr.], and your step-father [Garfield Graham], and really, the village that raised you.  Your, you know, your brothers and sisters, sisters.  You have more brothers than sisters, right?  You think--
Speaker 2: I think they're actually, actually four and four, yeah.
Speaker 1: --is it, four and four, okay, right.  What do you think of that, you know, as you sort of sit here now?  I--
Speaker 2: You know, I guess what I think of is all of us are, are basically products and, and the sum total of all the effort that those generations, particularly in, I think, the African American community, that those generations have put into us.  So, you know, I don't think I'd have a consciousness of myself as a African American, were it not for my brothers feeding that into at that particular point in time.  I don't think I'd have a keen understanding of education were it not for my mother just, and all of my parents really being just relentless about what their expectations were.  They did not care if I played--I'm probably the only black man you've met who's never shot a basketball because they did not care.  They wanted me to hit the books and get A's, all right, so up to this day, you hand me a basketball.  I have no idea what to do with it.  You give me a book, I'm good, so, so, you know, and that focus came from their parents, from my, my [paternal] grandmother [Gussie Reynolds] who was a housemaid, you know, my, my [maternal] grandfather [Austin Todd] who was a postal worker, and my grandmother who was, my mother's side, who was a homemaker.  Well, they launched all of, all of my, my parents who came out burning with the desire to get educated so they could get out of the grips of the Great Depression.  Then I go all the way back to that, that census document I have hanging on my wall that shows my great-grandfather having been born a slave, but was literate, a sharecropper, and raising literate children.  It's a continuum and we can't break that continuum.  That's what I, that's kind of what I feel like now.  My own children, you know, I'm fifty-four.  Thank you for calling me young.  They think I'm old--twenty-five, twenty-one, and eighteen, and I know that my job is, and Arlene's [Reynolds' wife, Arlene Ford Reynolds] job is to push them, you know, even further, as far as there, they can go and that their, you know, energies and ambitions take them, and, and make them feel that anything is possible.  I kind of think our generation, my generation is the first one that actually had a glimpse of anything is possible.  My parents' generation, they knew everything should be possible, but they knew what their limitations where.  And they're not limitations of their own making, but that society put on them.  And as you go back in each successive generation, more and more limitations, but everyone keeps pushing the successor generation to view what's possible, to, to have fewer restrictions, to, to grab hold.  And that's what I see when I think about it.

Speaker 1: So, you give the year and just a little about, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, this is a picture of my [maternal] grandfather, Austin Todd.  He's actually the namesake of my son, Austin [Austin Reynolds].  And this looks like it's about 1961 or '62 [1962], somewhat before he passed away.
Speaker 1: This picture is my proud grandmother--
Speaker 2: Could you spell your grandfather's name just now?
Speaker 1: Austin Todd.
Speaker 2: But A-U-S--
Speaker 1: A-U-S-T-I-N, T-O-D-D.
Speaker 2: T-O-, okay.
Speaker 1: This picture is Amy Winifred Todd [Amy Todd], Austin's wife and my grandmother.  And she is looking up at me on my graduation from law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in May of 1986.
Speaker 2: This is my mom and dad, Phyllis Marie Todd [Phyllis Todd Graham] and Lee Holmes Reynolds, Jr. [Lee Reynolds, Jr.], though he never liked the junior.  And this is just after they got married.  And I'm going to peg this at like, 19--early 1940s, but I don't know the precise date.  They were young when they got married.  They were, I think she was no more than eighteen or nineteen.
Speaker 1: Oh, she looks pretty.  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: This is the, the family, circa 2015.  And going from the--
Speaker 1: Left, you should go--
Speaker 2: --left to right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's me, and then there's my wonderful daughter, now twenty-five, Melissa [Melissa Carr-Reynolds]; my wife, Arlene [Arlene Ford Reynolds]; my now twenty-one year old college senior, Lovinia [Lovinia Reynolds], L-O-V-I-N-I-A; and then, my boy, Austin, who's now eighteen, A-U-S-T-I-N.
Speaker 1: June 3rd, 1989, that is my wedding day, and on the left is my wife's paternal grandmother; and it's me looking very skinny; my wife, who kind of looks the same; and my father-in-law, Clifton Ford [Clifton L. Ford].
Speaker 2: One of the benefits of living in this time was that we had the opportunity to visit the Obamas [Michelle Obama and HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] for two or three years at their holiday parties in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  Now, we were one of thousands of people pretty much, but it was always fun to be in the White House when President Obama was, was in office.  And this is a holiday party, I think, around 2015 or '14 [2014] and, you know, who's on either end.  And that's my wife and I in the middle in the White House.
Speaker 1: This is (unclear), this is the series.
Speaker 2: The series.  So, that's my, the wedding day of my mom and my stepdad, whom I'm always proud to call my, my dad. And this is September 2nd, 1968.  And you have the, almost all of the members of the combined family there.  And if you wish, I can identify people, but--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, going from left to right, first row would be Marilyn Graham; and then, next to her, Garfield Graham, my stepdad.  Hiding behind my mother is my brother, Lawrence, L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E Reynolds [Lawrence Reynolds].  Next to him is Lee Reynolds [Devamrita Swami], otherwise known as Pip.  And then going left to right again, there's Rhoda Graham [Rhoda Graham Carter], R-H-O-D-A; my mom, Phyllis Graham; my sister, Patricia Reynolds [Patricia Reynolds Hill]; and then my brother, Victor Graham; and then the little guy in front in the knee pants is me.
Speaker 1: Now, now the next picture is, is--that was the before picture, where everybody was very unhappy.  This is the after picture, where we're pretty happy.  And we're all together in our house in Detroit, Michigan.  And on the back row, you have my brother, Victor; my brother, Pip; my sister, Marilyn; and my brother, Larry in the hat.  Then what you also see is my oldest stepbrother, Calvin [Calvin Graham], with his wife, Linda [ph.], and their son, little Steve [ph.] in their arms.  And then my mom; and then my stepfather; and then in front, there's my sister, Rhoda; me; and my sister, Pat.  And we're smiling.
Speaker 2: So, this is 2005 and it's a family picture of us, slightly older.  And so you have going from left to right, my wife, Arlene; me; my brother, Larry; and then, my sister, Marilyn; my brother, Victor; and my brother-in-law, Harold [ph.]--I'm actually now--let me go back, left to right.  So, then, my sister, Rhoda; my, my sister, Pat; my brother, Pip; and my sister-in-law, Larry's wife, Jacquin, J-A-C-Q-U-I-N; and then next to her, my sister, Rhoda's husband, Harold, H-A-R-O-L-D; and my mom and dad; and between my mom and dad, is my sister-in-law, Linda.

Speaker 1: I'm guessing the year is about 1978 or '79 [1979], and this is me receiving youth of the year award at New Prospect Baptist church [New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: I don't know what year that is, but this is me as a kid in our house on Catharine Street [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: That is my high school graduation picture, the one that when my son, Austin [Austin Reynolds], looks at it, he says, I cannot deny him.
Speaker 2: That, I believe, is I'm going to guess, it's 19--summer of 1984 when I was working at a law firm in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: That is me in my father's [Lee Reynolds, Jr.] apartment in New York [New York] and that's probably 1967 or '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: That is my family at probably, I'm going to guess, year 2000, and we're at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  And that's my wife [Arlene Ford Reynolds]; my son, Austin; my daughter, Lovinia [Lovinia Reynolds]; and me.  My daughter, Melissa [Melissa Carr-Reynolds], hadn't arrived yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, goodness.  Well, the date is November of 1963, and this is the baby beautiful contest that somehow the Philadelphia Inquirer got a picture of it.  My mom [Phyllis Todd Graham] clipped it out, and there I am in kind of on the right hand side, my mom holding me.  I won!  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: This is, this is competitive even then.  This is me graduating from high school in June of 1979, Cobo Hall [Cobo Center, Detroit, Michigan], graduating from Cass Tech High School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: This is me in 1981 receiving the Harry S. Truman Scholarship from Margaret Truman [Margaret Truman Daniel] in Independence, Missouri.
Speaker 1: I don't know where I am in that picture, but it's got to be me, less than one year old, and so, I'm going to assume I'm in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but that's me as a kid.
Speaker 2: This is nice (unclear).
Speaker 1: This one, I believe, is 1965 or '66 [1966], might even be '67 [1967].  And I'm standing next to my [maternal] grandmother [Amy Todd] as, as we are planting an honorary tree in honor of my grandfather who had died the year before.
Speaker 2: This is the springtime of 1986 and it is my wife and I, as she was my girlfriend at the time, standing out in front of the Harvard Law Review building, and a friend of ours took this picture.  I guess I'm a little enthralled.
Speaker 1: This is me at my law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduation in May of 1986 with my godfather.
Speaker 2: That's a baby picture.  I don't know how old I was then, but there I am, cabbage patch.
Speaker 1: That is my grandfather taken--
Speaker 2: Which?  Name?
Speaker 1: --that my grandfather, Austin Todd, taken in 19--I'm guessing late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: That's the house that I was, I came back from the hospital to.  It's in Jamaica, Queens [New York].
Speaker 1: That's me on the day of my graduation from Kalamazoo College [Kalamazoo, Michigan] in 1983.
Speaker 2: That also is me in Detroit, probably when I was clerking for the judge [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] in 1986.
Speaker 1: Yea, that's (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, you're really going to show the report card?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) your report card.  It's here, okay.
Speaker 2: What grade was that, what grade was that?  I'm going to have to look and see what grade it was. (Makes sound) Sixty-eight [1968] to '69 [1969], oh--
Speaker 1: What year is that?
Speaker 2: --sixty-eight [1968] to--I must, this must be like primary, either Head Start or, or kindergarten.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Is there any way you can (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I am shaking it.
Speaker 1: And that is my progress report where it showed all outstandings and showing progress. One of my first report cards.
Speaker 2: It foretold your future (laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess it did which is why my mom, why my mom kept--
