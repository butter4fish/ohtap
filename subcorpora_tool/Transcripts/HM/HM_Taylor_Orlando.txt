Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 13955
Speaker 1: So, now, Dr. Taylor, if you would, tell me a little bit about your mother, starting with her name, where she grew up and her background?
Speaker 2: My mother is Carrie Taylor.  Her maiden name is Carrie Sanders.  She was born in Orville, Alabama in, in 1908  (laughter).  She's now ninety-six years young.  She--Orville, Alabama is in Dallas County, Alabama which is the county seat, the county in which Selma, Alabama is the county seat.  And there's a lot of family connections and history with Selma.  And since it was a very important point of the Civil Rights Movement, it has a special meaning for me.
Speaker 1: And how did your mother grow up?  Did she ever share any stories with you about growing up and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  My, my grandfather was a very, sort of special man in his, in his county.  He was the son of a African American woman and a, and a white plantation owner.  And as you'll see in pictures, he, he could have passed for being white, though he was, he was a very, very fair-skinned individual, who married a very dark African American woman.  But because of my, my grandfather's connections on the father's, on his father's side, he was not a sharecropper.  So he had the distinction of being one of the few blacks in the county who was not a sharecropper.  He was an independent farmer.  He had modest education.  My grandmother had had none, but my grandfather did read.  My grandmother did not.  He read the newspaper daily by kerosene lamp, the "Selma Times Journal", as I recall.  And he had a great interest in education.  And he, in one way or another, sent all of his seven children, (unclear) seven children to, to college, in one way or another.  And my mother actually went to boarding school, a boarding school that was nearby, that had been founded by the Presbyterian church, and I think it was Miller's Fairy, Alabama.  And it was where she and some of my aunts went to school as well.  So my mother then had an early start in education, great commitment for--to education and actually went to college, went to Selma University and finished with a two-year degree in 1930, middle of the Depression.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  My mother is, is a task master.  My mother is one who believes in doing things the right way with very, very strict rules and expectations.  She, she started teaching early in her life in Alabama, following the two-year degree.  At the time, in the '30s [1930s], it was possible to teach with a two-year diploma.  But she married a guy, called my father, Leroy Taylor, in 1934.  And they were married and moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee.  And in Tennessee, a more "advanced state", put that in quotes, they required a four-year degree.  And so she couldn't teach.  So she decided to do something, the next best thing, and that was to raise a family.  And she did not go back to college to complete her four-year degree from 1948, at the age of forty--1946, rather.  And she received her degree in 1948 at the age of forty, at which time she began a career in, in teaching at the elementary school.  And she became--she was a classic school teacher and school principal for that time.  And she transmitted those values to my brother and me.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about your father.  You've already shared his name with us, but where did he grow up and what was--and his background?
Speaker 2: My father is LeRoy Taylor--he's always very careful about not being Leroy Taylor, and it's spelled L-E-capital R-O-Y.  He grew up in Camp Hill, Alabama, which is in Lee County, Alabama, which is the, the county seat of Auburn University, and it's the, it's the county just East of the county--Macon County, where Tuskegee University is located.  He grew up in a small town called Camp Hill, Alabama, very near Opelika Alabama, a really country town.  And my father had a very modest education.  He had six years of education, but he was an entrepreneur from the word go.  He, he really knew how to maneuver his life and to take advantage of, of what he had to make life better for himself and for his family.  He finished the sixth grade as I told you, met this cute little school teacher that moved to his town, and talked her into going to Tennessee with him and married her.  That was my mother.  He, he spent a lifetime for the most part in Tennessee of working in a factory.  He was a, a laborer in a factory, but he, he self, taught himself a lot of skills and at the time of his retirement, he had a title of something like electrical engineer.  And it really wasn't quite engineering as he know it today, but he had learned a good deal about how to, to control and take supervision of the blast furnaces in this steel mill that were all operated by very elaborate electrical circuitry.  And he, an African American man, was the only one, who achieved that kind of understanding and title.  And he, he finished a long career with this company and retired at sixty-five and lived to be ninety one.  He passed just a few years ago.
Story_ID: 13956
Speaker 1: What made them move from Alabama to Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Well, they moved in the middle of the '30s [1930s], and that was a, there was a important migration that took place in the American South in the early 1930s.  There's a wonderful book by Riesman called "The Promised Land", and it describes this history fairly much in detail.  But it came about largely as a result of the invention of the cotton picking machine on the farms of the South.  And it meant that a machine could pick more cotton than a person.  I think six to ten times more.  And so it became economically unnecessary for the labor force to be quite the same on the farms of the American South.  And as a result of it, many African Americans moved to either the urban South or the North, the urban North.  So the urban South would mean places like Birmingham, which had a very large, heavy industry economy and my hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee, which also had a very strong, heavy industry economy.  And so it was a, a place to go from the farm to the city where there was a perception of big money available, maybe a little fast living at the same time, a little night life too.  And so many blacks moved to the urban South, not to Chicago, not to St. Louis, but to, but to places like Chattanooga and Birmingham.  So that's why he moved.
Story_ID: 13957
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about what life was like growing up in your house?  What was a typical day like?
Speaker 2: I had an odd growing up in terms of my own household.  My father, who had a great, a lot of aspirations, at the time I was five or thereabouts, wanted us to live in a very nice neighborhood.  And so the very nice neighborhood happened to be a white neighborhood.  And I don't know how he did this, given the patterns of housing segregation in Tennessee, my father bought a house on an all-white block in 1940.  And that's where we moved.  And some of my earliest memories was moving to this, this promised land, this, this wonderful neighborhood of nice houses, all--and they were painted white too, by the way.  But it was about four blocks from, from the nearest black neighborhood.  It wasn't totally, totally segregated from the black community, but it was a four-block gap between where we lived and where black people lived, which meant on my block, and the immediate blocks around me, there were no other black kids.  So I grew up, and I--at that time, I had no brother.  I have one brother, Robert, who's a physician.  But that, at that time, I had no brother.  And so I lived on a block where there was no social interaction amongst the neighbors.  And the whites in that block made it very clear to their children not to play with me.  And so I lived in a block with no playmates, no children, and walked to school past all these other places to get to my school.  And so my growing up was very much alone.  I learned to entertain myself.  I learned to--I read a lot, and I traveled around the United States, actually during that time.  And I traveled in the form of reading train schedules.  So I used to imagine getting on the Chicago Zephyr and going to Los Angeles, and learning all the little towns in between, through Illinois and Missouri and Kansas and to Albuquerque, and Gallop, New Mexico and San Bernardino, kind of running the route of Route 66.  I did those kind of things.  I loved radio, and I used to listen to the radio at night and pick up distant radio stations from other places and imagine how life would be in a place like Chicago or St. Louis because I could pick up their radio stations.  So my day was largely around going to school, coming home, entertaining myself, reading a lot, listening to the radio, going to bed, and getting ready, getting ready for another day.  It was life in an urban, Southern community.  My brother was born later, a few years later, and at that point, I had a little brother to take care of because my mother, by this point, was going to school to get her degree and later to college.  So I began, I became kind of a house husband, or house son, you might say.  I did cooking and, and house sitting and babysitting for my then, younger brother.  Not a very exciting life, but the one thing that it did for me, and I think it really has had an influence on most of my later life, is that I have learned to be able to be self-satisfied, to be independent and to not require a crowd in order to be satisfied.
Speaker 1: Dr. Taylor, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Mountains for sure.  Chattanooga is in the mountainous part of the, of the U.S. East.  And so any place I go where there are mountains with trees--not the ones in the West, without trees; the ones in the East with trees.  So like in Southern Virginia, in the Blue Ridge Parkway, I think about my hometown.  That's one, that's a site.  Country music.  I grew up in Appalachia and so I heard on the local radio stations--prior to the advent of black radio, there was a lot of--there was only, mainly white radio.  And there was a lot of country music.  In Tennessee, and the Grande Ole Opry was around, so when I hear that kind of music, I think about my home town.  Smells, I would say, fresh air.  If you've ever been to that part of Tennessee or anywhere near the Blue Ridge or the, that whole chain of mountains, when you get up into the, the air is fresh, and the water is clear.  And so I think about the smell of the, of fresh, clean air, though Chattanooga didn't have much of it because there was heavy industry there and it was smoke filled.  I can think of that too.  I think of the smell from the, from the blast furnaces, I think of that as well.

Speaker 1: So what can you tell me about your grandparents on your mother's side, starting with their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandfather was Arthur Sanders and my grandmother was Tishie or Tisha Sanders.  My grandfather, I described him a little bit in terms of being the, the offspring of a--which is fairly, not uncommon in that of the country and particularly, during that time.  He was a, he was a farmer and a very religious man, who was very active in his church and believed in all the rules and regulations that were specified in the bible, and raised his kids, kids the tough, strict way, very tough and very strict and lots of rules and punishment as required.
Speaker 1: What about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother could neither read nor write--she lived to over a hundred by the way.  The most important thing about my grandmother as I remember her, was, in addition to being the, the manager of the house and she really supported this farmer husband, who was my grandfather, was that she knew about folk healing.  And her nickname was 'Doc'.  And so for miles around if people got sick, they would summon Doc, doc for doctor, my grandmother, my grandmother who couldn't read or write, but who knew how to concoct teas and other chemicals from roots to, to, to provide to the sick person.  I used to have a joke that the tea that she made tasted so badly that you would be--whatever was in, that was inside you would definitely want to get out of you because it had (unclear), kind of those awful tastes of those teas that my grandmother made.  But she was known Doc, and it's ir--rather ironic that my brother late got a PhD in pharmacology and an MD and as a pharmacologist, he's involved in research that looks at the, the development of drugs to combat disease.  And he also provides clinical care to patients.  So he is like my grandmother in many, many ways.  That's, that would really, pretty much describe my grandmother and grandfather.
Speaker 1: What about your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Didn't know them well.  I knew my grandmothers--my grandmother and grandfather on my mother's side much better because almost every summer I was sent to Alabama to live with them.  And I hated every minute of being in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, there was this strict grandfather who had lots of rules and he enforced with a vengeance, and I hated that.  And he would punish you if you broke them in, in the traditional method of punishing children in those days.  But I found Alabama to be a very racist place.  And that may sound a bit funny because people in Alabama viewed Tennessee as kind of like, almost like the North.  Tennessee, particularly, East Tennessee, did not have the same tradition of segregation and, and the re--and the violent types of segregation as, as Alabama had, particularly, in East Tennessee, which was largely mountainous, there were not plantations and large farms.  So the tradition of the plantation and sharecropping was not characteristic of East Tennessee where I grew up.  And in fact, at the Civil--during the time of the Civil War, it was a place where many did not want to secede from the Union.  You may recall that Abraham Lincoln's running mate was Andrew Johnson from that part of Tennessee.  And it was largely Republican, not the Republican party as we know it today, but it was the Republican party of the nineteenth century.  So I went to Alabama, it was this other, much more rigid and much more violently enforced segregation of, and, and manners that were required to live in that part of the country; like if a white person approached you from the--on the side walk, you'd step aside and let them come back.  I didn't know that rule.  But I knew other rules.  I knew about drinking fountains and things like that.  But I recall, for example, one time I was in this little downtown area, this little town where my grandfather lived.  And I went into a little store to buy ice cream.  And I asked for vanilla or something like that, maybe.  And I guess the woman, the wife of the owner didn't hear me well and said, "Vanilla?"  And I said, "Yeah."  And by the time I got home, I had to walk home, my grandfather met me at the door because this white man had sent word to him that, that this boy from up North had come down here and insulted his wife by calling, by saying, yeah, as opposed to yes, ma'am, to her.  And he warned my grandfather that if I didn't teach this boy any better, any manners about how to treat people, I would like to talk about it very much.  And my grandfather made it very clear about the rules of etiquette regarding how you talked to the whites.  And not to say, ever say, yeah, to a white woman.  And that was a powerful lesson to me, and that's one--that was one of my first introductions to the etiquette, racial etiquette of that region.  And later, it helped me to understand about how lynchings had taken--took place of people like Emmett Till, for example, had shown what was described as disrespectful behavior towards white women.  It was a very powerful and scary moment.  I hated--that was just one reason.  That's why I hated going to Alabama.
Story_ID: 13959
Speaker 1: Dr. Taylor, tell me a little bit about the elementary school years.  What was--do you remember the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Orchard Knob Elementary School.  Actually, it was a nine, grade school.
Speaker 1: And could you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Orchard, O-R-C-H-A-R-D, Knob, K-N-O-B.  It was in the, it was the edge of one of the famous battles of the Civil War, the Battle of Orchard Knob, major battle.  Sherman's trek to Atlanta, which signaled the end of the Civil War, started in my hometown, Chattanooga.  Chattanooga is a major rail center, it was then, any way--still is.  And when winning Chattanooga was very important to the Union army because it meant they could cut off the rail transportation routes to gets goods and other materials to the troops.  And so Sherman--Chattanooga very, very vicious battle, very famous.  It was battles of Chickasaw, the battle, the battle (above the clouds?) and the battle of Orchard Knob were three major battles, also the battle of Missionary Ridge.  But my school set across the street from Orchard Knob where this battle had taken place.  So that's where I went to grade school.
Speaker 1: And what was elementary school like for you?
Speaker 2: A blur (laughter).  There used to be a time I remembered every teacher, but my mother [Carrie Sanders Taylor], which again was not unusual in the day, had finagled a way for me to start school early.  So I started school in at age five, and outside of--I was very, I was the youngest kid in the class.  I finished high school when I was sixteen, which was very unusual.  And the thing that was really complicated for me was that I had to go back home, back through this all-white neighborhood.  So I never saw my classmates after class cause I lived in another, another neighborhood.
Speaker 1: How did--did that matter to your classmates?  Did they treat you differently because of it?
Speaker 2: Maybe, I just didn't know them.  I just didn't know them well.  One thing that's fascinating about my, about my grade school--that I didn't know about at the time, in the playground area of the school, were rock formations.  And it, it didn't make any sense for these--all of a sudden there'd be these rock, rocks, these mounds that more or less grew out of the ground--not grew out--yeah, exactly (unclear), they were growing out of the ground.  I didn't know what they were.  Well, much later, as an adult, I realized they were, it was an Indian burial ground.  And if you know of a place like, I think Mounds, Illinois or something like that, which is another well-known place, my, my--my playground area of the school had all these mounds, which was an Indian burial ground.  It had--and nobody ever taught us anything about that, didn't know anything about that.  I had a lot of ref--reflection thoughts about that and how our Native American people were, were dissed and their history not taught in school.  And I also learned later that the Trail of Tears began in Chattanooga, Tennessee which was "the" most, the largest single force exiting of Indians from the Eastern, Eastern United States.  The trail started in my hometown.  That was never mentioned in my education, never.  In fact, I never heard of the Trail of Tears until I read "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" later in Dee Brown's great book .
Speaker 1: Tell me, what kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, average (laughter).  I, actually, I was, I think through much of my K-12 education I was a little above average.  I wasn't average, I was a little above average.  But I was a little above average because I was sort of bored with it all.  Because I was a loaner for the most part, and because I did a lot of reading, I would read a lot of things.  And I read the newspaper every day, and my hometown was blessed with having a very fine local newspaper.  A newspaper, actually it was owned by the owners of the "New York Times", and in fact, the masthead of the "Chattanooga Times" looked like the "New York Times".  And they early on had a "New York Times" news service connection.  There was a lot of good news in the newspaper, and I read the newspaper all the time.  Of course, I was reading a lot of other things.  And they were much more interesting than the books in the classes, and so I didn't really knock myself out to tell you the truth.
Story_ID: 13960
Speaker 1: And what kind of--what--did you have dreams and aspirations at this time when you were an elementary school student?  Were you thinking about what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  I know that my church life was important to me.  I used to go to a church in another neighborhood across town, and I enjoyed that a great deal.
Speaker 1: Tell me what some of your experiences in church were like?
Speaker 2: Oh, my experiences in church.  Well, first of all, the--at that time, to answer your earlier question, there was not a lot that a young African American kid could think about growing up to be, except being a teacher or a preacher or an undertaker or something like that.  You didn't even, even having a, a desire to be sports figure was not likely because there were--blacks were not in major league baseball and were not playing in the football leagues.  So I guess, I didn't think much, a whole lot about what I'd like to do, I don't think, except maybe some role in the church, maybe even preaching.  I was very active in the church.  I was a member of all the choirs from the junior choir all the way through the regular choirs.  And at a fairly young age, maybe fifteen or so, I became the, the person who read the announcements in my church.  I liked that.  That probably got me started in the field of communications as a matter of fact, by reading those announcements every Sunday.  I was good at that.  Oh, I could read those announcements.  And I also played on the church basketball team.  We had a little, a basketball team that played in the community, community conference.  So growing up was not, not really spectacular in those days for me.  I don't remember a whole lot about it, except I, I used to resent walking past the, the white kids going to school.  They would sometimes give racial taunts.  Sometimes I'd see them playing out in the street, playing touch football or something.  And one time they let me play with them, play football, and a parent, one of the parents saw it, and told them never to play with me again.  And though on both sides, there were white families, we knew one another's names; I think we spoke sometimes, but rarely, rarely did we speak.  I never went in anybody's house, and they never came into my house.  The most frightening experience for me in the, in the elementary years was going to a wake.  Someone died a few blocks away and my mother knew these people.  And I went to the, to the house prior to the, to the funeral (unclear) the next day.  It was my first wake, but I had no idea that the body was in the house with us.  I just, I knew there were a lot of people having a lot of fun, eating a lot of food and I was sort of an inquisitive kid.  And so I just kind of walked around the house after, from where, from the place where they were having the food.  And I, all of a sudden walked into the room with the body, and I'd never seen a dead person before.  And it scared me to death, and I had nightmares for weeks.  I can still see that coffin right now.  I remember the man's name, and it was a scary thing.  I wasn't expect--.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe eight or nine.  And I used to dream that this guy, the dead man, would come back and visit me often during the nights, 'cause I kind of invaded his room or something.
Story_ID: 13961
Speaker 1: Dr. Taylor, would you tell us your brother's name and how many years younger he is?
Speaker 2: My brother is Robert Taylor.  And I'm seven years older than he.  I don't normally tell people that.
Story_ID: 13962
Speaker 1: So, Dr. Taylor, tell me a little bit about high school.  What was high school like for you and what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Well, quite surprisingly, my high school was Howard High School (laughter).  You see, Howard got in my blood very early.  And I don't, I don't have a good history of it, but I often tell people, I think that it was also named for the Howard that was the founder of Howard University, and could have been a remnant of the Freedman's Bureau.  As you know, the Freedman's Bureau did establish a lot of schools and hospitals and other institutions around the American South.  But it was Howard High School.  It was a, a 10th-12th grade high school, all black.  It was, it was desegregated right after I graduated, but when I went, it was all black.  And it was, it took in students from all parts of town.  Excuse me--that was a very important moment for me because, by the time I went to high school, it brought together the East Side, the West side, the North side and the South side in this town.  My hometown had about a hundred and fifty thousand people in it, so it wasn't a little bitty place.  It was a, it was an urban area.  But it had a class demarcation.  I lived on the East Side, and the East Side for the most part, where I lived was where the more middle-class black families lived, for the most part.  That's not perfectly true because there were some working-class neighborhoods.  But on other sides of the town, particularly on the West side where my church was, and the South side, were thought to be more, what we would today call inner city, little tougher areas, from a, from a crime point of view, and people of lesser income.  But at the high school, we're all there together.  So I came in contact with a much broader segment of the community.  Something happened early in my high school career.  Now, high school started in the tenth grade for me, not ninth grade.  And when I was in the eleventh grade, this perhaps was the most defining moment of my life at the time.  I think I was about fifteen the eleventh grade.  So I finished high school very young.  One day listening to the radio, I was listening to this one African American--at that time black disc jockey, Negro disc jockey maybe, I forget what, when it was colored or Negro or black, but it was, by today's terms, African American disc jockey.  His name was Ted Bryant.  Ted Bryant was a pioneer in black radio.  He was the black announcer who had two hour--had a two-hour time slot at night to play rhythm and blues music.  At the time, most blacks that hear radio, hear, hear RnB on the radio, listened to a station out of Nashville, Tennessee that most blacks from my generation know, called Randy.  You've probably heard of it.  The station was WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee--50,000 watt, clear-channel station, heard all over the South and all blacks knew about Randy.  Actually, his name was Gene Noble, but Randy was a record shop in Galeton, Tennessee that sponsored Gene Noble.  So he was just known as Randy.  But there often were not local, local talents on the local station.  But WDXB radio hired Ted Bryant to do his own local version of black radio.  Well, he was gonna go on vacation in the summer between--I think it might have been my sophomore and junior year.  I can't really remember for sure.  I think it was between--I was probably no more than fourteen years old at most, maybe about to turn fifteen.  He was going on vacation and so he invited the audience to come in and do a, a tape as a contest to see who could replace him for two weeks.  So I was, you know, I was crazy, so, I'll do it.  So I went down to the hotel to, to do the try out, to do the taping.  And I won.  And so for two weeks, I replaced Ted Bryant on the radio station.  And, and remember now, I was fourteen or maybe, at most fifteen years old; never had any training in radio, or any experience, but Ted gave me some on-the-job training.  And in the audition, and I think I did a day or two with him, and he said, "You're on your own."  And the audience ratings for me were great for those two weeks because, first of all, all the kids in high school could identify with someone that they knew on radio.  And I was a fresh voice, and I was novelty.  It was almost like being in a circus I suppose.  Here was a teenager on radio, in his hometown, on a white station, mind you, playing this music.  And so when Ted came back, and time to take over his show again, the audience would call in because it was a call-in and also a write-in for asking for requests.  So I got a lot of people to write.  I didn't orchestrate this thing.  You can't let him go.  And so, as I recall, I would do one night a week--I think it was Saturday night; one night I got to do the show.  And I would, I would come in and join in with him sometime with him.  And it got me very interested in communications.  Well, the next year, during my junior year, there was a black radio station brought to my hometown.  There'd been basically two black radio stations in the South in the early '50s [1950s].  One was in Atlanta, I think it was WERD.  There was another one in Memphis.  I forget the name of that station.  But those were the two major ones.  But the smaller market began producing their own stations around '55 [1955] or there, '54 [1954], '55 [1955].  And they--one came to my hometown called WMFS.  And I immediately applied for a job there in high school, and I got a, got my own program.  And I did a show called "King Time".  It came on between, I think 4:00 and 5:00 every day, and it was a block from my high school, the station.  And they built, the way they built the studio, they built a kind of a window.  You could come in and watch the jocks on the air.  And so at 4:00, about 3:30, I'd leave high school, and I'd walk this one block to do my show.  And, of course, I'd have a trail of teenagers following me who watched me in the studio.  So I had one heck of a following.  And I, I put together a lot of couples.  This is for John and Mary, "Don't You Know I Love You" (laughter).  And I had all the, Wynonie Harris and oh, all, all the great stars of the day, Ruth Brown and early Sam Cooke and all that, and I'd play all that music and a little trash talking in the middle.  It was at, it was at the threshold of rock & roll emerging when white audiences began to pick up on rhythm and blues and rhythm and blues became rock & roll  and Elvis Presley and all that.  That was before this, slightly before that time.  But that got me very interested in, in radio and communications.
Story_ID: 13963
Speaker 1: However, I knew that I didn't want to do that [radio and communications] for a career.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Well, at that time, I knew I was gonna go to coll--I figured I was gonna go to college; clearly, you didn't need a college degree to do this cause I was doing it in high school.  And there was nobody, no African American at all in the United States doing anything but jock stuff.  I mean nobody was on network news.  Nobody was on, on national radio doing news or anything like that.  And so I thought that it was a dead end.  It was just a means to an end, and I enjoyed doing it, but it wasn't something I was gonna do the rest of my life.  As it turned out, another well-known person from the area also was doing radio on the same station, who later became a well-known writer and actually, a professor here at Howard, Sam Yette.  Sam Yette was on that same station, and he was a, he later became a teacher with my mother, no less, and we ended up at the same university and the same school of communications about twenty years later.  It's really ironic.
Speaker 2: So after high school, as you said, you knew you were going to college.
Speaker 1: Pretty much, you know, and in, in my hometown--and this was kind of a remnant of most of--most black high schools in the South.  You are going to college.  It was not are you going?  It was where you're--where are you going?  And we had a very high--my high school had a very high college destination record.  In fact, it was almost unheard of to not go to college somewhere.  Most went to Tennessee State [University], where I knew I did not want to go because everybody went there; Morehouse [College], which I didn't want to go there either 'cause the other group went there, or Fisk [University].  I always like to be, I was always one who sort of liked to be different.  Maybe that grew up--maybe that grew out of the fact that I grew up in a neighborhood that was different.  I didn't live in a neighborhood like everybody else.  I didn't have the same leisure-time activities everybody else.  I did the radio thing, the only one doing that.  So I kind of enjoyed being the only one or the first to do something or to break out and do something different.  But so, I didn't know where I was going to school.  I just knew where I was not going.  Of course, it was no option of going to the predominantly white institutions.  And so I thought I--and I wanted to get a long way from Chattanooga.  So I went a long away to Hampton, then Institute, in Virginia.  I only knew three other people who had gone there.  One was one of the teachers in the school who kind of pushed me to go, but the real reason I went was that I took an examination when I was a senior in high school.  And from the examination, Hampton offered me a scholarship.  I was not the world's greatest student.  I might have had a, maybe a B-plus average, somewhere between a B and a C.  It wasn't stellar, but I knew a lot--at least I thought I did.  And I could do that test.  I did, got, did very well on that test.  And it was based upon my outside of class readings and my newspaper reading, and I think my basic abilities.  It was good enough to get me a full tuition scholarship to Hampton [Institute, now University].  And so I went to Hampton.
Story_ID: 13964
Speaker 1: And what was life like at Hampton [Institute, now University]?
Speaker 2: Well, Hampton represented the first time away from home, and I was, I was very young, sixteen.  And it seemed like a long way away.  Going out of town for me at that time meant going down to Alabama.  I could get there in the car in three hours, four hours.  But I took a train, a long--my first long train ride, all the way to Hampton.  It took hours, seemed like, and while Virginia is a Southern state, it was unlike Tennessee, particularly, that part of Virginia because it was the peninsula part of Virginia, very different from the piedmont part of Virginia.  And they ate different food, like a lot of seafood.  I'd eaten seafood, but it was from the gulf.  It was a different kind of seafood.  I'd never eaten oysters and, and the clams, things like that.  It also put me in touch with black students from other parts of the country.  Hampton has always had a strong tradition of getting a lot of students from D.C. and Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York; urban blacks from the Northeast.  And I had never met anybody like them.  And they seemed different to me.  Their dress was different.  Their style was different.  They were much more urban than what I had known.  Hampton was a, also another strict place.  They didn't allow us to leave campus if--boys or girls, after 6:00 o'clock, as I recall, on weekdays.  The girls, I know, definitely had to be on campus by 6:00.  Girls couldn't ride in cars.  You go see your girlfriend, you had to go visit her in the parlor and sit there and, I guess, talk about current events.  It was a very proper place as I recall.  Hampton was a place that really--very good liberal arts college, but also spent a good deal of time teaching one the manners of being an educated person.  Rather interesting because it was founded by Samuel, Samuel Chapman Armstrong, and it was a place that Booker T. Washington used to build Tuskegee as a model.  And Hampton did have, at the time, all the trades, you know, tailoring and auto mechanics, and all of that.  But it did have, at the same time, a very strong liberal arts college component to it as well.  And it, it did emphasize the academics.  And so I, I enjoyed the competition there.  I did much better there than I'd done in high school, and I knew my high school was very good.  But I, towards the end of my junior year, I knew I wanted to do something different--again, liked being different.  And so we had an exchange program at Hampton which allowed students to go to an all-white, predominantly white liberal arts college in another--in the Northern United States in return for one of their students coming South.  This was the, now, the late '50s [1950s].  And that was unusual because this--the environment around the place was totally segregated.  And so I signed up for the exchange program.  I wanted to go somewhere else.  I was, I wanted to compete against white students.  I wanted to see whether it was really true that they were smarter than I was, and I was inferior by definition.  And so I signed up in my junior year to go to Dennison University in Ohio, where I went during my junior year.  There were three, three black students there.  I made the third.  Actually, there was one.  Two of us were exchange students, one from Howard and one from Hampton.  I was the one from Hampton.  And it was an all-white town.  And the deal was that the student who went on the exchange program should have the same experiences that they had at their home institution.  But I was a fraternity guy, Kappa Alpha Psi, which meant I had to be in a fraternity at the other campus.  And so I had to become an honorary member of a white fraternity in the '50s [1950s], Delta Upsilon Fraternity, and I lived in the house around all white guys.  And it was the most important recognition of self experience of my college years, the Dennison years.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned I could compete with whites.  I did better there than I did at Hampton, quite frankly.  It was easier to me.  But I also learned how to live in another culture.  I learned about--that all whites were not alike, that I found I could see a differential, I could get them--I could see them up close.  I had a lot of chances to talk with them about what they felt.  Most--I learned how, how they thought, how they communicated, hadn't had that experience.  And it helped me later when I went to graduate school because I had learned how, how the game was played on their turf.  And because I was an exchange students, I was treated with a lot of difference.  So I got to really see a lot of it.  I learned about the language, I learned about the culture.  I learned about what they valued.  I learned about the differences of the students.  And so I learned how to compete, and I knew I could compete, and I could compete well.  So at that point, I knew I could knew I could do anything from an academic side.  And that was a very important experience for me.
Story_ID: 13965
Speaker 1: And after you left Hampton [Institute, now University], you went on to graduate school at Indiana University.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were your years at Indiana University like?
Speaker 2: Wow, and now we're into the '60s [1960s].  Again, being different, when I finished Hampton, I knew I wanted to not live in the South.  I had been offered some jobs like all my classmates, like teaching school.  And my first offer was Falls Church, Virginia.  The schools in Virginia were not integrated, even in the late '50s [1950s], and Virginia was leading the way to not have integration.  I recall massive resistance very well, and I didn't want to live in Virginia.  I didn't want to live anywhere in the South, and I did not want to be a teacher like everybody else.  So I was gonna go to the promised land, you know, not realizing, of course, discrimination was as rampant in the Northern states as the Southern states.  So I chose to go to the home of the Ku Klux Klan, the state of Indiana; didn't know that either.  Nobody told me that.  But I did know it was North of the mex--the Mason-Dixon line, and I applied for jobs all over the country.  And one was in Fort Wayne, Indiana, never been there a day in life.  And I got this job in Fort Wayne, Indiana as a speech therapist in a school for mentally retarded.  It was my first job, and during the first year, I had a boss who I didn't think was very good, and I thought was, really not as smart as I was, but he had a Master's degree.  And I decided that if I was gonna have to work--if I didn't get a Master's degree myself, I was gonna work under a guy like this for the rest of my life.  And so I got a scholarship from the State of Indiana, Department of Mental Health to get a Master's degree, and I went down to Indiana University to get the degree.  So I went there for two years, and learned about--all these years, I was learning about discrimination Northern style, housing discrimination, job discrimination and discrimination on campuses.  I, I learned that--when I went to Indiana University, for example, I learned that the only place you can get a hair cut--I needed them at that time, but I don't need them any more, was in the student union building because you couldn't get one in the city, even from the black barber in town.  He wouldn't cut black hair.  He would cut white hair cause he was afraid if he would cut black hair, the whites would stop coming to his barbershop.  I learned about the fact that there were no black faculty members at university.  And I learned that just a few years earlier, blacks did not even really live in the dorms, in the '40s [1940s], fifty--early '50s [1950s]--well the '40s [1940s] for sure.  And I joined the NAACP chapter on campus there and began to combat the racism that existed in the city and in the campus, on the campus, and learned that discrimination was a national--I, it seems sort of silly to say, you sort of should know that the segregation--the discrimination was not limited to the Southern U.S., but many of us in the South in those days had believed the myth, just before Malcolm X had taught us that the Mason-Dixon line started at the Canadian border.  Actually, it was North of that too, but, you know, it was not well known to me the kinds of discrimination or kinds of exclusion that occurred, was occurring.  And just one other little point about Indiana, at the time if you applied for the dorms, blacks could live in the dorms by the time I got there, you had to, you had to indicate race on your application and send a picture.  And so the segregation occurred by how the housing office would match roommates at that time.  So these things became cumulative, and, and so a number of us on the campus there decided that we were going to really take on discrimination Northern style.  That was the political and the social side of being in Indiana.  The academic side was great.  It was a chance to be in a large, Big Ten university, really a wonderful university, and to compete with students from across the United States and a major research university.  And I did very well.  And I was always amazed by each one of these I took.  They seemed--it helped to reinforce the fact that people had lied to me all along about how inferior black folk were.
Speaker 1: And how did you take on discrimination?
Speaker 2: The NAACP chapter actually did sit-in's.  The best example I can recall, back to the barbershop thing again, we were determined to get haircuts.  We were determined to get haircuts.  And so we decided to go around and test, the NAACP campus chapter, barbershops in the city, to see if they'd cut our hair.  We knew they wouldn't.  And when we had found the, we had gone to the Indiana State code around getting a license to be a barber.  And nothing in the barber's license said you were qualified to only cut white hair.  So--and these white barbers were gonna tell us they didn't know how to do it, is what they would tell us, we're gonna challenge their license and get 'em closed down because if they admitted they couldn't do it, that meant they weren't qualified to have a license, which meant they'll have the license revoked and they have to close the shop.  So we would around, and we would just pestered, and, of course, they wouldn't cut our hair and tell they wouldn't do it.  And so then we had a--we told what we were gonna do.  We're gonna, you know, we brought out the charter for the license, and said, well, if you can't cut the hair, I guess that means that we report to the state commission on barbering, whatever it was called, you're gonna lose your license.  I don't know what you guys are gonna do when we do that.  We fully intend to do that.  And so they had a meeting somewhere, and they announced in grand fashion that a certain day they were gonna cut everybody's hair.  We were really quite militant at the time.  But when we went for the test to see if they would do it--we, we didn't get our cut ourselves.  We took our kids and had them, the babies get their hair cut, just in case they messed it up.  But they--we broke down discrimination in 1961, as I recall, of barbers in Bloomington, Indiana.  That's just one example of how we did it.
Story_ID: 13966
Speaker 1: And after you left Indiana, did you go on to [University of] Michigan then?
Speaker 2: No, what happened was I went there to get a masters, and I got it.  And I went back to this job in Fort Wayne [Indiana] that I mentioned earlier.  And by the time I got back, that guy who really wasn't very good, had stepped aside, and I got the job.  I became the director of this particular clinic.  I did that for two years.
Speaker 1: Was it unusual to have an African American working in the field of speech therapy?
Speaker 2: Very unusual.
Speaker 1: What was that like as an African American working in that field?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all I'd never heard, heard of the field until I went to college.  And I had always liked communications, and they had a major in communications which I gravitated toward.  And, again, liking to be different, one professor said one day, have you heard about this field called speech therapy or speech correction it was called then.  I said, no; said, what is it?  And he said, well, it's, you know, it's when you kind of provide therapy to people whose speech wasn't normal, and sometimes because they have emotional problems, sometimes because of brain damage and sometimes because of developmental disorders.  I said, wow, that's different, so I'll, I'll major in that.  I won't, I won't do the other part of communications.  Again, this being different theme again.  So I picked it up just mainly for that reason.  When I went to Indiana University to work on the degree, yes, it was unusual.  At that time, there was reported to have been one person with PhD in the field, but I didn't never know the--I never knew that person.  There were no faculty, of course, there.  And there was, there had been a report of one previous African American student in the department.  But when I was there--when I first got there, there were none.  But after I got there, one came along, and I think two came along after me, after--when I was still in the department.  But what was important about it, again, a very, sort of a life-changing experience, we had a number of international students in Indiana at the time, and they were doing their studies in English, but their first language had been something else; maybe it had been Portuguese from Brazil or maybe they knew Spanish.  So they had a speech pattern that was reflective of their first language, so you had Brazilian students speaking Portuguese influenced English.  And, of course, their pronunciations weren't the same as ours.  And at the time, the, the tests that were given to students in terms of whether they were normal or not normal, presumed an English-based first language.  So the result was all of these foreign students were labeled as having a speech impediment.  And they were all referred to me to fix.  So for the first time that I'm meeting up close and close and personal Brazilians, or people El Salvador, and I'd talk with them.  Of course, their, their grammar and their pronunciation patterns did differ from American English, but they were not disordered patterns.  They were predictable patterns, based upon having spoken another language first.  Why is that important for me?  Much of my research that really catapulted me to prominence in this field, when I started doing research on the influence of a first language and a second language and began to lead a group of folk to challenge traditional definitions about what was abnormal speech and move--it was a movement that led eventually toward bilingual education and a greater understanding about dialect variation even, even among African Americans, who were also labeled as having a speech disorder because they reflected Southern speech or Africanized English in their speech, and that really has revolutionized the field.  And that's really why Orlando Taylor got to be known because I was one of the first people to do work in this area.  But that experience at Indiana, where I had an opportunity to first-hand deal with people who were being discriminated against because of their speech, legitimate speech, led me to raise questions about the field.
Story_ID: 13967
Speaker 1: And in the early '70s [1970s], you began doing more--?
Speaker 2: I did that work, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and also some work around Ebonics, what's known as Ebonics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about what Ebonics is and some of your research in the early '70s [1970s] on Ebonics because we really weren't talking a lot about Ebonics during the early '70s [1970s]
Speaker 2: We were not, we were not.  Well, a key point of getting ready for that was that I decided, once I got this masters degree in Indiana, I went back to work in Fort Wayne, that I didn't know quite enough.  And so a variety of things happened that made decide to go back and get a PhD.  And I initially thought I would do it at Purdue [University], but Purdue didn't quite have what I wanted.  Besides, I didn't really particularly want to live in the same state much longer.  And I decided that the person I really wanted to work with was at [University of] Michigan, Ron Tykosky (ph.) who was my mentor.  And at that time, my interest was in, was the brain and language.  I was interested in how the brain functioned, that made it possible to be, to occur.  And particularly, how the brain functioned in different cultural settings, you know, and whether you grew in Bra--if you grew up in Brazil, your brain would, would wire itself, if you will, to become a Brazilian speaker without any formal training, without any formal classes, you'd become a Brazilian speaker.  If you grew up in Moscow, you'd--the brain would wire itself to be a Russian speaker.  If you grew up in the American South, you have a Southern accent; grew up in New England, you'd have a New England accent.  So I was fascinated with how the brain was structured that made language production and comprehension normal, but also why--how, what would happ--what were the mechanisms that govern what happened if you had brain damage, whether it was from a car accident, had a head injury or a stroke or just got old and, and dementia set in.  I was curious about the decline of language as a result of change in the ner--in the nervous system.  And Michigan, and this fellow Ron Tykosky had, I thought, the best program in the country.  So I went to Michigan to do a PhD.
Story_ID: 13968
Speaker 1: So, Dr. Taylor, let's talk a little bit about Ebonics and--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --we talked--let's talk a little bit about how the phrase was coined--.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --and about what year was that and how was it coined?
Speaker 2: Well, to be in--to begin with, particularly with regard to my own career, after having gotten a PhD at  [University of] Michigan with a focus on brain and language, most of us who were African Americans were caught up into the whole civil rights moment.  And we started asking ourselves, how can I use my little part of the world, my discipline, my profession to contribute to this major social movement.  And so I was in language.  And I'd had this experience with the Brazilians at Indiana ten years earlier, and I knew, having grown up in the South how much people had been ridicules--how much black speech had been ridiculed.  I was aware of minstrel shows and how whites in black face in early film would present negative caricatures of black folk.  I was aware of images of film in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] of black folk always appearing to not be able to speak very well.  I was aware when I grew up in the South how black Southerners, as they moved North, would work real hard to not sound Southern or to not sound country.  I was aware of going to Hampton [Inistitute, now University], how Northern blacks would tease the Southern, more Southern blacks with us at Hampton who pronounced words in a way that they thought was different.  So there was this whole negative thing laid on black folk in my view around speech.  And we had, we had spent a lot of time trying to, to not sound certain ways.  And also at Indiana University I'd become aware of how whites would perceive blacks as being smarter, if they didn't have a black accent and how proud black parents felt when somebody would tell them that their children sounded so nice, why, you can't even tell they're black.  And you say, oh, thank you, cause that--so the whole marker of being linguistically advanced was to have Northern speech, have white speech.  And yet I had learned by this point that all people's speech was based upon the historical roots of their language.  And so in the nineteen, in the early 1970s, a number of people--Geneva Smitherman (ph.) is one that comes to mind and, and Bob Williams who was a psychologist out at Washington University in St. Louis, were called together to--for a conference in St. Louis at Wash U to look at the scientific evidence around black speech.  As it turned out, there had been some earlier work done by a very well-known scholar, Lorenzo Turner, in the 1930s, long before my time, who had done work on African survivals in black Southern speech.  He had done work on the Gullah dialect off the coast of South Carolina, the coast of South Carolina and Georgia; speech that was the vernacular referred to as Geechie  speech and people talking like a Geechie was often referred to, derisively I might add, it was really a put down, but, in fact, it was the most Africanized speech in the United States.  And we perceived it as being ignorant and bad, but it really was out of, African origin.  We were at this point into looking for African origins.  Well, heck, the most African, one of the most African remnants that we have in America was the, was in speech.  And so many of us had begun to do research on how these Africanisms not only came--were brought to the United States, but had survived as a result of segregation and plantation life and separatism in America, got reinforced over time into modern American English.  And we thought that some of these forms that had been previously defined as being just bad speech or lazy speech or speech produced by folk whose lips were too big or tongues were too thick, really had an African origin to it.  So building up on Lorenzo Turner's work and later the work of Melville [J.] Herskovits who wrote a very important book called "The Myth of the Negro Past", we started looking at contemporary African American speech, looking for African origin and suggesting that part of the things that we had seen were not because we were lazy, but were quite explainable by historical facts.  Somebody in the room at the time, before that, before that event occurred, we had been referring to this speech in various ways.  Sometimes it was called Negro nonstandard English; often it was called black English.  And there were a lot of problems with all of these terms.  Somebody said, why don't we get a term that's somewhat neutral?  And why not--you know, if you say Ebony is black and phonics refers to sound, how about getting, coining a word that would combine blackness with phonics or blackness with sound.  So Ebonics, from ebony, the Ebo part, and the '-onics' part from phonics.  And so the word was coined in about 1972 in a book that was published by, edited by Bob Williams.
Story_ID: 13969
Speaker 1: Now, the term was very controversial at the, at the time--still is, and many of us don't use it any more.  But the controversy was really around two important variables.  Number one, to suggest anything black and of African origins by definition was controversial.  It was problematic.  And secondly, it implied that all African Americans spoke it.  That's another problem with it.  It's like saying white English as if there's only one English.  And so many people objected to any term that was, seemed to be so universal that to be black, you got to talk that way.  And it's a third controversy around the fact that it took the most vernacular of black speech and gave it the term black speech and it discredited what we might call educated black speech, the educated Americans--black American speech because while it offered--also had characteristics that were ethnically identifiable, they were not non-standard.  And almost all of the definitions of Ebonics focused on the non-standard things like, things like 'twenty cent' for twenty cents or "I'mo" for I'm going to, for example, and educated blacks said, hey, we don't, we don't talk like that.  And, of course, we might if we're being very informal and off the record and at somebody's house, having a little fun and the lights are turned down, and we let our hair down, and we might say a little "I'mo's" ourselves.  But in public speech, we would not engage in that kind of speech.  So, therefore, it became, it was offensive to many segments of the African American community.  And to this day, it's a lot of controversy surrounding it because people just hear it, it's just "not talking right"--.
Speaker 2: And Dr.--
Speaker 1: --and talking lazy and, and not, not adhering to standards.  But, in fact, every culture has a vernacular form.  People are informal, when they let their hair down.  And sometimes, most people, when they go to the vernacular speech, will use speech that is not the elevated kind of speech that is used in the public domain.  That's been explained well to the American people, and therefore, we still have a lot of problems with definition.
Speaker 2: And Dean Taylor, do you think that that's one of the challenges with Ebonics is, just like you said, in every culture people become relaxed and comfortable and may not enunciate as they normally would, but is that one of the challenges with Ebonics because sometimes in the African American culture, that's the, the type of speech that is used all the time?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  You see the problem that we are facing, we, we've allowed the definition of language variation to suggest that you talk one way all the time, when, in fact, to be a successful person you have to have speech to fit the occasion.  And so it would be a terrible myth, a terrible, a terrible lesson to teach inner-city black youth, for example, that this kind of speech is, will work all the time because it won't.  It may work on a basketball court, but it won't work in a college classroom, for example.
Speaker 2: How do we overcome that?
Speaker 1: I think we've got to, first of all do a better job of educating the public, but more importantly, we've got to build a pedagogy of teaching language which builds upon what people bring to a classroom, to teach them something else, without teaching them that what they brought was inferior.  Many students rebel against the teaching of the school's language because they perceive it as having to give up something.  And they have peer pressure saying, you need this language to be a part of the community, of being a part of the, of being a "brother", if you will.  So there's a strong pressure for that, but the school language should not be taught in that way.  The school language needs to be taught in a way which says there's a time and place for all language.  There is an educated form of speech.  When you're in a formal setting or in the public domain, you'll speak that.  That's like teaching English as a second language by people who speak Spanish as their first language, that Spanish is bad.  Forget your Spanish, learn English.  Well, that's a bad (move?) (unclear) because people don't want to give up their first language.  But if you say you can speak both, become fluent in both--there's a time and place for, for both, and you just decide which is appropriate, then the person doesn't have to give up anything to learn another way of communication.  So the model that many of us have argued for is a form of education which clearly states, clearly states, our kids have to learn the language of education and learn it well; no debate about that.  And at the same time, we would argue that you can maintain your other forms of language that fit those other occasions, if you wish, and, in fact, we'll even use those forms as a backdrop for teaching you the contrast required to teach you the language of education.  That's been a hard sell.  We've been trying to sell it for thirty-five years.
Speaker 2: And that's what I was gonna ask you.  So twenty, nearly twenty-five years after the term Ebonics was coined, how are we doing?  Are we making any progress?  What are some of the changes that you've seen in terms of language and how it's used in the African American community over the last nearly twenty-five years?
Speaker 1: Well, in some school districts we have had some rather impressive strategies for teaching language which take into account the language brought to school as a, as a springboard for further learning, quite successfully, I might add in some, in some places.  We've not had large system-wide efforts, but we've had some pockets of positive change.  The sad fact is, however, that African American students, including many I might add, from middle-class neighborhoods, graduate from high schools without the competencies in language that are required for success at the college level and the professional world.  It's a sad fact.
Speaker 2: Whose fault is that?
Speaker 1: You could easily--your first blush, you'd say well, oh, just blame the teachers or we could blame the curriculum.  I think we, I would blame universities.  I would say we have not trained a cadre of teachers in universities to fully understand the richness of American, of the American English spoken in the United States, and how to use that language, those language div--that language diversity in a constructive way to teach the schools language.
Speaker 2: What responsibility do parents have?  What role do parents play?
Speaker 1: Well, the problem with parents, shouldn't put it like that, many parents themselves do not speak the, the language of education.  So to ask them to be, to be, to provide that support at home is a challenge because they, themselves, may not speak it.  I think the main, the main role of a parent is to be able to provide students, provide their students with the encouragement that would be required to say, we want you to learn how to use language in a way that will enhance your success in life.  And we want you to do--(unclear) well, (unclear) they must really inform their, their children that it's okay to learn another way of speaking.  In fact, it's to your advantage.  It's like saying to an English-speaking child, "it's to your advantage to speak another language," and three if you can, four if you must.  American kids, across the board, are limited, in my view, they're limited in the global society by being monolingual.  I think it's to one's advantage to be able to speak more than one language.  I would also say it's to one's advantage to speak more than one dialect of American English because as you move around the around, you're moving in different settings, you can move into them sometimes more easily if you're able to be versatile in your language.  So if you teach children that lesson, then you certainly can make the case very easily that one of the most important variations you must know to success--to survive in this country, is to speak standard American English.

Speaker 1: Dean Taylor, if you would, I'd like to move on a little bit to some of the work that you are currently doing here at Howard University.  Just in terms of some of the trailblazing that you've done in terms of language, you are pretty much doing that in terms research, and African Americans in, in the field of PhD's and that kind of thing.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well, my own life now has changed a good deal over the last decade and certainly insisting that our students can speak and write the language of education is a good part of what we still do.  At Howard, we still have a requirement that our graduate students, all of them, not just African American ones, must demonstrate competence in their writing skills.  We know that to get a graduate degree and to be unable to write the language of education would be an impediment.  And we are not going to graduate people who do not write at a level that is consistent with the expectations of an educated person.  That part is certainly true.  But what I've been involved in more recently in the last decade or so is really an aggressive effort to address the real, I think, embarrassing production of African American and Latino persons and women obtaining PhD degrees.  You might say, well, why is the PhD such a big thing?  Well, the PhD degree, number one, produces the core of individuals who will become the next generation of college and university faculty members.  And if we don't produce a critical mass of African Americans in mathematics or chemistry or history or English, we won't produce enough African Americans to populate the faculties of the almost 4,000 colleges and universities in this country, let alone the 106 HBCU's [historically black colleges and universities].  And just think about it for a moment.  Look a field like mathematics where we produce about African American PhD's a year, in a good year.  But there are almost 4,000 colleges in this country, all with math departments, all hire faculties and they lack PhD's.  So to do the math real easy, let's say, let's say we have fifteen a year, and let's say we had thirty--3,000 colleges and universities.  It's more than that.  It would take 200 years for every one of those institutions to get one African American black faculty member.  Like you say, it's 4,000, it's gonna be more than 200 years.  It's gonna be more like 275 years to get just one, and that's presuming several things now.  It presumes that no one will die in those 275 years.  If somebody dies, then that messes up the algorithm.  Oh, and let's presume that no one will take a job outside of our colleges or our universities.  They can't work for the government, can't work in a high school, can't, can't do that.  And it presumes also that they all choose to work in the United States.  They can't work outside the United States.  So the fact of the matter is, the probability of having an African American college faculty member at most universities in the United States, not just HBCU's, is a fantasy--won't happen.  So the only way to address this problem is to produce more African American PhD's for that field.  Another problem, this country has depended heavily upon international students to come to our universities and become members of our various professions.  But two very dangerous things are happening.  Number one, as a country, we're making it very difficult for these persons to come to the United States through our, with our visa regulations, making it very difficult.  Another thing that's happening is that many of these countries are developing their own universities, China, India, for example, Korea, for example, many African countries are developing their own universities.  And their students are staying at home.  So therefore, fewer come to us.  And the third thing is that other countries are attracting these students, New Zealand, Australia and so on--Canada, even to our North.  The result is that the national workforce of highly educated people is diminishing in terms of people who can contribute in future generations.  And the only way the United States as a nation could maintain its preeminence in science and, and the, and the arts is to produce more people of our citizens--more of our own citizens who have historically been shut out from higher education.  And so my mission now is partly a national mission, partly an African American community issue and party an HBCU issue.  We've just got to produce more people of color to obtain a, advance degrees, masters and doctoral so as to meet these national workforce needs and to also meet the needs of our institutions and to meet the fulfillment of the American dreams for all of our people.  So that's, that's the mission I'm on now, to do that.
Speaker 1: And currently Howard does--Howard University does produce more African American PhD's than any other institution in the country, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm very proud of that.  I'm proud and saddened by it at the same time.  Yes, Howard, indeed, is the nation's largest producer of African American PhD's, and that's true in most fields, I might add.  It's not just in a few fields, most fields.  But that, and a certain--that, that's the good news.  We're proud of that, and, but that's only about sixty a year.  We do about, about ninety a year total, but about sixty of those are African Americans.  But let me tell you some of the sad parts about it.  We have a short--we have a very small number of African American males.  That's a big problem.  But also the fact that we can be number one, speaks to how poorly the other schools are doing.  We're only an institution of 11,000, but there are many predominantly white institutions that have forty, fifty, 60,000 students, and if they did their fair share, based on their size, they would pass us.  But we want--we don't think we do enough.  So we're on a mission to increase our own numbers, but we have to challenge the other universities around the country, particularly, the big ten universities, which have very large enrollments, that they've got to do better too, because it's all of us working together that will result in meeting this major, national workforce requirement.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Wow, that's a, that's a challenging question.  One, one hope would be that we would, we would take full advantage of the opportunities that present themselves in this new century, that in areas where the train has not yet pulled completely out of the station.  There are a lot of new emerging disciplines, where there are so many opportunities.  I'll just take two quick ones.  The field of atmospheric science where we're looking at the impact of things like global warming as an emerging discipline that cuts across many fields, where there are not a lot of people, let alone African Americans working, if we can get more of our students to, to get in on the ground floor of that field, they'll have numerous opportunities.  Another one, of course, is all of the work that's taking place with the human genome and Howard, I'm proud to say, like atmospheric science has doctoral programs in that area as well.  We are learning a lot about diseases that may have a genetic base, the, the understanding of the structure of the human ge-genome that's led us to be able to do that.  We have an opportunity to find out about the high prevalence of things like breast cancer or hypertension or prostate cancer or diabetes in the African American community.  And we have a chance to produce African Americans with this kind of knowledge so they can assume leadership roles.  So that'd be my--that would be my first dream, that we will produce a cadre of African Americans who can take advantage of these opportunities and can, and who can help us meet these very serious problems that face our community.  That's number one.  Number, two, I would have a dream of African Americans contributing more to the global, the global issues that we see in society.  I recently had the occasion to take a trip Southern Africa, where we had a chance to talk with the people out there about the scourge of AIDS, HIV-AIDS, where life span has been significantly reduced and where a very high percentage of persons between fifteen and thirty-five years of age, are HIV positive.  I want, I envision African Americans understanding the global issues faced by African people and having a commitment to using their talents to, while addressing our local, domestic issues, will also have a desire to have a positive impact on global issues that impact the African American community.  And I guess the final one would be a dream of the society at large having a greater appreciation for what African Americans can contribute to, to the human condition.  People have certainly recognized us in entertainment and sports.  I want them to recognize us in, in our intellectual capacities, in our, our contributions to science and to medicine, to the social sciences and to the humanities.  I want to have--see African American thought and ideas become more widely embraced by the society at large because as we contribute to ourselves, we also can contribute to others and in so doing, all of us are elevated together.

Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, how would I like to be remembered?  Well, well, I would say I'd like to be remembered as one who was willing to break outside the box, and as you have heard during this conversation, I've been one who has spent a lifetime being outside the box.  And I would be remembered as one who expanded the horizons for the university, this university where I--which I love, Howard [University], and for encouraging African American students to think outside the traditional boxes and to try different pathways and to seek new horizons.  I would like to be remembered for that.  I would also like to be remembered as one who really helped to advance--and I say helped to advance Howard to the upper echelon of American higher education.  I'm still bothered when I, on a plane and someone says, say--when I tell him I'm from Howard and dean of the graduate school, who might ask me, "Does Howard offer PhD's?"  You don't ask that of the dean from Harvard or Johns Hopkins.  You ask it from the Howard dean.  And if I say, yes, they'll, they'll presume that the PhD's we award are in the social sciences and then in education.  And they're stunned when is say, oh, yes, we offer a PhD in atmospheric science.  Really?  Does Howard do that?  And that's disturbing because what it says is that there's a kind of latent, maybe not so latent, racism that surrounds what people externally perceive what a predominantly black institution can do.  And I want to be remembered as one who has, who has been an advocate, a disciple, a promoter of what, what Howard can be as an institution, that it properly belongs into the upper echelon of major research universities; that the Howard PhD should be revered like that of the other prestigious institutions in this country, and it is--and it should be.  I'm just asking for this, I'm not promoting this just because it's a nice to do.  It really deserves that, but because of racism in my view, in the country, people have a hard time believing that a predominantly black institution can produce--particularly in the sciences, can produce a product comparable to the most prestigious white institutions.  I'd like to be remembered as one who helped to change that picture.

Speaker 1: And why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: History as a discipline or the history of this institution?
Speaker 1: Well, history in relation to this particular project, of preserving African American history.  Why do you think that's important?
Speaker 2: Okay, I believe that truth, as we know it, most often is perceived through a lens, and the lens is a cultural lens.  And if a people, it's--if a people forgets, forget their history, then they will have visions through which--their vision of the future and their vision of truth will be marred.  If I could just think of it for a moment, I would suggest that we know more today about breast cancer because more women are getting PhD's in the biomedical sciences and because of their history with breast cancer and their own personal stories, when they look through a lens for truth, they bring an understanding about this awful disease from a gender perspective that I think has resulted in us having much better understanding about breast cancer today than we had thirty years ago when we had so few women studying in biomedical sciences.  Likewise, if I had more African Americans getting PhD's in biomedical sciences, I think we'd know more about sickle-cell disease because of this historical context.  We've known people with it; perhaps suffered from it ourselves, known what it's done to our communities.  We might prioritize that topic or we might, we might frame questions around the topic of sickle cell disease or we might design methodologies for doing our science that has grown out of that history.  So if you have a people that does not pay attention to its history, it will mar the visions, of their vision of the future, their vision in their quests for truth.  And that's why I want our students to always know who they are, where they came from, why some questions are important, how they've gone about examining those questions in the past, so they can sit at the table with other people who have their own stories, their own histories and it's together, in our discussing of truth, that we can find truth that can elevate all of humankind.

Speaker 1: And if you could in a minute, tell me what you hope your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: It's hard to write your own story like that (laughs).  Just one who just contributed to a long line of folk at this great university [HOward University], that has helped to make it what it is today, and what it will be in the future.  And I just, I'm just a player, along with a lot of other people, and that would be my legacy, that I believed the university, I believe in its colleagues--in my colleagues, and I certainly believe in its history.
