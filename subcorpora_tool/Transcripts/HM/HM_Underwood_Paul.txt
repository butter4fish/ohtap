Story_ID: 671403
Speaker 1: Okay, those are the questions that we slate with, we ask five other "People" Magazine-ish type questions we'd like to ask you.  Number one, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food are greens, turnips, seven top turnips in fact.

Speaker 1: And, is there a particular phrase or saying that that you like to adopt or use in your daily life?
Speaker 2: From daily life, it's mostly looking forward and keep climbing on each, keep climbing on each experience.
Story_ID: 671404
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna move into a few more questions.  I'd like to ask you a question about your, your background, starting with your mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Jacqueline Martin Underwood.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Sevierville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: In Sevierville, and some in Knoxville, Tennessee, and then in Marion, Alabama, they moved some during her childhood.
Speaker 1: What do you know, or what can you share with us about her background growing up as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, I believe that a lot of it was very rural and it's difficult to understand African Americans who grow up in, in the hills of Tennessee, so they're basically black hillbillies.  But her life seemed like it was fairly spartan, growing up in--without modern amenities as we would appreciate them now.  During her life there was a lot of mixture between, say the whites society as well as the African American society and you can see how that has been able to carry through without, throughout her, her time.  Her father was an educator and they had a grocery store in Marion, Alabama, then they moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, and he eventually became a dean at the Knoxville College and so she grew up pretty much on Knoxville College's campus, and in fact taught there for several years.
Speaker 1: How'd you describe your mother as a person?
Speaker 2: Well she's very loving.  She's a math professor, so that she's very strict and holds accounting very, very closely and so it's very easy to see how decision analyses are, are performed because it's like yes/no or logic type patterns.  But that's really the structure that I might have, more than likely comes from her.
Speaker 1: Are there any particular stories that she may have shared with you regarding her childhood growing up that you can recant for us today?
Speaker 2: Well the stories are typically about family life and how different people, parts of the family would interact with each other.  And in particular, how different groups, say if they had married into the Cherokee Indians which were very prevalent in the Sevierville area or they had married African Americans and how, you know, they were (unclear) or European Americans, some of the whites that were there, that how their experiences were different than say, her experiences.  The early childhood days, and particularly with our family, relates to a story that we tell about the slave owner who went to Charleston, South Carolina to buy some slaves and when he finished buying the slaves, the auction I guess had finished and the auctioneer had stated that there was a little boy there that was too young to sale and the slave owner from Sevierville said well he looks like he's about my sons age, so why don't I just take him and we can take him back and they can be playmates.  Well that actually turned out to be our ancestor, so, you know, seven or eight generations later, here we are and that's really how we came into being.  The early Sevierville, the blacks in Sevierville were brick masons, they made the bricks themselves and they actually went out and constructed many of the building in Sevierville, so that you see that, I mean physical, when you go to Sevierville, to see some of the old buildings, you can actually see physically what the family has done and you get to know pretty much how they got there and how long they've been there.
Speaker 1: Approximately, what, what is the closest major city to Sevierville?
Speaker 2: Knoxville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And how far would you say that is from Knoxville?
Speaker 2: About forty-five miles.
Story_ID: 671405
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about your father for a moment.  What was his, is, is his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Paul Lester Underwood, Sr.
Speaker 1: And where did he, where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Knoxville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: In Knoxville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories that he's related to you about his childhood growing up?
Speaker 2: Mostly just living in the, in the inner city area of Knoxville and a lot of the life of people who--the place is called Mechanicsville.  And so, people who are African American who may not be so affluent and the things that they would do as they were growing up through school, particularly coming through the service, meeting people and traveling back and forth to different other smaller cities, say Dandridge, Tennessee, or say Sevierville [Tennessee], other smaller cities and how the, the close knit black community was there because they really weren't accepted in the larger community.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about his personal life growing up in his family home?
Speaker 2: Well, he had a brother and he, in terms of the schools, I think they went through school very well, they both served time in the [U.S.] Army and then really went into the professional world and federal agencies.  My uncle was a post, a postman and my father was a deputy marshal and so there was--he was a fire fighter at one time when I was born and this is during the time of civil rights, there was an issue with his--they had colored battalions, so they had colored units and then, say, I guess, white units, but that his shifts were on, then the colored units would always be second shift and third shift, and so he complained and said that he really wanted to work at the, one of the other battalions, not necessarily in the colored battalions, so this is the first part of integration and I think he actually formed a law suit against the fire department in Knoxville, and during that time he was suspended.  During his period of suspension is when he actually joined the marshal service and so there was a--it's very early on and even throughout his life and my, my mother, they've always taught us to kind of, to look into where we need to be and not necessarily accept authority to tell us where we should be.
Story_ID: 671406
Speaker 1: And will we--we'll go back over that part again later as we go through your life growing up in the time period in conjunction with his life.  However, where did your parents meet and when, do you know?
Speaker 2: I believe they met in college, sometime around their college days, they both went to Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee].  My father [Paul Underwood, Sr.] was a little older and I think that, that's around the time that they met, my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] after she finished school, spent some time in Egypt and Alexandria, she taught with Schutz Academy, it's an American school that was in Egypt and that was during the time of the Suez Crisis, so I believe that they knew each other then and then when she returned, during the time of the Suez Crisis, when she returned to the United States, they got married.
Story_ID: 671407
Speaker 1: Okay, now you mentioned that you had some stories regarding maybe eight generations back and, and some slave purchasing in, in Sevierville [Tennessee], or--
Speaker 2: Those are gifts (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --Now, how far can you go back in your ancestry?
Speaker 2: That's as far back as I can get on my mother's side, is back to when the slave master, slave owner went to pick up Whit[ph.] is his name, from the, from the auction blocks in Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: How far back can you go on her side as far as your grandparents, great grandparents, how far back can you personally go, like with names or, or names and interaction with people?
Speaker 2: Probably two generations, generations.  Interactions would be to say great grandparents in that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about your, your great grandmother on your mother's side.
Speaker 2: There's very little, (laughter) there's very--I really, I know them very little, but the--what I remember is that the times then were a lot different than they are now and what is described in some of these is that if they, some of them, if they had, if they were married to whites and then she recalls it that they would sleep on floors, the women would sleep on the floors, which we thought was very--that seems like it's almost like slave times again, but that was the relationship that they had within the house, it was very odd.
Speaker 1: So there was interracial marriage?
Speaker 2: There was--
Speaker 1: As far as back as your great grandmother?
Speaker 2: --Correct, correct and then along the same tier there would be Native American Cherokees and, and our family.  There were the African Americans in, in there as well.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories on how this was accepted?  Was it a closed issue?  Was it a hidden issue?  Was it the people were passing, they just didn't know?  Or was it very much in the open?  Do you--
Speaker 2: I think in that time it was probably very much in the open because people knew everybody in that time.  But I also think that, there was a lot of farming and people were on their farms and whatever you did on your farm was your, was basically your own business.  I know that some of the people in my mother's family did start passing, so to speak, and so they left in the '40s [1940's], and went to Paris [France] to dance because there weren't any dancing opportunities available for African Americans here, and they were able to go and dance with Josephine Baker and so they truly did pass.  And--
Speaker 1: --Are you able to know the names of, of, of, your great grandparents, do you know their names?
Speaker 2: I can find their names, I can--
Speaker 1: That's okay.  Now let's go to your grandparents--
Speaker 2: Um-Hum.
Speaker 1: --Your mom's mother and father, can you tell us a bit about them?
Speaker 2: Well my, my grandfather is a, was a, as long as I knew him, was a dean at a college and so he was always an educator.
Speaker 1: What school would that have been?
Speaker 2: Knoxville College, and so I knew him by going up to his office and seeing him and certainly with family affairs as well, but seeing him on campus and really growing up on Knoxville Colleges campus.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: Ralph, Ralph Martin.
Speaker 1: And, and your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother unfortunately was afflicted with multiple sclerosis and her name was Kit, she was called Kit, Kathryn [ph.] was her given name but, I think she said somethings when I was younger than four, but by the time that I was around four, she was really bed bound and I only re--recall going to visit her.  My grandfather took care of her throughout her life, going to visit her and never really getting any response back.  As she grew older, and this was when I was, let's say, in my early teens, she lived with us and she had episodes of heart failure, sudden heart failure, pulmonary edema.  And I think that was my first experience with having to have someone, you know, very ill in the house, calling the 911, the paramedics to come by and pick them up and go, go to the emergency room in the hospitals, then, you know, now I'm actually in that field, so I really have an appreciation for what it's like to family, to have to gather everything quickly, get everyone together, get in the car, call the ambulance, you know, and then go to the emergency room and sit and wait for someone to see if they're going to survive.
Speaker 1: Was that the beginning of your, of your, of your decision that you wanted to be a doctor one day?
Speaker 2: I don't think that that was the beginning of a decision that I had consciously, but in retrospect, I can say that that was my first experience of pulmonary edema, but it is an experience.  As I said earlier, with the affirmations that one thing leads to the other, leads to the other and so that we don't know what experiences we have here and how, how we're going to build on them and we have to be optimistic and look into the future, but that is certainly something that made me accepting of the idea.  It was actually my father [Paul Underwood, Sr.] that suggested that I go into medicine.
Story_ID: 671408
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your grandfa--your grandfather and your grandmother on your father's side.
Speaker 2: Um-Hum.
Speaker 1: Did you know them, and what where their names?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was Walter Underwood and my grandmother's name is Louise, and actually I didn't know her, her mother as well, because her mother, we called Ma Mag, Maggie Guyton [ph.] is her name, I lived with Louise and so--
Speaker 1: So that, so that would have been your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories or, or, or favorite times from, you know, or influential moments in your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, being with them was very important now and throughout life there's certain things that occurred.  Now, my great-grandmother was a guitarist, so she would play guitar and she'd have, use a fork (unclear) to slide guitar, well not a fork but a knife as a slide guitar and so, they tell me that, you know, when I was very young, I would play on the curtain strings and pluck 'em and started singing and have everyone be quiet so that they could hear me play.  Now, (laughter) little did I know that I would continue that on throughout--I don't sing though, but certainly playing bass is one of, has been one of my favorite avocations.  Also, my, my penchant for the greens, those seven top turnips is from my grandmother, we used to go out and pick seven tops and she would cook them.  So we, I, I've eaten lots of them throughout my life.
Speaker 1: Explain what a seven top turnip is?
Speaker 2: Well, a seven top turnip is a, it's a turnip but it--they're smaller turnips and they have seven buds that come from, just like you get seven row corn, you know, it's, it's just this particular type of turnip.  But it's a little more pungent, it's very pungent and people would call it a little bit more bitter than the typical turnips like, you know, that you would eat, and it has a distinctive flavor.  I like all greens, so kale, mustards, collards, they're all good, but if you ask me which ones specifically do I like, it would seven top turnips.
Story_ID: 671409
Speaker 1: So those are your grandparents and now we're gonna move into the early days of your life.
Speaker 2: Um-Hum.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest mem--your, your earliest moment or, or, or a memory that you can call up for us to bring back, that you can recall your earliest time?
Speaker 2: Well, just looking at pictures, it's probably is when my sister was born, and so--
Speaker 1: How old would you have been at that point?
Speaker 2: --Four, so and, and having to hold her and to have the little bottle and her, you know, or hold, hold her with the bottle.  I mean, I'm certain I don't remember very meant, much of those experiences, but that, that is true.  And then later on, growing up through, through, nursery school, you know, I've met some very good friends that we're still on, I'm still in contact with in nursery school.
Speaker 1: Who are some of those friends?
Speaker 2: Well one of them is Brian Whaley [ph.] he was actually the best man at our, in my, in our wedding and so, I met him in nursery school and we still talk now.
Speaker 1: So you actually met Brian at about two or three?
Speaker 2: No, I was four then, right.
Speaker 1: So, it'd be about--
Speaker 2: Four or five.
Speaker 1: --Nine, 1964 or so?
Speaker 2: Correct, exactly.
Speaker 1: So you and Brian have been friends ever since.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 671410
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So let's talk about the neighborhood, do you recall the street you grew up on?
Speaker 1: Well we had several houses, I think when I was very small, say, three or four years old, we lived on McCullough [ph.] Street, it was just a brick house on, near an area called Five Points, it's an area undergoing re--revitalization in Knoxville.  But I think that's really always been a hub bub of African American culture through, for Knoxville in that, in that area.
Speaker 2: What was life like in your community, and in your neighborhood?
Speaker 1: The life seemed to be very simple, it's just as a child growing up, you know, you go to school, come back and play with the friends that are around you, the later years, we moved from McCullough then we moved to a small house on Lansing, I called Lansing Street and then we moved to a house on Beaman, my, my father [Paul Underwood, Sr.] sold real estate also so, I guess maybe he had more of an interest in buying houses and then my high school days, you know, the house that we've kinda considered ours in growing up with is on Dandridge Ave. and so, there in Tennessee, there, there were woods beside our house and then there was an area of, a large area of woods that was very close by and a lot of the friends that I had, because at that time I had, had a bicycle and I would go out and so we had friends and to get together in the neighborhood, we would spend a lot of time going to a little creek that was in the back of the, of the--it was Tennessee School for the Deaf was the name of the school, but in the, in the woods that are associated with that we would spend quite a bit of time there playing in the woods and in the creek catching crayfish and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 671411
Speaker 1: And the larger community, we'll say Knoxville proper itself, what were racial, racial conflicts, or were there any racial conflicts, or what was the climate of Knoxville at that time?  This is the mid '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Correct, I think that the climate was probably a little more tense than I was able to aware, be aware of and I say that because I, I was on the, the avant-garde of integration.  My mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] would apply to have, have us transferred to schools out of our district.  So my first three years of school were at a Lutheran school, which was fine, so it was, it was very integrated so, you know, I'd always, at a young age been exposed to whites and considered them friends and as kids growing up there really weren't any, any racial tensions per se, not, not any more than, I think were unusual, you know, just, but, so you, were felt very comfortable being around whites at a young age there for the first three years, then I transferred to a public school that was in, around University of Tennessee, their main campus is in Knoxville, Tennessee, and so there were a lot of whites around there, my mother was taking some classes at UT so it was more convenient for her to have me go to school there and so that worked out pretty well too.  Then I went to a private school which was way out in, at that time, no man's land, certain things have developed around it now but, that was certainly predominately white as well, a different type of environment and then I graduated from the school in my neighborhood which was African American and so, you know, I had many different experiences throughout.  My parents also encouraged me to get involved with different things so, I'm not much of an athlete, but I have tried all the sports, so, I tried, you know, football for a bit and basketball at the Y[MCA], little league baseball, but the sport that I really like the most was ice hockey, so I spent, you know, several years playing ice hockey and as you can imagine, (laughter), there weren't very many African Americans doing that either.  So, that, in the, on the travel, I would go to other areas where they were predominately white as well and the tensions really weren't expressed on me personally, at least I don't perceive them, I'm sure that there were jeers here or there, people may have said things here or there but that's pretty much to be expected but nothing that was really a standard.  My mother does relate though that when they were have, having me going to go to different schools they applied for me to go to the Knoxville Country Day School and that, at that time they didn't have any black students and it was a time when school desegregation was taking place and apparently the board was in favor of accepting me, you know, it's, I was just a small kid, I didn't, I had no idea of this happening, but the board was in favor of accepting me, but the headmaster was not, and I think the headmaster held out and they didn't accept me and the board resigned.  So, shortly thereafter, they had other African Americans students there but that's what I'm saying, that I would be on the, the avant-garde of integration, but I didn't perceive it as happening to me as a person.
Speaker 1: So you felt that somewhat insulated from that?
Speaker 2: Right, right, I wasn't really aware, certainly my parents are, are very pro-communi--community, and we're, we grew up as African Americans, there's no doubt and we still hold the African American community as our community and we know very well of what goes on within the community.  So, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], you know, when he, he came through, you know, the opportunity to see him, to try, you know, it's my (unclear) so I do my children now, the way that they would try to make sure that I was aware of what the current state of affairs was is, is definite.  But it wasn't that I felt personally intimidated, you know, no one told me to get off the sidewalk, my house wasn't bombed, it's, it's mostly economic and really in trying to get, secure better employment, secure better housing and, and those fronts were where we pushed.
Story_ID: 671412
Speaker 1: Now, how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one sister and I have a half-brother.
Speaker 1: Could you list their names and also put your order of birth in, in, in the line please?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My sister is Carla [ph.] Underwood and she was born in, four years after me so, she's my younger sister and then my half-brother is Paul Lester Davis and he's two years older than me.
Story_ID: 671413
Speaker 1: What was life like in the Underwood household personally at that time?  Was it, what were the main things happening around holidays, special events, or what was the main theme of the household?
Speaker 2: The main theme of the household, I believe would be just productivity and work, definitely.  So, my parents both worked and then we would go to school, come back, we'd have chores that we were sup--that we were to perform, so, say for myself, cutting the grass, taking out the garbage, I did half of the dishes, you know, cleaning up, so it was basically productivity and so that's, that's why my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] can account for things very well, either you did it or you didn't do it and (laughter) that's the basic truth.  But fortunately with my, my father [Paul Underwood, Sr.], he did sell real estate and he was a broker so, I would have the opportunity to go with him to work on the houses, to tear off a roof, or to pour concrete for a driveway, you know, fixing plumbing, things of, things of that nature so that I had a chance to learn some degree of household maintenance and productivity and just what hard work really was.
Story_ID: 671414
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of, of, of spiritual worship or religion in your household?
Speaker 2: We went to church every Sunday, definitely and--
Speaker 1: And what, what church would that have been?
Speaker 2: It's a Presbyterian Church, Shiloh Presbyterian, and certainly I've had a lot more experiences with churches, but this is an African American church, but being Presbyterian, it was a lot quieter than a lot of the churches that we've attended since then.  The services were very brisk, one hour in, one hour out, but it's still our church.  When I was very young, as you bring back these memories of being four and five years old, the church was in a downtown area so it was a large church, you know, that, I mean just a large church, very popular, but then urban renewal came at that time and the church was torn down and replaced with the coliseum [Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum] that's in Knoxville [Tennessee] now and then we relocated to another church, which is for, even closer than, well closer to our house at that time, then the previous church, but that is an experience that I have in terms of having the church torn down and seeing the, the coliseum built on top of it.
Story_ID: 671415
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned your, your preschool or, or called the nursery school years, can you recall your first elementary school?
Speaker 2: I can.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: That was First Lutheran.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a school, at that time they--corporal punishment was still accepted so, I can say that I had my fair share of spankings.  I enjoyed class work, I, and my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] being an educator and her doctorates are in child[hood] education, she would often, I wouldn't say experiment on us, but bring us different interesting teaching tools to see how, how we responded to them, so I've, I think that perhaps fostered an interest in math and science for me and so it was fun.  Now, there are a few health issues that came up, that arose that were, that became evident during that time, one of them is that my vision is very bad and so I think that I would sometimes sit towards the close, towards the front of the class where I would be able to see the blackboard and apparently, once I wasn't able to get to, to the front of the class and I was in the back of the class and the teacher wrote an assignment on the board, and I, I wasn't able to see it, and so, I got into quite a bit of trouble for not completing the assignment and then it became apparent that my problem was I couldn't actually see the blackboard.
Speaker 1: What grade was this?
Speaker 2: This was probably around second grade.
Speaker 1: How long were you at this particular school?
Speaker 2: I was there for three years, but another very important health issue came up during that time also, because we had to clean our plates and so, I was, got caught giving my friend a sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich and I had--they made me eat it and I became very ill, so from then, we learned that I'm actually deathly allergic to peanuts, and that friend was Brian, he was at the, my, Brian (unclear) was my best friend and so he was, he was the one I was trying to get the sandwich to and I was, of course, intercepted and, you know, I, I blew up, couldn't, couldn't breath and had to call my mother, had to go see the allergist, take the skin test and find out that, you know, yes, I'm allergic to peanuts and took some allergy shots for a while for some other things, but I'm still very allergic to peanuts to this day.
Speaker 1: Had you had, had a previous experience prior to this on your own and just didn't know what it was and maybe it passed or--
Speaker 2: Well, obviously I never, I never cared for peanuts or else I would have eaten the sandwich myself, so I knew to give it to someone else, 'cause I really didn't want to eat it, so I, I didn't like them.  But my mother told me that, as I said earlier, my father [Paul Underwood, Sr.] was a fireman and he would work the late shifts and during the times that he was gone and she was pregnant with me, that she would eat a lot of peanut butter crackers and more than likely she exposed me to the peanut, the antigen, the protein on the peanut, at a time when in the womb, my immune system was developing and I likely was sensitized to peanuts at that time.
Speaker 1: So it's very possible that it was, it, it was pre, pre your actual birth.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now, this school, were there any teacher, was there a teacher or person who was very influential that you can recall and name today that had an influence on you?
Speaker 2: I think there was, Mrs. Duncan [ph.], I believe was her name, she was my third grade teacher and just, there's nothing special in terms of influence, it was just, I think, that was, that might've been around the time that I learned that my eyes were bad.  I believe I did get quite a bit of corporal punishment from her in different ways.  I remember rulers, and I remember the bolo paddle, (laughter) and so, and I, I was very clever.  I remember having to write something on the board, I misspelled a word, think it was spell and so I, I had to write it a hundred times, so I put S-P-E- and I wrote to long lines for the "L's" and she didn't like that very much, so (laughter) there was more, more corporal punishment, but I do remember her and she was, she was very nice, you know.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you, as far as your academic?
Speaker 2: I believe I was always a, a very good student, actually I've been graced, or, certainly at that time with the ability to score well on my test and so that allowed me to be perhaps more clever, the, you know, I, I enjoyed school, the coursework was easy but, because I had, was able to complete the school task, then I had time to do other activities as well.
Speaker 1: And what kind of child do you think you were at that time?  You, you mentioned somewhat of some corporal punishment, what kind of overall behaviorist were you at that time?
Speaker 2: I think I was well behaved, I never considered myself an unruly child, I believe that I may have been more clever and was just, would, challenge the system in ways, and that was likely the cause of corporal punishment, not because I was belligerent or, acting out or disruptive, I don't think I, I've ever been considered a disruptive person.
Speaker 1: Or, would you say maybe you somewhat soc--socially rebellious?
Speaker 2: In a small way perhaps, not socially, but the authority part or thinking of other ways of completing the task, like with that word spell, I mean, what I did was correct, it's just that, it wasn't what she had in mind.
Story_ID: 671416
Speaker 1: So you're here at the elementary school and this is a Lutheran school, you're there for three years?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Then where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to public school that was in the, in the area, in the neighborhood of the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee], it was Ft Sanders School.
Speaker 1: And how long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there for three years, through six grade.
Speaker 1: Were there any, any highlights that you'd like to share of that experience or any people that stand out, friends or teachers?
Speaker 2: Well, my teacher, my fifth grade teacher, I recall, my memory's getting hazy, but that was Mrs. Elkins [ph.] and she was very nice.  I do recall that I was in (unclear) at the time so I had some degree of, you know, socialization, but that, it was, that was, I guess, grade school wide or grade wide, so we'd go on fieldtrips and different places and on one of the fieldtrips we went to the Smokey Mountains and on the walking back from Mount Clingmans Dome, we had, interacted with some people that were there on a fieldtrip from Job Corps and a young man--
Story_ID: 100297
Speaker 1: Now you're in the Smokey Mountains on a, on a camping trip and you met some people, could you go and bring us forward now?
Speaker 2: Well, this, this was, it wasn't really a camping trip, it was just a field trip during the day, so when you go to the mountains hike I think it's two or three miles up to Clingmans Dome, lookout, then hike back to the bus.  And on the way back we encountered some people who did the same thing that were from Job Corps and, well I guess, I, as I said before, that there weren't any racial act--actions, (laughter) but this, I suppose was a racial action, but the individual came over, this guy came over and held a, a little razor blade to my neck and said, you know, hey, you know, "N" boy, you know, give me your watch and so, I had a little Timex watch on, so, you know, I gave him my watch and then he went off his way with his friends and I walked down the bus, so when I got to the bus I complained that, you know, someone had, you know, mugged me and they were very concerned and, you know, they asked, who was it?  And I said, I don't know, but, you know, it was with that group, you know, the Job Corps people, and so they lined them all up and had 'em go to the bus individually and eventually, I got my watch back, and went on about my business but--
Speaker 1: Justice.
Speaker 2: (Laughter), --Right.  But, you know, they say that, you know, certainly neighborhoods in Knoxville at the time, there was a somewhat rough element and I've been in, in many, many different places, I'm very urban so I like cities, and so the dangers that come about in travel, the time that I've had my worst experience is actually, I mean, this is when I was small, I was in the mountains and I was mugged by a white person.  It wasn't the, the, the carjackings and, I know that are common perhaps in, in our communities, but that's not the experiences that I've had with armed crime against me.
Speaker 1: How old were you and what grade were you in around then?
Speaker 2: I was in fifth grade then, so I was probably, I'd say about ten, eleven years old or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stayed at this school between--for, for three grades I think you said.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 100298
Speaker 1: And at that point was there a junior high system or?
Speaker 2: Well there was at that time and so I left, when I finished at Fort Sanders, then I was at the private school which is Webb School of Knoxville, and that was, that school we had to wear ties every day and I believe for assembly, we had to have the jackets on.  It was very, it was a very nice school, you know, high academic standards, I played football, I tried to play football, I, I would play football during the early fall and then when hockey season came on then I would stop football and go and play hockey.
Speaker 1: Was your decision to go to Webb, or the decision to go to Webb, your parents decided that maybe now it was time to put you in a more sheltered environment?
Speaker 2: I'm not really sure of what motivated them, I'm not really--I don't know if that was sheltering me or if it was just to try to make sure that the academic standards were upheld.  Remember, I said that I was very clever and the school, and the schoolwork was easy for me.  And so, my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] being the educator would want the work to challenge me, and so she challenged me.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay at Webb?
Speaker 2: I was at Webb for three years.  Through the ninth grade and I, I did well, I certainly didn't excel in school, but I, I did well.  And, you know, and I developed some very good study skills at that time and, that was the time that I was also being active with my friends in the neighborhood that I was growing up, and Webb School was about, say thirty, like thirty miles away from our house and so there was quite a bit of time that, you know, we'd spend on the bus going out there, coming back, one of my friends, there was another African American girl that was a friend of mine who had lived in the same neighborhood as I did, and so that we were the only blacks that were there at the school for the most part.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Kathy [ph.] Grant, she's an attorney in Chattanooga [Tennessee] now.  But, you know, we were the only ones that were there and--
Speaker 1: How large was, was the school population?
Speaker 2: --I'd say, probably 600 people or so, it was relatively small, it was, it was college prep, it was, you know, I had ca--campuses, many buildings if you can imagine, it was very nice.
Speaker 1: So, it was 598 to two?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, I think at one time there might be another one that came in, but they was never in our class, you know, they were always like, upper classmen.  So, you'd see their face but you never really interact with them, 'cause we were young--
Speaker 1: What was your feeling at that time?  How did you feel in that environment?
Speaker 2: I think at that time, you know, I fought almost every day, we wrestled, being a boy, I'd fight, I'd fight at school and then I'd, I guess, I wasn't that bad, it was wrestling, and then, and then when I got back home, I would wrestle with the kids around the neighborhood too.  The feeling was okay, we, we played just as everyone else, we kidded each other, I was just like anyone else really, it wasn't separate in the sense that there were a lot of racial tensions or anything in that nature, that I, at least that I perceived, I just think of people as being people.  But, I did want to, you know, I was meeting more people in my neighborhood that lived in, on my side of town and I wanted to be around them more and so I pleaded with my parents to allow me to attend the high school that was in my district because I'd gone to all white schools for half of my life and I wanted to go to an all-black school.
Speaker 1: How were you treated during these junior high school years at Webb?  Did your neighborhood children or playmates, did they chid you about going to the other school and wearing your jacket and wearing the clothes that they probably didn't have to wear to go to their school, was there any, any teasing about that?
Speaker 2: I don't think that they chided me at all about it.  There was a certain feeling because I had a lot of say nationalistic tenden--feelings that, say if you go to basketball games and you have a black school playing a white school and the spirit that's involved in some of the, the black cheers and the camaraderie that you see amongst the black people, that spiritual stance for a, say basketball game, or football game, isn't there for the, for the whites.  And so, I would always gravitate over to the blacks and then, you know, my parents know the people that were the black--you know, you know, you go to the schools, you know that they know the kids and, I knew some of the other kids that went to the schools too so, I'd felt at that time more comfortable being around the blacks and the whites.  They'd--people really have always respected at least my academic interest, you know, the ability for me to study, I never let that, try to let that interfere with the way I interact with people, so I don't think they considered me overly nerdy, I mean, I'm certainly, may have been more conservative than some of the people who were on the fringes, but I think I interacted well and if they did tease me, it's nothing more than I didn't tease them about too, about other things as well.
Speaker 1: Now, junior high is a very impor--important period in development and sometimes we have a tendency to get an idea of what it is we want to do and we have an aspiration or a dream at that point.  Did you have any dreams or aspirations for your future at that point?
Speaker 2: None in particular.  I went to school, I enjoyed classes, you know, math and sciences again, I tended to like, but I really liked to read a lot as well and, you know, I wrote things, you know, so I pretty much enjoyed all my classes.  That time at Webb [School of Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee], I do recall that the history classes I took, some different stances on because teaching of the, well for one, teaching world history without mention of Africa is very difficult and then, particularly, the history of the South in Tennessee, you know, Scopes Monkey Trial [The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes (1925)], and all these things and where African Americans came into that, it wasn't really all that clear to me from the school's perspective of where I sat there in Knoxville, Tennessee, you know, how did my people get here and what are we, how did we get to be here so, one would have difference with that, you know.  I'll say that, for myself the, at Webb was the first time I'd had a black teacher and it was a--there's this English teacher, Mrs. Morrow [ph.] and so it was nice just to finally get to see, you know, a, a black teacher.
Speaker 1: And what was she, as far, as far as a percentage of the faculty, was she the only black teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: So, at school they're two black students that you can recall close and then one black teacher?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you stayed there at Webb three years?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Story_ID: 100299
Speaker 1: And what year did you enter high school?
Speaker 2: The, in grades?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, as far as the year, the actual year that, that you--high school, was it tenth grade for you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  10th, it was '74 [1974], I believe.  I started school a year early, so I started when I was five and then, actually I graduated a year early so, I was at the, the Austin-East High School for two years and that was probably--I graduated in '76 [1976], so I must have started in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: So, Austin-East is your neighborhood public school.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: In your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: A black school?
Speaker 2: It is black.  Historically, Austin High School was the black school where all the children, the black children in East Tennessee, would go.  So, my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] went to Austin High School and she would, she was bused down from Sevierville [Tennessee], that's forty miles to get, to the colored school and then sometime later on it formed to, with East High School, we lived in East Knoxville, so they formed Austin-East, that was, that was the black high school.
Speaker 1: So here it is now for the last ten years, so to speak, you've been in predominately white schools and now you're in this all black high school--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --In your neighborhood.  I'm sure there's some familiarity there, but, tell me about your experiences as you now enter, was it anything, was it group, was it, as ac, as ac--academically astute for you?  Was it same, was it same feelings of accomplishment happening there for you?  How did you feel in that school?
Speaker 2: Well there were many more African American teachers at Austin-East High School and they would be challenging as well.  Say, overall there were, there's a very diverse student population and some of the students weren't as--didn't achieve academically as others did, but those students who had interest, they had classes for them and so, the calculus that, say, Earl Barnett taught us was just as much calculus as I would have learned pre-calc at Webb and then when I went on to Morehouse, it was the same calculus they taught there.  I think, Mrs. Cannon[ph.] you know, in having us to do our, our reading for English, you know, we discussed things just as well there as I did later on with Mrs. Ightland[ph.] at Morehouse, so I, I mean, they were challenging but there was a lot of space there for me to interact with others and to understand particularly how the community, the black American community interacted with the white community.  So, just because I was comfortable going downtown and going to different places on U.T.'s campus and other areas doesn't mean that everybody else was comfortable doing the same thing.  And then, the experiences that one may have, say if a group of us were in certain areas, would be different than maybe I would have if I was in a particular area also.  And it's those experiences that you see overall that lets you see how perhaps, the communities may be somewhat pitted against each other.
Story_ID: 100300
Speaker 1: And just--
Speaker 2: Let's discuss that for a moment.  Our time has a tendency to think that we're all kinda monolithic, but in your community, were you considered or your family considered the affluent, part of the affluence?
Speaker 1: No, we were middle class, we did better than a lot of people but we would consider affluent people as living out in the hills, up in Holston Hills, where the doctors and the dentist and lawyers lived and we didn't live there.
Speaker 2: Did any of those, those families' children go to that school at all?
Speaker 1: No, they didn't go to that school.  I, we would be involved in groups such as Jack and Jill, so, I mean, they, they were friends of ours certainly, but I can't recall that any of them, there was another school, called Holston School, which was in their district that they went too.
Speaker 2: So can you explain that, you've alluded to the fact that there was somewhat tension, inter-race tension, based upon communities and, and different aspects, different visioning, you had no problem going downtown?  Some children did or some students did have a problem doing that, what do you think was the, was the thread that bound everybody together or what tore you all apart?
Speaker 1: The thread that bound us together I think was largely that, that was our community so, there I could see that it's possible because I had a lot of interactions with the majority community , with whites, that that's possible even in Knoxville [Tennessee], that you could probably set up shop and have a business and just deal with only black people, that if I didn't have to see whites, I mean I'd have to see them some, but you could actually live there and just have a business there for blacks and just, just live and not have to worry with, with other aspects.  So, you had a sense of geo--geographic, it was isolation, geographic isolation and certainly the potential too, say build a business to any, of any magnitude, it was not there only relying just within the African American community, but the possibility does exist.  Then, you also see that there are certain pressures placed on you where you, you can't go, you know, that say, there'll be police action, people questioning you or trying to arrest you to keep you out of certain areas, or opportunities for jobs, for employment that, you know, may be available in certain areas that would not be available in other areas.  And, it's a little bit easier to see that from, from the perspective of, of being within an African American community as opposed to my living here and then coming into it from outside, you know, so, then maybe as a Webb School [of Knoxville] student, I might be able to get a job at say, if I want to, to be at a restaurant, I could get a job there, but as being an Austin-East [High School] student, I would not be able to get the same, you know, get that job.
Speaker 2: So you were able to see the definite difference in perception?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Being part of both situations at one point in your life.
Speaker 1: Correct.  And those experiences allow one to see what pressures the African American community is placed under.  I mean, to, to be in a white environment it's difficult to experience what pressures the African American (laughter) community is placed under.  But, once, if you're a part of that community, then you can see very clearly, you know, these houses are falling down, the people over here have a lot of drugs, they're stealing and robbing, you know, the churches are very strong, you know, we felt very, very good, see Knoxville Colleges were extremely vibrant than and so Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee] would use our stadium for some of their games, and they would have parades, you know, and so you really have a lot of community involvement, you know, and spirit, you know, when Austin-East played other schools, it's like our neighborhood was playing, you know, Bearden, the white school or you know when you played Webb, you know, you know, this was, this is my, my neighborhood.  Now, things are, I mean, somewhat mixed up, in the sense that the schools don't really define where one's from, they just, you know, they're kind of where you go and you don't really have a sense of school spirit and my own children now go to a Jesuit school so, you know, it's that community of students is certainly together, but it's not our community, our geographic community and so those are, those are the experiences that I had early on that kind of let you see perhaps what role I could play in my community, not, and certainly knowing the larger community, know what's available and where the roles should be played, but what needs are in my community that, that, you know, I could be doing for us.  As, I said, like having a business, what you could be doing for us here, what does this community need and then what interactions are on the outside that you'll have to be able to make to be successful and be able to, to be a vibrant part of that community.
Speaker 2: So you value your experiences on both sides and you think that helps you today understand things a bit better?
Speaker 1: Oh, with a doubt.  Sometimes my time in Austin-East [High School, Knoxville, Tennessee], there was a lot of socialization, I had a lot of socialization to do to understand how African Americans, particularly young African American males would grow up and the things that are, that are available, the pitfalls that can arise to people, you can really, you know, fortunately, I've been blessed that I've not had a lot of trouble, but I can't say that I, I told you that I was very clever before, so being able to, to experience different things and not necessarily have to face the consequences, but see what consequences are there.  It was very important.  I have a much better understanding on how to reac--relate to people coming from that experience then I probably would if I had stayed in a white environment the whole time.
Story_ID: 100301
Speaker 1: What were some of your extra-curricular activities of socializing that you did during your time at Austin-East [High School, Knoxville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, my music, so by then, I started playing bass guitar when I was twelve and then when I was in sixth grade so I'd kind of played around with it since then, so we'd get around with different bands, you know, little groups and bands and playing with that.  I did quite a bit of--I still play ice hockey, so I spent quite a bit of time, you know, practicing and then the games, and being on the road with--we had road trips where we'd go to different cities to play hockey as well.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about that.  Now, here you are playing ice hockey, were you the only black on the team?
Speaker 2: My friend Brian [ph.] played on a lot of the teams with me as well.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: What was the reception at the different rinks and, and the different leagues because as you said earlier, that shoul--that has been traditionally viewed as a non-African American sport.  First of all from skating, ice skating the ice and the whole game itself, so tell, tell me about your reception when all of a sudden, you and Brian show up?
Speaker 2: Well, in that, in that time things were a little bit different then they are now so, our teams would stay in the homes of other people, so we would arrive as a team and I'd get off the bus and then we would be distributed to different families.  And so, this allowed me to live in the families of, of, of white people for a weekend to see what they did, you know?  And to act with them, they were never--the families that accepted us I'm sure wanted it--to have us, or have me and so there weren't any racial overtones there.  On occasion, you know, people would yell somethings from behind the goal which is just, I guess, if they play any sport, that's what you would hear.  But, very rarely, and even like hockey is a contact sport so, just 'cause if you're, I mean, if you have people playing football and there's a certain amount of rivalry and, and contact, I mean would there be extra contact and people would say things here or there but overall, I think we were very well received, honestly, and it was really useful for me to go to other cities and to, to live with whites as they did, you know and sleep in sleeping bags on the floor and play with the family, eat their food and to understand that they really are no different than we are.  There's no, there's no mystery, you know, it's not mystical that they're just on a pedestal and you look at them and, and look up to them, they're just ordinary people.
Speaker 1: What some of--what were some of the cities that you went too?
Speaker 2: Charlotte, North Carolina, Lima, Ohio, there's a team in Huntsville, Alabama, that had another black pers on--person on it, so, and the rinks were owned by the same person, one in Huntsville and on in Knoxville, were owned by the same person.  Let's see, we have Silver Springs, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Now these areas were quite a ways from Knoxville, some of them were a little bit away.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Do you think that the ho--gelst [ph.], the host home or the guest homes, did they have a tendency to make sure or, overdo it to make sure you were comfortable?  Was, was there a feeling of their going above and beyond or did it just feel natural to you?
Speaker 2: It was just natural, we'd go eat, go play with the kids, time to go to bed and get up in the morning for these hockey games, finish, eat, go play some more, get up for the, you know, hopefully we have a game on Sunday, play some more hockey and then get on the bus and come back home.  It was, it just--there wasn't, there wasn't like sitting around having to recount at least a hundred calls, sitting around recounting a lot of experiences, mostly we'd go out there and do what the, do what the team member was doing, you know, the other person, the other team was, it was doing and play with his friends, meet his friends.
Story_ID: 100302
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any aspirations or any idea of what you wanted to do with your life, because now you're in high school and, and you're soon to go to college, did you have any idea of what the direction was gonna be for you at that point?
Speaker 2: At that point, no.  I still was interested in business.  That, that's really all that I knew was some sort of business, my father [Paul Underwood, Sr.] was an entrepreneur so with the real estate--he was a deputy marshal-- real estate and then we also would go to Cleveland, Ohio to a warehouse and buy crosses, a lot of crosses, a lot of crosses, jewelry and other small items and sell them at the gospel shows, you know, they'd have the, like a big gospel fest, four or five gospel groups that would come to the [Knoxville Civic Auditorium and] Coliseum and, I mean, a lot of people would come to them so we'd have a stand out there, a kiosk and sell crosses basically, a lot of crosses and rings and different things of that sort so that entrepr--entrepreneurial spirit was there and I think, I was just thinking as a businessman.  But, sometime when I was a senior in school my father had said that, you know, I do good in math and sciences and so maybe I should consider medicine and so, I said well fine, that seems fine to me, you know, 'cause, I, like I said, I've always liked math and science, I just never thought of being a physician.
Speaker 1: So, you had a great relationship with your father to listen to that, and to take his advisement?
Speaker 2: I had a relationship with father, he was very good, I, I always had a lot of respect for him, but certainly, at that time, I was doing a lot of things and, you know, he really didn't like me doing quite all the things that I was doing on occasion so, on that occasion I did listen to what he had to say.  (Laughter)  I, I certainly am, really respected him throughout honestly but, there are other times when we might have bumped heads on certain aspects of my behaviors, I guess any child would have.  When I left and I went to school, I went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] being a math teacher, I said well why don't I try engineering for a little bit and then with my father's statement I said, well why don't I try pre-med and so I, I enrolled kinda like as a dual major with engineering and pre-med and then--
Speaker 1: Let's--
Story_ID: 100303
Speaker 1: Back up for one moment, there at that point.  So, you leave Austin-East [High School, Knoxville, Tennessee] in '70--
Speaker 2: --Six.
Speaker 1: --'76 [1976], and you--the decision to go to Atlanta, Georgia to Morehouse [College], where did that come from?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not really sure, but it's like I always knew that I wanted to go to Morehouse,  I think as a family, we would sometimes travel to Atlanta, you know, Atlanta was basically the closest large city to Knoxville, yeah well it is really the closest large city so, we would travel there to go to the jazz festivals or to whatever events so, that was my kind of only experience of a, of a large city and then, Morehouse was a school, it was--see the schools were very similar, like Knoxville College and then you had the  A.U. Center [Atlanta University Center], the A.U. Center is certainly much larger than Knoxville Colleges, but I felt very comfortable on campus and so the school that I thought would be, you know, good for me was, was Morehouse and I--that's so I really only wanted to go to Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Did you know anybody else that had graduated from Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, no.  It wasn't influenced in that way.  Perhaps my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood], suggested Morehouse or let me see some of their materials and I looked at it and said, oh that looks like a, a good place for me.  I really enjoy Atlanta, there's no doubt.  Even until this day, I enjoy Atlanta, so getting in that environment, to be in Atlanta was key and then to be able to be at Morehouse which has a very good reputation for people go--who are going into medicine, you know, they have a high rate of acceptance to medical schools in their pre-med careers so, that may have influenced me as well.  They also added a dual degree program for engineering with (unclear) tech so, you know, the, in terms of at that point in time, career aspirations, Morehouse seemed like a very wise place to go.
Speaker 1: So you decided this is the furthest time that you, this the first time that you been, that you've been this far away from, from your family by yourself?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Or was that the time?
Speaker 2: It is, true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you--what, what do you do that summer between Austin-East and getting ready to go to Morehouse?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I worked somewhere.  I would have to go--I had, had to work for my father on the houses and then typically my friends and I would have a lawn mowing service.  I, I had several jobs, I used to wash dishes in, in a college, in Knoxville College I washed dishes and then, I worked as a checker for Kroger's for a bit so, I might have been doing that at that time.
Story_ID: 100304
Speaker 1: Okay, so we'll fast forward to the following year and now you're getting ready to go to Morehouse and you go and you go up [I-]75, down 75 to Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What happens when you arrive?
Speaker 2: No, really I, I just recall checking in, being up on the dorm and, you know, kinda when you're unpacking, just meeting other people that are there as well.  We stayed in, actually it was a senior dorm, DuBois Hall and Martin Luther King, III was there, Marty was, he was a, a couple years ahead of me, but, you know, he was, he was there and so it was kind of interesting having Martin Luther King's son there in the same dorm that you were in.  But, mostly just meeting some of the other guys and walking around making friends, you know, a lot of people that I, I'd never met from before, it wasn't anything spectacular.  Now at Morehouse there's a freshman orientation period and I don't recall that being there.  I just recall going there, you know, unpacking and then, you know, going, registering for classes, buying the books and then going to class.
Speaker 1: And who was your roommate at that time?
Speaker 2: I believe Brian [ph.] was my roommate.
Speaker 1: So Brian is still on the scene now.
Speaker 2: Yes, yep.
Speaker 1: So, you go to, to Morehouse and, you know, it's a beautiful campus and it's considered a (unclear) for African American males.  Now, right across the road is another campus, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Um-Hum.
Speaker 1: What was your interaction like when you went, or the whole campus life with Clark [College], Clark, and those different schools, how did you feel and what was the interaction?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a little bit young when I went there, as remember I said I got out a couple of years early so--
Speaker 1: So, you're sixteen years old?
Speaker 2: Correct.  The interaction with the Spelmanites wasn't as it is depicted on movies, because often times I think that they would look for people who had more than I, I mean they had more years than I did and I had very little resources, I'm just a country boy from Tennessee, right.  And, I, I had a car but it wasn't a very fancy car, it was just an old car we paid $500 for it, had it repainted and what not so, I would go to Spelman and certainly I was friendly with some of the, a lot of the girls but, I can't say that I really hung out on campus a lot, you know, and classes, particularly later on in pre-med classes then I got to interact with more for studying and things of that nature, but that wasn't the type of interaction a lot of people think about with Spelman.  So, I would--I've always felt free to interact with everybody so with Clark, I was, I was interact there, I didn't pledge a particular fraternity largely because I didn't want to isolate myself from other people.  So, you pledged one thing then you would only be around those one peoples and then all the other peoples that I like and I considered my friends, I wouldn't really interact with them that much, so I didn't pledge anything so I could interact with everybody.  I thought that I didn't need a support system that then, in my feelings, I didn't need a support system to help me get through college and so be it.  I moved off campus after my second year and so, then I had the whole city of Atlanta that was exposed to me and that was very nice as well.
Speaker 1: Which part of Atlanta did you move too?
Speaker 2: I moved in East Point, College Park East Point.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your view of Atlanta at that point, in 1976, I believe was it Maynard Jackson or Andy Young [HM Andrew Young] what was the mayor?  Was it Maynard Jackson?
Speaker 2: Maynard Jackson.
Speaker 1: It was still Maynard Jackson.  Now, tell me about the overall feeling in Atlanta at this point and you being there.  How, what's going on now at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, for Atlanta as I've, I've even told my sons, is that we don't really know, is if you're a student then you're consumed on campus life and so we're not so aware of what's going on in the city overall so,--
Story_ID: 100425
Speaker 1: Okay so now you've moved off campus to East Point College Park, which is an area near the airport in Atlanta, Georgia.  Could you tell us about your experiences on a whole in, in the city of Atlanta living off-campus, being a student?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that there was a certain amount of independence as I was growing up because then I didn't rely on the lunch line at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I'd have to go to the grocery store and buy food and interact with other people, I did work study at the time, I think around that time I was taking care of some of the lab rats in the cycle biology lab.  So, you were removed and not necessarily dependent so much on campus life anymore, and so I had a chance to meet people and interact with people that are live in the city that were there working, you know, people that were there that were--had moved there from Knoxville, that were not necessarily associated with the school but they still lived there nonetheless.  And it allowed me to see that you have the opportunity to thrive in those environments that as an African American, you could say have businesses and live in a city overall, not necessarily been relegated to a particular neighborhood, but you could actually be in the city and have a business and survive and to do very well and to live in nice houses just as, as anyone else would.  And so, I think it was, it was nurturing in that sense, you know, I still had to drive a distance down Cascade Road to get to school and go to class and, you know, you know, do homework and that, that type of thing, but it did open up the campus quite a bit.
Story_ID: 100426
Speaker 1: Was there any--one teacher or person that you even met off campus who became very influential to you being a physician or just in your studies in general?
Speaker 2: Well, all of our teachers were very, very nurturing and certainly I remember many of them particularly through homework and test and exams and the GPA of how our interaction was.  But, one in particular that I remember, and I still interact with now is, [HM] Dr. David Satcher, so when I, I was the president of the Health Career Society then as I, when I was a senior, and I would go to the medical school which is just founding, which is just recently found at that time and get some of the teachers to come over to come and speak to us about health careers, and one of them was Dr. Satcher.  And so he was very inspirational then and over time, now that he's been the U.S. Surgeon General and he's been the director of the Centers for Disease Control, he's still very active in the health community of African Americans and we have a chance to interact on occasion at the different meetings, so that was certainly a very good interaction that occurred at a very young age for me.
Speaker 1: How would you have been when you met Dr. Satcher?
Speaker 2: I think I was around eighteen, seventeen or eighteen years old.
Speaker 1: And did things, did things get concrete for you, did things really sur--surely, surely get to the point now you think this is what I want to do, medicine will be the field for me?
Speaker 2: Well yes, it happened even before then.  My first year at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I'd said I was like a dual major and so, engineering and pre-med.  Well the first engineering course has you basically write your name and print your name in block letters and I failed that course, so that was pretty much it for the engineering, I went to med, took pre-med from that.  So, that thing about the doctors not having good handwriting, it really does make a difference, if you have good handwriting (laughter) then maybe you might wanna consider changing a career.  But, so at that time I really wanted to be a doctor.  I didn't know what type of doctor but, I was really set on going to medical school.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So you decide early that, that medical or being a doctor is the way you want to go.  You want to be a physician, you meet several different people, you meet [HM] Dr. [David] Satcher, what kind of personality, what personal story did he share with you or encouragements that he gave you regarding your, your future?
Speaker 1: Well, I believe that even at that time Dr. Satcher was able to show us that medicine is certainly going to school, learning Anatomy and Physiology, and medicine and is, is one aspect of it, the interpersonal interaction of being able to relate to people is certainly very important.  But what was very impressive with him, even that I could recall as a student was that, he knew what the community needed, what the needs were so for maternal and child health, cardiovascular disease for cancers, he knew what the community needed.  He also had segmented what steps you could take to, to eradicate those problems and he knew what networks and resources were needed to, to help overcome those barriers.  Likewise, when he related to us, he would see us as a group of individuals that would soon, you know, a few years, within a decade or so, go out and be influential in eradicating disease within the African American community and so he would tool us to carry out those wishes and let us know kind of where we fit into the overall scheme of things.  He was very organized certainly and I think that, that organization we've been able to see throughout his time, but extremely very caring and personal.  I mean he wasn't dictatorial, he didn't appear as an autocrat, yet he was the dean of the school when Dr. Carruthers [ph.] passed at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], he left Morehouse and went and headed up Meharry for some time just because he's very good at, at leading and then when they found the interim, or found a new director for Meharry, he came back to Morehouse.  And so, he's very skilled at administrative task as well as medicine, I mean, he knows medicine and I can imagine, I've never been a patient of his, but I can imagine at least how he relates to us, that his bedside manner is just remarkable.
Story_ID: 100427
Speaker 1: How did you feel when you found out that he'd been made Surgeon General, appointed Surgeon General?
Speaker 2: I was really elated because I knew him [HM Dr. David Satcher] and I, I already had a lot of respect for him, certainly if someone that you know becomes the surgeon general, it's a very, very rewarding.  But also because he was very impactful in terms of the Healthy People 2010, which we still work on, that was his, his document, you know, and, and so to know that not in terms of just, I mean, all surgeon generals have impact, but he had fairly profound impact and his ability to garner resources to make sure that things are--go into place, and to be able to codify aspects of like Healthy People 2010, is very well written, you won't be able to, to argue with it very much, all you gotta do is just follow the document and then, even if he's not the surgeon general anymore, we still use that document and it's actually the basis for say, The American Heart Association and our goals are drawn, many organizations goals are drawn off that Healthy People 2010 document.  When he left there to go to the Centers for Disease Control, I said, you know, this is just wonderful, I mean, he, he does everything.  I think, in fact, there was a period of time when he was actually both, he was the surgeon general and head of CDC, and during his time, CDC has, has been held in high esteem.  For example, that was when Ebola became about and his attitude was why don't we send a team over to Africa to study Ebola because even though it's not in the United States, we can extend our resources to other countries, because we don't want these illnesses to actually end up in the United States, so why not meet them there.  Which was the first that the Centers for Disease Control had actually left the American boundaries.  Recently, you see other surgeon generals, and I, I mean, not that it relates to this particular interview per se, but the--Dr. [Richard Carmona], his attitudes about his to--his tenure as surgeon general and interaction with the administration, the, the president and how he's, he's--relates how he felt as he was stifled.  You see the Centers for Disease Control and this person with the multiple resistant TB when they come back.  So these agencies can fall very quickly in disfavor, but with Dr. Satcher, it was not that way.  The, the CDC was flourishing and the surgeon general actually set up a national policy that we're still following to this day, so that of course makes me feel very good.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: I've had a chance also to see Dr. Satcher.  He came here to, to celebrate a ceremony of relationship between Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and T-Gen which is a large translational genomics lab that's here in Phoenix  [Arizona] and so I had the opportunity to have my son, who was sixteen at the time, meet Dr. Satcher and I said, and he's a, he's a Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] student as well, so I said this is just wonderful that, you know, at about the same age that I was to meet Dr. Satcher, you know, you're meeting him at the same age and he still seems that he hasn't aged at all and (laughter) obviously that's not the, the case, but it's just, it's extremely rewarding to be around him, honestly.
Story_ID: 100428
Speaker 1: Now, as you're in, back at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] now, you're in your, you're in your studies, as you go about Atlanta or as you view the African American community, are you starting to see the health of African Americans in a different light?  Are you starting to watch things differently?  Does your perception change so, are you starting to see more chronic illness and things of that nature more, more easily now?
Speaker 2: Not particularly because in medical school it's really science classes and I'm going back and forth learning about insects and different other animals and plants and math, so I'm really not in the healthcare field.  I did, I was a, an orderly basically, a nurse's aide at the Grady [Memorial] Hospital, I worked there and so I had some experiences there in terms of very humbling experiences of, of illnesses and taking care of people, how to make beds, you know, and how to clean people, bed pans and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: How old were you when this was going on?
Speaker 2: Probably seventeen or eighteen (unclear).
Speaker 1: So you were still, you were just now in school?
Speaker 2: I'm--yeah, this is one of the jobs, I've always worked, okay.  (Laughter) But, seventeen or eighteen or so and I went to the DT Board where they had alchoholics that were having delirium tremens, you know, they had 'em tied down to the beds and they were shaking, you know, I was there, I mean it's a wards, 'cause Grady had wards at that time, there's people laid out in different phases of conscientious and pouring this nasty smelly stuff on them and that was paraldehyde, you know, I know that then, I think probably my first experiences with death would have been during that time.  But something that was very important was the Emory [University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia] then and Emory used Grady Hospital to train their residents and so in essence I was a, a pre-med student and the nurses were largely African American, you know, we're in the, in the community.  I was a pre-med student and you'd see these white doctors, these young white doctors and their interaction with the healthcare staff wasn't always good and they had some very nasty behaviors that I had a chance to observe, you know, because I grew up and then I went on to medical school and I was in the same position that they were in, but there was no way--reason that they should act the way as arrogant as they did.
Speaker 1: Did that anger you somewhat when you saw it?
Speaker 2: It made me very aware of how certain people are and I still need to be able to influence physicians to have culturally competent care.
Speaker 1: And.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  (unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  (unclear)
Speaker 1: So, so you're there and you saw these, these young doctors who many of them went, many of them we'll say somewhat may be even privileged, we don't know, but, but you said their interaction with, with the, the nurses who were also trained professionals.
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: Was sometimes inappropriate, could you elaborate a little bit, just give us an example of, of the?
Speaker 2: Well, just, it's basic arrogance and so yelling at nurses is, is one thing that could happen routinely but then, what I do recall is one doctor who basically threw the chart at the unit secretary which, you know, I thought was uncalled for.  Again, I'm just a nurses aide, but this isn't the way that I would treat this woman and, you know, they--these people took very good care of me and I didn't really particularly appreciate this resident, you know, throwing the chart at her, you know.
Speaker 1: Did any of them have any, any problem with you, or go--give you any kind of grief or drama at this point?
Speaker 2: The relationship between a doctor and a nurse's aide is not very much particularly if I'm black and they're white, it's not--they--we didn't, I didn't interact with them, nurses would interact with the doctors, but the aides, we did the bedpans, made up the beds, delivered trays to people, things of that nature, so, there was, there was very little interaction.  I did interview with one of the fathers of cardiology, J. Willis Hurst, who was at Emory at the time, so he came to Grady and interviewed me.  I didn't get in but still, it was nice to meet him at that time.
Speaker 1: So you met him and, and what did he say as you, as he interviewed you?  What were some of his questions to you or?
Speaker 2: Just basically, you know, where are from, what, what aspirations do you have, and, and there wasn't anything particularly amazing about the interview process itself, it's just that he wrote a book of cardiology.  I didn't know I was gonna be a cardiologist but now that I look back on it, you know, that I did actually meet him.
Story_ID: 100429
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you stay at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] through up until about 1980, is that correct?
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: Now, you're getting ready to graduate, with you, with your undergraduate degree and now a decision has to be made or has it already been made now regarding the next step?
Speaker 2: No, well certainly to go to, to medical school, yes, 'cause I'm a pre-med major.  During the time that I was in school, my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] left Knoxville [Tennessee] and moved to Minnesota, she left Knoxville College and started working with IBM.  While she was there, she, she found out that Mayo, the Mayo Clinic [Rochester, Minnesota] had started a medical school, it was a very young school then and she was on the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], a board of the NAACP and one of the women there actually worked in the medical school in admissions and so she invited my mother to have me come for an interview at Mayo, so on Christmas break I went up to Minnesota and interviewed at Mayo.  That was the coldest time of my life, I, I didn't have the clothes to prepare me for that type of experience and there was no skywalk or skyway, jet way to connect the airplane to the terminal, I had to walk down these steps and when I stepped out of the plane it was just misery.  I'd, I'd never been so cold in my life, (laughter) but that was, that was my first experience there and Mayo is a very, very small school, I think we had fifty people in each class, we were basically spoon fed and it had all of the trappings of the Mayo Clinic around it so, it was at that time that I knew that I was gonna be leaving Georgia and going to Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about that for a moment now, so, you, you, now you've applied to several medical colleges?
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: Which, which other ones have you applied too?
Speaker 2: Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], certainly, I believe I applied to Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and then Mayo, probably UT in Memphis, UT has, University of Tennessee has a medical school in Memphis.
Speaker 1: Where did you really want to go in your heart?
Speaker 2: Mayo is good.  (Laughter) I'd, I'd been to--
Speaker 1: Until you got off the plane right?
Speaker 2: --Right.  Well at that moment, I actually had to, I had to wear my sister's coat 'cause she had a, a coat like a ski coat that would keep me warm and then from then I was okay, but that first experience was--I took my heaviest coat from Georgia, that the heaviest thing that I knew and--up there and it just, it was nothing, (laughter) it offered no protection at all, but Mayo, when I was twelve or fourteen, my mother spent the summer in Rochester, working with IBM, there was a faculty exchange program, so she worked there, so I lived there at that time, I was probably around twelve and I remember riding a bike around town, around Rochester and the student library the children's library was there, well that was the medical school building, so in the time that I had been away, it actually changed the, well Mayo, it was, it was like in Mayo's, Mayo's campus basically.  They had bought the library and turned it into the medical school, so it was nice, I mean, I could actually tell people, they would, they may not believe it, but I could tell people that, you know, I was in the building, you know, when I was twelve, when most of them hadn't, hadn't been there and now, I'm back in the same building as a, as a, as a medical student so.
Speaker 1: And so, so that kinda falls in line, in line with your, with your overall belief, you said, steps happening and occurring, one thing leads to the next.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You'd, you'd never, you'd never imagine.
Story_ID: 100430
Speaker 1: So you're there [Mayo Medical School, Rochester, Minnesota] and you've now been accepted to med school in 1980, now, now what year would that have been?
Speaker 2: 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you're in med school.  You, you, you're going to be a doctor so to speak, what's going on now at the Mayo's, Mayo Med School?
Speaker 2: Well, we're a very close group.  It's a small class and so, as I said we're basically spoon fed, we have the Mayo Clinic consultants come and teach us and the curricula was, say of an experimental type curricula so, it was a systems approach, so we learned kind of the anatomy and physiology and pathology of each system as it came about, as opposed to like traditional medical schools where anatomy and physiology are the first two years, you know, you're in the lab and you have the vision of people with the cadavers, you know, during the first two years and then, clinicals thereafter.  So, the curricular was different and it was like an experimental environment and you had all the resources of Mayo Clinic around you, which was just wonderful.  It was a great learning environment.
Speaker 1: Now were you the only African American in your class?
Speaker 2: No, there were, in this class, there were two other African Americans who's fortunate that way.  We had--typically there were about two per each year of, of each class.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the names of the ones in your class?
Speaker 2: Sure, Stan Barry and Dennis Ackery[ph.]
Speaker 1: And how long was the class, how large was the class in general again?
Speaker 2: Around fifty people.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 'bout--
Speaker 2: It was a small, it was a small school.  Most, most medical schools have 200 people per class, this had 200 people in the whole school.
Speaker 1: I have a question.  Where is Brian [ph.] at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, Brian was still back in Atlanta [Georgia] then.  He'd run into some financial difficulties and he wasn't able to complete Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] then, so he was actually still there on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, now you, you're at the medical school, there's three blacks and you're getting into your classes now and you have some of the finest educators there at your disposal.  What were you feeling about the next three or four years of your life?  How, how are they gonna be for you?
Speaker 2: Well, again it's, it's mostly study and there's a, there's quite a bit of study that comes along with this so, they're--you have the chance to interact with the group and it's a very close group, very similar to say the classes that I grew up with when I was in elementary school or mid--middle school or junior high school and so you'd have more school type of activities so, beer in keg, you know, kegs of beer out on the farms and the (unclear), I played bass, we had a little band and we used to play in the Mayo Foundation House for the big wigs, the, you know, they came over for their development meetings 'cause we're a group of students that played. I also was very active then, in the Student National Medical Association, which is a black medical student group and so, we formed the SNMA at, at Mayo and so we'd have meetings and we'd have the residents, the, the other trainees that were at the hospitals, so we had a black residents association, so we had a cadre of, of African Americans that was there that we could interact with.
Speaker 1: What was the mission of that student group, what did you all do basically?
Speaker 2: It's mostly support and then trying to recruit other African Americans to, to go to college and take pre-med careers and to come to school, to try to make sure that we had access to all schools, to make sure that, you know, each medical school was enrolling African American students in and that the, that they went, they completed school.  Attrition is, is--was and is now a major factor that you can matriculate your school but don't actually graduate, and so, it was appropriate in that sense.  And also networking with other students in other chapters, say at the University of Illinois, was--'cause we're kinda in the same region, I got a chance to know them, the University of Wisconsin students over there so we're still friends now.
Story_ID: 100431
Speaker 1: So at this same time you did have sec--you did have some of, some of the support of your mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] was in town also, correct?
Speaker 2: I really had the best of both worlds because, Rochester, Minnesota, you may not know it that well, has a large research and development, IBM research and development plant and then the other large entity is Mayo Clinic.  And so, my mother is an IBM person and so, most of the African Americans worked for IBM, they're there as programmers, analyst or whatever happens to be that works, you know, that works with IBM.  They were there with IBM so the African American community there in Rochester is IBM and then I had Mayo here so, even though I was in the, in the white environment of Mayo Clinic, my home life was all African, was basically African American and so it was really very good for me in that way.  It was a lot of--quite a bit of sup-support that came, you know, with me, I didn't feel isolated at all.
Speaker 1: What was the overall social and, and racial climate in Rochester, Minnesota?
Speaker 2: It's what I would call bland, a lot of things were accepted, it's I think one of the only republican counties that's there in Minnesota, but that's because there's a lot of, and mixture of some of these whites that have come from other areas, there was continued of people that time who were, who were coming over from South Africa who were basically Afrikaners and their group was like a little racist quorum within Mayo.  But, once you realize it then it was our, our duty of the Student National Medical Association to counteract that to expose it and to--as much as any students gonna be able to put in check the faculty to make sure that we'll at least are all aware of what the issues are or whether the school decided to do, to take any action on it or not.  But, there wasn't any particularly bad feeling at all and I thought, you know, we interacted very, very well, as I said, I have, was blessed to have the best of both worlds in terms of being able to get along very well with the Mayo people, being able to get along very well with the IBM people, we had a small foundling of a black church there so, it was very good.
Story_ID: 100432
Speaker 1: What were some of your challenges if you, if you had any in medical school?
Speaker 2: The aspect of understanding African Americans and what of an instructor being able to, to tell you what it, what it means for African Americans in terms of their overall health issues and typically the attitude was that they were going to relegate you to the back and that you were just there perhaps maybe, affirmative action brought you there for some reason, it's hard for them to understand that I'm actually truly an in state student, my mother lives around the corner, you know, I pay taxes, went to school, my grades were as good as anyone else's, but still this is the, the attitude that, you know, you can take the second tier and then we'll talk to the first tier here about things, you know, (unclear) and what not and that's--and again having more than one solution, you know, that I may say that why don't we do this and they say, oh know, why don't we do that and, you know, it's then enough of that, they would try to steer you into path, career pathways that they felt that you would do best in and maybe not necessarily be what you want.
Speaker 1: Give me an example of that please.
Speaker 2: All right so, for myself, just all through my Mayo experience, not necessarily just through medical school, I spent a lot of time in the cardiology section, cardiology is very important and they thought it was very important for the students, so I spent about six months in cardiology, I met, you know, these are top named docs and so there're a lot of big time cardiology people.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) a few names just for the general sake of the people listening?
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: Like who's there?
Speaker 2: You know, it was Bernie Gersh [Bernard Gersh] and just someone that came over from South Africa and his attitudes may reflect that as well.  You have Ray Gibbons [Raymond Gibbons], who is the current president of the American Heart Association, [Abdul] Jamil Tajik, Bijoy Khandheria, which are very top known imaging people. Dave Holmes [David Holmes] is a intraventricular  cardiologist who is extremely well published, I mean, there's just a slew of them, Rick Nishimura is another echo [echocardiography] guru, they were all our professors at the time, some of them were fellows, like Bijoy Khandheria, is, it was a fellow then, but still they were, they were all in that department.
Speaker 1: They were still there?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  They never once made any inkling that they would, that I would have a career in cardiology and in fact, the people who were in the gastroenterology division were much friendlier with me and, you know, would invite me to the house for picnics and we had some good cases, very exciting cases.  And so when I left the school, when I, you know, got out of residency I was more geared toward going into gastroenterology because I liked procedures and I liked to help, help sick people and really didn't know anything at all about cardiology and, you know, I, I figured as, as a cardiologist now, in retrospect, that, you know, they should have been able to see if they were, you know, particularly with the amount of time that I spent with them, that they should have been able to, to understand that I probably was a budding cardiologist and to be able to develop that, typically by inviting the students in, mentoring them, research projects, getting involved with some of the things that they were doing and showing you, they didn't, at all.  When I went away, I left, I did my internship at Henry Ford Hospital when I went away, my first rotation was in the cardiovascular intensive care unit and there was another South African, which was very favorable, he left South African because he didn't like apartheid and the first thing he said was, you know, you need, you know, consider going into cardiology you have a knack for doing this.  And I said, no, no, actually when I get finished I'm gonna go into the gastroenterology and, you know, things transpired but, he was the first one that told me that, you know, you might consider being a cardiologist.
Speaker 1: So I'll back up.  So be, now would it be fair to say or safe to say that, that their attitude towards your cardi-cardiology aspirations might be somewhat condescending, it was somewhat?
Speaker 2: I, I didn't have any cardiology aspirations.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, their attitude toward me period would be condescending.  Right.
Speaker 1: In general at the school?
Speaker 2: In general, right.  And they would, I guess, I guess prefer me to perhaps consider family medicine which is, I won't say dead end, it's but there's a--you can't become a specialist as, with a family medicine track, so if you commit to that track, then you would never be a gastroenterologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, no other specialty.  There wasn't really very much development at all and despite--see the other white students would have close bonds, you know, that they were like their fathers, I wasn't, you know, this wasn't like my father, the, the young white students, they would talk back to them like they're, like they're their parents, I guess that's how they talked to their parents, that wasn't my, that wasn't my existence.  And likewise, unfair grading policies or something that became known at that time, that the evaluations that, that we would get as a group wouldn't be the same as others there, you know, we were graded unfairly, basically.
Story_ID: 100313
Speaker 1: So you're having some challenges there [Mayo Medical School, Rochester, Minnesota] that you're noticing with some, we'll call it blatant racism and condescending i--ideas towards you as a young African American male in which direction you think you could have been nurtured a bit more in certain areas, are you having discussions with, with your mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] at this point about this?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the discussions that I would have with my mother would be more related to the happenings during the time and then the, the experiences of us as a group.  Since I, I did have a family there, we'd have people to dinner and, you know, my home was open to them.  Now, I didn't stay with my mother but I certainly had the resources and the knowledge of the events that were taking place in the African American community and a lot of my African American colleagues, counterparts, comrades at medical school and residence, would then, you know participate with me, they'd go to parties or picnics, or whatever it happened to be to get a chance to, to meet the other African Americans that happen to live in Rochester [Minnesota].  Because you really wouldn't interact with them on Mayo's campus, they're, they just weren't, they almost live in separate parts of town.  So, she knew a lot of the people, you know, by name because they were basically my friends and knew what they were experiencing.  The advice had always been the same, certainly no one has ever said that racism didn't exist and certainly knowing some of the political background of some of these individuals it's easy to, very clear to see where they're coming from, it's also easy to see that they are in power where they are.  I mean, Mayo Clinic is a private institution, no one said that they had to have us there, it's not, it's an attitude that they, you know, certainly the people who were the administration who were say, would be in human resources, understand the importance of diversity definitely but that doesn't mean it's filtered out throughout the whole department, you know, in those ways.  These issues have come up over and over again, that you look at the administration and ask them, do you believe in equal opportunities and they say yes, well then why don't you have any more African Americans on faculty?  Well, it's because each of the decisions is based on the different departments and so we leave it up to the department chairman to hire what the best person for that, for that position.  And so, I guess that department chairman couldn't find any African Americans, but the institution overall, does believe in equal opportunity and so, this is just the first experience of, of this and it's gone on throughout, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there any African American--American professors at the school?
Speaker 2: There were.  There was an oral surgeon, there were too, some scientists, a biochemist was there.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any name, or any names that we all, might all know?
Speaker 2: Stewart[ph.] Taylor and I think his name is Jack Nelson [ph.], was the surgeon, are, are ones that I recall.  And, and so those, we had some inter--interaction, there was a Dr. [Franklyn] Prendergast who was a, I think a biochemist, he worked in a, not necessarily a clinician to see patients but he was in one of the labs there and he'd been there, at Mayo for some time.
Speaker 1: So you have your four year tenure there you, and you, you get toward '84 [1984], and you graduate from medical school, how does your mom feel now?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother must be feeling very good because during that time that last year there, the--there was a student that came over as an intern, so I'm a fourth year medical student and then an intern came over and this is when I'm doing my clinicals, being in the hospital, you know, seeing patients, going on rounds and then on one of the sister services, a young African American female came from Washington, D.C. and so I had the opportunity to meet her since I'd been in the city for three years before, I knew my way around very well.  And so, that was a very interesting relationship that developed for my final year and I was engaged when I left.
Story_ID: 100314
Speaker 1: So, that was--
Speaker 2: We'll talk about that, we'll talk about that for a moment.  So you're getting ready and now this last year is a serious year of medical school for you and you meet a young lady and what was her, is and was her name?
Speaker 1: [HM] Hollis Underwood.  Well, Hollis, Jonetta Crowe at that time.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER):  Hold on one second.
Speaker 1: Some kind of alarm or something.
Speaker 2: So Hollis Underwood and you're doing the rounds and--
Speaker 1: It was Hollis Crowe.
Speaker 2: Hollis Crowe at that time.
Speaker 1: At that time.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: --And you're doing your work and you're, you--you're getting ready to go into your internship soon, the next year, I would imagine and you meet Miss Crowe and develop a relationship, tell us about that?
Speaker 1: It was wonderful.  Honestly we, we would study together, she's, I mean, she's a very studious person so she knew all the answers to the different diseases 'cause she basically read the textbooks from cover to cover as I said I've--clerk--course work was okay but I had a lot of time socializing as well, so it was very nice to have this very important resource and she's an upperclassman, can get around, she can write orders and, and, you know, I'm, it's, it's very nice to see what life could be for me in the very near future that there was actually light at the end of the tunnel.  And, we had the opportunity to explore, you know, you know, through different experiences the attitudes of Mayo [Medical School, Rochester, Minnesota], you know, and just so you have a broader experience because you're sharing it together.  And so--
Speaker 2: And, and somehow in that time period you all got engaged?
Speaker 1: Right, right, I had to wrench her away from some of her classmates and just keep her separate because I knew, I knew the territory well, I could position her in a way that they couldn't be around her and that way I was able to keep her for myself.  And so, when I left Mayo, I, I tried her, to get her, I got a--my experience at Mayo was such that I wanted to leave Minnesota, and never actually come back and so I didn't apply to Mayo for residency, I'd, I wanted to make it sure that there was gonna be no accident that I would be away, that, you know, that, that if the match, 'cause we have a match system, if by some accident, because I put Mayo here at the very bottom, I would end up back there, that's not what I wanted, that's why I did, I did match, I was going somewhere else, I, I was committed to leaving Mayo.  A lot of that was because Mayo didn't have a graduated responsibility system, there was no leadership hierarchy for medical training and so the students residence fellows were all on the same level and the consultants were on top and traditionally, you'd have the consultants, you know, the attending, then you'd have a fellow, a resident intern medical student, you know, and, you know, those, that type of hierarchy in most medical situations and I never been exposed to that and I wanted to experience that because that's what I thought you would relate to once you got outside the Mayo system and I, I didn't see that I was gonna be staying in the Mayo system that long.  So, I tried to entice Holly to come with me to Detroit [Michigan] and she said she, you know, grew up there and she'd been there and she's gonna stay at Mayo, so I thought it would be very wise to secure the thing so, we were engaged and then halfway through my internship year we got married and then we had to commute back and forth for a bit and then I went back to Mayo to, to finish my internal medicine residen--residency.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)figure out earlier, you said you were quite clever so, you were able to work this thing out correct?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 100315
Speaker 1: So, so you, you go to Detroit [Michigan] and she [HM Dr. Hollis Underwood]'s still in, at Mayo [Medical School, Rochester, Minnestoa], tell me, tell me about your first years and, and where, where did you go to, to do your residency?
Speaker 2: I was at Henry Ford Hospital at the main campus right downtown, I was there for one year for say 1984, to 1985.
Speaker 1: Um-Hum.
Speaker 2: For my internship.
Speaker 1: Now, how was that experience?
Speaker 2: It was very good, it was extremely good, we had much more responsibility.  The disease processes were definitely there, at Mayo we see a broad spectrum of disease processes, a lot of very rare illnesses, but you don't really get a lot of experience in dealing with the illness yourself and then again, I was at a younger level of my education.  Now, as an intern in the hospital you're right there with the disease and so your work load is there, instead of being a student paying tuition, now it's actually say, on the job training, I'm getting a salary and having to come to work and take call and learn different things.  So, it was a wonderful experience and my--there were many more African Americans, African American attendings, one of them was, one of the fellows that was ahead of me that took me around a lot was Emanuel Rivers, Dr. Rivers he's now a big attending for emergency medicine, but he was able to take me around, show me the ropes of medicine, how to do procedures, how to talk to people and get, get things done because there's a lot of negotiating that you have to do and, and, like if you have a patient and you want to get two test done but there's a conflict in schedule you have to negotiate to, to get the schedule lined up or to talk to the nurse to hold this, to do this other thing so, it was a very wonderful environment for me, I really enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 100316
Speaker 1: Now, you're in Detroit, Michigan too which is a predominately, at that time, I do believe Detroit was about 70 or 80 percent African American.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And Coleman Young was the mayor, what was your experience like in the community in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well, I had the, the fortune of living right in that community, very similar to what it was when I was growing up in Knoxville [Tennessee] so, crack cocaine I believe had just hit Detroit so there was a lot of violence and crack addiction at that time.  There was a gang, I don't know if you recall Murder, Inc. was there at the time so, Errol Flynn[s]. There, there was a culture particularly in the area of Detroit that I was in that was very rough and so, you were able to see what the plight of African Americans in--I never lived in a lot, in a large northern city like that, what the plot, plight of African Americans in those environments was, it was very desperate.  I mean, people didn't have very many resources, a lot of people were fighting with each other, the people that were bringing the resources in were just being robbed of the resources, so then they would try to move further and further out and certainly being in a hospital you see where the, what the other--the consequence, the health consequences of those behaviors.  And so, it was a very enlightening experience for me in that way, definitely.
Story_ID: 100317
Speaker 1: Now Detroit [Michigan] as you said, the crack cocaine had--and it had become an industry, as I recall because the, the city had all kinds of, as you said, gang violence, organized situations, Young Boys Incorporated [Y.B.I.], Murder, Inc., and you said--,
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --And now you're, you're an intern witnessing all of this, there--let's just take a typical Saturday night, I don't know if you were in the emergency unit at that time, were you at all?  Did you have to deal with that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the emergency room some, I wasn't an ER resident, but I certainly spent my time there.
Speaker 1: And what were you seeing coming in during this time period?  Where things like different kinds of things that, what, was there a higher frequency of, of gun--gunshot wounds, was it a higher frequency of--
Speaker 2: I can't, I wasn't, I'm not a surgeon or for, in trauma, so we would see, say on a surgical service you'd see your fair share of gunshot wounds, but, but it's mostly chronic illness is what we'd see so, it's heart disease, diabetes, just basic illnesses there, just a lot of it.  It's the same thing that people basically die of all the time, you know, pulmonary emboli, but in this setting, you know, there was, there was a wide diverse, more diverse patient population and you had the opportunity to speak with them because these people are just like the neighborhood that you grew up in and, you know, Mr. Rogers, or Mr. Johnson, is here and, you know, he's a baker or he's a priest or, you know, a pastor of the church or something, so it's a very, it's much more personal then say, the Mayo Clinic environment where, you know, I--I've, I've had a varied experience in growing up, I can relate to a lot of different people, but you never got the sense of, you see what is happening to your people, so how--the things that were happening to the people in Detroit, would be the same things that would be happening to my neighborhood in Knoxville.  You know, they would be going in with the same illnesses and same problems, they're overweight, the blood sugar is out of control, the blood pressures to high, they had a stroke, you know, and, and those things.
Speaker 1: Now, there has been said at times, within the African American community there was an inner distrust of other African American doctors from the patients.  Did you ever experience that?  Like, like your diagnosis or your advice was not taken because the African American really didn't trust you and your abilities or your decisions?
Speaker 2: Well, I think of it often as a say "Doogie Howser," so if you had the intern there trying to make a decision on your life, then there may be some attitude of distrust there.  Very rarely does that, has that ever come into play and most of the time, most patients, particularly African American patients are very, very happy that I'm taking care of them, you know, honestly and that's been throughout and now, certainly I'm older, people look (unclear) that directly, but even I felt the same thing being younger too.
Speaker 1: Have you heard tell of that though?  Because I can recall growing up hearing sounds of don't trust a black doctor, have you ever heard that before?
Speaker 2: I have, it's, that must have been something that was kind of germane for Detroit because I've heard it from other people that are from Detroit, but for the most part, when I grew up, people trusted African Americans and we thought that we would be in better hands with African Americans and not, and that may not always be the case, and there were--there was a period of time when I think that there may have been people who were over extending themselves or over selling themselves and were not able to deliver on what they said that they would be able to do.  Likewise, I'm sure that there was a time for African Americans and that might be in my parents time or their parents time when the doctors didn't have access to the latest equipment and so to go to a black doctor you would be limited to the black hospital, if you went to the white doctor, then you might be able to get in the white hospital and to get, you know, the specialized testing and so, in--integration had come and so I'm there in basically the white hospital and I have access to everything that Henry Ford has to offer and they were--more rapport with them, and perhaps that's from coming from Austin-East [High School, Knoxville, Tennessee], my rapport from Austin-East or my growing up let them know that whatever resources were available, I'm definitely willing to give it to them, and just as I would be willing to give it to anybody else.  And so, they would feel comfortable that I'm not withholding things which is a problem that you go to the doctor and you think that they're not doing everything that they possibly could do.  Well that attitude does come up, and sometimes you do see now, you know, I had a chance to see that at Mayo as well, where people who may be African American aren't exposed to as much testing or they don't seem to work them up as diligently or they don't take an interest in their case to really, you know, get to a final diagnosis, they just treat 'em and let 'em go as opposed to really following them as intently as they would follow other cases that were similar.
Story_ID: 100318
Speaker 1: So you were at Henry Ford [Hospital, Detroit, Michigan] for a year, what caused you to go back to Mayo Clinic [Rochester, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: Love brought me back definitely.  It wasn't Mayo, it was love, my wife [HM Dr. Hollis Underwood] was at Mayo and I went back to finish my internal medicine so I could be with her.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stayed there for how long?
Speaker 2: I was there for two more years.  So I did my, my internal medicine residency, my internship was in, at Henry Ford and then internal medicine residency was at Mayo, Mayo Graduate School of Medicine.
Speaker 1: So you stayed there for two years and you reacquaint with your wife and get that on an even keel, and now you go somewhere else, where do you go and when do you go?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, that would be 1987, we went to the Virgin Islands, my wife had two year public health service commitment to pay back, the National Health Service Corps paid for two years of her school and she had to give back to the country to repay that so we were assigned to St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, so we went to the Virgin Islands.
Speaker 1: What a great way to pay back, so easy.  (Laughter) So, so you go to the Virgin Islands and what did you do?  What was your actual title and your position?
Speaker 2: Okay, I was the director of the emergency room and the intensive care unit at St. Croix Hospital.
Speaker 1: Now you're here and now in, within a couple of years you're now the director of the emergency room.
Speaker 2: Right, that was a very beautiful experience because I'm well trained, St. Croix Hospital is, is as you can imagine, is very small but directly out of residency I, I became a director and so the leadership, and remember I said, I went away for basically leadership training when I was at Henry Ford to understand that.  Now, I'm a, I'm a dual director--I have two departments--and that's pride by having my first job as a director, being a leader, but I'm really deeply ingratiated to the Virgin Islands for allowing me that opportunity, it's only in a black system that they would have a student African American come out of school, that I would be able to get a directorship anywhere.
Speaker 1: How large was, was your staff at that point?
Speaker 2: I had eight physicians and probably say fifteen nurses.
Speaker 1: Now the St. Croix Hospital Emergency Room, were you witnessing the same types of things that you had, you had exhibited in the States actually, except were you--was it the same illnesses, the same kinds of traumas with it--was it, was it different or was it less or more?
Speaker 2: Well, it's the--in terms of illnesses, they're basically the same honestly, the--Henry Ford you had more diverse population and St. Croix is pretty much all African American.  The resources to deal with it are much less, Henry Ford is certainly a much larger hospital than St. Croix Hospital, okay, and then being over the entire emergency room, there was trauma, there was a lot, I mean there was, there was trauma there whereas, as an internal medicine resident, as a, as a medicine res--resident, there's not that much trauma or surgery.  So I had to learn, my colleagues taught me the surgery that I needed to know and which goes for burn management or major trauma, car accidents, gunshot wounds and simple sutures and things of that nature, I learned that when I was a St. Croix.
Speaker 1: So you're there, have you any children on the way yet by now or?
Speaker 2: No, we were trying, but then we did have one in 1987, we had our first, Paul.
Speaker 1: And he was born in the Virgin Islands or?
Speaker 2: He's a Crucian, that's right.
Speaker 1: So you're there and Dr. Underwood, the female version, she's there also, and what is she doing at this time period?
Speaker 2: She worked in the Frederiksted Health Clinic, and so this is a community health clinic and she had patients and worked.
Speaker 1: Now, while you were in St. Croix, did you do anything else?  Did you become any--on any other boards, members of anything else while you were in St. Croix?
Speaker 2: Well on the islands, we're somewhat isolated, but in terms of being involved from the emergency room perspective, I worked on a task force to get a bill passed to--for domestic violence for that reform and then, I had the chance to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA to develop a hurricane preparedness program for the island so, that was good because it had, we'd--there was--it was a multi-lateral type of, type of board, we had many different agencies that were involved.
Speaker 1: Let's back up to the, to the domestic violence task force, talk about that for a moment, what, what was that like, and what was that about for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the same, my, my real first real experience in going to meetings of a group to, to try to pass legislatures.  So, it's, you know, the--it was founded by a woman's support group and then to find a senator that would sponsor the bill, and to get the input, say from the emergency room, from the police department and just to watch the process of how the coalitions are formed and legislation is drafted and I'm watching it go through the senate and to eventually be passed.  It was, it was fairly simple, it just forced the police to arrest people for suspected domestic violence so the police officer couldn't come by, look at the situation and say everything is calm, just don't do it anymore, that if there was an allegation of domestic violence then they were forced to arrest, so we didn't place the burden on the female to press charges.
Speaker 1: Was there a high incident rate of trauma or injury in the, in the emergency department that you think was due to domestic violence in St. Croix?
Speaker 2: It was a, there was a fair share, it wasn't particularly any higher than I thought than any other emergency room.  But there, there was a considerable number of patients that were abused that came through.
Story_ID: 100319
Speaker 1: So now, this is quite interesting.  Now you're twenty-nine years old, you're not even thirty yet, and you've been a director of a hospital emergency room, you're on task force, you're married, you have a child and it's 1990, what happens now?
Speaker 2: Well, time is going on.  I think there was a major event that happened in 1989.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had another child, (laughter)so, little Ian came, but a couple months after our son was born, our second son was born, there was a major hurricane that hit St. Croix, so that was Hurricane Hugo.  So the disaster preparedness really came into play and it had another aspect of the say, the emergency management and the leadership characteristics, to be able to hold together the emergency room team to make sure that our services continued on unfettered and that we were able to care for the community there.
Speaker 1: So, ironically enough, you had been part, you had helped put places, planned in place prior to this hurricane coming.
Speaker 2: And we had a chance to, to use it.  In the Virgin Islands, you're in a hurricane belt so you can count on hurricanes being there and often times, hurricanes come and they're, they're severe storms but never the magnitude as Hurricane Hugo.  Hurricane Hugo was huge, it was on the same scale as Katrina, Hurricane Katrina actually and Hurri--the island is small, as I said very few resources and to have that force be placed on us and then to the length of time.  I don't know if you recall how the National Guard had to come in to stop the looting and we didn't have any resources, everything was torn up, 85 percent of the houses there lost their roof, you know, the issues with water, we had, we didn't have, like city water, we, most people relied on cisterns, there were a lot of people who didn't have homes, you know, we had to put tarps on top of some of the roofs there to (unclear) and bay and to be able to manage, 'cause the emergency rooms then got to be very busy because the hospital became fairly ineffective, you know, the generator in the hospital blew up, but people were still stepping on nails and needing their insulin and so, I had to maintain full services and my own staff had their own issues too, you know, they had their own houses that they had to go take care of and their own families that they had to take care of.  Communications were difficult, this is before we had cell phones, we had already had a system of radios in some areas that were predestined to become like satellite clinics in case the major ones were, were cut off as they were, so it was very nice to see that our plan, even though there were some glitches, that came up, that our plan really did go through and it's a very in--fortunate, fortunate that we did have a chance to plan for it because I've seen examples since then of when people didn't have a good disaster plan and the, just the catastrophe that, that can occur.
Speaker 1: What's going through your head, you're twenty-nine years old, you have two small children and what was, at first a beautiful situation, has now turned into possibly what some would call a nightmare?  You're in charge, you're twenty-nine years old, and this is a young man relatively, you gotta make decisions, yeah, you have to staff a group of people, as you said, they have their own problems, and we know how hard it is to work when you are, are, are trying to compartmentalize like that so, what's going through your head at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, what actually happened is, my mother-in-law at that time was the director of nursing at St. Thomas Hospital, so the family, the young family went to St, Thomas to stay, so I was there basically in our house alone.  We didn't have power for six months, I had a little generator that my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] had sent me from Minnesota and I was able to, to work from that aspect and hold things together, interact with the public health service when they came, they brought some of the--National Guard brought the deployable medical units, like the MASH [mobile army surgical hospital] units and so, I had to get the staff to integrate with those and, and keep going.  So, it was really, it was very challenging, it was fun, and really to, to have, have a system in place and to pull it together and to work with other people, other agencies to make sure that the health of people was guaranteed, all our patients in the hospital, we helicoptered over to Puerto Rico, got them so people were safe and in retrospect, I think we lost around three people during the storm.  The same storm went up to Charlotte [North Carolina], it hit Charlotte I think seventeen days later, oh no, it hit Charlotte about two or three days later and seventeen people died in Hurricane Hugo here in the States, so, I had a sense of, you know, I felt better about that, that we were really able to hold things together, I mean the situations were different but, I did feel that we, we performed adequately.
Story_ID: 100320
Speaker 1: It was also during some of those experiences that I'd learned that probably gastroenterology wasn't for me either, that the life of gastroenterologist in the real world wasn't really what I'd depicted and probably cardiology was a, would be a better choice for me, that I seemed to be much more comfortable with the cardiac medications. I'd worked with our pharmacy and formulary committee to get some of the clot busting medications on the island so that people, a lot of tourist would come, sometimes they'd have heart attacks, so we would be able to treat them in the best way possible. And so, I'd then shifted toward looking for sub specializing because my wife [HM Dr. Hollis Underwood]'s public health service commitment did come to an end and so we we're gonna move on, so then I was gonna go back and finish my training.
Speaker 2: So, that happens in 1990, where do you go?
Speaker 1: I left and went to the Cleveland Clinic [Cleveland, Ohio], it was very fortunate for me.  I hadn't really heard at that time Cleveland Clinic wasn't--it's always been very prominent in cardiology, definitely, but it, it wasn't in the same light then that it is now.  And so, I want to go to an institution that had a lot of patient experiences, it was just always been very busy, it wasn't very academic, but it was very, very clinically busy, and I wanted to be in a place where I could see a lot of patients, get a lot of exposures, to know what the complications were so I would be well-versed when I went to the community to practice medicine, to practice cardiology.
Speaker 2: Explain life in Cleveland at that point, Cleveland is this big heavy town with, with a lot of blue collar workers and susceptible to heart and a lot of eating and things of that nature occurs in Cleveland.  So, what did you see there as, as you went into the cardiology?
Speaker 1: Oh, there was a lot of heart disease, there's no doubt, it's the busiest place in the world for cardiology so, it was a very good experience in terms of education, definitely.  My wife worked in Parma [Cleveland, Ohio] so she was around a lot of the blue collar people in that, in that sense, but the interaction was, was extremely very pleasant.  We lived in Shaker Heights [Ohio] and the cadre of African Americans that were with us, you had other African American professionals, orthopedists, surgeons, dentists, you know, it was a nice, another Jack and Jill group, 'cause the kids, the children were small at that age, so it was really a very home-like environment, it's really like our first time, you know, in the Virgin Islands we, we were certainly interacted well with communities also, but here it was really more of a home environment and, you know, with young children and looking for childcare and things of that nature and you could fit really right in with the community, it was integrated of course, but still you really felt like you were a part of the community.
Speaker 2: Now, at this point how are you being received professionally, because at this point you're still a young physician and it's, it's not ten years yet, since you've been, you know, been a physician.  What is the feeling, because you, you've come up the ranks and you've done some big things, probably more experience than some that have had, had longer careers, what is your reception like among, among your peers and colleagues?
Speaker 1: I think I was generally well received, I got along well with pretty much everyone, and I had the ability to understand different peoples perspectives so that--see I'd had a break in training so, I didn't go straight through residency to fellowship.  I had a chance to see how some of these skills could be employed.  The things that they're trying to teach us, what would be important when we got out, you know, when I was in the emergency room, in that intensive care unit, and I sent my patients off for cardiovascular care, there are certain things that are important and those are the things that we would want to emphasis to the, to that my colleagues would learn as well.
Story_ID: 100321
Speaker 1: So now you're in Cleveland [Ohio] and you're, you're on your fellowship [at the Cleveland Clinic] and you've decided now that cardiology is the way for you.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, I was very surprised when I got here to see exactly what cardiologists did, because this was just like the, it's like the bomb, this is just golden that they do procedures and all the aspects of the heart and all the different medications.  I had no idea that cardiologist were actually involved with doing angiograms or angioplasties or, you know, are now stents, pacemakers, even though I was inter--interested in cardiovascular disease, I wasn't aware that it was actually the cardiologist that did those procedures and so I can honestly say that, you know, I didn't go into it for, say financial gain, you know, they, it's not so bad to, to do the procedures but, that wasn't what really motivated me to go into cardiology, it was not procedure-oriented.  And so, I was really pleasantly surprised to see that, that's actually the realm that I'm in so, that's why I said that if I'd probably had a little bit more exposure at Mayo, to these same things, then I might have been able to decide even earlier on, even though I'm not that far, I didn't delay at all.  But it, you know, is, it would have just been nice that I could have capitalized on some of those experiences earlier.
Speaker 1: So you stayed in Cleveland for how many years?
Speaker 2: We were there for three years, three years with the fellowship and then I spent some time in Iowa, in Des Moines, Iowa doing my interventional cardiology fellowship and so when I was away my family stayed in Cleveland.  I had another young son then as well, so our third son was born while we were in Cleveland and my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] moved from--she, she was, had transferred from Minnesota to Connecticut so she moved from Connecticut with us to help with--Holly [HM Dr. Hollis Underwood] while I was away in Iowa.
Story_ID: 100322
Speaker 1: Now was your father [Paul Underwood, Sr.] still alive at this time, or?
Speaker 2: No, my father passed when we were in the Virgin Islands, so shortly after Hurricane Hugo he passed.
Speaker 1: And we need to back up.  When, where was he, and what was his feelings when you became a doctor, since it was his suggestion?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's always been very proud of me, even throughout my life he's been very, very proud of me.  His, his death, again, brought out some feelings for physicians that I'd had.  He had cancer, he had neck cancer and became ill with pneumonia, went to the hospital and somehow the doctor had convinced his mother and my mother's and my, my grandmother's sister, my aunt (unclear) to basically make him a no code, DNR [do not resuscitate] and they put him on a morphine drip and he died, and within, you know, I was trying to get from the Virgin Islands to go back to visit him, I knew that he was ill, but within the forty-eight hours he was already gone and knowing medicine it wasn't necessary for him to go quite so quickly, I'm not really sure if it was necessary for him to go at all.  There was a time when people had these bag--bad strep pneumonias that were killing people that was one of the strep pneumonias and it just always left a bitter taste in my mouth on how the physician seemed to take advantage of these two old ladies and to get them to do something that didn't allow me to see the--spend the final time with my father.
Speaker 1: And where was he living at this point?
Speaker 2: He was in Knoxville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so, so same physicians, I went to visit 'em, talk to 'em, same arrogant type of physicians.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, these, these experiences make one not want to be that way when you have the opportunity to be that way, so that seeing how others may act, and the characteristics you see are favorable or dis-favorable, would make one tend to try to be compassionate and understanding with a situation if I had the, the chance to do that, and so that's how it molds my behavior.
Story_ID: 100323
Speaker 1: So you go to Iowa, your family stays in Cleveland [Ohio], your mom [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] moves to help out, how long do you stay in Iowa?
Speaker 2: I was there for six months, during the floods in Des Moines [Iowa], if you remember several years ago?  I was there to experience the floods.
Speaker 1: So, you've noticed that you've been around some, some, some water.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: A disaster can happen at any time, yeah, but it was fun, it was very good, it was a very nice relationship, the practice I was with was just wonderful, Iowa Heart Center, the mentors that I had there taught me a lot, a tremendous amount.  I had a chance to initiate some research, at that time that I still pretty much have continued until now.  Seeing how that their practice was structured, the satellites and the administrative staff, the services, the clinics that they have within their cardiology practice and how they were run, was really a very enlightful, very insightful for me and it's been a model that I've tried to remember when I try to set things up for my own, so it was a wonderful experience.
Story_ID: 100324
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stay in day--Des Moines [Iowa] for six, about six months.
Speaker 2: Six months, right.
Speaker 1: Then where do you go?
Speaker 2: Well, I went back to Cleveland [Ohio] and that was the time when I was looking for work basically, so I would moonlight around on the town there and I did locum tenens in different areas until I could find a--(simultaneous) (unclear)
Speaker 1: Explain that term to--(simultaneous)(unclear)
Speaker 2: Well, it's spending time, say journeyman type work, so you'd spend two or three months at a particular hospital or a clinic or institution and provide coverage for them until they're able to hire, typically hire someone as a permanent staff person.  So, the major assignment that I had was in Madisonville, Kentucky, at the Trover Clinic and so I would go there, pretty much during the week and come back home on the weekend, go back during the week, and come back depending on how their call schedule went, until I had the opportunity to find a permanent position.
Speaker 1: And, did you find one?
Speaker 2: I did, it was very odd.  People, even when, as a, as a fellow they would say that, you know, why don't you consider Arizona?  I said, well, no I don't really wanna consider Arizona, California perhaps, 'cause California is very popular, and I would love to go to California, but Arizona was where they had cowboys and there was a desert, they didn't honor [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s birthday at the time either, so since there's not really any reason for me to be out with a bunch of rednecks in the desert and I--that might be a good opportunity for you, but I don't think that, that's the opportunity for me.  But, there was a course, it was a stent course, how to, you know, put in the coronary stents that you hear about, well there's a stent course that was at The Buttes in the, in Tempe [Arizona], which is a resort area that's close to here [Phoenix, Arizona], and one, one of the practices [Advanced Cardiac Specialists] that kept trying to recruit me, you know, send me all this information, had the headhunters call me, was in Gilbert, Arizona, and so I had no idea of what, what Gilbert was and certainly, I mean, Phoenix, I'd heard about or Tucson [Arizona], I'd at least heard about, but Gilbert, I knew nothing about so, I said, why don't I, while I'm out there for the stent course, I looked on the map and then Gilbert's about ten miles away from Tempe, I said, I'll just go out to that office, look at it, tell 'em I'm not interested and don't call me anymore and be on my way.  But, it was February, came out here, everything is nice and green, people running around in their shorts, the city's clean, you see not very many African Americans, but one or two walking around, they have the Indian, the Native American motifs on the, on the underpasses and overpasses, I said, well, you know, this got some spirituality, ethnicity to it, it's not so bad and that's why I asked, you know, called my wife [HM Dr. Hollis Underwood] and asked her to come out and she spent a couple more days while we were out here looking around, the opportunity was very good so, I signed up and we've been here in Phoenix ever since.
Story_ID: 100325
Speaker 1: And at that time, you met a few people, you're coming out there, you know, so you changed your mind basically about, about how Arizona was for you.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --At that point, and you met [HM] Marvin Perry?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well Marvin was one of the first people that we met and he seems to have a knack for hav--finding new professionals as they come to town.  And so, he said he had this Black Board of Directors Project and would we wanna participate and so, it sounds interesting, at least it's a way of networking with other people who seem to be similar to myself.
Speaker 1: In a small sentence, what is the gist of his project?
Speaker 2: Well, what the Black Board of Directors does is it gets professionals that are new to the community and tries to involve them within the community.  So, he would try to place us on boards, community boards, whether it's Planned Parenthood or American Heart Association, or the, the school board or the juvenile court board, so that we can interact with others in, in the, in the city to make sure that our voices are expressed and that we have the opportunity to give back to Phoenix [Arizona], what Phoenix has given to us.
Speaker 1: So he was pretty successful because he got you on the--you, you became the director of a very important agency or board, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well he's got me on several boards, but I've enjoyed--
Speaker 1: The American Heart Association?
Speaker 2: The American Heart Association.  I've had a long standing relationship with them so, at that time there was the South Phoenix Board that they'd had and I was acting with the American Heart Association then as a board member, but it was continued involvement with the Amer--with the American Heart Association so when that board was restructured, there as the ability to work with him on other committees and initiatives.  Now, you know, throughout, throughout time the--my tenure here, I've worked with the American Heart Association in different ways, whether it's been vicariously through my wife [HM Dr. Hollis Underwood] on the Heart Ball or I was the chairperson of Operation Heartbeat, which put the automated defibrillators in the airports and all the public municipal areas here, I worked on that committee.  Now, I'm working with the Cultural Health Initiatives committee, which is directed toward making sure the message is getting, as president of the Latino and African American communities, one of our spokespersons was the late Yolanda King, so that interaction so, just the ability to work with the American Heart Association throughout and be influential here in the Valley to make sure that all communities have access to the information for cardiovascular health.
Speaker 1: Now, you about here for three years and you're working at the, at the Gilbert in Gilbert [Arizona], correct?
Speaker 2: Right, it was mostly South Phoenix, we had a catheterization lab in South Phoenix that I spent a lot of time at.  The main office was in Gilbert, and so it was going back, back and forth.
Story_ID: 100326
Speaker 1: Now, '97 [1997], something happens, you get a chance to, to travel, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, this was a time that I had established a relationship with the cardiovascular surgeon, Afro-American cardiovascular surgeon, Albert Olivier and he had developed this project, Project MEDHELP, which was to establish a cardiovascular surgery center in Senegal, West Africa.  This came out of the work with Reverend Leon Sullivan and the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help and one of--through one of the African, African American Summits communication between the (unclear) and Senegalese surgeon came about, that they wanted to, to develop a program.  And now, our Dr. Olivier garnered a lot of resources here, both physical resources, materials and then professional resources so doctors and nurses to travel with them to, to Dakar [Senegal] and to help train the, the professionals there as well as, to bring over materials to complete cardiovascular surgery.
Speaker 1: Now you're in Africa, how did you feel when you saw this and you saw Africans now?
Speaker 2: I felt absolutely wonderful.  It was great to be in a different environment for one, and Senegal, the national language is French, I'd learned a little French through school and then the major language, the most widely spoken language is Wolof, which is totally different than any language here.  The culture is different basically, and they're about 95 percent Muslim so, it, it--everything is different and the best part is to have, you know, a bl--me as a black cardiologist, and they have black cardiologists in Senegal and we're all very similar.  You know, they maybe Muslim, but they have kids the same way, little Nintendos, some of them and, you know, having to send them to school, the attitudes toward patients and what you see is exactly the same, they just speak different language, go to a different church and it was, it was various, I'm, I'm still friends with them, definitely.
Speaker 1: Was there, was the disease ratio different because of diet and things being different slightly, was it the same kinds of conditions or was it different?
Speaker 2: From my aspect they have--it stems from a higher rate of infectious disease, they have a lot of rheumatic heart disease and the cardiovascular surgery program that we have there, it centers around valve replacement surgery, whereas here in the United States it's coronary artery disease is very important and a lot of people have coronary bypass rather than have, you know, bypass surgery and some valve surgery, there it's mostly valve surgery and that's, we were there really to setup a cardiovascular surgery program to put in valves so, that's based on untreated strep throat in children, so that's definitely a difference.  But as a cardiologist, you know, Dr. Olivier would work with the surgeon doctor and I quite a bit and they would develop their surgical techniques, I would develop cardiology techniques with Doctors Bah [ph.] and Doctors Jope[ph.] to, to look at cardiology and so there is an incidence of coronary artery disease, hear failure and certainly arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or stroke are very important.  Similar things as you, as you would see here, but an overwhelming preponderance of rheumatic heart disease too, which I would never see over here to the same degree.
Speaker 1: So, it was heart disease but, but for different reasons?
Speaker 2: Correct.  So, I was able to teach them about their coronaries, the equipment that we have, because I'm more use to these resources, the coronaries and that management of the technical management or technol--technological management of it and then they were able to teach me about rheumatic disease and how to manage that, arrhythmias and how they manage that with the resources that they have.
Speaker 1: So how long was that trip?
Speaker 2: The trips were for two years.  We went five or six times.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So back, back and forth, sometimes twice within the year so, we'd go operate and then leave and then they would try to bolster their systems in different ways to get more training, get more people involved, then we go back, refresh them, you know, more and to, to didactic education and operate more.
Speaker 1: How long would you stay at the--
Speaker 2: Typically ten to fourteen days.
Story_ID: 100327
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you, you're doing this and you move through, into '99 [1999], and you join the Association of Black Cardiologists [ABC] or you're already a part of this group already?
Speaker 2: Well, really I joined the Association of Black Cardiologists right when I came back to the United States from St. Croix.  As a fellow, I was in, a fellow in the Association of Black Cardiologist and that group gave me a tremendous amount of support.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that group.
Speaker 2: Well this group is founded thirty years ago, in 19--
Speaker 1: Who founded it?
Speaker 2: --1976, Dr. Richard Allen Williams, and a group of twelve other members founded it.  He, he is the, Dr. Richard Allen Williams, is the founding member and over the years what we've developed is a way of professional education for, for physicians to let them know the latest nuances in cardiovascular disease particularly as it relates to African Americans.  We also look at cardiovascular research to make sure that African Americans are participating in cardiovascular research so that the tablets that we may use on a, on a black person we know have been tested, to know that it works on people who are like them.  And then also, in community programs so that we have awareness programs very similar to the American Heart Association, to go to the churches and barbershops to make sure that people are aware of cardiovascular disease, it's signs and symptoms and risk factors and to intervene in that way.
Speaker 1: How large is the group, Dr. Underwood?
Speaker 2: They are approximately 600 members across the country and we have now that our community programs have grown, there's probably around 700, 800 members if you look at lay members as well.  But let me just say that, this group gave me quite a bit of support because I could go to the national meetings as a fellow and interact with other cardiologists, there were some there, and they would, you know, teach me and so, when I went back too, as a fellow, I would know even more then everyone else, I would know what's, what's important and so I was seen as a resource and it's largely through my association with the Association of Black Cardiologists that allowed me to do that.
Speaker 1: So you eventually became a president, correct?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And you sat, you sat on several boards, but your highest rank inside the organization was president, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: That was another learning experience and certainly the opportunity to ex--to experience leadership in that way, which now as time has gone on, now leadership is a very prominent component of most, of most programs and how to lead organizations, motivation, hierarchical management in organizations is very important so, then it was my responsibility to pull, pull the organization together and try to tug at the reins for some time.  During my tenure, we built our headquarters in Atlanta [Georgia], which is a 50,000 square foot building for, I think around $7 million is what we paid for it and to watch that building process come into play, the different interactions that took place and then to have our programs interact with the large pharmacy and device, medical device companies to setup educational programs or opportunities for community intervention, to make sure that the research protocols are open for our, for our investigators to use.  It was really very insightful, interacting with boards, the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, so these same individuals who were at Mayo [Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota] who never mentioned anything about cardiology to me before, now we're on, you know, sitting across the table with each other and I represent the Association of Black Cardiologists and we have to--we all have a similar interest, but we have to go head to head to get these things done.
Speaker 1: So how do you feel now, you're sitting here looking at some of these same people and just, what's going through your head as president of the, of the ABC?
Speaker 2: I'm very happy that I've had the experiences that I've had and to be able to know my community in some way and know my community well enough to be able to express our needs and to know what aspects that they may have access too, that they may be withholding from me.  And to allow us to interact in certain ways to get people on these committees to open up and have joint programs here, to vie for the same dollars and resource dollars that are, that are here and that they won't be able to at least as far as I can tell, they won't be able to hide these things from 'em, from me or us as a group.  And to allow us to express ourselves as they've been able to express themselves as well.
Speaker 1: How long was your tenure for, as president?
Speaker 2: I was president for two years.  I was vice president for two years before that, president for two years and now I'm resting.
Story_ID: 100328
Speaker 1: Now, the Association of Black Cardiologists got very involved in Hurricane Katrina?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Once again, another storm and, and Dr. Underwood is part of this, tell us about this now.
Speaker 2: Well, what we developed, one of our prominent members, Dr. Keith Ferdinand, is a cardiologist in New Orleans [Louisiana], I mean a very staunch, diehard New Orleans person and he developed the Hope Fund for Hurricane Katrina relief and we were able to get resources from both membership, as well as, as the pharmacy from the medical and device industry to help appease some of the damages that had been done by Hurricane Katrina.  Now with the Association of Black Cardiologists [ABC], one of my pet projects is our community programs, and so we'd established a network going through sites in Missouri and then to Port Gibson, Mississippi, of, of community programs that, that are ABC programs and, you know, strangely enough, through my network, I was able to distribute resources (unclear) water, food and clothing goods to, to my satellites, those, those in our network for our community programs faster than the federal government was able to distribute aid to New Orleans.  And so I said, I never thought that these simple systems, which this wasn't a, a disaster response system at all, but this is just a simple network of community programs that we would able, be able to support ourselves, you know, to, to whatever degree that we could support ourselves in a way that's better than all the resources of the federal government that I pay taxes for every year and, and to be faster and more efficient in doing this.
Speaker 1: So would you say that it, do you think it was just lack of act--absolute concern that caused some of the health problems and things that occurred and even, even the, the mortality rate in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: I think that there was perhaps a considerable degree of lack of adequate planning, there may have been some problems with resource allocation that certainly it's easy for me to say, do this, do that, but unless you have the resources dedicated to those projects, they probably won't take place.  A lot of those was just lack of planning and I think that there were some bureaucratic tangles in terms of who was taking leadership authority for dispatching certain goods at certain times, and no one wanted to take responsibility for releasing items that were needed for people there.  The--this, the response that we saw at Katrina didn't have to happen, a lot of it, not to be political, but some of the people that were in charge of FEMA at that time were political appointees and I had already probably had more disaster management training then they had had, and so they honestly, even though they were, may have been bureaucrats and good administrators they honestly didn't know what they were doing.
Speaker 1: Did you go actually to the rec--to the area and see anything yourself?
Speaker 2: No.  I--no, no, I still--I had been to New Orleans a couple of times but I haven't seen th--I've, I've seen what a hurricane does, I can pretty much imagine what it was like.  Travel was difficult, I have a cousin that's an anesthesiologist, Dr. Melva White [ph.], who lived in New Orleans, and so I'd hear all these stories about how he went to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and, but has transpired and talked to him frequently now what New Orleans is and I've seen the individuals that are in the programs though and some of our other meetings that when we get back, you know, get back together for like networking type meetings with them within the ABC's organization, so I know that they really deeply appreciated our, our efforts and our response.
Story_ID: 100329
Speaker 1: Now in 2005, the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approved a drug, can you tell me what that drug was called?
Speaker 2: BiDil.
Speaker 1: BiDil, tell us about BiDil.
Speaker 2: That was another very rewarding experiences that we had during my tenure at the Association of Black Cardiologist.  There was a large multi-site, multi-center, clinical trial, so it was across the nation trial that looked at a particular drug called BiDil, isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine combination, fixed dose combination.  And it was used exclusively in African American patients.
Speaker 1: Was it designed for that purpose totally?
Speaker 2: No, the, the combination had been used in the veterans' heart failure trials in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s], in all populations, but it seemed that combination had more benefit in African Americans and so the desire was to use it in solely African Americans to see if that benefit was real or not.  So, on top of standard therapy, it wasn't, it didn't replace any therapy for another, but on top of standard therapy, using this drug combination or just using this drug led to a 40 percent improvement in mortality in African--but it was all African Americans.  And with that data, the company NitroMed went to the Food and Drug Administration and asked them to approve the drug and because it's a trial, the pivotal trial, this landmark trial was for African Americans, it was indicated, it was written for use for African Americans, although it's--if non-African American takes it, I doubt it's gonna make them sick, in fact, I've used it on non-African Americans, and they seem to respond equally as well.  But, that was very rewarding in several ways, for one, there was a close interaction between the Association of Black Cardiologists and NitroMed in terms of exploring the aspects of, cultural aspects of African Americans, heart failure in African Americans, so the communities, a need came out, the issue of race and medicine was very prominent and the Association of Black Cardiologists had a prominent spot in being able to help define for the country or educate the country some of the issues on race and medicine.  We had interactions with the Food and Drug Administration and the Office of Minority Health, you know, testimonials and what not on the interaction and the opportunity to have African American investigators conduct a clinical trial that was very well conducted and to--brought back important scientific information for everybody to use, and we've learned, we're still learning from the A-HeFT [African-American Heart Failure Trial] trial that had the largest number of women in any heart failure trial involved with it and so for--there's a condition called peripartum cardiomyopathy, which it's a strange illness that gives young women heart failure after they've delivered, directly after they've delivered, we have the largest registry of that.  So, just, just for an example, so there's a lot of scientific information that we're all gonna benefit from that came out  of this particular trial and so, as I've told people that often times the community at large would think that, that African Americans and health are basically taking something away from them, that you have to give the African Americans this, this is one chance where there's actually been some good that's come--they're many other instances, but this one clear instance where there's been good for the overall community that's been based on African Americans in our, in our experience here and so it's very rewarding to be involved with the group and getting that through.
Speaker 1: And you were president at this time?
Speaker 2: I was president when the trial was reported at the American Heart Association in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Story_ID: 100330
Speaker 1: So you've gone through, and you've helped out with drug trials, you've been on various disaster relief efforts and a few years ago I guess, last year actually, 2006, you received a very prestigious award here, can you tell me what that award is from [HM] Marvin Perry?
Speaker 2: That was the Lincoln Ragsdale Award [2006 Dr. Lincoln J. Ragsdale, Sr. Outstanding Director Award] and it's for them being an outstanding director in the African American community here and through the [Black] Board of Directors Project but, but here in Phoenix.
Speaker 1: Now, who's Lincoln Ragsdale?
Speaker 2: Lincoln Ragsdale was a prominent African American who unfortunately passed before his time, but he was very responsible for integrating, waking up Phoenix [Arizona] to the existence of African Americans here in terms of the need to expand in business and the need for the culture of African Americans to be expressed here in the Valley and not just to be subjugated to certain areas.  A lot of the early African Americans here in Phoenix are migrants from Texas and Louisiana who came here to pick cotton.  I'm sure you've heard of the Pima Cotton that you see in towels, well that's from the Pima Indians and the--they have reservations here in the Valley, in Phoenix you probably passed over them when you flew in, they grow cotton and so cotton industry was very large in the '40s [1940s], and '50s [1950s], here in the Valley and there were a lot of blacks that came over to pick cotton in that industry.  They were relegated to certain areas and it was the efforts of Lincoln Ragsdale that got 'em out of those areas and to become more involved in the community itself.
Speaker 1: So up to this point you had many, many accomplishments, you, you've done quite a bit in the areas of cardiology and medicine in general and not just these areas in humanitarian and community efforts also.  Now, what are you doing daily, on a daily basis?
Speaker 2: Well what I've recently done was to change practices, I--I've moved from--
Story_ID: 100331
Speaker 1: So how is life, and the climate working with Mrs. Underwood [HM Dr. Hollis Underwood], the two of you together for the first time [at Sonoran Health Specialists]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's been, I've been very warmly received, it's been I'm sure stressful on all parts, particularly her part because we've now moved myself and my small team into her space and so we're a bit cramped, but it's nice to work together as a team in terms of husband and wife and particularly in terms of a common vision with medicine because it allows us to have some synergy there and to get the, the resources that were needed for, for overall management of patients or overall interaction with communities.  And so, it's been challenging certainly, but it's been extremely enjoyable from my stand point.  You would have to ask her to get her opinions on, on how this has been, she's been in practice for some time in that, in that area, she designed the, the practice, the office and she had space for herself and to interject other individuals into it, I'm sure it throws 'em out of kilter to some degree, but I think that everyone really is looking for the shared vision and certainly the opportunity to have what I consider a premiere practice which involves, you know, high level, high standards of patient care, a professional education, community education, as well as clinical research, those aspects are now being covered and are expanding.
Story_ID: 100332
Speaker 1: So what does the future look like for the Underwoods medically as far as they go forward in, in Arizona here?
Speaker 2: Well my future is to develop a strong clinical research base, I think that's a lot of individuals know that they may have certain illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes, or high--high cholesterols and they may not be able to seek medical care or receive medical care as they would like, and certainly participation clinical trials is an important way that they can at least share with us some of their experiences and yet be treated at the same time.  Likewise, there's a strong push to get people out of the hospitals and get away from the hospital-based system, there are a lot of issues with that and so as much as we can do in the outpatient setting in managing patients, then I think that we would all be better off.  And so my idea is to use clinical research in the outpatient setting to try to help people, not necessarily have to rely on hospitals and the hospital setting to receive care for some of the chronic illnesses, not that researches care, but care can be rendered in a research format from, from those centers.  And so, I like to see our satellite clinics throughout the Valley that will look at cardiovascular research, clinical research, to have people come by and educate them on what they need to do with the wellness component to understand the need for diet and exercise, weight maintenance and, and things of that nature, as well as to see if there is illness, and if there is other illness involved, then to make sure they receive adequate treatments as well.
Story_ID: 100333
Speaker 1: What is your hope or dream or aspiration for the African American community in the future?
Speaker 2: Overall I think that we still have to maintain our degree of cohesiveness.  As the African American communities expanded, as all communities have expanded, we're held together by, you know, cell phone communications and internet and often times the geographical bonds that we've had in the past aren't present anymore.  We don't see each other often, we're not around each other often and some of the cultural aspects of our socialization may not be expressed in particular, they may not be expressed in the way that our children can understand them and carry them on to the future.  So, I think it's very important for us to realize what our community is and then to--everyone has a role no matter what position, you know, you don't have to be physicians, you don't have to be lawyers, whatever position we're in, to make sure that we look after our communities so that we have the healthiest best community that we possibly could.  Which means that our children, when they grow up, they have the opportunity to express themselves in a way that they would want to express themselves so that no potential, you know, the mind is not wasted, mp potential is going to be wasted.  Likewise for us, you know, we will be healthy, that we will not be overweight, that our blood sugars will be under control, our blood pressures will be down, we will not be having strokes and so people can live to be like the old men that you see in the church, the eighty-five, you know, 100-year-old people that are there, that's what we should all experience and, I sometimes think that if we abdicate that responsibility to other people, particularly our, our governments to express that onus, that we may be missing out on some of our own personal responsibility and we probably won't achieve those goals.
Story_ID: 100334
Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for a young African American med student that might be experiencing some challenges or so, they might be thinking about going into medicine?
Speaker 2: Well for both aspects let's look at the second part first in terms of someone that's thinking about going into medicine and that is basically to know what you feel about science and your, your goals and your personal conviction for taking care of patients.  I think in the past, people would say you can go into medicine and make a lot of money, I think then there's the age of the investment bankers where people will say, you know, you should go into investment banking and then you can make a lot of money, okay, medicine may not be lucrative, it's not bad, but the amount of work that you need to put into it really requires a quite a bit of commitment or else you may become frustrated and so, if you have ideas and aspirations, don't let people, and this is for the medical student part, don't let people sway you from them based on what they perceive you to be.  So, if you wanted to be a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon, then you should be a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon despite individuals saying I think you would make a better dermatologist or, you know, you really need to go into OB/GYN, people often are very willing to transfer their beliefs about you to you where, you know, you have your own beliefs.  Likewise, there're many resources available of networking and there are a lot of people who are very willing to help in, in many different ways, I mean my community has helped me throughout in ways whether they protected me when I was young, they gave me opportunities and when I was older, you know, they gave me responsibilities to explore and I was able to grow on some of those, the community has helped me in many different ways, and so, your experiences may not need to be isolated, you can share them with others and that's been one of the strengths of the African American community, that we've been able to take a lot of stress on ourselves because that stress is filtered out and needed amongst the larger community.  And despite people maybe being down on one individual, it doesn't mean the whole community shatters, it just means that, that individuals been beat on and we absorb some of the shock throughout and we're able to keep on going and that's been one of our strengths and we need to, to know that.  As a young person, you need to know that and then as you grow older, then you can re--I won't say rely on it, but you know that, that's available and one of the tools that you have as being part of this community.

Speaker 1: In closing, is there one closing thought or message that you'd like to tell our audience today?
Speaker 2: Well, hopefully, we'll never close and this has always been a learning experience and building on one experience, not knowing how it may influence another experience that you've had, is really to always be open and to engage in people, to understand where they're coming from, exploring new ideas and to always continue learning, and so as you're able to develop ideas and be creative, another African American trait, to be creative in our minds, then be able to find the outlets to express that creativity for the betterment of everybody.
Speaker 1: Dr. Underwood, I want to thank you for this interview, it's been very enlightening.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's been fun for me, I really appreciate the time that you've spent with us.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 100336
Speaker 1: What you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well that's a very difficult question because I hadn't really thought about finishing, I'm still going through life at this moment and to have one aspect of one accomplishment is not, I'm not really geared toward accomplishments as toward keeping on.  The ability to establish a network that would persist is something that I feel very strongly about, just it's the network and, for Hurricane Katrina, to develop your own family network, your own social network, but networks that are strong, that inter--interrelate with each other and persist is one thing that I would like to say that I've had some hand in, in terms of bringing people together.
Story_ID: 100337
Speaker 1: And is there any special way that you would like to be remembered as a, as a physician or as a, as a humanitarian?
Speaker 2: Well, that I, I cared for people, and that I am a cardiologist and likely will be for some time now, I don't know when my time on this earth ends, if I will still be a cardiologist then, but certainly my aspect for caring for people and caring for the community is something that I would want people to remember.  I'm very committed to the community.
Speaker 1: Thank you.

Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about that picture?
Speaker 2: Okay, this picture looks like it's me when I'm probably around eight years old or so, so, there in Knoxville, Tennessee in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This photo is from the Virgin Islands at our house in the Virgin Islands and it's our newborn, Paul, he seems very small, almost the size of a football, he was a premature child so we're very, very happy that he's out and back home safely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now this is a picture of my family, probably when I'm around ten years old or so, my mother [Jacqueline Martin Underwood] taught in Alexandria, Egypt and they have a group of alumni that gets together and this is a--one of her coworker's house in Kansas City, Missouri, and so you have the family, our family's there in the center with my father [Paul Underwood, Sr.] in the background, my mother right in front of him, my sister beside her and then myself.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now this is one of our annual Easter photos and my sister and I in front of our house in Knoxville, Tennessee, I can't really judge the age, but probably I was around nine, I'd say nine or ten probably.
Speaker 1: Great job. Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of my mother's side of the family, my grandfather [Ralph Martin] is the only man there to the right and then my grandmother [Katherine (ph.) Martin] is on the other, other side of her, my mother is directly behind my grandfather standing up and then you have my two aunts, Rosie sitting down with my grandparents, and then my aunt Cleo.
Speaker 1: It's kind of a hidden one. But it's a great one though.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) This is me back in my young athletic days, I'm playing hockey for Hamilton National Bank in Knoxville, Tennessee.  I was a peewee I believe at that time, so I must have been around twelve.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my father.  I'm not sure exactly when that would be but, that's him in his polka dot tie.
Speaker 2: All right. Next.
Speaker 1: Now this is the first attitude toward team work that we expressed together so we're cutting the cake there at our wedding on November 24, 1984.
Speaker 2: Good, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is back in the days when I had hair, now it's gone (laughter). Way it goes.  All right this is me probably when I'm around thirteen, I would suspect probably a school photo because I have on my tie and my suitcoat there.  I seem to like a lot of colors and I had the afro and my, is it, gold rim glasses, what do they call those?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And this is in Rochester, Minnesota, directly after I graduated from medical school so, 1984, I've got diploma in hand.
Speaker 1: Nice.
Speaker 2: This is a great one.
Speaker 1: This is during a summer internship that I spent at Argonne National Laboratory in, what part of Illinois, we said in Elmhurst [Illinois], but what?  Anyway I was--
Speaker 2: Outside Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: --Right, there's Batavia [Illinois] and then there's Fermilabs in Batavia, I, I can't remember where Argonne is though [in Lemont, Illinois].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I mean we stayed in, in Elmhurst College in (unclear), I can't even think of where it was, maybe it's Argonne, Illinois, it might be its own city.  Anyway, so then this is Argonne National Laboratory, probably around 1978.  I did a research internship there and little did I know that probably at the time the, the dean or the president of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] was actually the director of that lab, [HM] Walter [E.] Massey, Dr. Walter Massey.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is at, in Cleveland, Cleveland Clinic and this is my, my group of fellows, I'm kind of to the upper right, excuse me, or upper left, looking at this way.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER)
Speaker 1: Its right, I'm right there, it's kinda of a dark spot there facing to the trees.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Cardiologist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, does that, does that come out?  Does it, does that--
Speaker 2: I think we can make it happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  Now, this is let me think, we're in 2007, 2005, it's 2004, when we had the ground breaking celebration for the Association of Black Cardiologist International Headquarters and Conference Center and during the invocation there was a storm, it stated off as a peaceful day and there was a fierce storm that just blew through, a lot of thunder and wind blew everything away and in the background that rainbow appeared, (laughter) (unclear) but that rainbow appeared and so we were able to gather ourselves together and get back out there and shovel some dirt with the blessings in the background.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER)
Speaker 1: Now this is one of the earlier moments that I can remember, so I must have been around four then and that's me helping my baby sister through life, giving her the bottle.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER)
Speaker 1: And that's my grandmother certainly to the left there, Louise Underwood, and my cousin, Rondel-- that's Vivian, Vivian Underwood, now she's Vivian Shipe.
Speaker 2: This is the, a picture of the family that we took during my induction to the Amer--as a fellow,  in the American College of Cardiology, so this was in 1995, I believe, '94 [1994], '95 [1995].  The children wouldn't sit still then so they had to digitally retouch it, (laughter) somehow to get them all smiling at the same time, it was really funny.
Speaker 1: And that's it, we're good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
