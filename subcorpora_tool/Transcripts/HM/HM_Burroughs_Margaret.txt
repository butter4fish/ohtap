Speaker 1: And what about a phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) Well, there's so many of them, you know, like what I use it goes with my life, like, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try, again."  And I try to pass this on to many young people and the main thing in getting something accomplished is perseverance. "If at first you don't succeed, try, try, again."
Story_ID: 4406
Speaker 1: Talk about your childhood and your parents and you were raised and born in Louisiana and I would like you tell us about who your parents were and describe each of them.
Speaker 2: Well, I was born--.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, can you wait until the helicopter passes?  It's a little bit noisy.
Speaker 2: Is that the helicopter went by?  Okay. I was born in a little town on the banks of the Mississippi River called St. Rose Parish in Louisiana. They say it was about 1917, but I'm sure they made a mistake.  Because the way I figure it out that I was much later (laughs). My father [Alexander Taylor] was a farmer, a dirt farmer, my mother [Octavia Pierre Taylor] was a housewife and she worked as a domestic for some of the white families down and around there. And, and that's what they were. We lived there until I was about five or six years old and this was about the middle '20s [1920s], the period of the Great Migrations of black people coming from the South, moving to the North, where there were jobs in the steel mills and the stockyards and my family--one of my uncles had been to World War I and when he came back from the war he wrote and told them he had stopped in Chicago [Illinois] and there were many jobs and more opportunities for education and everything else like that in Chicago, so they started saving up money for us to come to Chicago. I particularly remember one incident when the folks in the house said my mom and dad had saved up $100 and they were counting this money in the house and I was with them and I heard them say $100 and I ran outside and I said, "Oh, we got $100, we got $100." And my mama snatched me in the house and I got the best whipping of my life, you know, passing the word out about this money.  But anyhow we finally did get the money together. We went--came north in sections. I had two sisters older than myself and they came with a cousin and then I came with my mom and--I had--I remember that I had to walk with my knees bent so that they wouldn't see how big that I was so they wouldn't charge me full fare, you know, because I was kind of big for my age. So, I remember walking through this place, stooped down like that 'til we got there. Anyhow, that's when we came to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now let me--what do you know about your parents' parents. Was there anything--did you grow up around your grandparents?
Speaker 2: The main thing, I was only able to go as far as a--say a grandfather, on my father's side, from that point on, he disappeared into the Cherokee Indians because many--most African Americans have, have Indian heritage--Native American heritage anyhow and if you study far enough you find out that's where it goes, because it many places the Indians took--accepted the slaves into their families--married them, made them parts of their families and all, and so forth, and so, on my father's side, in fact, he was called, he was browned-skinned and he had straight hair and that's where my sisters got their straight hair from, of course I took from my mother's side, mine was ulotrichous, ulotrichous means crispy, I think, that's a nice new word for you. And the word for straight hair is leiotrichous, white folks have Ieiotrichous hair, black folks have ulotrichous hair, so now I've given you a lesson. But once a teacher, always a teacher. And on my mother's side, she goes back--there's an ancestor of hers from Martinique who was French, so they were French Creoles and they spoke Creole and everything. My grandmother, she could only speak Creole and they called her Mae-Mae and she only spoke Creole and the Creole dialect.  But they went back to the French.
Speaker 1: Did you grow up around your grandparents and know them?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, no, didn't know any of them, they were all gone they were all gone.
Speaker 1: By the time you were--okay.  And you were--so you were about five years--.
Speaker 2: Five or six years old--,
Speaker 1: --when your family left.
Speaker 2: --when we left.  I think it must, must have been about in '22 [1922] or '23 [1923] and we came North on the Illinois Central Railroad and stopped at 12th Street. Many people don't that there was the reason why they call that area Illinois Central Station place, because that was the place where the Illinois Central station office was and the trains came right up there and many thousands of black people came on those trains and got off at 12th Street and first settled around there and then began to move further south, and further south, and further south, so that's what we called we had what they called Bronzeville. We were--we first moved at--on 31st [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], because we moved with an uncle of mine who had come before. And at that time we all moved in together until we got situated so we could get our own flat. They were called flats, not apartments, which was at 35th and Rhodes [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Did you--do you remember your parents--anything of them telling you about how different and strange that was for them coming 'cause they were basically, you know, farmers and they were coming to the city.  Did they ever--you were relatively young, so maybe you weren't really aware of this--do you remember any of their reaction to the city, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Well, no reaction.  The main thing is that here they were able to get jobs. Here we were able to get our own apartment. Down in Louisiana we had this little shotgun shack that we lived in, you know, and here we were in an apartment that had running water and steam heat and everything like that. Papa had a job, money was coming in regularly. We were able to go a school--a real school, because down in Louisiana, we had no school for the black kids. We black kids went to--we had school sessions in the rear of a church, the Baptist church down there in that little town. The white kids had a school they went to. We didn't have any school.  But, when we came up to Chicago, and there we had this fine big school, the [James R.] Doolittle School [Chicago, Illinois], I'll never forget it because I went into the first grade--my mother was a--she was a teacher in this one room school down South, so, because she had finished and got finished up to the eighth grade, so whoever finished the highest became a teacher. And she had taught us our ABC's and she had taught us how to count up to 100. And so this teacher, a white teacher, she had all the kids stand up by the board and she was going to teach us how to write our ABC's, gave us all a piece of chalk and so I took the piece of chalk and I started writing--and my mother had taught me my whole--I knew my ABC's, so I started writing A, B, C, D, E, F, and went all the way up to M, when she stopped me, she said, "Margaret, you stop that.  You're being very disobedient. I told you just take them one at a time.  Now, you go and sit in that corner and put that dunce cap on your head." For many years, I couldn't understand why I should be punished for doing something smart, you know.  It was only years after when I became a teacher that I was able to understand why--that the role that many of the teachers play--the white teachers particularly played, was to discourage the black kids from their ambitions, you know, and so forth and so on.  And well, that was that.  So, that's why when I became a teacher, I made it my main goal to try to teach the children to reach--reach for the skies, reach for the skies.  And I remember one incident, I had this student at DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] and I was--sitting in the counselor's office and one of counselors--white--had one of our students in there and she was talking to them about what they were going to be and this student said, "Well, I wanna be a doctor." And that counselor said, "Look, Joe, you can't be a doctor, you're not smart enough to be a doctor.  Why don't you be an auto mechanic or something like that?" I jumped up and I rushed in her office and I said, "Don't you dare tell him what he can't do. Let him find out that he can't be a doctor, let him find it out for himself. Then he can choose to be something else. But, don't you tell him that." And so forth and so on.  Well, anyhow, she didn't like it, but that was--that's what I had to say.
Story_ID: 4407
Speaker 1: I'd like you to share some memories that you have--some of the memories of growing up, your family life, things like that.  That, you know, are particularly--you know, that you would like to share.
Speaker 2: Well--I did not know that we were poor and deprived or anything like that. I had no notions of that. We, you know, I came up particularly during the period of the Depression and well, we had to live together and sharing an apartment, and all, we were crowded together, several people sleeping in one room and all, but that didn't seem to be any of a problem. We--went to school and we were urged by our parents to do the very best we could. We--I remember those peanut butter sandwiches we had for lunch--peanut butter sandwiches, and sometimes fried egg sandwiches and all like that, but we didn't complain, we thought that was normal, we thought everybody was having things like that. It didn't seem to be particularly impressive. And--went onto high school, and still striving to be the very best and--and we just didn't accept this fact of the fact that we were so poor and deprived and poverty-stricken. We looked down on the idea of any kind of welfare--getting on welfare, you know, people were not the least bit interested in that because the idea was to strive to become independent, so our parents worked--my mother [Octavia Pierre Taylor] did domestic work, my father did labor--labor work and all and we made it, you know.
Story_ID: 4408
Speaker 1: You had two older sisters you said--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then are you the third child?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Oh, there are three girls?
Speaker 2: It was three girls and I was the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  Can you share what the family life was like--lessons that your parents [Alexander Taylor and Octavia Pierre Taylor] taught you do you remember discussions around the table, or instances, particularly bad times or good times, or--.
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you--this was something I was thinking about today for a lecture I'm going to give this afternoon at the Illinois Youth Centers, you know, where young people between the ages of fourteen to eighteen are in there for their first offense and that is, I was remembering what our parents told us. They said, "Girl, you gotta learn the difference between right and wrong. You do right, don't you do wrong."  And really what, what she meant was--encourage the virtues and reject the vices. So, I was looking in the dictionary there for definitions of virtues and vices because I was gonna use this as--what I was gonna tell these young people about. But, I particularly remember that, and I think coming along as a teacher and all, if children are not taught by their parents or anybody else the difference between right and wrong--so children decide to do whatever they do, because, if it feels good you do it. So, that's how that gets into so many of these problems and all. But, I don't remember anything particularly, other than, other than positive support of us that our parents were firmly behind us and--and I've also concluded as a teacher with many years experience that the main thing that children need to become a success in life is to know they have parental support that their parents or somebody is behind them--somebody believes in them--and it doesn't necessarily have to be parent, it could be a friend, a teacher, a neighbor or somebody to say, "I believe in you and I know you're gonna do it, I know you're gonna make it." And so, very often, in my speaking to young people today, I just pat them on the shoulder, I say, "I believe you, you know, I know you're gonna make it. I can see it in your eyes that you're gonna be a success." And I, I think that they remember it, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, who do you think of your parents are you most like and why?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay. No problem.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I can't tell.
Speaker 1: That's no problem.  What, what--the young Margaret Burroughs--and when I say that, the young Margaret Burroughs, what was she--what were her dreams and aspirations? Why type of person was she? Was she quiet, was she shy, was she introspective, was she--?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think I was shy.  I don't think I was quiet. (chuckles) I like people, I've been active.  I was an athlete. I missed going to the Olympics by about three or four inches in the high jump--and being active, at [William W.] Carter [School, Chicago, Illinois] playground, I was on the volleyball team, baseball team--my first connection with people, other than my (audio interruption) in these team sports where I learned that people we're all--people we're all pretty much the same, you know, and white folks, and black folks and other folks we're all people.  And I think that's those--where I got some of those ideas from--which has stayed with me to this day and which I think are correct and proper.
Story_ID: 4409
Speaker 1: I didn't know that whole thing about you being in sports--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I got medals--I've--that's what I did and we had a team at [William W.] Carter [School, Chicago, Illinois] playground, a track team, and I was on the relay team, and I'd participate in the dash and then my, my main feature was the high jump and as I said, I missed going to the Olympics--in the '36 [1936] Olympics by about two or three inches, unfortunately, but anyhow--
Speaker 1: Okay, what about--okay, in high school that was in high school right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you went to what high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois], Englewood.
Speaker 1: What was--Were there any teachers that influenced you positively there, were there, you know, other things about that, you know, about high school, can you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--I particularly remember we had teachers there who were teaching children they were not teaching black children or white children, because Englewood at that time was--I think about 30 percent black school population and 70 percent white, but we had--I was fortunate enough to have teachers who were teaching children and they did everything for us that they did for the other kids-and, and I remember particularly my division teacher in my senior year, she tried to get me a scholarship--she did get me a scholarship to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], but the scholarship was only for tuition and there was no room and board, so I couldn't afford to take it. So then she advised me--I went back to my elementary school--Carter School--talked with the art teacher there who inspired me to become an art teacher--an artist--and she said, "Well, I'll tell you what, I want you to come here everyday and from 9:00 [A.M.] until 12:00 [noon] I will coach you on the examination to pass the [Chicago] Teachers College [Chicago, Illinois] exam. Stop for lunch and from 1:00 to 3:00 [P.M.], we get back on this studying again."  And she did that for me--with me for a semester and so in that way I took the Teachers College exam and I was able to pass and get into Teachers College. Well, in Teachers College, which was then called Chicago Normal School [sic, College], which is now Chicago State University, you didn't have to pay, you know, money, all you had to do was buy your books.  And so that's how I got into college because of this wonderful, white maiden lady, Mary L. Ryan, who, who believed in me and influenced--who inspired me.
Speaker 1: Good to do that.
Speaker 2: Yep.  And I'm--I'm glad I was able to make her proud because I was able to graduate from the teacher's college and I did my practice teaching with her at the [Edmund] Burke School [Chicago, Illinois] for a semester--under this same lady, who was teaching there.
Speaker 1: And what do you, do you think if you had gone to Howard, do you think you would have--?
Speaker 2: I would have been an entirely different person. I would have been a bourgeois person--not the least bit interested in the people or the community, 'cause you know at that time you had the blue vein people, the people who, if their vein--you could see their veins were blue because it was all based on color--you know, they were way up there and the blacker people were down there, so I'm glad I didn't go there.
Speaker 1: At what point did you really feel that you were destined to be a teacher? Was it at the point where you actually started teaching--at what point did you decide that you sort of really enjoyed that?
Speaker 2: Well, to tell you the truth, being an artist, I realized that when I went to the Art Institute [of Chicago], I was able to get in there, and I realized that one could not make very much money being an artist, you had to be a [Pablo] Picasso or Rembrandt [Harmenszoon van Rijn] or somebody like that to make money from it and so I figured the closest thing would be to teach art in order to make a living and so that's how I chose to be a teacher and I found out that I was able to carry on my artwork along the same time as teaching and I was able to earn some money to take care of myself and my family and all that. And besides I enjoyed it because it was sort of giving something and I found also that teaching was a two-way street. If I gave a student something, they were also giving me something. In fact, it was the students who--at DuSable High School who got behind me and pushed me to start a museum--you know, saying, you do it--you do it--you gotta do it you gotta do it--so I had to do it. (laughs)
Story_ID: 4410
Speaker 1: You know, some people are not as talented as you, you know, you're saying you missed the Olympics just by--,
Speaker 2: Three inches.
Speaker 1: --three inches and yet at the same time you were an artist.  You know a lot of time arts and sports, they're totally sort of separate.  And when did, when did you start drawing and, you know, doing those things?  When--?
Speaker 2: Five years old. I'm sure, I'm sure very, very young, because I remember that my mother [Octavia Pierre Taylor] and these two sisters, who were older than me, I remember that my mother would tell them to wash the dishes or do some work like that and they'd say, "Well, why don't you make her do this?" And she'd say, "Leave the girl alone, don't you see she's drawing. You know, she's gonna be the artist in the family." So I became the artist in the family--that encouragement, that parental support is what did it. You know, I was drawing from--and, and this is true with all young people whose parents who look very closely, they can see what talents they have that need to be encouraged and developed.
Speaker 1: So your mother always encouraged this in you?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And when you--in the schools you went, did they, did they actually have an art classes?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  This lady, Mary [L.] Ryan, I had her in sixth grade and she was the art teacher there and she would--so, I would do, do--draw something and she'd put it up on the board and say, "That's very good." Just a little sentence like that can help to chart a person's direction.
Story_ID: 4411
Speaker 1: You went to Chicago Teachers College [later Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] first and then you went to the Art Institute [of Chicago]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. See Chicago Teachers College--Chicago Normal College it was called. It was just a three-year school at that time, so you, you did three years there and you got your teaching certificate and then you had to go to get that other year to get your bachelors, so then I chose to go--I was able to get into the Art Institute.
Speaker 1: How did you find that, how did you find the Art Institute back there, 'cause it was pretty snooty, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Well, the point is, the main people who were there were the children of these North Shore, rich North Shore parents, who could afford to send them to art school just to be artists. But, then there were a few of us like me, who were training to be in art education, to be art teachers and all like that. But they were very encouraging. In fact, I--I'm glad I went there, you know.
Speaker 1: How do you think that experience going there impacted you and did it open up any--did you see things in a different way--how did Margaret Burroughs change coming out?
Speaker 2: I had one particular remembrance of being at the Art Institute that I would like to share in this documentary, there was a teacher there, a history of art teacher named Kathy [Kathleen] Blackshear, a blessed memory--a white Southern woman from Texas and you know what I'd heard about white Southerners was something else, you know, you know and I had nothing to do with them and--I was in her class, history of art class, and I remember walking down the hall, I'd been was really feeling very depressed because the--bursar--registrar, or somebody had called me in and suggested that maybe I oughta drop out of school because I was behind in my tuition and my teachers were saying that I wasn't doing my very best work and so forth and so on and they were suggesting that I drop out and I realized if I drop out I'd never get back in again, so I walking down the hall very depressed and Ms. Blackshear stopped me and said, "What's the matter?" I said, "Well I got some problems." "What's it all about?" I said, "Well, I don't wanna worry you with my problems." She said, "Well--" So, I finally told her, I said, "You know, I was behind in my tuition and didn't have money to buy art materials," and so forth.  And she said, "It's gonna be alright."  Give me that pat on the shoulder--"It's gonna be alright." So, then about a week or so later, I was called in by the bursar and the bursar told me, said, "An anonymous donor has paid up your tuition for the year and is leaving an amount of $25.00 a month for you to buy art materials. I'm not at liberty to tell you who it was, but you may write a letter of thanks."  I knew who it was, I knew who it was. I had occasion years afterwards when I was invited to speak down at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] and I was visiting the museum, I guess, in Houston, and I looked across the room and there was Ms. Blackshear, she'd--by that time she had retired and I ran up and I grabbed her and hugged her down there--in the bosom of the Deep South, but I didn't care a bit, you know, I just got a chance to hug her and to thank her for what she'd done for me.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a wonderful story.
Speaker 2: And, and a white Southerner, you know.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story. So, she saw something in you--.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: So, you went there one year or two--.
Speaker 2: Oh, when I went to the Art Institute, I was there about three years, 'cause I did one year to finish up my bachelor's and then the head of the art education department called me in and she said, "Now, I have some credits leftover from Chicago Normal College and if you would continue, I will see that these credits are--you can use these credits." And so somehow I was able to continue to working on my master's and she was able to maneuver in those credits so that I could get credits from them, you know. But, I spent two years doing that because I was working in the daytime and I went to school at nights and on Saturdays. But, you can achieve it, because--I achieved more, as much, and perhaps more than many of my fellow students who had gone straight through four years college and so forth and so on. You heard about me, but you never heard nothing about them. And I think that having obstacles makes you stronger, it makes you much stronger.
Story_ID: 4412
Speaker 1: Letting them kids know they believe in them--I believe in you. I know you're going to achieve it--and not--now many times when I speak to school groups and I tell the kids--I have each kid do--stand up and say--tell us what they're gonna be when they grow up. "I'm gonna be a teacher, I'm gonna be a doctor, I'm gonna be a lawyer, I'm gonna be a veterinarian," and so forth and so I praise them and say, "Oh, that's wonderful, that's wonderful, that's wonderful."  And then at the end, I look and I say, "I want you all to look into my eyes." I say, "I want you to know, I've been to Africa. When I went to Africa, I've had a meeting with the village priestess and she gave me peculiar powers and she said, 'Margaret, you'll be able to look into the eyes of young people and you'll be able to see the future,' and I see your future. I see that you're all gonna be what you're gonna say you wanna be. You're gonna make us proud of you and one of these days you're gonna come to this DuSable Museum and you're picture will be up on the wall." (laughs) And, they don't know whether to believe me or not. (laughs)
Speaker 2: But they're excited about the possibility.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 4413
Speaker 1: That's why I was asking about the time that you're going to school, here attending the Art Institute [of Chicago]--I mean you're teaching and your attending--what were you doing as part of your extra-, you know, in the arts community?
Speaker 2: Well, I was continuing my own artwork and all, but, then in 1941when the--the government decided to do the New Deal program, they decided to set up these art centers in various communities and it was decided to set up one on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And as a young artist, needing a place to exhibit--'cause we had no place to exhibit, other than in churches or the Y [YMCA] or someplace like that, came together with the committee to work for--establishing the South Side Community Art Center at 3831 South Michigan Avenue. So, I was a part of a group that stood on the corner--I think I stood on the corner at 39th [Street] and Grand Boulevard, you don't remember that--South Parkway, now [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Drive, with a can collecting a mile of dimes to buy a building at 3831 South Michigan Avenue.  This was the former [Charles] Comiskey mansion which we were able to raise the money and we bought that for $12,000, that property, and established a South Side Community Art Center, which, it opened in '41 [1941] and was dedicated by Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, who came all the way from Washington [D.C.] to dedicate it, cut the ribbon, and it has been continuously open since then. I think we're going into our sixtieth year.
Speaker 1: Now tell me who was this group--you said they were a group of--.
Speaker 2: Well you had--Kathryn [Kennedy] Dickerson, you had the--I think they were mainly the black bourgeoisie of Chicago at the time among them. One name I remember particularly, Kathryn Dickerson, who was Earl B. Dickerson's wife and some of those society--it was society people--Frankie Ray Singleton, who was of the Chairman of the Board and--l have, I have a booklet on who those people are and if make me a note, I'll send you a copy of that--it'll tell you who all they--who they are were.
Speaker 1: Now how did you find out about this opportunity? Who was the instigator, was it the black bourgeoisie who contacted the artist?
Speaker 2: No, the--you see there was a gentleman by the name of Peter Pollack, a white gentleman, and had started--he had a gallery downtown on North Michigan Avenue and he was the first one who invited us, I think this must have been 1939.  The black--young black artists were having an exhibit in his gallery to sell our work. The first time we've been down on Michigan Avenue. So then when the idea came through about establishing the South Side [Community] Art Center, it's one of the fifty art--community art centers that was started throughout the country by the WPA [Work Projects Administration]-Federal Arts Project, he was the first director of that and he served as director for a number of years, then he was replaced--he moved on and--so, he called together a group of people, including myself, the young artists, William Carter, Bernard Goss--many others, whose names will be listed in that book I'll give you--and Charles White, yes, and so we all came together and worked to get it started. And, we're very proud to say it's still going on.
Speaker 1: What do you consider significant about that whole period, you know, with the WPA and the South Side Community?
Speaker 2: I think it--the significant thing was the encouragement that it gave to just grassroots artists and all, because here we had a chance--we all couldn't afford to go to the Art Institute, go through that struggle of getting money to go to the Art Institute, but, here at the Art Center, you could come and there were art classes there that encouraged people. I understand Gordon Rogers Parks, the, the 'Life' photographer had his first darkroom there at the South Side Community Arts Center--many other artists included Charles White, who became famous, had their first exhibits at the South Side Community Arts Center and so, I think that was the significance of it.
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories of that time now, you know, artists meeting there, or anything like that, that you would like to share?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, once thing that's memorable was the Annual Artists and Models Balls that we had where--it was a fundraiser, where--it was a costume ball, we'd all dressed in costumes and--there were--models, you know, and artists.

Speaker 1: Because really out of that--the WPA [Work Projects Administration] movement came--there was also representation of slaves, and those have just been packaged--there were slaves--they had gone around interviewing people who had been slaves and just so about a year and a half ago--they went into the Library of Congress Archives [Washington, D.C.] and put those together in a book and recording.  But you know when I--this is what I think is significant about this whole project, and while, you know, the things that you were doing with (unclear), it's really important because it represents our twentieth century history and if we don't record it--it's going to be gone.
Speaker 2: We have an obligation, just like the Jews have done.  Absolutely--.
Speaker 1: And then you don't you have a revisionist history so much, you don't have people saying, "Oh you know I knew so-and-so, this is what they thought," when it's totally, you know, the wrong thing.
Story_ID: 4415
Speaker 1: You were talking about the [Artists and Models] ball, is there anything else that you remember that was sort of vibrant about that time go or things you'd like to share? Not, you know, not--to go to the South Side Community Arts Center [Chicago, Illinois] now you would not sense what the South Side Community Arts Center was like back then is what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: I think the main thing that--was that the feeling that artists had of working together and supporting each other. We were not competing against each other, like--African American artist would go to New York and then all be completing--competing against these others, grabbing for the same piece of pie, but we all worked together and whenever when anyone of us had a success or sold a painting, we would have a party or something--we would share with our fellow artists. I think this is the main thing I remember about that particular period--that we were not competing. And I think it's significant to note that when they speak of the Harlem Renaissance, they act as if that was only happening in Harlem, but there was a renaissance going on in art--in the arts, wherever there was a community of black artists and it went on in Chicago also because, like--I think we remember William Edouard Scott, Archibald Motley--two of our very famous artists coming out of Chicago--we were--at that period of time, they were written up on the front page of the 'New York Times', they had exhibits written on the front page of the 'New York Times', you know.  And that generally has not been noted by many people who talk about the, the Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 1: And what do you think Chicago's contribution, in terms of the arts community, around that time--it is true--the Harlem Renaissance, people look at that, mainly in the '20s [1920s] up until the Depression.  But people said there was a renaissance that happened here, you know, Chicago's contribution may have been a little later, but still is significant. What would you consider--it's never really been named--you know, the Harlem Renaissance, had its name, there was no real true movement coming out of Chicago, what do you think is significant about the Chicago--?
Speaker 2: I think the main thing about Chicago is the encouragement it gave to the artists--the African American artists--you might not make a lot of money from it, but you--you got that pat on the back that kept you going and I think that that was very significant and I think that's the reason why we ended with the Charles White or Charles Sebree--Henry Avery--Gordon Rogers Parks and many of the other famous names that come out of Chicago, because of the encouragement that we received.
Story_ID: 4416
Speaker 1: With your art at that point in time. You were doing a lot of charcoal mainly, you were doing charcoal?
Speaker 2: No, no, because, you see--being in art education we had to try and experiment in all of the media, watercolor, oil, printmaking sculpture, papier-mâché, ceramics, whatever, you know, I think that art teachers are the smartest people in the world, so we had to do some of all of it. It just happened that I--in 1952, when I had an opportunity to take a sabbatical leave and go to Mexico, where I studied, I was a guest member of the Taller de Grafica Popular--the popular artists--Graphic Popular Artists--graphic workshop that--I began to work with Elizabeth Catlett [Mora] and some of those artists and discovered the printing making media, which, in doing lino-cut [linoleum cut] prints, you could do it on the kitchen table, you know, you didn't have to have a big press or anything like that, something you could do on the kitchen table, so I started working on those things, which I continued working on. But, I worked in the other medias, also in fact, in October of 2001, I will be honored with an exhibit--a retrospective exhibit of my work here at the DuSable Museum of African American History and I hope that you will receive an invitation and that you will come and see my work shown from the earliest piece (audio interruption) that I have as a teenager on up to the present, which is a collage that I just was working on, on Saturday.
Story_ID: 4417
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see, when was the first time I got married?
Speaker 1: You said 1947-- no no.
Speaker 2: I think the first time I got married, I really should get those dates straight in my mind--about '49 [1949] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was two years before you went to Mexico?
Speaker 2: Ah, let me--
Speaker 1: You said you went to Mexico in 1951--
Speaker 2: '52 [1952]--
Speaker 1: '52 [1952], okay.
Speaker 2: I was on my second marriage when I went to Mexico, yep, with Charlie Burroughs--'52 [1952], so, I think Bernard Goss must have been before that.
Speaker 1: So you--so Bernard Goss was one of the--,
Speaker 2: He was my first husband, but he was one of the artists--.
Speaker 1: --artists, okay at the South Side Community Arts Center [Chicago, Illinois], and--what kind of artist was he and, you know, what was your life like?
Speaker 2: Very fine artist, very good artist. In fact, we have a collection of his work here in the archives of the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois].  And people are beginning to write from all over asking whether we have any of his work--some things from the--from the--let me see, the '40s [1940s] or '50s [1950s]. In fact, people are beginning to write to me asking if I have anything from the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], particularly, that they are interested in, you know. But a very good artist, a very good person.
Speaker 1: And you had a child with him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bernard Goss and I had one daughter, Gail Goss Hutchinson. She lives in University Park [suburb of Chicago]. She has had four sons and they're grown and doing very well and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 4418
Speaker 1: At this time, you're still teaching--are you still teaching?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're still teaching. Do you think that your work as an artist that you worked less because you had to teach, or did you work more--you know, I mean--.  How do you think, if you had just had the luxury of just doing your art, do you think things would have--?
Speaker 2: I just--I don't think I would have achieved many of the things I have achieved--I think--I realize why I was doing it and I figured that I always had a certain amount of time that I was going to devote to the art, whether it was weekends or evenings or what--teach in the daytime and nighttime and summers and everything and do your painting and so forth and so on.
Story_ID: 4419
Speaker 1: With your art--you know, every artist, has different stages in their life, you know, their art form sort of takes on different personalities--there are different stages in life, during your early years, what were you trying to say through your art? What do you think influenced your art?
Speaker 2: I don't know I've always been--I've tried everything, abstracts and representational things, but I've always been mainly interested in making statements that are meaningful to people.  I think I could have gone along the abstract pathway and made a whole lot of money, but--that was not my main interest--but I was more interested in doing things that people could understand--people--people paintings and if you make a note--another note--I'll send you a copy of a poem I wrote--I'm a People's Painter--I will send you that, which explains that very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about that a little bit. What does that mean, being a "People's Painter"?
Speaker 2: To me it means that--representing scenes of the people--the working people, whatever they're doing--working or having fun or whatever, but showing people, I like to show people in my pictures, you know--and I do landscapes and all like that, but, it--the main thing I do is people and if--I guess if you come and see my exhibit you'll be able to see what I'm talking about, because I'm always doing people. Like, I would do a portrait of you somewhere, so people could see you and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 4420
Speaker 1: You came out with your--with the drumming--
Speaker 2: 'The Drummer Boy' [sic, 'Jasper, the Drummin' Boy'].
Speaker 1: Now, that was when?
Speaker 2: I think 1947 wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was around that same period, you were teaching and the article that I read said that you had the student that was constantly drumming--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That was Walter Perkins, who is still alive and whose quite a distinguished musician and lives in New York and I was teaching at the Burke School--no, that was at another school and this little boy was always drumming--I'm trying to teach and all--he'd be drumming on the desk with rulers and everything like that and that's where I got this crazy idea about the drummer boy--so, that's how I created this story.
Story_ID: 4421
Speaker 1: You are in many ways a renaissance woman, in many ways, I mean, first you start, you know, your--are you a female version of Paul Robeson, is this is what (unclear)--? (laughs)
Speaker 2: That would be a very flattering remark, I can tell you that, but, I mean Paul Robeson has certainly been an inspiration to me ever since I was a teenager.
Speaker 1: And why--Because he was very much a renaissance man, and a brilliant renaissance man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well and then--l first heard him when I was seventeen years old, when my uncle bought me a ticket to hear him in concert at--I think he sang at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and--and it was first--no that was a Orchestra Hall--down at Orchestra Hall and it was first--and my uncle bought me a ticket to hear him and it was the first time, I was seventeen years old, that I had seen a person who was the same ethnic origin of me that was so proud (with emphasis) of, to be of the same origin, you know.  And so, they had a reception for him, this concert was sponsored with the Colored Women's Clubs and they--a lady announced on the stage after the concert that there would be a reception at the Appomattox Club on, on 35th [Street] and Grand Blvd. and that everyone was invited, so I said, "Everyone's invited, so I'll go too."  So I went and they had a receiving line, I'd never been in a receiving line before, but I got in line and when I got up to this man, I shook his hand and I got--stunned, I couldn't let go, and I just kept looking up at him and I said, "Ah, Mr. Robeson, Mr. Robeson--we're very proud of you, we're very proud of you." So, he finally got, got his hand loose, you know, and I was shot down the line, (laughs) but, I just remembered him from that point on and every time--I had some decision to make, I would think, I'd say, "Now what would Paul Robeson do and--what would he do?"  Whatever I decided he would do, that's what I did. And I particularly remember, I'll tell you this, that I think I was a senior in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] and--the civics teacher was talking something about the Soviet Union and how bad it was, so I said, "Well I don't believe it was that bad." The teacher said, "Well, what are you talking about?" I said, "Well, Paul Robeson sent his son to go to school over there and if he sent his son to go to school over there, it can't be that bad." Well, I did pass the course I want you to know. (laughs) But, anyhow, he's been a lifetime inspiration and then during the period of the '50s [1950s] when we had the [Joseph] McCarthy period, I don't know whether you know about that or not, where they were getting on his case because of the fact that he spoke out and all like that. He came to Chicago and I had the honor of being a part of his Girl Friday security team, and carrying his coat and books and all and so forth and so on. And particularly, I'd just like to add this that I was called into a--hearing at the [Chicago] Board of Education, this is in '52 [1952], in the period--that McCarthy period--and questioned about my political beliefs and so forth and so on, and I think they were about to kick me out of the school system and one of the key questions asked me was what did I think about Paul Robeson, and I told them I thought he was one of the greatest American artists that this country had produced, and they said, "Well, wasn't he a Communist?"  I said, "I don't know what he was, I don't know his religion or his politics."  "Well, didn't he send his child to go to school in Russia?"  I said, "Maybe he did, but he ought a have the right to send his child to go to school wherever he wants them to go to. I still think he's one of the greatest American artists that we have produced."  Well, apparently that didn't satisfy them. But, I figured that at that time, the way the political climate was going, that they might be trying to drop me off of the--take my job from me as a school teacher, so, I asked--requested a sabbatical leave, you know, and, and, at that time, if you taught seven years, you'd get one year off to study or travel and I asked for a sabbatical leave and luckily I got it and that's how I went down to Mexico, that wonderful year in 1952, and studied printmaking with Elizabeth Catlett-Mora and met with Leopoldo Méndez and the famous artists down there and got strengthened and when I came back here, I said, "There ain't nobody going to take my job from me, uhn-unh." (laughs) Never heard from them again, except when the Board of Education contacted me and said they wanted to give me an award as being one of the most outstanding teachers they'd ever had to teach in the Chicago Public Schools.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) See how close they came to losing me?  'Cause I was scared to death, I was thinking about just resigning myself--I said, "Nope, I'm not gonna do it."
Story_ID: 4422
Speaker 1: When you spent that year in Mexico [1952], what was that whole experience? Was that your first time out of the country?
Speaker 2: Yep. Very wonderful experience. In fact, it was very revealing to me to be in a place where there's no racism.  You know, where people did not look at people based on color of skin or anything like that, and had a chance to travel all around Mexico, various parts of Mexico, we had a chance to go to places down there where we found the--there were Mexicans there--Mexicans of color. A lot of people don't know the fact that many Africans came over from Cuba and were given--allowed to come into Mexico and they had a settlement there which retained pretty much all of their African culture and heritage, you know.  And I went down to this place and that's where I first saw--I got the idea of growing--wearing an Afro--wearing my hair natural, 'cause I saw these brown people who looked just like me, hair just like me, and they had their hair cut neatly in a boyish cuts and all like that and I said, "Gee, that looks, that looks pretty good." 'Cause, I had come there armed with straightening combs, Sterno, everything else, you know, all of my equipment (laughs) and that was in 1952.  By the time that year ended I had decided I was just gonna come back to Chicago [Illinois] wearing an Afro and I'm telling you, it should those people up, particularly those teachers at DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois]. They said, "Well, well, she's an art teacher, you know, all art teachers, they're crazy anyhow, you know."  Said, "Look at her." "Why you wearing your hair like that?" and so forth. How was I to know that ten years later everybody would be wearing Afros, including Jesse Jackson, with a great big one. (laughs)
Speaker 1: That's a great story too.
Speaker 2: But, apparently, I guess it was just--
Speaker 1: You were before your time.
Speaker 2: --it was pretty much a fad. Well, I imagine that--the students at DuSable High School that I've taught in the past so many years, remember me, particularly, because I was a teacher that didn't straighten her hair and so I figure that when I die they'll probably have on my tombstone, "Here lies a teacher who was the first one with a college degree to wear an Afro." (laughs) But people remember--the students remember me from that more than from anything else.  One time, when we started the museum, a fellow--a former student came in and he said, "How did you know, how did you know?"  I said, "How did I know what?"  "Well, how did you know about the--all this business of black history and all and the fact that you stopped straightening your hair?"  I said, "Well look, l'm a tell you the truth why I stopped straightening my hair. I got tired of that lady burning me," 'cause, you know, they put oil in your hair and then they'd have a hot comb and it would begin to sizzle and burn you on the scalp.  And I said, "The real reason why I stopped straightening my hair, not was it--because of Afro-, African American pride or anything like that, I just got tired of that woman burning me, burning me, so, I figured there must be some other way, some other way, so that's it. (laughs)
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story. Now what--you met Elizabeth Catlett [Mora] there in Mexico, what were your views of her?
Speaker 2: You know, I met Elizabeth Catlett in Chicago, 'cause she came to Chicago to study at the Art Institute [of Chicago] and she was looking for a place to stay and where she could also have a space to work, she being a sculptor. And so somebody told her they knew I had a study with an extra room and they sent her to me and she came--I had a studio at that time at 62nd [Street] and Vernon [Avenue] and I had an extra bedroom and space downstairs where she could work and that's how she first came to me and we became friends and that's also where she met her first husband, who was Charles White--met him right there, you know, they met and--so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: So, then she ended up going with--was she already in Mexico, or--?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: She married Charles White and then two or three years later, she and he--won a [Julius] Rosenwald Fellowship to study down in Mexico and they went down there to study. Subsequently, she met 'Poncho'--Francisco Mora, who came to sing with the mariachis, singing below her window and so forth and so on.  And when that happened they went back to New York--she went back to New York, she packed her stuff up there where they lived in Green-, in the [Greenwich] Village and she disappeared down to Mexico--went to the border, got a Mexican divorce from Charlie and went on down and married Poncho. Poor Charlie, he almost went into a relapse, he was ill for quite some time, you know, getting over this, so, so--this is very interesting to record too.  So it happened that Francis, Francis Barrett, whom I knew and worked with at the camp--Camp Wo-Chi-Ca in, in New York, she came to visit me in Chicago--no--I think Charlie White had come to visit me in Chicago and he was telling me, he said, well, he'd finally gotten over this Elizabeth thing and he thinks he'd like to get married again, and so forth and so on. So, I told him, I said, "Well, I got just the person for you."  And I called up Francis, who was in Detroit [Michigan], and I said, "You gotta come to Chicago right away, you gotta, 'cause I got something you gotta do--somebody you gotta meet." So, she came to Chicago and Charlie White was visiting me and, and she came upstairs and I said, "Look Charlie, this is Francis, and I remember Francis from Camp Wo-Chi-Ca.  Francis, Charlie has decided he wants to get married again and I think it would be a good idea if the two of you got married, and so forth and so on."  So, then, Charlie Burroughs and I, we left, said, "Well--we'll, we'll see you all in a couple of hours, we got some business to take care of."  And we left them in the studio together and by the time we came back in a couple of hours, they had made some decisions. So, two months later they called us up and said, "Meet us in Detroit, we're getting married." So, that's how he married Francis. So, I was a matchmaker in both--.
Speaker 1: You were a matchmaker--. (laughs)
Speaker 2: --matchmaker in both regards.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful, wow, okay. So, that's what I'm wondering, you all were sort of artists together, you know, in this whole, this sort of small unit--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --of people.  Was there any time, I mean, do you think anything unique came out of that whole thing, or any, you know, did you guys have dreams together, or, you know, was there bickering amongst the group, or was there--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't there was any bickering. I think we've always been very supportive of each other, you know. Wherever we could help each other.  As I indicated earlier, that whenever any of us sold a painting or something or another, we had the responsibility of having a party and entertaining everybody on it.
Story_ID: 4423
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember the first painting you sold?
Speaker 2: Unh-unh (shakes head no).
Speaker 1: How did you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I can remember the one that I sold for the most amount of money. (laughs)  That I was invited to speak at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] and--they invited me to go through the, the president of the university's mansion. They said he had an art collection of African American art and so I was going through there looking at Jacob Lawrence, and Sam Gilliam and other the other famous people, and so forth and so on. So, I said, "Well, Mr.--I think his name was [William R.] Harvey--I said, "There's one artist you don't have up here." He said, "Who is that?" I said, "You don't have a Margaret Burroughs here." He said, "Oh, no, I don't." I said, "I just happen to have a couple of slides." (laughs) See, I believe in shooting from the hip, and I showed him--and one was of a painting of a little girl, I called it 'Slum Child', an oil painting, and the other one was, I think, 'The Birthday Party'. And, he looked at that and he decided he'd like it, so he said, "Well, how much would that be." So, I had Thurlow Tibbs, who was an art collector dealer with me, I said, "Thurlow come over here a minute. How much should I sell it for?" So Thurlow said, "$18,000.00."  And, I said, "Well, Mr. Harvey, my asking price is $20,000, but since you are connected with the Hampton University, I'll let you have it for $18,000."  So, he said, "Okay."  I said, "But, now, when you write the check, don't write it for $18,000, write two checks, one for $9,000, one for $9,000." I said, "You give me one for $9,000 now and when we send--I send you the painting, send me the other $9,000. 'Cause, you know, anything $10,000 goes straight to the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], you understand."  And, so he told his secretary to prepare the paperwork and so that how they bought that painting.  And--I'd just to--in the same vein, I wanna tell you how I sold 'The Birthday Party' to Northern Trust Bank at 78th [Street] and State Street [Chicago, Illinois], you can see it up there.  They were having their opening and I was asked to--if there was a painting I had that could be featured at their opening so they could have a poster made of it to give to their clients, and so forth and so on.  So, I picked out 'The Birthday Party' and, and, so the [Chicago] mayor [Richard M. Daley] was there at the opening, and the president of the Northern Trust Bank and all of them, and I was there.  And so at one point in the program they introduced the artist--me--so, I got up and I said, "I just wanna say this one thing, Mr. President of Northern Trust Bank, this painting should never leave this institution and the price is negotiable." And I sat down. Later on, they bought it for $15,000 (laughs). Anyhow, that's--
Speaker 1: When did you sell the painting at Hampton--
Speaker 2: Hampton--I think that was in--well, it must have been somewhere in the '80s [1980s]--'70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s] or something like that.
Story_ID: 4424
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna go back to you and Charlie Burroughs, okay, he was in many ways your life partner, right?
Speaker 2: Well, Charlie and I were married over forty years. A lot of people thought it wouldn't last. (laughs)
Speaker 1: So, why didn't they think it wasn't going to last?
Speaker 2: Well, I think Charlie told me that somebody said to him that I was very flighty and so forth and so on, but, we proved them to be wrong.
Speaker 1: And, he was an artist also?
Speaker 2: No. Charlie was not an artist, he was a historian. In fact, Charlie was, Charlies was born in, in New York. He had an interesting story of--all of his own, because though he was born in New York, at the age of nine, his mother took he and his younger brother to the Soviet Union and they lived there for seventeen years. In fact, they went to school there and all of that. And, so, then when World War II came along, they were--they--since they were still American citizens, they had to come back to the states and join the [U.S.] Army and--which they did. By the time they got through boot camp and all that stuff, the war was over. I guess this would have been 1940-something or another. And it just happened that Charlie was going on a tour of the country, speaking about life in the Soviet Union and all that jazz--that I went to a program where I heard him speak, and where we got eye--we made eye contact and began to correspond back then. By that time, I'm divorced [from artist, Bernard Goss] and all, and so forth and so on--free, single and disengaged. And so, I, I asked him if he would marry me and he agreed. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Wonderful, so he, what did he speak of in terms of his life--?
Speaker 2: Well, no, he, he, he spoke Russian fluently and he'd gone to school there and--.
Speaker 1: --and how did his mother come to do that?
Speaker 2: Because she decided--she, she was a school teacher in New York and she decided she would like for her children to be educated in a non-racist state, so she had four children, she sent one to Germany--the oldest boy to Germany to study, he studied theater and all, she sent the, the next girl she sent to Switzerland to study dance and the two boys, the younger boys, Charlie, who was nine and his brother, who was seven, she sent them to the Soviet Union, because she had come to the Soviet Union and she was--employed as a radio--English radio broadcaster in, in the--by Radio Moscow and so they were there for seventeen years.
Speaker 1: Did he speak much of his life growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well, he's written about it, it's been written about it, in various articles.
Speaker 1: This is so, so, when you met him though, he was--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He had come back to the states and he decided not to go back there because they were able to come back to wherever they wanted to and he wanted to get more acquainted with his New York relatives and people like that.
Speaker 1: But how did he end up coming to Chicago [Illinois], was it because of--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I persuaded him to come to Chicago. (laughs)
Story_ID: 4425
Speaker 1: You were married before you went to Mexico [in 1952]?
Speaker 2: Charlie [Burroughs] died in 1994, so, subtract 44 from--
Speaker 1: That'd be 1950.
Speaker 2: Right, about 1950, you know--.
Speaker 1: So, you actually went to Mexico after, you know, you had already known each other by that time--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.  We had a wonderful year together, we got an old jalopy--a '47 [1947] jalopy and drove on down to Mexico, with two kids, my daughter, Gail [Goss Hutchinson] and my nephew--one of my nephews and I think he was about thirteen or fourteen and had the best year of my life.
Speaker 1: And, so when you came back--so really, I wanna get to the beginning of DuSable [Museum of African American History]--your house--around that time, there were a lot of gatherings at your house?
Speaker 2: Well, I--see, we have coach house and I moved into the coach house first. This building was owned by the Quincy Club, a railroad man's club--the front building--and they rented me the coach house as a studio, upstairs and downstairs.  And so the studio was on the alley, we could have parties there--didn't disturb anybody, 'cause we were right on the alley, and so forth and so--we'd have parties and gatherings and all like that. And to have people to come up.  I had things up on the wall and people would come--a lot of times they'd tell their little children and they'd call up and say, "Well, can I bring little Johnny by to see your collection." So, you know, this is really how the idea of the museum got started (laughs) and then one time, one Saturday, the doorbell rang and went upstairs--downstairs to open it and there was this minister--black minister, and he said, "Is the museum open?"  Well, we had formed the museum organization, but the fact is that we didn't have a place for it and, and the telephone book would have my address and it said Black History Museum in 3806 South Michigan (laughs) so, the Black History Museum.
Story_ID: 4426
Speaker 1: By a quirk of fate I said, "Yes, sir, the [Black History] Museum is open." And he came on upstairs and he looked around, and so forth and said, "But, you know, there's one thing--," he said, "--you should have an admission fee." I said, "Well, sir, today's is free day." So, he looked around again. He said, "This is very good what you've started." He said, "I'm gonna come back and bring some of my parishioners back." I said, "Thank you sir, and will you sign the guest register?" And, I had this piece of paper there, you know. Then, I sat down at the desk as if I was the secretary or something, you know, like that, you know. So, he went on out.  So, for the last--the next couple of weeks I had the most fun laughing and telling people about it, I said, "You know this man rang the bell and he came upstairs and he said, 'Is the museum open?'  I said, 'Yes the museum is open.' He came on up and he looked around, and so forth and so on--," just had people laughing. But, you know what, that was that electric light bulb that appeared up there, so that when, sometime later, when we got--some of us got together and said, "Well, what about the idea of starting a museum?" And, so, that's when we started. So we set up a committee. And I was on the site committee. And somebody was on the collection committee, to go out and collect things.  So it finally--when it was possible for my husband--Charlie [Burroughs] to buy this building, the whole property--a double lot on Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], with a mansion house--it's twenty mansion room--twenty-room mansion in the front and an eight-room coach house, upstairs and down, for $12,000--double lot on Michigan Avenue, now appraised at over $100,000, the property. Well, we said, "Well, let's try to get it." So, that I went down to Teachers' Credit Union and got some--hocked all my furnishings and everything like that to get a down payment, down payment--we only, only had to put down--what--$3,000, then we owed $18,000, so, we only had to put down--what--$9,000--so, we only had to get $9,000 down, 'cause we were gonna buy it on contract. Now, they would get this $9,000, so here we were potential landlords, but Charlie and I, we're not the type to be landlords, so, he said, "Well, what should we do with all this space now?"  So, that electric light bulb here--the museum and that was how the museum--so, we said, "Well, this'll be where the museum is."  So, for the first year or so, the museum couldn't afford to pay any rent at all, 'cause we're the landlords and the museum at the same time, but then later on, it go so that we could pay some rent and help us pay off this indebtedness. And we opened up, but a sign on the door--museum. First, as I said, we were free and then we decided to say--remembered what that man said about "People don't appreciate anything that's free--," we put Admission: Adults, $0.25, Children, $0.10--and put a jar on the table. People start putting it in there. Now I think adults are $3.00 and kids $1.00 and so forth and so on, but people are still coming.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.  Now, was there any discussion about the fact that there was a South Side Community Art Center (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no. We came, we came along together, a sister organ-, institution, you see, because I was--remember, I was also an--active with the South Side Community Art Center, so we figured that, "Well, the art center--we're right on the same block, so the Art Center is devoted with--got emphasis on art and we're putting our emphasis on history, so there's no conflict at all."  People could come to the Art Center, would tell them to come over here and to come over here, well tell me to go over there. And so we've always existed along that way. I've still help the Arts Center in anyway that I can, to, to date, you understand. So, we've always existed cooperatively like that.
Speaker 2: And so tell me how the--it first started out as the Negro--right the museum wasn't DuSable Museum.
Speaker 1: First we were the--I think the Ebony Museum [of Negro History and Art], Ebony Museum, because we got that 'ebony' word, ebony means black, so people would say black museum. So, we had the Ebony Museum of Negro History and then I got a letter from the attorneys, 'Ebony' magazine's attorneys saying--"We would like to instruct you to refrain from using the title 'Ebony' in the name of your venture." I think the thing that got me most was the fact they called it a venture.  And so I had our attorney to write them--their attorney a letter saying, "The word ebony is a adjective. It's a descriptive adjective and nobody has a patent on this descriptive adjective and--my client is not in the, in the business of publishing magazines," or anything like that, so, what is the problem? Well, we never heard any more from them on that.  And so then in my own good time (with emphasis), since the--many of the African countries would write me letters saying the Museum of African American History--we just dropped ebony and went African American history.  And then back in--around about in the late '70s [1970s], there was always a committee of people converging upon [Chicago, Illinois] Mayor Daley--that's Richard J.--urging that there be a proper memorial to Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, the first permanent settler of Chicago.  And so in 1968, I became a--I was--I won a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship to study for a year at the Field Museum [of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois] and when I was studying down there, the person in development said to me, he said, "Have you thought about the idea of changing the name of your museum?"  I said, "To what?" He said, "Baptiste du Sable." I said, "Well, you know, we changed it so many times, you know." He said, "Well, you know the point is that if you name it DuSable, you just might able to get more response financially," and so forth and so on. So, that is when we voted to change it to DuSable and the mayor had setup this committee to find a suitable site to name--to honor du Sable. And, so, he set up the committee and that committee kind of went into non-existence and I remembered that and I wrote the mayor and asked about why could not our museum be made--one of the principle monuments to du Sable.  And so the mayor saw that as a nice easy way out, because committees would converge upon him every year about naming something for du Sable, so then he had issued a proclamation that the--this committee that he had set up would acknowledge the DuSable Museum of African American History as the monument to du Sable--as one of the monuments to du Sable. And he came over here and brought his check for $10,000, and also he made it possible for us to get this building and stuff like that. So, that's how it became DuSable.
Speaker 2: Now--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And then besides we found that once we were on state land, this is state land, like, like [Museum of] Science and Industry, Art Institute [of Chicago] historical site, all those that are on park land, which is state land, they get support from the tax levy, so you see, we got in on that.
Speaker 2: So, really, how many years--the museum though have been in existence for twenty-something years?
Speaker 1: We opened in '61 [1961]--,
Speaker 2: '61 [1961]--so--.
Speaker 1: --I think we'll be celebrating our fortieth.
Story_ID: 4427
Speaker 1: Was there was a lot of discussion at the beginning about what the purpose would be from an education--'cause you come from a teaching background, so--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I think that was made very clear in our mission statement, you know, that it was--the main thing was that the purpose of the museum was to spread African American history and Africa and America, in Chicago [Illinois], in the United States and the world and in Africa. And that the purpose of the museum was for--mainly for all Chicagoans of all ethnic--origins, you know, black, white, red, brown and yellow--to bring unity and cohesiveness and friendship among people. And I want to--I want to point out also that since--once--since we got into this building in 1973 that we came into this building, that the Mexican-Americans got together seeing that, so they surveyed in Harrison Park, found a building there that was available, a park building and they asked for--if they could move into it. By this time, and that was about in 1986 or '87 [1987], or something like that, that [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington appointed me to be a commissioner on the Chicago Park Board, so I was able to make the motion to accept these people. They said the name of their institution was the Mexican-American Fine Arts Center. So, the young man who was making the presentation to the commissioners--I said, "Just a minute, sir, the correct name of your institution is the Mexican-American Fine Arts Center Museum, isn't it?" He got the idea, because if it said fine arts center, he wouldn't get no money--understand, it had to be a museum. They have been very grateful about that, you know. And, so, they've been getting along very nicely and now I understand that the Puerto Ricans are working on something in the Humboldt Park Stables and I--I've gotta check up with them because they're supposed to be--between the Puerto Rican Alliance and they just may have an agreement to have exhibitions there, but I gotta talk to those people to tell them how they can get the--get it to be--so, they can get the same status as we have and the Mexican Americans have. So, I gotta get in touch with them. And I do want to get in touch with the Native Americans to, to--and--suggest that they find a facility and so forth and so on. They can have--we can have a Native American museum. We have--we'll have in Chicago a group of ethnic museums that people can visit that cut across all those barriers that we have. There are great blocks and barriers that separate our communities from each other, that the culture buses can go from one to the other people and says, let's share all these cultures.
Speaker 1: I want to go back to the time--the early days--do you have any stories that you could share about that period of time--of kicking the doors open, or--
Speaker 2: I, I just--there's just one that comes to mind about how I got my first foundation grant, which might be interesting to the people. It was from the, the [Marshall] Field Foundation. And, I'd been down there and had talked with the gentleman, the director of it, whoever it was. And asked for some help from them and they had written me a letter, rejecting our application. Meanwhile the poor fellow who was in charge died and I had written a letter back, just taking issue with them, I said, "Your, your qualifications--I think we met your qualifications, you say that should we--you help institutions that are--minority, and so forth and so on, and we are a minority institution and we feel that we should receive some consideration for our request." Well, I think Mr. [Marshall] Field [IV], himself, was going over the papers that were left, you know, came across this letter, in which I had disagreed with them about rejecting our application, and he--asked me, he said, well, was I still interested in applying for a grant. I said, "Yes." So, when he got a new--he said, "Well you send us another letter again." So, then, they appointed a new director and this guy came out to talk with us, and so forth and so on. And he looked around, he said, "I think what you should do is--instead of this, ask me for an operational grant. That you should ask for a grant--a specific grant to do a certain thing--that is you want to upgrade your exhibitions, you know, build new display cabinets, and so forth and so on."  So, he said, "I'll tell you what I'll do," he said, "I'll write the letter for you and then I'll send it to you and then you have it typed up and send it to me on my letterhead." I said, "Okay."  For which he did and I sent it and--and then he presented it to his board and then he granted us $9,000. Can you imagine what $9,000 was like in 1969 or 1970? That was like a million dollars. So, with that, we were able--you know, we got $3,000 a year--it think it was $3,000 a year for a three-year period. And so we were able to get these new cabinets made and so forth and so on, new exhibitions, I was able to commission some artists to make paintings and so forth and so on. And that was how we got that.
Story_ID: 4428
Speaker 1: What was it like for the Black Arts Movement here in Chicago [Illinois] in the 1960s?
Speaker 2: I guess it was the '60s [1960s] where many of the artists were doing a lot of stuff that really wasn't art as far as I was concerned. They had--did such paintings like, I think if I remember correctly, one fellow had done a painting where he had this black man, he was trussed up with the American flag and stuff like that. Just an awful lot of bad art, just bad art, as far as I was concerned. But there was also some very good things being done, some of these things, which were, I think, sort of opportunistic, where the artists was taking very obvious things like that, you know, black people beating up white people, or something along like that, you know, which I did not care for at all--a lot of that junk. And it's, it's forgotten. Nobody remembers it. Whatever they were doing, you know.
Speaker 1: What do you think was the most important period here in Chicago in the Black Arts Movement--what do you think was the most important--was the '50s [1950s], was it the '30s [1930s], the '40s [1940s], '60s [1960s] or what?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember when they had the--there was an exposition at the (pauses) I think it was in 19--oh, gosh, I'd have to go back and do some research about this--about 1939, it was an occas-, I think it was the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Now, what year would that have been?  Emancipation Proclamation came out in 1863, so--fifty years from 1863 would be what--1939 it was about '39 [1939], but anyhow they had an exhibition on the Negro in American History and Culture at the--down there at 16th [Street] and State Street, there was a--like an armory or something building there--.
Speaker 1: International Amphitheater?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's over on Halsted Street--but this--it was torn down anyhow--it was like an exhibition hall, I forget the name of it right now, but anyhow, we--they had all the artists, many of the artists of that time, whose works were shown. And I particularly remember 'cause I was one of the docents, you know what the docent is don't you? That supposed to be the guide--you take the people to and tell them all about it. And they had Augusta Savage's painting and [Henry O.] Tanner and some of the greats that we had heard of shown at this particular exhibition--there was a catalog that was produced--I don't think we have one.  But I think that was one of the highlights, and I think also in the World's Fair of 1933, there was a similar type of exhibition--highlight-, highlighting the works of African American artists (pauses) and I think I had something, something to do with that. 'Cause, out of that came--Balm [L.] Leavell's--he had a, a black newspaper and he had an exposition of the Negro business and culture and it was also at The Coliseum--The Coliseum is the building I was trying to think of. And, so--we were able to--get a number of the artists to create paintings on black--the history of blacks in Chicago--in Illinois that were shown at his first exposition. This group of paintings is now in the archives of the DuSable Museum. In fact, that group of paintings may well have been the, also, one of the electric light bulbs that helped to start DuSable Museum, because I was the one to (unclear) together and had them created. And later on, Mr. Leavell gave them to the DuSable Museum, which we still have. I think there's some hanging up in the--big auditorium--small auditorium there now.
Speaker 1: So, do you, as an artist, as a black artist, if you look back are you happy about what you see happening now, with black artists? Do you think that things should be further along, or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know. People are painting, people are painting. I was invited--a couple of months ago to have a two-person--to participate in a two-person show at Stella Jones Gallery in New Orleans [Louisiana] and along with me was Ernest, Ernest Crichlow from New York. And we had a very beautiful opening and a beautiful exhibit and part of that exhibit will, of my stuff, will be shown here at DuSable and we're still, we're still painting, I mean, as a artist, you're an artist, you just have to paint regardless of whether you sell or whether you don't sell. You just--you just gotta do it. You see if you're a true artist. And, if you--if you're only painting for money, then you're a hustler, you know, I don't--you can't, you can't paint thinking about money all the time. At least that's part of my philosophy.
Speaker 1: Since you believe that an artist is someone whose committed to their art form, do you have any views of historically, you know minority artists have had a hard time, you know, either being collective, and things like that, do you have any thoughts about how that is changing--is it changing now, do you see things, do you see--?
Speaker 2: I think it is changing--I think, well particularly in Chicago, I think it is changing and I think that the DuSable Museum has played a role in that by--the fact that--we came into existence at the time when we were born, very little was shown by any of the other major institutions in Chicago of--in reference to African American contributions and when the DuSable Museum came on the scene it began to get headlines and people noticed and people starting coming and all and then particularly because of the--the demographics of the Chicago's population, wherein many of your white museum-going population was moving out to the burbs [suburbs], so that--and the population of Chicago was becoming fifty or more African American, then the other museums have to reach out to the get those audiences to come in.  And so then they began to have exhibits that related to--or that would interest African Americans. The, the [Museum of] Science and Industry started having Black Creativity. Now, not only do they have Black Creativity, but they have Latino art creativity and reaching out to the other groups. The [Chicago] Historical Society began to have special programs--relating to African Americans. The Art Institute having--pulling out of their collections whatever they had on African American artists and showing them--including, including a couple of my pieces, pieces.  And having these on an annual event. And, so, I think that--I take pride in the fact that the DuSable Museum helped to cause this interest, you know, and--the works of African American artists and historical figures.
Story_ID: 4429
Speaker 1: What would you like to see for this institution [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] going forward?
Speaker 2: My, my dream--yes--is that now we are a museum but I would like to see the expansion into a cultural center and museum, or a museum and cultural center. I would like to see an arts center concept developed. I would like to see an arts center in which the young people could come and they could take--have lessons in art, music, painting, dance, theater, writing, and so forth and so on, as an adjunct of the DuSable Museum. I would like to see us to have a large banquet hall facility and this may be included in the Museum campus plan that they have--that, that Mr.--the Chairman of the Board is talking about, whereby--when we have--people could have--receptions and dinners and so forth and so on, at, at a museum setting, 'cause you have space enough for it in a museum setting so that you could have various events like that, so you wouldn't have to take everything out to Evergreen Park or Evergreen Plaza or some of those--Drury Lane--so of those people--that have no relationship to you and don't even have any black employees, to--waitress or waiters--so, I would like to see that sort of thing--I would like to see us develop more traveling exhibits based on our exhibits that would travel around to other museums in the country, black or white, or whatever, and so forth and so on. Those are just some of the ideas that I have. But, particularly, I would like to see the idea of this cultural center with these classes for the young people coming in where they would be trained--a dance group--an African dance or whatever--or musical group that would play--a musical performing group that would play the compositions of Negro composers and so forth and so on. I think that's taking a step further, you understand.
Speaker 1: And why do you think that's important, Dr. Burroughs? Why is that important?
Speaker 2: It's the legacy to pass onto the next generation, you know.
Story_ID: 4430
Speaker 1: You've been to Africa many times, what--when you first went there, what were your anticipations about at the time?  And I don't know where you--did you go to Ghana--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, the first year it was to Ghana--in 1968 (laughs), and, of course, you know, I went over there, I was very mad about these white folks who had taken my people as slaves and brought them over here and made them slaves and so forth and so on. And when I got over there and did a little more research, I found out that it was African chiefs--they were knee deep, ankle deep, elbow deep in slave trade and that they had participated with the Portuguese and all the others in, in starting internecine wars and battles and conquering people this--shipping down to the shore and selling them over here. So, then I wasn't so mad at white folks no more because they hadn't done it all the time, (laughs) but I remember that some of the young people we took over there--I remember one guy, he got off the plane, and he got out of the airport and he got down and kissed the ground (laughs)--he was kissing the ground. But, I found out that there was just thing that made a difference when you were surrounded by everybody that looked like you, you got stronger. And, this is the strength that I get from Africa that--and that, and that the white people who are around there, they don't--they don't hate black folks--they get along very well together. In fact, the white folks--all the white folks in our group would gather close to us to let the other black folks know they were closely our friends and all, and so forth and so on. So that--those were some of the things that one finds. I go, I go many times and each time I get energized by just being surrounded by our people and the fact that they're interested--they're very much interested in what's happening over here. Many of them are interested in coming over here just like the Europeans are interested in coming here--for the American dollar--just, you know, they all come over here for the American dollar. And--but it's just nice to be in a place where you can forget about black or white, black or white.  It's the same feeling I get in going to Cuba.  That here I'm surrounded by black, white, red, brown and yellow, but I don't have to think about, "He's white," you know, "She's white--," you know, "She's different or she's white," or something like that. You don't think about all those things. And it's very relaxing not to be thinking about this.  "She's a person, she's a human being, she's a person just like myself.
Story_ID: 4431
Speaker 1: You said that when you first went [to Africa] you had this sort of anger and then came to--you look at it in a different view, but, I guess what I'm asking is what do you think--what has your--changed your view of the African Diaspora changed over the years and what do you think should be happening between African Americans and when you refer to the Mother Country--what would you like to see sort of happen that hasn't?
Speaker 2: Well, now my observation is that--what [Kwame] Nkrumah [President of Ghana] was speaking for a united Africa--that Africa needs to unite otherwise it wouldn't be in the position it's in, but I realize that there's certain forces that work to keep it disunited, just like for the same reason that there's certain forces--black and white in the United States, who keep us disunited. Like if, if African American people in the United States could unite we could solve all the problems and everything else like that.  But then you have people like--what's that fellow, Mr. [Clarence] Thomas in the [U.S.] Supreme Court and some of the others and all, who are just the opposite in, in the same way that Africa needs to, to unite, but there are so many forces there that just keeps up that tribalism and they're fighting against each other, and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Do you--you said your views of Africa have changed, but I've often thought that in many ways the fact that we've sold each other off, was almost a sin that we had to pay for in many ways.  Do you have any thoughts about--?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that, that people should know that--I mean this--for this--the same reason that we're, we're disunited was because of these, these black people who were selling their own people away and, and it's, it's the same way that in the United States that you have black 'Uncle Toms' that are dealing and selling us off in the same way.
Story_ID: 4432
Speaker 1: Dr. Burroughs, who would you say influenced you most in your life--for different points--and for those who influenced you, I know you talk about Paul Robeson, but is there, you know, and you talked some about your parents, but are there any other people who have influenced you and state why.
Speaker 2: Well, I think, as I said, again, Robeson and speaking of inspirational people, I'd say, I'd say Ida B. Wells, Ida B. Wells, who was a schoolteacher, who had an interest in the community. I was a schoolteacher, I had an interest in the, in the community. And so, school teachers can, can do something to help make change, you know. I think, you know, other than all the rest of the people, you know, like say, all the other historical figures, and people like that--but mainly standing out for me is Mr. Paul Robeson and Ida B., whom I never did know personally, but I knew her daughter, Alfreda Duster, and then I had an opportunity to read her diary. Alfreda let me--loaned me her mother's diary overnight, which is now in the archives of the Illinois State Library, which I was able to take and sit up all night reading it about her experiences and so forth and so on. But, she will always remain an inspiration.
Speaker 1: You know we--when we interviewed Haki [Madhubuti], he spoke of how you had influenced him so much, and (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Happy that--well Charlie [husband, Charles Burroughs] and I did was he, he happened to been our work-study student and he was at--I think it was called [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [later Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] then and he was--he was our work study student and so that's how we came in close contact. In fact, it was Mr. Eugene Feldman, a Jewish gentleman, who gave him some of his first lessons in black history, you know, and a lot of people don't--aren't aware of the fact that one of our main co-founders was Mr. Eugene Feldman, a Jewish gentleman. Or another person, who worked very closely with us in the beginning was Jan Wittenbauer (ph.), a white gentleman, who was an artist and who had charge of all our exhibits and all and their pictures are up in the mosaics in the lobby [of the DuSable Museum of African American History].
Speaker 1: So, in many ways, if it hadn't been for them, eventually those people have a big part also (unclear) DuSable--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Absolutely, absolutely. And I always like to let people know this that it wasn't just an all black thing, that it was--there's other people who worked right along with us.
Story_ID: 4433
Speaker 1: What, what would you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: It is (laughs)--it's the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois], that's all--end--and also my paintings and my poetry.
Speaker 1: Is there any other artist that you admire, besides yourself, that you know or you think is important?
Speaker 2: Elizabeth Catlett [Mora] and Charles White, particularly, and I think primarily Elizabeth and Charles White. I say that just a couple of days ago we wrote--we read in the paper about the death of Jacob Lawrence in--up there in the state of Washington, who's a very significant figure in the arts--Bernard Goss--just a few.
Speaker 1: And if you could just spend a little bit talking about why you think they were significant?  Why was Elizabeth Catlett significant--I mean she's a beautiful sculptor--
Speaker 2: Because of her depictions of African American people and the exquisite form, design and all the qualities of art, you know, that you just don't find every, every place--Charles White, the same, 'cause they were very close in their work--inspired each other and Bernard Goss's work--they, they did things having to do with people like Bernard Goss, we, we have one of his pieces of Frederick Douglass--very beautiful--and I'm gonna try to figure out how to get a print of that made to be able to pass it around, yep.
Story_ID: 4434
Speaker 1: Dr. Burroughs--what about being an artist, what does that mean? You said you're life of being a teacher, one, and an artist also, one, and I guess what I want to ask you is what does that mean being an artist?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I think that every, every human being has a certain amount of creativity in them and you're an artist when it--you allow it to come out in some concrete form, you know, whether it's painting or dance or theater, and so forth and so on--I think everybody has it in them and I think it's important that it does come out, because it makes a better human being out of you or a more human, human being or something like that. That's why I've encouraged the development of the arts and everybody to have that experience and whether it's writing poetry, or painting, or whatever, you know I teach class every Tuesday at Joliet penitentiary, and teach the guys and have them painting and have them writing and they're writing poetry and they're painting pictures and if you make me another note to send you a copy of the heritage stamp that one of my inmates did at Joliet [Prison, Joliet, Illinois], I'll send you that. I got about three or four things I gotta send you, right? But, I think their experiences--and it's a voluntary class, and they come and they always want to--I have room for twenty--but, there's always a waiting list and this is their only opportunity to speak to the outside world. And I have one young man who's down at Danville [Correctional Center, Danville, Illinois]. I think it was at Danville and I had him at Joliet and he does much--many, many works, in all medias, and he wrote me and he told me that I was--he had been a gang-banger all of his life and he ended up in jail and he said he never known he had any kind of artistic talent, but when I came to a class and he came to a class and I said, "Here, young man, here's some paper, here's some colors, make something." He said he was scared to death, but the fact that I showed confidence that he could make something, he took them and he started working and he's been working ever since. And this guy's a born artist, the marvelous things that have come out of him, it's amazing, you know. And that's why I've gotten the idea to, to start something else--I wanna start a, I wanna start an art gallery, which will promote the sales and all of some of these inmate artists--you know, to bring it to the attention of the public--to sell some of their works. Now, like Haki [Madhubuti], he gives me--he sends me paintings and all and he asks me, he says, "Since you go around to the schools, give this to each school--give a painting to a school--a couple of paintings to a school--so that my paintings will be doing something--they'll be influencing people." So, I've been bringing them, passing them out and the principals usually send him a letter of thanks and he's got them in his folder and all, 'cause I think he's a lifer or whatever it is--I tried to get an attorney to look into his case to see whether we could get a reduction in his sentence and all, we'll see.
Speaker 1: So, Dr. Burroughs, you're still out here touching--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Got to--got to do it--
Speaker 1: --you're touching mankind and making a difference.
Speaker 2: I wanna live a long time, don't I? (laughs) I'm trying to be 100--at least live to 125 so I, I got to do it.

Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I was here, I, I made a contribution to the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] or whatever--at least I don't have to worry about my monument or whatever, it's here.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: Let me see, now, is there anything else that I would like to say--oh, I just want to say, "Keep on keepin' on" and do whatever you can to encourage the artists and the young people in whatever they're trying to do. Give them a pat on the back instead of a slap in the face. That good enough?
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: And anything else that I can do for you, all you have to do is holler.
