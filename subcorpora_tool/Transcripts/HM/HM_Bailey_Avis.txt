Speaker 1: Where was she born?

Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother and her family?  Do you know the names of her parents?
Speaker 2: Her parents' was Maude [Maude Heavlow] and Jabez Heavlow.  My grandfather's from Dayton, Ohio, and he was part, part Indian [Native American] there Blackfoot.  And I guess he was about a quarter Blackfoot.  And they moved to Washington, D.C., and that's where he met Maude and they got married (laughter) and had two daughters there and a son.
Speaker 1: Do you know around what time they were born?  What year?
Speaker 2: What year?  They were born--Maude was born in 1880, I mean 1893 and my grandfather was born in 1894 yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you hear any stories about them?  Did your mom tell you stories about them?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Actually I was the youngest of eight so I'm sure that she told my older siblings about their grandfather, her father.  And but, by the time I came along, he was pretty much up in age I guess and although he did live with us for a time and he was, he was a character but yeah, I really did love him.  He used to cut my hair all the time.  He was a barber so that we used to always go to granddad to get our hair cut yeah.
Speaker 1: Fun guy, sense of humor?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, without a doubt.  And probably where I get my (laughter) sense of humor from which is--my wife [Tamara Durant-Bailey] says is not, not everyone gets it.
Speaker 1: What about Maude, your maternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: I never knew her.  She passed away in 1944 I believe so she--of course I was born in '49 [1949] so.
Story_ID: 551972
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your dad [Roosevelt Bailey, Sr.] and his family, what you know about his family?
Speaker 2: Actually I don't know too much about my father's family other than that they were in North Carolina and I--from what I understand my--his father had come over from Scotland and but that's as far as it went there because our only records were as most families kept their records in the Bible and I think we salvaged maybe two of the Bibles to get some records from so we never did really go back and do a family tree.  We were thinking about doing that though.
Speaker 1: His father came from Scotland?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And his mother was of African descent?
Speaker 2: Yes, here in I guess in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he's biracial, your father (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 551973
Speaker 1: So tell me about your first memories growing up?  You were born in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Washington, D.C., at Gallinger Hospital [Gallinger Municipal Hospital].  Well of course now it's D.C. General Hospital [District of Columbia General Hospital] and so I grew up in the '50s [1950s] and it was pretty--it was nice.  I had, I had a pretty nice childhood other than the fact that well from what my perspective because everyone around us had about the same childhood, which was not one of that, that you--we were all in poverty if you wanna call it that.  All of the houses around were pretty shoddy and most people rented--
Speaker 1: What part of D.C. is this?
Speaker 2: This is actually we lived in almost all parts, but we moved around quite a bit.  But--
Speaker 1: So your earliest memories are from which neighborhood?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories are from south, southwest I guess this is about in '54 [1954] I guess when I remember when Hurricane Hazel hit and and I was just telling my sister the other day that she--that I for some reason hid under a fallen tree before I made it back home.  But I remember being up on the roof with my brothers and sisters, well I say my sister Dorothy [Dorothy Bailey] and my brother Butch [Birchard M. Bailey], we would be up on the roof and at night and sing songs and things like that but this was when, when life was I guess pretty simple and no one really cared if you were up on the roof at night at ten o'clock at night singing.
Speaker 1: You were singing?  What were you singing?
Speaker 2: Just the rock and roll songs that were there at the time and it--you know we'd, we'd see how, how many lyrics you could just like they have the, the show on now you know do you need any help with lyrics and stuff like that.  But--
Speaker 1: So you were the youngest?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Of eight kids?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 551974
Speaker 1: Tell me the names of your siblings and what are your memories hanging out with the crew?
Speaker 2: Well Jacqueline [Jacqueline Bailey] my oldest sister actually I thought this is what I was told because I was a baby, that I thought that she was my mother because she was I guess about fourteen years older than I and so it was Jacqueline, then there's we call him Junior but that was Roosevelt Quebelle Bailey Jr. [Roosevelt Bailey, Jr.], and, and then Earline [Earline Bailey], then next came Gwendolyn [Gwendolyn Bailey].  She passed away as a child as a baby and you have Rita, Arealia [Arealia Bailey] is her name, and Dorothy [Dorothy Bailey], who's my only sibling that's still alive and then my brother Birchard [Birchard M. Bailey] call him Butch and, and myself.  But the way it went is that I'm the baby right so and you have to love the baby so I got a lot of love there from my--and protection from my, my siblings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you recall--
Speaker 2: --but most of the time they you know when they did get the chance to move on when they got old enough and everything and Jackie got married very young I guess she was about seventeen or eighteen and then moved away to California and so I've had a--I was an uncle since I was maybe two or three so.
Speaker 1: You said they provided protection for you as a youngster?  Can remember one such occasion?
Speaker 2: Well, living, in in Washington [D.C.] in the '50s [1950s] they of course we had--every street had its gang it seemed that anyway and and my older brother Butch he was two years older than I but he--if anyone would bother me he would come to my rescue.  If someone bothered him, Rita would come to his rescue (laughter) 'cause you didn't mess with my sister Rita.  She'd take on anybody.
Story_ID: 551975
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you said this was a poor neighborhood?  There were gangs.  Take me around the neighborhood.  What are some of the sights you remember?
Speaker 1: Well you, you see on the--in the streets you have houses that were boarded up, condemned and I always joke that you know when you know when, when more than ten houses on the street got condemned, we'd move to a better neighborhood with just two houses which were condemned.  But it's to me right now it seemed, it seems funny but then that was just the way we had it.
Speaker 2: Was this a predominantly, was this a colored neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Were you aware of race back then white and black D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: We weren't because we had the the elementary schools that you went to are predominantly, predominantly black the--everything around you was predominantly black.  We may have had one or two white families in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Do you remember who they were?
Speaker 1: No, not really because I, I generally dealt with the kids that are like two doors down and just in that neighborhood we didn't stray very far.  And of course back then we--you also had that the adage that it takes a village to raise a child and everything so you know if you did something wrong you know the next door neighbor would smack you upside the head.
Speaker 2: Who is the next door neighbor?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well you, you had a Mrs. Green [ph.] that was I think two doors down and, and she would hit you and then tell your mother and then of course that happened too.  But we also had a--on our--on one block it was on I Street in, in Washington, D.C., unit hundred block and and we call it unit hundred block and I don't know why we call it a hundred because it's--they're just, there was no address on there over a hundred so but that's unit hundred block and then you had the hundred block of, of I Street but we had a little mission I guess there in the block and they used to show movies on Wednesdays and we'd have them of course it's a mission so you had indigents coming there that men that would come there for handouts and everything like that but they would still be around there while the kids looking at the the movies and everything but it was pretty rough (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was there violence in the--
Story_ID: 551976
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was there violence in the neighborhood because you mentioned gangs?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yeah so there was vio- we've, we've had on my street we've had like almost showdowns.  We've had people shooting at one another up and down the block.
Speaker 1: Who were the gangs?  Did they have names?
Speaker 2: You had the Roman Nuggets [ph.], Baby Nuggets [ph.], the Mau Maus [ph.] things like that.  That all came to a head back in 1959 I believe.  We had a big fight at Terrell Junior High School [Washington, D.C.] and, and I think one kid was killed and so the police came down on us very hard so.
Speaker 1: You said us.
Speaker 2: Well like I said you had to--you either belonged to the gang or, or you know you got beat up every day.  Not everyday day but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So which gang did you belong to?
Speaker 2: I was young so it's baby--it's Baby Nuggets.
Speaker 1: The Baby Nuggets and was there an initiation or tell me about joining the gang.
Speaker 2: Well actually we had an initiation however, since I knew several of the people that were in the Roman Nuggets, they just said you know you're gonna be one of us you know like that so.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of things would you do?
Speaker 2: I'd hate to say (laughter) but we, we would know anyone that comes on the block or whatever, we'd probably run them off or or shake 'em down like told to come on our block and things like that.
Speaker 1: So how long do you think you stayed on that path?
Speaker 2: Maybe, that was maybe two years.  It was in like I said until I was about eight when I started and then about like I said ten when I--
Speaker 1: So you were in elementary (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) got out when we stopped.  I was in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Which elementary school?
Speaker 2: Walker-Jones Elementary School [Walker-Jones Education Campus, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 551977
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about that school?  Did you have some good teachers?
Speaker 2: I had very good teachers.  Matter of fact one of my teachers Mrs. Lewis [Dorothy Lewis (ph.)] she took a quite liking to me.  She's my homeroom teacher and I was--used to when she had to go to the principal's office or wherever she'd go, she'd ask me to take over the class.  I was president of the class and actually she was going to skip me to the seventh grade from--and forget about the sixth and my mother [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey] didn't think that was a good idea because I would be younger than the people that I'd be in there with so she--so I stayed there at Walker-Jones [Walker-Jones Elementary School; Walker-Jones Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] for the fifth and sixth grade.  That was one of the few elementary schools that I attended at least two years because it's--because we moved around a lot.
Story_ID: 551978
Speaker 1: Now why were you moving so much?
Speaker 2: Well, we, that's--we had a better--my wife [Tamara Durant-Bailey], (laughter) my wife--my mother [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey] had a better option at another home or something that would cost less to maintain 'cause my father [Roosevelt Bailey, Sr.] he left the home when I was maybe four, about five I guess.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that?  Do you remember your dad?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean he, he left the home but we knew where he worked and we stopped past there and see him on occasion maybe once a month or so.
Speaker 1: What did your dad do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a mechanic for the most part when I was younger (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are your first memories of your dad inside the home before he left?
Speaker 2: Funny and because actually on M Street [Washington, D.C.] I say we were on the roof singing he was there at that time because actually he worked I think we were right next to a service station where he worked and so, so he was home then and I had a good time with him then but then like I said I guess between my mother and he, friction happened so.
Speaker 1: Do you remember those days when your dad was still at home, holidays for example?
Speaker 2: No, I was like I said I was pretty young you know four and five.  Every day for me was holiday as far as I knew yeah.
Speaker 1: So you mentioned the after your dad left the house you knew where he worked so you visit him at work?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We visited him like I said maybe once a month or so go past there and see if we can get an allowance or anything from him.  But that was few and far between too because my, my mother she's the, she was the one that you would go to for whatever you need.
Story_ID: 551979
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell me about your mom [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey]?  What was she doing to pay the bills and keep you guys in line?
Speaker 2: Well, we--she had a, a small job at--being a cocktail waitress, waitress and she would go off and about go to work may be three [o'clock] in the afternoon and come back at two or three in the morning so when this was happen when I was in junior high school [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.].  Again before that when I guess when my father [Roosevelt Bailey, Sr.] was in in the home I guess my mother was just a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of--she was a homemaker at that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time.
Speaker 1: --do you remember some of the smells inside the house?  The sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah my mother could cook oh yeah very much so and--
Speaker 1: What are some of those smells?
Speaker 2: Chitterlings that's for sure.  But they were like different things when you especially like you say holidays when you'd have a turkey in the oven and things like that.  It was--that was pretty good then and then like I said things changed so.
Speaker 1: What happened when things changed?
Speaker 2: Well things changed when you know when you don't have the breadwinner there then your mother have to go out and and find a job to take care of the kids that were still there.  Like the ones that were still was Earline [Earline Bailey], Rita [Arealia Bailey], Dot [Dorothy Bailey], myself and Butch [Birchard M. Bailey] so the other ones had, had already left the home and but as soon as you start moving around you know as, as the years go on whenever one child got to the age that they could move on you know they would get out of the house.  Make things easier for, for the mother and the rest of the kids.
Speaker 1: So they'd get out of the house and go to school or get married, start working (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They'd get married or start working and get their own place yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 551980
Speaker 1: You were saying at this time as well you were attending Walter-Jones Elementary [Walker-Jones Elementary School; Walker-Jones Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and you were your teacher's [Dorothy Lewis (ph.)] sort of star student.  Tell me about how you achieved academically?
Speaker 2: Well Walker-Jones, well, well it's just that I like I said at--when that happened back in '59 [1959] you know and I had mentioned to you earlier about going my own way and, and I would--and that's what I'd advise everyone to do to not to be a sheep and follow the leader you know try to be the leader and set the example to, to do something.  So I--that's what I did.  I just followed my own path and that's when I got into going at ten years old going all over the city, going to different monuments, the libraries and all of that.
Speaker 1: So how did you get around the city?
Speaker 2: Bus, walk.  I would--I could walk from one end of Washington [D.C.] to the other in two hours.
Speaker 1: And so tell me the first time you went to the Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Oh well the first time I went to the Lincoln Memorial actually I walked there because we there at M Street and, and Southwest so I could just you know walk up the--to it was maybe fifteen, twenty blocks away so it was not really that far to walk.
Speaker 1: And so what was your impression?
Speaker 2: Oh it's you know it's just awesome seeing you know the, the, the structure, the statue and the carved statue there, him sitting and going over to the Jefferson Memorial [Thomas Jefferson Memorial] around the Hains Point [Washington, D.C.] there.  Going well all of the different memorials and things and, and reading what was there.
Speaker 1: So you were doing the reading as well so at the Lincoln Memorial for example you were reading the inscriptions on the wall, some of the manuscripts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I--you know and you do the--and you know you do that.  Also you go to the different you know on the way to the Lincoln Memorial of course you have the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] on the way there so you would just stop off at this one, stop off at that one.  Look at the--go to the museum of art [National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.] and look at that--
Speaker 1: What were you getting--?
Speaker 2: Natural history [National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: That's brill- what were you getting from that kind of hands on education?
Speaker 2: Well it's seeing actually what Washington, D.C. has to offer because in that matter of fact I and I still think Washington, D.C. is one of the best--the most beautiful cities in the world, especially during cherry blossom season.  It's you know you--I don't think you can beat it and of course you know people compare that to any other city--their own hometowns and everything.  Matter of fact I mentioned that at one time and this guy overheard me and he, you know, took an offense to it and said that Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was so I said okay.  I mean, Philadelphia is nice.  I think Washington is and it's my opinion.
Speaker 1: And you started saying this as a young kid, you were around how old?
Speaker 2: Ten, eleven, twelve (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ten? And you did this from ten years old until, until you graduated high school [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 551981
Speaker 1: I mean even--well in high school we had--I had another avenue there too when I went on to junior high school and we--I was selected to as one of the fourteen I think it's fourteen kids from the citywide pool to to be the first honors program citywide that--and we went to Banneker Junior High School [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] to start that.
Speaker 2: So you excelled in elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: In which subjects?
Speaker 1: All subjects.
Speaker 2: In all subjects?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You were always at the top of the class (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Do you remember you know one such occasion when you were--?
Speaker 1: Well I like math mostly but the, the only--you say one subject that was I excelled I do, I like art but this is back even before the fifth and sixth grade and the third grade I did a two wall mural of the three Billy Goats Gruff painting and my--I met this guy I guess was in the eleventh grade, twelfth grade and he you know was at Cardozo [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and he pointed out he says I know you, you and then he pulled out the three Billy Goats Gruff from the third grade because he was in my class you know.
Speaker 2: So you were a talented artist as well as a budding scholar?
Speaker 1: I don't know whether or not a talented artist, but I, but I would try and so anyway when I got into the fifth grade at Walker-Jones [Walker-Jones Elementary School; Walker-Jones Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], that was noted and they used me for different whatever--whenever they needed a mural or something done in the school, I would do that.
Speaker 2: And Mrs. Lewis [Dorothy Lewis (ph.)] was one of your sort of mentors (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Were there other teachers who took you under their wing?
Speaker 1: In high school is not but I guess getting ahead of myself (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay so then you were mentioning junior high?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Banneker Junior High School.
Speaker 2: So you were selected fourteen out of several students?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yes.  And we started the honors program there where we learned the--what they call a new math came out from the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and I actually--the new math had algebra, trigonometry and all of that with it but mostly it was theory and it's--I don't even, I think that they probably dropped it after (laughter) we finished the eighth grade because we had it for two years and, and that was the last I heard about it and when I went on to Cardozo it's--we start again, I was put in advanced algebra classes and stuff like that going on.
Story_ID: 551982
Speaker 1: I just want to ask you as you were walking around Washington, D.C., you were moving in and out of different neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At this point did you notice the contrast between your neighborhood and some of the other neighborhoods in D.C.?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, in, in walking like I, like I walked a lot.  Didn't have the money for the bus so well when I did I would take it but walking through the neighborhoods it's--it was eye opening especially coming, going up 16th Street.
Speaker 1: What did you notice on those blocks (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Large homes that were very much well kept and as opposed to the row homes that I was used to.  Of course they call them townhomes now but just row homes.
Speaker 1: And this was during the years of segregation?  Were you coming across white folks in D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah I did.  I remember one time I--one policeman told me I should get home.  I said I'm going home but it's--you know it's like you'd better you know get out of this neighborhood like that and I said--you know I just looked at him and kept on walking.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I guess maybe twelve something like that.
Speaker 1: So you kept on your way?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Didn't go home?
Speaker 2: You know I, I was on my way home at the time but it just happened to be--where was I?  I believe coming, I think I was on 16th Street (laughter) at the time yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there other episodes similar to that one?
Speaker 2: The only blatant episode that I would know was just a car coming past you know yelling epithets but you know and of course I ran after them and they sped up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were you aware of you know colored movie theaters, white movie theaters?
Speaker 2: I was aware of, of that because we had of course U Street was the black theaters.  Actually at one time blacks weren't even allowed there.  But I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But that was the LeDroit Park area of D.C. near Howard University, Shaw [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --along Georgia Avenue, U Street?  Was that so that was sort of a mecca?
Speaker 2: Because actually Cardozo High School [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] is the, the white high school was Central High [Central High School, Washington, D.C.] and then they renamed it Cardozo and it was black.  Because Cardozo [Washington, D.C.] was, was the Shaw and then went up there.  It's confusing (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 551983
Speaker 1: What are some of your memories so you walked you know toward the monuments and things like that?  You walked to U Street as well, that area?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, but we lived near there.  We lived up on Georgia Avenue.
Speaker 1: What are some of the memories from that area because there were lots of, you know, African Americans not only you mention the poor neighborhoods, but there were people who were affluent as well, teachers, doctors, lawyers.  Did you come face to face with those people as well?
Speaker 2: Some of the teachers.  We've had I remember one teacher on, on our block but I forget his name and it was a he you know which is--was very rare back then to have a male teacher.  And then but I did have in high school [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] we had male teachers, but elementary school [Walker-Jones Elementary School; Walker-Jones Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and at that age, at ten and twelve years old, no it was all you may have had one male teacher in the school, in elementary schools.  But and on our block not like I said just one lived near you know us 'cause they were out of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were your first?  You were talking about going from Banneker [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] onto high school who were your role models then at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, role models did not really I guess enter the picture because as they're talked about now who is your role model, what are--although you know of course I love my mother [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey] and, and so I just wanted to please her.  But as far as a male role model, perhaps I did have a one my homeroom teacher in--at Banneker--
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: --and you're asking me his name and I really--I don't know why I'm thinking Jenkins [ph.].
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory with him?
Speaker 2: Well, actually he--we had--I'd gone to his home with a couple of other guys and I'm trying to think we had a project or something to do that's why we went over there to and he helped us with that.  And I'm trying to think of the project now that--it escapes me (laughter).  But that was a good time because he showed you know interest I guess.
Story_ID: 551984
Speaker 1: And so you were--was this an integrated junior high?
Speaker 2: May, may have had one or two whites there.
Speaker 1: But it was prestigious?
Speaker 2: Yes, Banneker [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] just it was for me it was prestigious in a way because my, my cousin had gone there and and I had a couple of cousins had gone there and then went on to Cardozo [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] now because I said, "Yeah I'm going to that school you know."  And they said, "It's a good school."  I said, "Okay."  And it, it did prove out to be a good school for the--and that's why I guess Banneker was chosen as the the school to house the honors program.
Speaker 1: And where were you?  Were you excelling still in math (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.  And because I'm, I'm one of the people who would raise their hand if I didn't understand something and and I would stop any teacher, you know, if I didn't understand it, I would raise my hand and of course the other kids they said, they just wanna get on with everything but I you know and I turned to them and say you know if I don't understand it, I want, I want the teacher to, to teach me to to for me to understand it.  Because I know if I don't understand it, probably some of you don't understand it either but you know.
Speaker 1: Do you have any example?
Speaker 2: Just a mathematical problem or something like that.  How did you you know get this, the proof or something like that?  Tell me again.  Tell me again, tell me again until I know it.  And actually and this was in high school at the time.
Speaker 1: So you left Banneker?
Speaker 2: To go to Cardozo that's where it continued on, the honors program.  But I, I skipped back to Cardozo because you know I remember this one math teacher. He got upset with me because I kept raising my hand.  But I'm glad I did because it it made me understand math other than just knowing multiplication tables or whatever or, or trigonometry or whatever.  It made me understand how math works.  Because math for me was I was thinking about well I guess this'll be later on in the interview but because I was thinking about going to college and then being the test pilot and all of that.
Speaker 1: Were you dreaming about that even in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school well we had an assembly where for college day and this one cadet from the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado] talked and that's when I thought about going to the Air Force Academy.
Speaker 1: What was he saying?  What was so mesmerizing?
Speaker 2: Just to go into flight training and you know the feeling because that's what he was gonna be doing and actually and he was a white cadet had come to the school which was surprising, but I mean that's what they had mostly out there and mostly was at the academies.
Speaker 1: Had you been to any of the harbors surrounding D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?  Had you seen ships?
Speaker 2: Just pictures but I mean it's as far as ships are concerned around the Baltimore [Maryland] and Washington harbor no you just you know Hains Point [Washington, D.C.] you're there and you see the small boats and everything but not no real ships.
Speaker 1: But in pictures you were still fascinated with them in books and--?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I was not really bent to go to sea at that time.
Story_ID: 551985
Speaker 1: In high school [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], there were you know my high school days were still filled and I was thinking about I was even thinking about going to Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] because I had--between my tenth and eleventh grade and eleventh and twelfth grade, they had a program that I went to took some classes during the summer at Georgetown.
Speaker 2: Were you one of the few African American students in that program?
Speaker 1: No.  They actually they took African American students from all over the city.
Speaker 2: Okay so it was a minority (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --centered program?
Speaker 1: Yeah it was about sixteen of us or so at any one time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you know the name of it?
Speaker 1: I really don't know.  I mean it's we just went through the program and and it, it was called something orientation.  I forget.  I guess college orientation.  Yeah college orientation program that's what it was called.
Speaker 2: At Georgetown?
Speaker 1: At Georgetown and but they also had it I think at other schools also.
Speaker 2: So that was kind of a moment of inspiration?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: What did you see at Georgetown?
Speaker 1: Just working in the labs doing actually writing in for the English class that we had there.  All of this was paid for you know and they gave us you know your lunch and everything and your, your bus money to, to take the bus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who was with you, who was in your cohort?
Speaker 1: I had Stanley Mayes, Robert May [ph.]; two of these are classmates of mine that were there.
Speaker 2: Who else?
Speaker 1: Well, I think Sheila Wattsworth [ph.], Lydia Holland [ph.].  And then most of these people and I'm saying they were also in the honors program because they would had come through junior high school [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] and high school.
Speaker 2: Did you know [HistoryMaker] Sharon Pratt?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Growing up in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: No, not at all.  I'm pretty sure that I'm a little older than she is (laughter).
Speaker 2: Hm, no.
Speaker 1: No?  Oh okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But no, no I didn't.
Story_ID: 551986
Speaker 1: So in high school [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] did you belong to any clubs or organizations?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I was matter of fact I was president of the research and science club, the German club.  We had--I'm a thespian.  I had my my points, they had points that you get for being in plays and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: What plays were you in?
Speaker 2: 'Thurber Carnival' ['A Thurber Carnival,' James Thurber] and we did 'South Pacific' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II].  We had to do the--but I wasn't in that.  I was like backstage hand--
Speaker 1: So at this time--
Speaker 2: --well actually one of my--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Go 'head.
Speaker 2: I was gonna say one of my guys who was with me in school, Roger Aaron Brown, he's actor in Hollywood now yeah.  Well matter of fact he's in that story in Washington, D.C., with Craig Nelson [Craig T. Nelson].  He's was a police captain or something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'The Commissioner' [sic. 'The District'] or something like that I think.
Speaker 1: So this is the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: You mean in high school?
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, in '60 [1960].  I graduated in '67 [1967].
Story_ID: 551987
Speaker 1: Were you aware of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: I was aware actually--I was matter of fact when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had come on the--and made a speech there, I was supposed to get--I for some reason I did not get off.  I was working at the Association for the Advancement of Science [American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D.C.] and I was gonna get off to go down there because it was a short walk down to the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] to where they were on fourt- what is it 14th [Street] and Massachusetts Avenue I believe or 15th [Street] and Massachusetts Avenue. Anyway I was gonna walk down there then and something happened that I didn't get a chance to go down there and that's--
Speaker 1: For the March on Washington (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I miss that.
Speaker 1: For the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you had hopes of being a part of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were your friends talking about the fight for racial justice?
Speaker 2: Well I had come up to visit someone here in Baltimore [Maryland] and I was guess in the eleventh grade, twelfth grade and, and we were talking about the Black Panther Party and 'cause she was thinking about joining them and everything but I had reservations of that because, 'cause like I said being back in the '50s [1950s], you're with the gangs there and if you're--and your record would follow you wherever it was and that's what I was thinking and so I said well that I'm not gonna get involved in and I said I'll try to do something, get ahead and then perhaps you can 'cause you can do something for our people so to speak.
Speaker 1: So it was kind of an overarching conversation that we need to uplift the race and create some kind of justice?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually it was that because and I'm glad that Janice [Janice McAllister] had given me the Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] interview and he was talking about you know you needed Martin Luther King but you also needed Malcolm X you know, you needed Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture].  But I believed that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you hear any of those I mean Stokely Carmichael was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], did you ever hear him speak?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s]?  Did you hear any of this--?
Speaker 2: The only speech--well I've heard the speeches after it been recorded of Malcolm X but and I heard, I heard Carmichael speak you know on tape but not live.
Speaker 1: Were there other speakers?  Did you ever go around Howard University and, and hear any of the speakers there?
Speaker 2: I was--I went to Howard because I--just to, to look at and I didn't go there to hear the speakers, I just went there to look at the campus and everything because I was from Washington [D.C.].  You got Howard University here so that was one of my thinking there but then I thought also that maybe I don't wanna stay here in D.C.  That's why I looked at colleges elsewhere.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 551988
Speaker 1: Were you conscious?  I mean you had talked about walking around the city and seeing the various monuments--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so you must have been also very much aware of the federal government and even the local government.  I mean because you went on to study I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was, I was thinking about the local government there as a matter of fact going, when I was going through college at the academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York], I thought about doing my time to pay back the academy but after that the coming back to Washington [D.C.] to get into politics, but politics and myself we had two different I guess thoughts about it because of the things that you may have to do to get what you want done, done.  And I believe that you say you just do the right thing you know as Spike Lee says.  Just do the right thing.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of people like Walter Washington in D.C. and the fight for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes and matter of fact his wife Bennetta B. [Bennetta Bullock Washington] was my principal at Cardozo [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] when I first went there.
Speaker 1: And was she an influencing figure?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a very powerful principal there you know.  Everyone liked her.  The kids as well as the, you know, teachers and everything.
Speaker 1: And you were aware of what her husband was doing in D.C. at the time his leadership position?
Speaker 2: At the time, yeah I--we you know it was like a peripheral thing but we didn't really get into that.
Story_ID: 551989
Speaker 1: Because mostly I was just doing my work because when I went to Cardozo [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], you know, I, I was living on 14th Street in Northeast [Washington, D.C.] and had to take the bus all the way over there and the streetcar, we had streetcars then, and then and get back home too so it's like by the time I, I get there in the morning and do that and do my you know schooling there and then get on the bus and go back, it's like four or five [o'clock] in the evening, and my main focus was just to you know get through schooling and do the best I can in school.
Speaker 2: Were your older sisters and brothers at home you know sort of cracking the whip making sure you did your homework or were--
Speaker 1: Not really I was pretty much left of my own to do whatever I had because during that time everyone had left my, my brother Butch [Birchard M. Bailey] that was two years older than I, he quit school in, in tenth grade and joined the [U.S.] Air Force so.
Speaker 2: So what gave you the idea of going off to the academy?  Tell me about your wishes upon graduation from Cardozo?
Speaker 1: Well when I--like I said I, I was going, I was listening to the, the gentleman from the--cadet from the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado] and said well the academy that's a good idea because it's free, it's a free school.  And well Washington, D.C. at that time, we had commissioners and so and the commissioners gave an exam to anyone who is interested in going to the academies so it was about maybe four hundred, four hundred fifty guys there taking the test but the only thing about it they only had seven openings for all five academies.
Speaker 2: So the Air Force Academy, Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland], all of them, West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York], Merchant Marines [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York]--
Speaker 1: Yes and the Coast Guard Academy [United States Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut] they only had seven openings and these are openings that other senators, senators and everything from other states didn't use so that's why they had just seven.  And I landed one of the seven but it was to the Merchant Marine Academy so I said oh okay.
Speaker 2: How did they figure that out?  How did they decide?
Speaker 1: I don't know I guess your preference is when you write down what you want.  They didn't have any to the Air Force Academy at the time.  I think they had one to the Naval Academy, two to the Military Academy and four for the Merchant Marine Academy so I got one of the four.
Speaker 2: And it was a test you had sit for?
Speaker 1: Yes you had to take I think it was about a three or four hour test you know yeah.
Speaker 2: And you did pretty well?
Speaker 1: And I did pretty well and so they nominated me to go to the Merchant Marine Academy where I had already had scholarships to go to other colleges, but I said well Merchant Marine Academy you don't really have to you know keep that B, B plus average to maintain that scholarship and stuff like that so this is and they pay you for going you know.
Story_ID: 551990
Speaker 1: What were some of the other schools, where you were accepted?
Speaker 2: At Bowdoin [Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine], Colby [Colby College, Waterville, Maine], Union [Union College, Schenectady, New York] so yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's a lot of sort of Northeast (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --New England--
Speaker 2: Yeah I went yeah.
Speaker 1: --schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah definitely yeah New England.  So actually there were Bowdoin honored a full academic scholarship there so but I said well and I'd gone up there to visit them for a weekend and it--that was pretty funny too.  I stayed at the Beta house [Beta Theta Pi Fraternity] which is a fraternal house for for frats--
Speaker 1: White frat?
Speaker 2: White frat yeah.
Speaker 1: That was a little unusual.
Speaker 2: But we had--they had I think one or two black brothers there too but anyway we--I stayed there and we went to a hockey game and matter of fact the hockey game was against Colby College and something happened in the stands and like all hockey games, fights might break out but, but it was interesting to see that happening.  Colby won the game that time.
Speaker 1: But you decided against going to Colby (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah well I was actually talking I had a friend, a girlfriend at the time and I said, "Well there's Bowdoin up there and such and such," and I said, "Well this is the Merchant Marine Academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] is all male school so."  She said, "Well why don't you go to Merchant Marine Academy?"  But she didn't decide that for me, but I thought about it with the--with them paying me.  Like all the academies you get paid while you're going so I said good.
Speaker 1: Serious girlfriend?
Speaker 2: Nah, just--not really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Prom?
Speaker 2: --prom and things like that yeah.
Story_ID: 551991
Speaker 1: So then you went off to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--yeah.
Speaker 1: In 1967?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then they decide--they said that, "Well you, you can transfer over if you know your grades are okay and you can transfer over to the other academies."  So I said, "Well okay, maybe I'll do that," because I still wanted the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado].  I wanted to be a test pilot and maybe an astronaut, get my Ph.D. in mathematics and physics and all of this, be an egghead for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] but I went to the Merchant Marine Academy and they said, "Well at the Merchant Marine Academy," the guy said, "you know, you know they make about twenty thousand [dollars] a year you know when you first come out you know, the first year out?"  I said, "Twenty thousand a year that sounds pretty good to me," you know; this is in '67 [1967] right--
Speaker 1: That's lot of money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a lot of money and I said I don't think my father [Roosevelt Bailey, Sr.] earned over twelve thousand you know a year his whole life.  I said okay I'll try that.  And so I stayed there for a while but I was pretty much you know disillusioned with the 'cause it, it's all white there I was the only I was the only black no I take that back there was two of us in that class.
Speaker 1: How many people in the class?
Speaker 2: What thirty-seven to start, three hundred thirty-seven started out in the class each class (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was it the first time you were outnumbered to--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  And, and there were only two black upperclassmen so four out of a thousand that's it.  And, and also you get the--you feel the prejudice there from some of the students. But then you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about one of those memories of prejudice?
Speaker 2: Well, I've had one economics professor he would come in my name is Bailey [HistoryMaker Captain Avis T. Bailey] of course and had Adams in my class too so it goes Adams, there's Bailey.  He would come in the door and said, "It's a great country if you're free, white and twenty-one."  And then he said, "Oh, hello Bailey," so you know things like that.
Speaker 1: And that was a joke?
Speaker 2: His joke, yeah and that joke was maybe every other week and so.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: So every other week he would make a joke similar to that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did he treat you otherwise?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll put it to you this way.  I had a, a B average well not a B from the test that I took, I had eighty-nine--eighty-nine average B average and taken a final, oh I missed the final for some reason so I had to go back and take a makeup test.  And so he said, "Wow if you'd done this it would be great, but you didn't. This is a makeup test so I got to give you this."  So he--
Speaker 1: A lower grade?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I got a I think I got a D out of that class.  That's good, fine, leave me alone.  I've had another professor, history professor and before I even took the course, he said, "You know, you know you gonna fail."  I said, "Okay."  I just because I disagreed you know with his take of history because he was trying to tell me what someone thought at the time.
Story_ID: 551992
Speaker 1: Tell me about your history professor [at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well my history professor, Dr. Saluda [ph.].  He's--he wrote a book and of course he like I guess most professors know where the money is, he can tell everyone you have to buy his book to (laughter) when you take the class.
Speaker 1: What was the book, do you remember the name?
Speaker 2: I have no--you know--
Speaker 1: But a world history book?
Speaker 2: It's a history book yeah, yeah.  And it's just his I guess his idea of history because I guess saying his idea and my idea were two different things.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the area of conflict?
Speaker 2: Well the area of conflict is--was mainly his saying what someone thought when they did something and I, you know, I don't think anyone can say what someone thought and you know to do it because it's just like I don't know what example because a lot of people don't know you know what they were thinking at the time, why they would--why they did something.  I said you know because they have questions themselves, why did I do that you know?  But you know he says well that's a good day to invade Poland you know.  So that's why Hitler [Adolf Hitler] invaded Poland.
Speaker 1: Was that the exact example (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That may be you know I'm just giving a you know that's--
Speaker 1: So you challenged him?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I guess he didn't like that and matter of fact when I did, I left, when I graduated and everything I, I actually I took him a Ebony had had a I think a four volume, three volume, four volume set of black history and I, I gave them to him as a gift.  So.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) How did he receive that?
Speaker 2: No comment, no, nothing.
Speaker 1: Well in the classroom how did he react when you stood up to him?  What did he say to you?
Speaker 2: Well, he just said you know like in other words, he's the teacher you know (laughter).  Said okay but I mean I, I've had history in high school [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] you know and you know and of course you have history you know they said well history is the written fact.  It's not necessarily a fact.  I mean it's, it could be, but that may not be the, the end all of why that fact is fact.  Like I, like I said it could be same thought, woke up and had a cup of coffee and just thought well maybe I'll do this today 'cause he's the fuhrer, you know.
Story_ID: 551993
Speaker 1: Were there other faculty members who gave you trouble [at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York]?
Speaker 2: I mean I've had other faculty members that, that didn't give me trouble, they would welcome my input, my English teacher for example.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Professor Norton [A.A. Norton], yeah.  He was the only one who didn't wear his--wear a uniform because of course they had uniforms of their lieutenants and captains and commanders and everything, he was just Professor Norton.
Speaker 1: What was read about in his class?  What did you read in his class?
Speaker 2: We had discussions about works like science fiction or whatever and then he would, he would do one quarter for and say okay we're going to do a, write science fiction or something like that.  Everyone has to write a story and everything so we did that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it's creative writing?
Speaker 2: Creative writing yes.
Speaker 1: Also literature?
Speaker 2: And literature yeah but--
Speaker 1: Did you read any African American authors or--
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: --was this the traditional English canon, Shakespeare [William Shakespeare]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some of the American writers?
Speaker 2: But, but he was really into the like I said the science fiction Asimov [Isaac Asimov] and all that.
Story_ID: 551994
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about students [at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York], tell me about some of your classmates and how they received you?
Speaker 2: For the most part, that that first year I, I did okay.  The upperclassmen some didn't know how to treat me, some were just like I didn't belong there.  I mean but that's and that was evident you know when they would come up in my face.  Of course when you, when you're a plebe you're a plebe so you have to make the chins and and brace go against the wall and repeat plebe knowledge as they say which was useless but it's knowledge that you have to have.
Speaker 1: Like what kinds, what kinds of stuff did you have to know?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me see if I can do this.  You have to take in a deep breath because you have to say it all in one, one fell swoop.  "Sir, my inexcusable ignorance and unmitigated incompetence have been occasioned by the prodigious thickness of my cranium which means (unclear) permits all but the smallest bits of wisdom from permeating the axons and tissues of my meager brain and I'll do my best to find out sir," that is if you don't know something.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you also you know other thing, and I still remember that because I used to brace a lot in upperclassmen's rooms.
Speaker 1: So did you learn that stuff I mean there must have been sort of a basic training kind of period for cadets huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a two week orientation that we called the plebe beat and you're down in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what did that entail?
Speaker 2: --you're down in the zero deck which is the basement and that's where all the pipes and everything goes through so it's hot and you're in full uniform sweating profusely, you're up against the wall with other cadets and they're--some of them falling out and everything and of course you always have the little guy in front of you yelling up at you and, and you have to you just look straight ahead and say whatever it is.
Speaker 1: And lots, lots of discipline?
Speaker 2: That's just it.  It's a military.  It was a quasi-military school.  I said quasi-military, it's supposed to be military but quasi-military because you know I had I was in high school cadets in, in at Cardozo [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and I was captain there in the high school because that's when I was in twelfth grade but coming over there I joined the, the drill team because I was in drill team there at Cardozo too but joined the drill team there and I know how to do the manual of arms and all of that before I even went there and so that respect, you march around with your rifle and all of that military but other than that it was not quite a military thing.  And matter of fact people get confused of the [U.S.] Merchant Marine because they say, "Well it's military."  Well, it's not military.  We still had military ranks and things like that same captain and chief mate and all that but that's--and you, you go by rank so to speak but it's not quite military.  Only during times of war then it could be.
Story_ID: 551995
Speaker 1: Tell me about the mission?  Did they really spell out the mission for you in terms of aiding--
Speaker 2: Well, well our mission--the [U.S.] Merchant Marine is supposed to get the cargo whether it's munitions, doing the Murmansk [Russia] run during the Second World War [World War II, WWII] or getting cargo, getting troops ammunition, whatever, the logistics for the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 1: Did that seem like a noble enterprise to you at this stage of the game?
Speaker 2: Well, at this stage of the game, my, my main objective was not that I'm mercenary or anything but like I say it was twenty thousand dollars that first year out that you, that you're looking at but at that point it was just seeing what, what can be done with whatever the Merchant Marine is, is gonna do for you financially, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was very lucrative it seemed to me.  But doing that was getting into not knowing that that was not that many black officers throughout the Merchant Marine and everything like that.  Actually I was the twentieth black graduate of the academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] and this is from '42 [1942] yeah this is in '72 [1972] in thirty years it's, that's amazing to me.  And, and matter of fact what's amazing, even more amazing is that in '79 [1979] when I became a pilot you know as the first black pilot, licensed, state licensed pilot, it's, you know, it's in '79 [1979] I mean turn of the century is pretty close here.
Speaker 1: Now toward the end of your year you went back home to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at the end of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the first year there like I said I was, I was pretty much disillusioned with you know being there with a sea of white and having those, those, those, some problems come up.
Speaker 1: Those are the problems you mentioned?
Speaker 2: Well no, not with the professors at that time, but I did have a problem with not those two professors but another one, but that's not, that wasn't the cause. It's just I was not ready for I guess being in that, that group of, of mostly white--
Speaker 1: So it created some kind of emotional and psychological tension or struggle?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I guess within me that I had to you know step back and so I did.  And when I, when I went home--because like I said I thought I don't really need that, I can do something else you know.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you went home when?
Speaker 2: Around in beginning, late April, beginning of May something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of sixty-eight [1968]?
Speaker 2: Of '68 [1968] yes.  And---
Speaker 1: So what was happening in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] around this time?
Speaker 2: Well in '68 [1968] and you still had the the struggle there. In '68 [1968], you had--Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was just assassinated and 14th Street was burning and all of that is happening (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So were you aware, you were home at the time of the protest and the riots?
Speaker 2: I was, I was there just after the riots because that, that happened in I guess February, the riots and I got home a couple of months after that.
Speaker 1: So what was your reaction when you saw the aftermath?
Speaker 2: I was, well I was pretty much sickened actually because I, I don't you know I, I'd always thought why would blacks burn their own stores, homes whatever and they have to live there you know.  I could not understand that.  But then after you know in thinking about it you know like I say you, you just, it's frustration.  It's almost like you're in your home and you get very upset and you take a glass and throw it against a wall.  I mean the glass is just sitting there.  I mean you own it.  You know you're--but you're going to shatter it because you just ah and I can understand why that happened there.
Speaker 1: What were your friends doing?  Were your friends active in as you mentioned Black Panther Party?  Were they active in the Civil Rights Movement?  Were they involved with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] or SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 2: No, when I, when I got home I had, I--we didn't talk politics or anything like that because when I got home we just tried to I guess settle down and not not go the political thing because I was still thinking about coming back [to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] and--
Speaker 1: Well what was your mom [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey] saying?
Speaker 2: Well, she was so busy just you know working trying to make ends meet.
Story_ID: 551997
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about your desire to maybe leave the Merchant Marine Academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well when I, I had left and, and had come down and of course my mother [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey] was upset. I was the only--her only child to ever go to college so she was very disappointed and I don't like disappointing my mother so but I try to tell her I could go to somewhere else but she said, "It was you know you need to you know finish you know what you did."  So I said, "Okay."  Well I made a call up to the admissions office up there and they, they allowed me to come right back in the next class.  So, so I did the two week plebe beat again.  Start off as a plebe again, took all of the, the abuse (laughter) that the upperclassmen were throwing at me again you know.
Speaker 1: Was any of this abuse targeted at your race or was it all just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's everyone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So the next few years there at the academy, what were some of the highlights?
Speaker 2: Well the highlights was I joined the, I joined the glee club there.  Actually I was in glee club the first year and I went back then and I was still in the glee and so I was in the glee club then because I like to sing so.  And it was great.  I, I liked the glee club because we were the only team to leave the academy before--when you're, when you're a plebe, most plebes do not leave the academy until after Thanksgiving; they're sent home at Thanksgiving.  This is from mid-August to Thanksgiving that you're there so but if you're on a team, you go on what they call team movements and, and the glee club got out in September to sing (laughter), so okay and the thing about it we used to sing at--with girls' choirs from other neighboring schools and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Did you get to date some of the women of other choirs?
Speaker 2: Not really.  They--we would have mixers and stuff afterwards you know we get together but that's about it.
Speaker 1: Did you travel along the eastern seaboard or where did you travel?
Speaker 2: Just well the eastern seaboard meaning New Jersey and Upstate New York or over to Connecticut.  But you know close because our school was on Long Island, Kings Point [New York].
Speaker 1: And eventually you were aboard a ship?
Speaker 2: Yeah, eventually well when you're going to the school, it's, it's a four year academy but one of the years you spend aboard ship as a cadet midshipman and and that's your second year.  Because I was with the glee club I was designated in a team so to speak so I was eligible to split my sea year up to my so I had one year at school and a half year at school, then a half year at sea, half year at school, half year at sea and then the one year at school.
Story_ID: 551998
Speaker 1: So in doing that you know my first port of call was Bilbao, Spain which was actually Santurtzi [Spain] which is northern part, north part of north coast of Spain and that was on the Exporter [ph.], 1948 I think it was built the ship, and that was that taught me a lot because the chief mate said go out there with the boatswain and the boatswain is like the top non-officer [non-commissioned officer] and in deck crew so I went out there with boatswain and he taught me how to splice, he taught me how to do everything there was on deck which was great but still I was supposed to--my sea project which entailed taking my taking stars meaning finding your position on the water by stars or the sun, the moon whatever.  I still had to do that too.  But the chief mate wanted me out on deck so for the forty-eight days I was on that ship, forty days was like on deck slushing stays and just doing manual labor and stuff.  So but my first port got to Santurtzi and I just said--asked the mate could I have off so I could go and visit the port?  And he said yes.  Okay so I went off instead of doing cargo watch for the ship and I had to walk from Santurtzi to Bilbao because I didn't have any pesetas--
Speaker 2: What were some of the sights, smells and sounds of that town?
Speaker 1: Well, I had--first time I ever ate a gyro was there.  I don't know why we went to--they had a Greek restaurant there because we had Greek AB [able seaman] that went ashore with us and he said, "You gotta try this," and so I tried it and loved it.  But going into the city with the, with these guys the first time it's, it's an eye opener.  It actually in every city that you go to is like you know wow.
Story_ID: 551999
Speaker 1: How were you received as a black man?
Speaker 2: Actually as, as cadet--you mean going into the--
Speaker 1: To Spain or other countries (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Into Spain and other countries? Oh it was actually they didn't think I was black.  They would stop me and ask me directions in Spanish and (speaking Spanish), "Muy poquito Espanol," and I and then they would go on, not Spanish so.  I mean I, I been confused for so many different nationalities.
Speaker 1: Did you compare and contrast your experiences abroad with what was going on in the U.S. racially?
Speaker 2: No, well I did some, somewhat because I realize that abroad has a different outlook on you know colored and everything because you have, if you're Hispanic, you're Hispanic you know doesn't matter.  Although you know when you really get into it and you you get to know them more, there's still a difference there, and you know I, for the life of me, prejudice to me is ignorance and I remember when I was a kid, I mean very young, maybe six years old you know and I had a wish that I could take all the illnesses in the world and bring them inside myself and I thought I'd--and plus ignorance which I think is the thing with the world, with what's wrong with the world and ignorance bring it within myself and that I throw myself in front of the car, kill myself.  Of course I'm thinking killing all of that.  So saving the world but I guess we have to save the world another kind of way because I don't think my wife [Tamara Durant-Bailey] would like my throwing myself in front of the car.
Speaker 1: I don't think so.  And so you wanted to get rid of all these ills in the world and you traveled around so you're able to witness how the rest of the world handled some of these things?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But I, but my going to these different countries and and being accepted by whomever I met there and that many people even Russians then because I was taking Russian in, in school [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] because I wanted to go to Russia to stay there for maybe a year or so to see what really the Russians think because I did not believe in the propaganda that Russians are bad you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't believe it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you were a skeptic?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and, and then you know I said I can't and you know the Russians can't believe that we're all you know you're capitalist and everything, so what you know but we're not all bad.
Story_ID: 552000
Speaker 1: When did you go to Russia?
Speaker 2: I did not go to Russia but I was, went to Chile and at that time this was in 1970 I guess.  There were many Russians in Chile and and I met this girl there and went to her home, she invited me to dinner with her sister and her sister's husband which was Russian so that was interesting there 'cause the conversation was in English, Spanish and Russian altogether.
Speaker 1: Practice your languages?
Speaker 2: If you wanna say that yeah, yeah.  But it--
Speaker 1: How many languages did you study?
Speaker 2: Spanish, German and Russian and English of course (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you got to use them in various countries?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and which served me very well.  I--and especially when you're over in these countries and you're trying to speak their language, trying, it's the same thing as a pilot coming up the bay trying to speak their language, trying to learn their language as they're coming up the bay.  They seem to respect you more because at least you're trying you know.  And for myself being overseas, I, I really enjoyed you know meeting the people and talking with the people.
Speaker 1: What were some of the other countries?
Speaker 2: Italy, going through the Mediterranean from Spain to Italy to Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Lebanon, Greece (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of those countries was there a memory you have of one of them that really stands out?
Speaker 2: Well Greece, is, is my favorite memory because the Greek people and I think they were the warmest people that I have met.  You know they invite you in, "Hey, come."  It's just like the--like I said the Greek AB [able seaman] that we had on board ship you know, "You gotta come you gotta do this."  It's great.  So actually I told my wife [Tamara Durant-Bailey] I said, "Well when we retire, we wanna retire to Greece," and said well and I have a Greek frat brother that maybe you wanna go there again and because things are a little, little bit different than 1969 you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  So you went to these different countries. Do the Greeks think you were Greek, and did Italians think you were Italian?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no but you know they knew I'm just American and that's the thing about it they, they just said American and not black or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They didn't care about your race?
Speaker 2: Just American.
Story_ID: 552001
Speaker 1: Now around this time as well when we have the Vietnam War kind of going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: Were you involved at all in the Vietnam War?  Were the Merchant Marines [U.S. Merchant Marine] supplying--?
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't involved, the ships that I went on, no.  Although I must say that the out of all five fellow academies, the Merchant Marine Academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] is the only academy that has a--has war colors. That we've been to war.  You had cadets in war.  So.
Speaker 1: Were any of the cadets--
Speaker 2: We have a battle standard.
Speaker 1: --were any of the cadets you knew at school at the time, were they at all active?
Speaker 2: A few, a few of the cadets went over on, onto ships but not like I said myself we just did the cargo to the Mediterranean and South America to the Far East and places of that nature, but I've been to maybe two dozen countries as a cadet which opened my eyes at nineteen years old you know and, and not really being paid that much.  I think we were paid one hundred seventy-six dollars a month (laughter) but you got food and and lodging on the ship so there was no problem.  But that's what I liked, going to sea.
Story_ID: 552002
Speaker 1: Tell me more about this indoctrination process.  Did you have to memorize any other speeches?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  There's one that definitely I had to remember and that was when you forget to say sir so you have to say, "Sir, sir is a subservient word surviving from the surly days of old Serbia when certain sheriffs too ignorant to remember their lord's name yet too servile to (unclear) them, circumvented the situation by surrogating the subservient word from which now belatedly address as certain seems (Unclear) who correctly surmised that I was surly enough not to say every word I said sir."
Speaker 1: So you had to say that to upperclassmen?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and you had to do that while you're up bracing against the wall with your neck against the wall.
Speaker 1: How long did you have to do that?
Speaker 2: Anytime an upperclassman say do it.
Speaker 1: Just your first year?
Speaker 2: Just the first year as long as you're a plebe then when you're recognized as a fourth classman then you don't have to do all of that.  But also you also had to tell them when they were gonna have the next meal too and you know whatever it was.
Speaker 1: Were there any other highlights from your experiences at the academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] that you can tell us a story?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), I remem- I remember one story of course like I said there weren't too many blacks at the academy and I remember I was a first classman at the time, a nonrated first classman as a matter of fact 'cause that's what I wanted to be.  We call them zombos and I wanted to be nominated once so I wouldn't have to deal with the the the marching or the anything just all I have to do is just show up for formation.  But anyway the the black guys that were there came to me and complained about one of the--some of the other cadets complaining about them sitting at a table together all black.  So I had to go up to Lieutenant DeFilippi [Dominic DeFilippi] and, and say you know, "I understand they--you having problems with this guy sitting at this table together these ten black guys," and and they said, "They don't, it just doesn't seem--they should be integrated throughout."  I said, "Well I'm looking at this table that's who they want to sit with."  Said, "Well they're from different companies."  Said, "Well if you look at their table there, they're from different companies too and if you look at all of these tables in the mess hall, you have ten whites over there, you have ten whites there, you have ten whites there, you have ten whites there, you have ten whites there," 'cause of course it was majority white so they had to have at least ten whites at some of the tables, but I said, "They're just there having a meal.  They're not causing any uprising or anything like that so."
Speaker 1: How many students were in this group?
Speaker 2: Well, we had let's see myself; I was the only black in my class.  Class after me had four, the class after that I think maybe had six or so, so anyway it was enough to fill up a table at the time at that particular time so.
Story_ID: 552003
Speaker 1: There were eight of you in your family, eight kids?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your mom [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey] and your dad [Roosevelt Bailey, Sr.], did they get to see you at the academy?
Speaker 2: My one sister, my mother.  Actually my father did come to the graduation.  My father, my father came to the graduation, my oldest brother [Roosevelt Bailey, Jr.] and I think one of my sisters Earline [Earline Bailey] came to the graduation three of them.
Speaker 1: Was that a proud moment for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess yes it was for me.  I, you know, I made it (laughter).  We have this expression we graduate in '72 [1972] and of course we have shirts that I mentioned, "Out of the zoo in '72 [1972] U.S. MMA [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York]," so that was our yeah fight song and our theme song was I guess for all of the cadets and matter of fact they wanted to ban the song from being played while we're having mess and every time we have liberty, they would play the song by The Animals 'We Gotta Get Out of This Place If It's The Last Thing We Ever Do' [sic. 'We Gotta Get Out of This Place'] that's it.
Speaker 1: Were you conscious of the fact that you were the twentieth African American to graduate from the academy?
Speaker 2: No, not until I graduate--I was conscious there weren't too many before me because it's only one in my class.  But I was happy to see that Milton Irvin he had stayed in the class because like I say I was in class of '71 [1971] with Milton and he was in engineering program.  I was in naval science, nautical science program myself to become captain and he would become chief engineer when aboard ships.
Speaker 1: Tell me--
Speaker 2: But he did other things after that.
Story_ID: 552004
Speaker 1: And you went through a difficult period with your mom [Dorothy Heavlow Bailey] during, during this time?
Speaker 2: Well, during that well like I said, my mother had, had contracted cancer in, in 1970, that's when she passed.  And of course for me not having her those final years is a little hard.  As a matter of fact it was very hard but I, I you know I muddled through it especially I was going to--I was thinking about leaving again and I thought about her and I stayed on because this at that time that was in '70 [1970], '71 [1971] I think President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] had I think it was gone into Cambodia and we had a big protest about that and a lot of things were happening at school [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York], the Vietnam War at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were some of those protests?
Speaker 2: We, we because we're not, because we are a federal academy, we weren't supposed to protest anything that was political there.  It was banned but we did anyway.
Speaker 1: Protest against the war?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And meanwhile you were--
Speaker 2: At school.
Speaker 1: --at school involved in the war in some way?
Speaker 2: And we, matter of fact, we got letters from the Military Academy [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] and all the other academies saying how could we do that?
Speaker 1: So tell me about the protests?  Where were you?  And what were you doing?
Speaker 2: Well just you know we were gonna walk out of the school we had a lot of, a lot of the guys getting together just gonna, just leave and not take--we were supposed to go to the what is it I think the, wasn't a Flag Day it was Armed Forces Day or something like that, we were supposed to take part in a parade or something and we didn't do it.
Speaker 1: Why, why that sentiment, why the anti-war sentiment?  I'd be surprised by that.
Speaker 2: Well, because it, it seemed as though he was extending the war.
Speaker 1: Nixon?
Speaker 2: Yeah and, and going into Cambodia and everything that's gonna get them involved and you know--
Speaker 1: So this is around the time when, when the greater public had changed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You already went into Laos too you know. You got Vietnam, then you have Laos then you have Cambodia you know what are you gonna involve, you know.
Story_ID: 552005
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then you graduated in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I graduated in '72 [1972].  When you graduate from the academy, you get your third mate's license, your bachelor of science degree in transportation, you get your your commission in the [U.S.] Navy and that's, that's a funny thing when you get your commission in the Navy I went--you have pre-commissioning physical and so talking to the doctor which was a full lieutenant in the Navy was saying you know ask me what nationality I was.  I said and I said, "Isn't this the American Navy?  Isn't this the U.S. Navy?  I'm an American." Then he got embarrassed to that and he said, "Well okay." I say, "I'm black American, African America, whatever you want it.  So.  But my nationality is American."
Speaker 1: And where were you, where you stationed with other, with other black Americans, white Americans primarily?
Speaker 2: Well you mean in the Navy, in the Navy I was just in the [U.S.] Navy Reserve because when I--as a, my first class year there before I graduated, Pete Braza [ph.] from Sun Transport Incorporated heard of me and and knew I was the only black in my class and he was, he was a graduate at Kings Point [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York].  Pete Braza was the vice president of Sun Oil Company [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.]--Sun Transport I should say which is a [U.S.] Merchant Marine arm of Sun, Sun Oil Company, they took the ships, Sun Oil ships.  Anyway he come up to offer me a job you know because they didn't have any black officers on board their ships so he did and actually wanted me to become--to be third able body seaman for six months to a year and then become third mate on one of the ships and I just said no you know.  I get my third mate's license from here.  I did my AB work when I was on those five ships as a cadet, I'm an officer.  So he said okay.  So as soon as I graduate from Kings Point, I jumped to the ship in June, the S.S. Texas Sun as third mate.
Speaker 1: And so what were some of the turning point experiences for you aboard that ship?
Speaker 2: Well just, just being on the ship as an officer and it was funny because like I said I did--we didn't quite, we didn't wear uniforms or anything like that and and when I left school of course at school my hair was short and everything so when I left school I grew my hair down to my shoulders like Super Fly and had cutoffs and (unclear) you know no shirt as third mate on board a, you know, a tanker, which was great (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you became a part of a culture the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --kind of hip culture?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.  And anyway it was and what got me also with Sun Oil Company and as I said it would--back to going back to the money I said that first half year from June, July to December 31st my pay, my--I think I made nineteen thousand dollars for a half year's work. I said this is even better than I thought.  So you kept going up.  So when I got my--as third mate goes from different ships and you you have your discharges and then every year a year at sea you can sit for your next license, and your next license, and your next license.
Speaker 1: So where did you go aboard that ship?
Speaker 2: Well mostly that was just a, a feeder from Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania down to Sun station, Texas or, or Beaumont [Texas] or Corpus Christi [Texas].
Story_ID: 552006
Speaker 1: So what was going on in your personal life at this time?  When did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: Well, my present wife [Tamara Durant-Bailey] I met her at certain--many years later, but my first wife, I had met her when I was a senior in high school [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and she was a freshman at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And she had graduated from Morgan I had graduated from the academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] and I for some reason went back down to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and actually Dorothy Lewis [ph.], my fifth grade teacher, she was her cousin or yeah so we got back together anyway.
Speaker 1: And you got married in what year?
Speaker 2: In '74 [1974] and so I have three boys, three sons from that.
Speaker 1: What are their names?  When were they born?
Speaker 2: Christopher [Christopher Bailey], he was born in '75 [1975] and Jason [Jason Bailey] was born in '80 [1980] and Jarrett [Jarrett Bailey] was born in '82 [1982].
Story_ID: 552007
Speaker 1: While you were on this Sun Oil Company ship [S.S. Texas Sun], you were also--you got married?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you started a family?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was it hard to juggle the professional and the personal?
Speaker 2: Not real- for me not really I guess my first wife may differ in that opinion but then again I can't see how because I was out at sea, I would do two months at sea and take a month and a half off you know.  That's the way we worked and when I so I went up the ladder from there when I became chief mate that was in '77 [1977], yeah '77 [1977], we would--you know I was saving, I was getting ready to go for my master's license and I saw one of my classmates and he said, "Well why don't you join the pilots?"  And this is in I guess '78 [1978] in the latter part of '78 [1978] and I said, "Hey I'm black, you know, this is Maryland which is a southern state.  They don't have any blacks in the United States."  He said, "Yeah but we'll beat the drum for you and you know several of the guys that are at at you know pilots there, several of them, know 'em from school."  Said okay so I said I'll apply, so I applied and to my surprise I was accepted but I had to think about it because I--with Sun Oil Company [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.] like I said I was the first black with Sun Oil and they had written up in the paper you know in Sun Oil's paper that twenty-nine may be Sun's first black skipper so okay.  So I was gonna get my master's license and then actually they had a ship the [S.S.] New Jersey Sun waiting for me.  The New Jersey Sun was built in 1953 so that's how old the ships are.  So but I, you know, if I'm gonna be captain that's no problem.
Speaker 1: So you became the first African American pilot, licensed pilot in the State of Maryland?
Speaker 2: Ship's pilot, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ship's pilot.
Speaker 2: The ship's pilot that's state licensed yeah, in the United States.
Speaker 1: In the entire United States?  So how did that feel for you?
Speaker 2: That felt good because I, I, I weighed that you know I said now I can become captain you know, captain with the increase in salary is about, they make--this is back in '79 [1979], they made about one hundred twenty thousand [dollars] and I said that sounds good and--
Speaker 1: That was a lot of money back in 1979, still is.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: But it was a lot then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so and or become apprentice pilot making eight hundred dollars a month which is ninety-six--nine thousand six hundred dollars anyway, I said hm I said but as a pilot and at that time with Sun Oil Company you were in touch with the office like three times a day and you'd have someone, young person in the office telling you what to do with the ship you know.
Story_ID: 552008
Speaker 1: As master of the ship, that's why they call them masters, masters you're the person on that ship.  You can do, you have you know the whole ship in your hands and all of the crew.  Just like--
Speaker 2: So you have a crew of how many?
Speaker 1: Well that that time the crew was about thirty-two, thirty-four and you--but they used to say as master of the ship you're next to God because you can do any- you know if you say walk the plank, you walk the plank you know or whatever.  So but then you have some nowadays you have someone in the office telling you what to do with the ship you know okay.  Or I can become pilot and I get on the ship, I take over the ship.  Nobody tells you what to do.  So and also put my foot in the door for more blacks to follow me through so I did.  That's why I become a pilot.  So--
Speaker 2: Was there big celebrations surrounding that?  I'm sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not really.  No.
Speaker 2: Articles?
Speaker 1: I mean my yeah there's an article actually I have an article that's up on my fifth level there that's my best friend he, he blew it up for me.  This is from what is it from The New American here in Baltimore [Maryland] called "Masters of the Chesapeake" and it has my picture and myself climbing up the ladder inside of a ship.  That was back in '83 [1983] but he gave it to me for Christmas gift one time.
Speaker 2: Very nice.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But as far as Sun Oil Company [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.] I said well okay fine I'll leave that be but I had to stay there until after June finished because we have a seven years there, you're, you're vested for retirement so I have to call them up and tell them I'm retired, I want my whatever it is a hundred dollars a month or whatever that seven years got me and--
Speaker 2: What did you do next?
Speaker 1: Well I became a pilot; it's an apprentice pilot for one year.  Since I had gotten my--I had my chief mate's license at that time, I had just was going to sit for my master's license so in that year I sat for my master's license too and so I got that and the year of apprenticeship you're just riding up and down the bay with senior pilots and then they'll let you take it over.  I mean actually my first ship that I had down the bay the Captain Maderry [ph.] said, "Did you have your, your courses and this and courses and things?"  And I said, "Yeah."  He said, "Well you got it," you know.  Okay.  So but I was, I was pretty comfortable with it because I was at Sun Oil Company because they knew I was coming up to become you know chief mate captain with them even when I was third mate I had several of the captains take an interest and say you gonna have to do this sometime so they let me undock and dock Sun Oil ships from Marcus Hook [Pennsylvania].

Speaker 1: So who were some of your role models at this time?  I mean obviously some of the white apparently white men because you were setting the precedent when it comes to African American people in your field, but were there other people outside of your field who you saw as sort of role models?  I mean were you aware what Colonel Gregory [HistoryMaker Colonel Frederick Drew Gregory] was doing in with you know NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I, I, I didn't know him.  Actually I knew his, his wife [Barbara Archer Gregory] from Boston [Massachusetts] and yeah his--my, my--friend of mine Wylie Rollins had gone up to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he was dating her roommate so.
Speaker 1: Small world.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: So who were some of the people maybe like Colonel Gregory, who were some of the people you looked to in variety of disciplines and said you know they're doing it I can do it too?
Speaker 2: Well actually that's, that's one of my, my sayings that I tell people, young folks when I'm talking to them you know I say you look at the person who's doing whatever and you have to say if he can do it, I can do it.  So do it you know.  It's almost like the adage if you think you can do it you can, if you think you can't do it, you're also right you know and you know all these you know--I found it comical that people say oh they just old adages but there's truth to those you know (laughter).  There's a lot of truth.
Speaker 1: So who were you looking to?
Speaker 2: Well, looking to--I, I looked at some of the captains that they had with me that knew their stuff, all the captains, some of the captains knew--
Speaker 1: Who were they?  Do have any names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you have Captain Cable [ph.], you have gosh Captain Melon [ph.], Captain Taylor [ph.].  You have several you know all of the, like I said all of the captains that were there they knew what they were doing and and because you had to.  Actually coming up the bay, the Delaware Bay on, on some old ships generally, the captain was the pilot because he had federal pilot's licenses and that's another reason why I went to--came here to the Maryland because you know if I even if I become captain with Sun Oil [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.] I would have had to have gotten my Delaware pilot's license to--had just a federal license and not the state license.  But I said well if I'm gonna do the piloting you know you might as well get paid for it so.  So that's one of the reasons why I came here to Maryland too (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long were you with Sun Oil Company [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Seven years (unclear).
Speaker 1: What are some of the enduring memories of sights, smells and sounds with that company?
Speaker 2: Actually one of, one of--that was one of my best ships that I was on the America Sun [S.S. America Sun] which was about seven hundred ninety feet tanker, only held about six hundred thousand barrels crude [oil].  We went down to Venezuela and we had a shuttle between Yabucoa, Puerto Rico and Maracaibo, Venezuela and I was third mate at the time and we had a guy named Peacock [ph.] he was the second mate at the time so we had made a bargain that I would take his watch in Yabucoa and he would take my watch in Maracaibo and we were there for like four months going back and forth, back and forth every five days.
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: This is in '75 [1975] yeah.  And--'70 [1970] yeah, no I'm sorry, I'm sorry, can't be in '75 [1975] that must have been in '73 [1973] because I was not married at the time '73 [1973] and I said I'll go ashore in Maracaibo, take the launch over and go up to the Hotel Del Lago [Maracaibo, Venezuela] right on the cliff and overlooking the Lake Maracaibo and they would have this gaita band playing and it's just great just being out there being normal and I met a guy name Hugo Alberato [ph.] and he asked me to sit with he and his girlfriend and his girlfriend's mother.  We were there listening to the gaita bands and we were talking, mixed Spanish and English and his girlfriend piped up said, "I want to, to," did I know Cat Stevens and I said, "Yeah, yeah," and he said, she said, "'Father and Son,' do you know that song?"  I said, "Yeah."  I said, "I like that song."  He said, "Well sing it for us."  (Laughter) So when the gaita band finished playing I stood up at the table and sang that song of course without any music anything.  They said, "Oh great, great."  So after that when we'd come back I would meet Hugo there or elsewhere with or without his girlfriend and we would sing and this is during the disco so we'd do that too but that was a great thing.  It really funny times there too.
Story_ID: 552011
Speaker 1: What about the role of women?  This is the late '70s [1970s] mid to late '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --women's rights movement, the feminist movement is picking up momentum?  What about your field?
Speaker 2: We did have women aboard ships.  And matter of fact the--one of our--I remember I was with the chief mates and he was a very gruff one and but we got women aboard the ship to clean up the ship for shipyard one summer and it's like he would yell at one of the guys and then he turned to the girl, "Now you do it this way," oh it's amazing but and but most of the women onboard ship, they wanna be treated just like any other--
Speaker 1: Where did they get their training?
Speaker 2: Well those particular ones they were just like ordinary seamen so they really didn't need a license or anything.  They just joined the ship, hired for the ship to work.  Although we did have one third mate, I was chief mate at the time, we had a third mate Wendy Maddox [ph.] and she had come on board.  As a matter--she would come to me with all of her problems and so I'd have to tell her this, tell her that.  You know I said, "Well now this captain you have to watch out he may you know he--you know you third mate you know.  Being his secretary is not your job description.  But he's gonna make it your job description."  I said, "I wouldn't allow--I wouldn't do that."  But she allowed that to happen to her anyway.  But she had other problems with--she was of course ship board romance with--she liked the, the other third mate's helmsman, his quartermaster and the other third mate liked her so it was a triangle.  So when you saw one you saw three all three of them.  I mean but you know, you know that happens aboard ship but as far as the pilots are concerned you know mostly--all of the women that come to the pilots are, are generally academy graduates or, or in New York Maritime [State University of New York Maritime College, Throggs Neck, New York] graduates you know there are different maritime schools out there.
Speaker 1: Now the Merchant Marines [U.S. Merchant Marine] may have been the first academy to admit women?  But you know it took a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it took a while. I think the first women went to the Merchant Marine Academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York].  I had graduated, about '74 [1974] I think, I think yeah.
Speaker 1: From listening to the stories I guess told by colleagues, was there resistance?  Was this revolutionary?
Speaker 2: I don't--to me I don't believe so.  It's you know it was inevitable you know, you know you have women's rights and the law before women's rights yeah I think a woman should make just as much as a man if he does the same job you know why not?  The job, because that's the job description, not the person that you put in there.
Story_ID: 552012
Speaker 1: What did you do after you left Sun Oil [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: When I left Sun Oil I, I came here to the pilots like I said became an apprentice pilot and that year when I, after that year, I got my my license, state license and everything becoming the first black state license pilot here in the U.S. but the the Delaware pilots wanted me to talk to someone about me coming up there.  So I called up to Kings Point [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings, Point, New York] to ask them to let me sit down with some of your students.  So I did.  I made that--to do that and I think I met with four students for about thirty minutes but still they got the idea and one of them was a female, black female and she, and she asked me about blacks being--well not blacks but females being--become pilots and I thought I said, I said in '79 [1979] I became first black here.  I don't think it's gonna be until after the turn of the century before any women are allowed in but I was wrong which is good I mean.
Speaker 1: When did that happen?
Speaker 2: That happened with Nancy Walker [ph.] out in San Francisco [California] and I think that was, she was accepted out there in 19--probably 1990 at eleven years later yeah.  And then we got our first female here I guess in '92 [1992], something like that.
Story_ID: 552013
Speaker 1: So were you conscious of I guess the political shifts in the world at that time, presidential shifts from you mentioned earlier '60s [1960s] with Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] and then on to Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] you know, were you conscious of the political atmosphere at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was especially with the hostage situation under Carter and you know 'cause I, I do believe that there is a--the embassies all over the world are a part of our soil, it's part of the U.S. and whatever embassy that's over here is part of theirs and it should not be invaded you know.
Speaker 1: Were you still part of the [U.S.] Navy Reserve as we move into the '80s [1980s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well no not at that time.  After two and a half years in the Navy Reserve they wrote me a letter saying do I wanna be Lieutenant JG [junior grade] or honorable discharge.  So I wrote them back I want to be Lieutenant JG and they sent me my honorable discharge and all of the papers that I've ever had with them.  So I said okay.  I'm still in the [U.S.] Merchant Marine you know (unclear).
Story_ID: 552014
Speaker 1: So in the '80s [1980s] tell me about your political--your professional sojourn.
Speaker 2: Well as, as I'm going up, I had three years of to be a junior pilot or they call it they just--not just renamed it, but you say junior pilot is, is not say unlimited license pilot now is because each license you get for every year, you get licensed up to twenty-four foot in draft and like six hundred foot in length the ships and then it goes up and up and up until you're unlimited.  And so when I became in '83 [1983] I became an unlimited pilot, a senior pilot and with all of the things that went along with it, the, the money you get because when you as a pilot you have to pay into the association because we own property, we own boats, we own all of this.  It's almost like a lawyer, a lawyer have to buy into the law firm because of the payments that have to be done and.
Speaker 1: So what kind of work, were you working for a particular company at this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no as you, you belong to the Association of Maryland Pilots, it's an association.
Speaker 1: So how do you get deployed or dispatched?
Speaker 2: Well we have a dispatching system that when you're, when the ships are coming in, going out they're on the list and depending on what time, where it is and things like that, how large it is or small, it doesn't matter if you're a senior pilot.  So you take any ship in and out.  I've taken cargo ships, container ships, auto carriers, naval vessels including submarines up the bay [Chesapeake Bay].  I've had the largest ship that's ever come up the bay that was the Brooklyn, S.S. Brooklyn [ph.].
Speaker 1: Do you remember one of those trips?
Speaker 2: Well that trip in particular I remember because I was a junior pilot at the time and or a limited license pilot, and my license you know, my I had twenty--twenty-eight foot license whatever so therefore I could take anything under twenty-eight foot and but the length was only seven hundred fifty feet.  This ship was over twelve hundred feet (laughter) but we had two pilots.  We had one pilot Captain Ernest [ph.] he had climbed onboard and climbing onboard entailed the ship was drawing twenty-five feet from the keel, which is the bottom of the ship to the deck which is the top of the ship until you go up to the superstructure of the, ship was ninety-five feet so twenty-five feet underwater so that's seventy feet.  Well that's a seven story building that you're climbing up the side of at night.  So the climbing up the side of that was something else.
Speaker 1: With the ocean down below?
Speaker 2: Yeah and the water there--actually the launch was down below that I stepped off of to climb onto the ladder and I'm waving to him to get away from the ship so I can, if I fall I wanna fall in the water, not on the launch.  So but we did, I got on it and brought it up the bay and anchored it in Annapolis [Maryland] and Captain Ernest said, "I'm not gonna be climbing down this.  Call for a helicopter."  A helicopter came out from BWI [Baltimore-Washington International Airport; Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Baltimore, Maryland], picked us up and took us there.  My first helicopter ride.
Speaker 1: Oh wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 552015
Speaker 1: Was race a factor ever again onboard these ships?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the funny thing about it the race was only factor with American captains.  All the other captains accepted me no problem.  Matter of fact I had the best rapport with the the foreign captains.
Speaker 1: Foreign captains like whom?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean it's the Greek captains, the, you know any, all (laughter) any and all.
Speaker 1: So Greek, Spanish, Italian?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Chinese yeah.  Whatever nationality that came aboard.  Now I tried to speak--matter of fact I, I, I had a list of different words for me to guide the ship up the bay [Chesapeake Bay] in in Danish, in Chinese, in Korean and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of them?
Speaker 2: Greek, let me see here I'm trying to put everything in perspective here, putting me on the spot here.  Let me see (speaking Greek) or (speaking French), "Merci" or things like that.  They're different--these are different languages that I'm speaking here.  You got (speaking Japanese) is twenty in Japanese things like that.  You, you just you know the numbers and the courses that you want to to speak out.
Speaker 1: So you might have a crew that's speaking an entirely different language?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean I've had one ship that I, I was speaking to the crew to the helmsman because you generally, you you speak to the helmsman but in, in actuality you're speaking to the mate that's on watch and he, and he relates that to the helmsman but to get the order done expediently, we just speak to the helmsman even though it's going through, through the chief mate or whatever mate is on watch or the captain to him and he just executes.  And I was giving the orders and they said that I guess it was in German or whatever and then they change helmsman.  And so I said, "Do you speak German?"  He says no he's Spanish, gave it to him in Spanish.  And then next watch came because it takes about eight to twelve hours to get up the bay on these ships so you have change of watches and changes of helmsmen and some of the ships are so--had many nationalities on them, you don't know crews piloting, so just speak English. It's just like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So is there a character that stands out?
Speaker 2: Well I had one Japanese ship and I'm speaking--no it was Chinese actually and I'm speaking in Chinese or trying to and the, and the mate says, "Mr. Pilot," he says, "please speak English."  And I said, "Oh, my Chinese not too--?" He said, "Oh it's okay, but we're trying to learn English."  I said oh, okay.  So we'll do it that way.  So you just go on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Interesting.
Story_ID: 552016
Speaker 1: Now where are you living at this time, '80s [1980s] moving into the '90s [1990s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah '80s [1980s] I was still with my my first wife.  I was living in Reisterstown, Maryland.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is that community like in the '80s [1980s]?  Was it predominantly white?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how were you received in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah they, they all, all the kids loved to come to my house because I had a big backyard.  But then all the houses around there had backyards you know three acres to six acres or whatever.  But they used to play with my boys [Christopher Bailey, Jason Bailey and Jarrett Bailey] and and they know that a lot of times I would be home because I'd worked two or three days and then I'm off two or three day when I was working as a pilot.  And so they, they would come over to the house.  But they know that I didn't take any stuff off their kids you know, you know.  You will do what I tell you.  I don't--no, there's nothing, you're a kid, I'm an adult you'll do what I say and so the parents of the other, would send their kids over to my house knowing that they were gonna get disciplined you know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause this is after integration?  This is when a lot of people are moving to the suburbs, but very few African Americans living in some of these more prominent suburbs, were the kids facing any conflicts at school?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  They fit in pretty well, they fit in pretty well.  The school, the--out in that area was about half and half you know because you had a lot of kids came from Owings Mills [Maryland] and Reisterstown together.  But like I said in in my neighborhood you know our cars were unlocked.  You know I always left my my garage door was unlocked.  If my neighbors needed a tool or something they could come over open the door and get it.  Same thing for the other neighbors.
Speaker 1: Were you active in the community in clubs and organizations or politics?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Although we did have a a community pool that everyone worked, about twice a year we'd have a picnic or something there at the pool, one in the fall, one in the spring and things like that.
Speaker 1: Were you affiliated with any of the local universities at all giving lectures?
Speaker 2: Not really giving lectures.  I would always put myself out to, to talk if somebody wanted me to talk to the kids in school.  Also I would talk to some of the Neptune Yacht Club, the, you know, the black yacht clubs around here and open their season and things like that I'd give a talk.
Story_ID: 552017
Speaker 1: Did you return to your old neighborhood in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?  I mean you're not too far Reisterstown [Maryland], not too far from D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well I had gone back down to Cardozo [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and tried to fit in with one of their assemblies and everything but for reason Cardozo is totally a different school now.  I mean it's it was pretty much, it was rough back then too, but it's it was even rougher now so.  So I, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you see some the changes in that neighborhood, well not only in that neighborhood but in D.C. over the course of those three decades or so with [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry and [HistoryMaker] Sharon Pratt taking office?
Speaker 2: Well I think that you had what is, I see in those neighborhoods throughout that northwest corridor you have many Hispanic in that neighborhood now and it it seemed to me that when you could get out of Washington, D.C. you did and then you see and I see I saw a lot of re-gentrification down and around Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] and all of that.  But it was something to see that, knowing these houses that we lived in that were you know maybe going for twelve, fifteen thousand dollars selling for five hundred thousand dollars that's amazing you know.  I couldn't believe it.  Now even when I graduated from the academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] I used to live just outside D.C. when I first started working with Sun Oil [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.], I had gone to Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] because I liked the area when I went there during my high school years and I was gonna buy, I wanted to buy a house and I went I guess I was wearing the wrong thing when I went into this real estate office there in Georgetown but it had a cutoff sweatshirt Kings Point sweatshirt and had window pane jeans, bellbottom jeans and (unclear) on and my hair was down to my shoulders and--
Speaker 1: This was around what year?
Speaker 2: This was in '72 [1972], '73 [1973] yeah and I said you know looking for a home here in the area and so the person looked at me thought said, "Well maybe there's something up the street that may be in your price range."  I said, "No," he said the price--the homes here in Georgetown are about two hundred fifty [$250,000], two hundred seventy-five [$275,000].  I said, "That should be no problem.  Just give me a call when you think you can show me something."  And never did call so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow.  But and of course you could afford it but you were surprised to see that the prices had gone so high?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and now those ones in Georgetown are a million dollars.  Wished I had bought a few of them then.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But how long did you stay in Reisterstown then?
Speaker 2: We were in Reisterstown for I guess about nine years I stayed and then my wife and I split.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in '95 [1995], yeah.
Speaker 1: And are you still piloting ships--
Speaker 2: Yes, still--
Speaker 1: --along the bay [Chesapeake Bay]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 552018
Speaker 1: Any highlights in that period in the early '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: No, just--the highlights one of my favorite stories is is sailing the, the motor vessel Proof of Gallon [ph.] which was a spirits carrier.  It carried scotches and bourbons whatever and small ship under two hundred feet long and I went to the ship and the--and I saw there were no tugboats around.  I said so I asked the captain, I said, "Captain are you gonna undock it?"  He said, "No you undock it."  So I looked around and said okay well the wind was blowing off the dock so I said captain, I said, "You have to pay extra for me to undock."  He said, "Okay you undock."  I said, "Okay."  So I put out a security call and said, "We're ready to undock here," and so I asked the captain one more time I said, "You know you're gonna pay for this?  You sure you don't want to undock?"  He said, "No you, you undock."  "Okay."  I said, "Let go all lines."  So he let go all the lines and the lines were coming in the wind blew us off the dock about fifty feet.  I said, "Pull ahead," (laughter).  I said this was the most easiest undocking I've ever done you know.  Okay.  So they paid for it so.  Okay I started not to charge him but I said no this is what what you have to do.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: But then again you have other things that are much harder to have a nine hundred eighty foot ship and the captain turn to me and says, "Captain can you un- can you dock it?" When he tried, he was gonna try to dock it but the fog shut in and you know we're pretty close to the dock this time and I said we did and I turned the ship around to go along side and he and then the fog lifted just when we were about twenty feet off dock.  He says, "Well I got you now," but I said, "You're still gonna have to pay me for what I did so."  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's exciting stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah sometimes it is exciting but sometimes it's a little hair raising.  Had the Hyundai New World, a brand new ship on its maiden voyage and it was a coal ship (unclear) thirty-six feet I was taking it out and I just happened to leave my handheld radio in the office.  I said well they got radios on the ship.  But it was a brand new ship and they didn't have time, they didn't really charge the batteries for the backup and everything like that so, no communication.  The ship everything stopped, blacked out and so we were in the main channel and the tugboats had left and so I went out there trying to flag them down to come back because there was only one other ship on the anchorage.  And there's five anchorage sitting in Baltimore [Maryland], one ship on an anchorage and of course we're heading towards that ship.  So I dropped the anchor at short stay and you know try to hold on with anchor and it's still going, still going so I dropped the other anchor and finally we stopped about seventy-five feet off the other ship and so.
Speaker 1: Close call.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the engineers got the steam back up or the engines running, pulled up the anchors and the tugboat pushed us back into the channel and we went down the bay [Chesapeake Bay] and I got off at the mid bay station.  We had mid bay station at this time, so in Solomons Island [Solomons, Maryland] so I got off there and Captain Hope [ph.] had come on.  He was Kings Point [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] graduate also.  He took the ship the rest of the way down the bay without incident but then he read when that ship was going into Brazil I believe it ran aground and broke in two.  Lost the cargo, lost the ship too, brand new ship.  Same thing happened everything went out.
Speaker 1: Millions of dollars.
Speaker 2: That can happen (laughter).
Speaker 1: Unbelievable.
Story_ID: 552019
Speaker 1: Now were you still--while you were a student you were also a singer, a musician?  So along the course of your career were you also keeping up with your musical talents?
Speaker 2: Well I wouldn't say I'm a musician (laughter), although I, I like to sing.  Matter of fact they called me the singing pilot here on the Chesapeake [Chesapeake Bay] and you got people hear me because I you know going down the bay like I say it's eight to twelve hours so you have to amuse yourself you know.  You can't just sit there and sit in the chair and say give me another cup of coffee you know.  "Okay starboard ten okay mid ship steady," you can't do that for twelve hours so you know I'd have a small radio or the ship may have a radio and I said, "Play some music," and they play a song that I like and I would just sing along with it you know.  And I'd tell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of music?
Speaker 2: --the mate, "You wanna sing along, you can sing along too."
Speaker 1: Well what kind of music, can you give us an example?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well the music can, can go anywhere from Led Zeppelin to Johnny Mathis and it's--and of course I still think Johnny Mathis is the best singer in the world.  Oh yeah.  But yeah I love music.  Without music I think what good is life?
Story_ID: 552020
Speaker 1: So you were talking about music and your love of singing.  Who were some of your influences?
Speaker 2: Johnny Mathis (laughter).  Yeah, yeah.  I like, I like singers that can pull up a chair and just entertain you with their voice.  Sam Cooke was one and I used to love music because when back when I was a kid actually in I guess '59 [1958], '58 [1958] I used to sell glossies there at the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.] with a Mr. Gaffney [ph.].  Glossies are pictures of the acts that are there and I got to see a lot of the, you know, the James Brown revues and [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, The Coasters, The Moonglows you know.  People that and also my, my brother-in-law my--Earline's [Earline Bailey] husband used to fill in for the some of the guys if they were missing a guy you know with The Moonglows or, or The Clovers, he would fill in for them.
Speaker 1: Did you get to do any performing outside of the Merchant Marine Academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, not I mean other than you know doing karaoke and stuff and like I seen at the Hotel Del Lago [Maracaibo, Venezuela] but professionally no.  I might--I guess my biggest thing was singing at the, what is it the benefit there in New York City [New York, New York] at the Madison Square Garden, we sang there.  Mickey Rooney introduced us and of that so.  It was, it was nice.
Speaker 1: When was this?
Speaker 2: This is back in maybe '71 [1971], '70 [1970], '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: And aboard the ship who listens to you when you were singing aboard the ship?
Speaker 2: The, the quartermaster, the captain who was up there, whoever is up there on the bridge you know.  'Cause I'd be singing on, on the ship there.  I guess it stems from when I was with Sun Oil Company [Sun Oil Company, Inc.; Sunoco, Inc.] because Sun Oil we, at that time a radio was not allowed on, on the bridge, radio for music that is.  And I didn't need it because I knew most of the lyrics and just sang when I felt like singing and had this one quartermaster that he, he liked to sing too.  So he used to sing in a country western band.  Well I wasn't that keen on country western sung on my bridge so I told him he'd have to go out on the wing of the bridge to sing.  But he said that's unfair so I challenged him to a sing off and said that, "I know more country western songs than you do."  And I proved it.  And so.
Speaker 1: Well what did you sing?
Speaker 2: Well see the thing about it back in 1963 [sic. 1962] Ray Charles came out with an album called 'Modern Sounds in Country Western Music' [sic. 'Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music'] and I know every song on the album so it was a no brainer for me.
Speaker 1: Are you a tenor?
Speaker 2: I've sang first tenor, second tenor, baritone and bass.
Speaker 1: Can you give us a bar or so of Ray Charles or Johnny Mathis?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Let me see Johnny Mathis, (singing) "Arianne's an April morning that come slipping through my window, she's a smell of coffee brewing on a quiet rainy Sunday and the purring of a kitten that has made my neck a pillow for its bed." How is that?
Speaker 1: Lovely.
Speaker 2: That's "Arianne," that's one of my favorite by him.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that helped you as you traveled up and down the bay [Chesapeake Bay]?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  I mean it you know it, it keeps you awake and cause see like I say it's a long bay I mean we've had that's why we have a mid bay station now down in Solomons Island [Solomons, Maryland] so the, the pilot can get relief if he needs to because it takes anywhere like I said from eight to sixteen hours to get up the bay depending on the speed of the ship.  It's one hundred fifty-one miles.  It's the longest pilotage for one pilot in the U.S. so.

Speaker 1: Are you still traveling or have you retired?
Speaker 2: I did retire last year in August of last year so I said well 'cause my wife, she had retired and she was a flight attendant with United Airlines and she retired several years ago and so she said it would be great you know if I were so we could do other things and that's when we you know got together on that to say okay.  Why not.
Speaker 1: When you mentioned your wife, when did you guys get married?
Speaker 2: We got married in 19--2000 actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your second wife?
Speaker 2: The second wife in 2000.
Speaker 1: And what's her full name?
Speaker 2: Tamara Allenette Durant-Bailey [Tamara Durant-Bailey].
Speaker 1: Okay can you spell her name for us?
Speaker 2: T-A-M-A-R-A, Allenette, A-L-L-E-N-E-T-T-E, Durant, D-U-R-A-N-T hyphen Bailey, B-A-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And where did you two meet?
Speaker 2: We met several years ago at a friend's birthday party and then when she found out that I was getting divorced and available, she said well you know I'll show my face there.  So.  I said okay.
Speaker 1: And you got married in 2000?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the two of you are planning lots of trips then--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --as a retired couple?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Especially since she's like say United Airlines and we can fly almost free (laughter) anywhere in the world.
Speaker 1: So you can go by air or by sea?
Speaker 2: Um-hm by air.
Story_ID: 552022
Speaker 1: Now I know that you've been honored with a couple, in a couple of different ways, tell me about a couple of those big things that are happening in your name?
Speaker 2: Well we started the Captain Avis T. Bailey Mariners' Foundation and what we wanna do is give the youth here some insight on the maritime field.  But we it's a non-profit organization through the Associated Black Charities [Associated Black Charities, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland] here and we, right now we're sponsoring kids at St. Ignatius Academy [St. Ignatius Loyola Academy, Baltimore, Maryland].  They're youth that are underprivileged youth in the city here that attend St. Ignatius.  And they're very unbelievable, bright kids.  And we also have them come down and take trips out on the tugboats and to the ships to see firsthand.  Anyway that Captain Avis T. Bailey Mariners' Foundation put a portrait of myself at the Douglass Myers museum [Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park] here in Baltimore [Maryland] along with a layout of the ship's bridge with streaming information coming out above you about ships that are coming and entering coming and going from the port in Baltimore and what goods they're carrying and all that so the kids can know about it you know.  Like the hands on thing.  But also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How does that feel for you?
Speaker 2: I feel privileged, humbled at the same time.  Just to think that anyone would think of me and to honor me in that way also they they had also talked with the Great Blacks in Wax Museum [National Great Blacks in Wax Museum, Baltimore, Maryland] here and we're, we're thinking about having a wing when they get all of the housing together and fix everything up that we'll be in that also.  So I mean a lot of people just like I, I told my son, you know 'cause I wanted them to to go in my footsteps but of course they didn't but like I said I can do something for you if you you know if you can--
Speaker 1: Follow.
Speaker 2: --follow yeah.  I said most people don't know me from Adam you know they don't know but in the [U.S.] Merchant Marine and that's worldwide, they know me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They know you.
Speaker 2: If only as a singing pilot (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's a pretty great legacy in and of itself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah sure.
Story_ID: 552023
Speaker 1: Is it therefore important for you to have this nonprofit [Captain Avis T. Bailey Mariners' Foundation] now introducing the things you love to younger kids?
Speaker 2: Yeah it is.  And I just hope--because like well I love the pilots here.  There're not--there're no black pilots here in Maryland.  We may have thirteen throughout the United States that are senior pilots maybe a few more I think there are some that are in the pipeline to become pilots but it's, it's few and far between because just like at Kings Point [New York] at the Merchant Marine Academy [United States Merchant Marine Academy], most blacks when they go there, they--nautical science is, is well maybe teach you become maybe an administrator or something like that but engineering you'll always get a job.  You'll always have a job somewhere so they, they gravitate to the engineering aspect of it.  But as an engineer, you're not a pilot you know you won't become a pilot.  So.
Speaker 1: So it feels rewarding for you to give back to the kids and open their eyes?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely.  I mean without I think education 'cause you only or it's not the only, but it's the biggest thing that you can give our black kids to face you know the United States you know, there, here and the world because it's you know you must communicate.  You have to speak well.  You have to everything that you need to do you have be educated to do you know.  Hopefully, you'll be able to take it upon yourself to learn it just because you want you know you want to know.  And and in that knowing it adds to your makeup to which adds to what you can take to the world and get from the world.
Story_ID: 552024
Speaker 1: What would you say as you look back now?  What are the biggest turning points in your life?
Speaker 2: Well I think the biggest turning point was when I went back to school and back to Kings Point [United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York] because without my going back there I would never have been in this situation I was in.  I mean sure I I think I would have you know succeeded in other fields or whatever but I think the field that I chose and because I, I really loved going to sea and I loved as a pilot bringing ships up and down the bay[Chesapeake Bay] trying to speak the language, trying to get to know the people that are coming up because I used to take the captains and, and the chief mates off the ship after they--after we dock and we'd go out and, and show them a bit of the Baltimore [Maryland] because I--
Speaker 1: Where would you take them?
Speaker 2: Well, some wanted to go to bars of course and things like that but I would take them downtown to see the harbor and things like that.  I would come back to the ship with my car and take them actually yeah.  And and we had Baltimore magazine come and I would cut out places to eat, places to go and would hand it to the ships too, when they come out.
Speaker 1: Very nice.  So that was real important for you to go back to the academy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It changed your life?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah it did, it did.  I mean it was not all good there but you know as we say at the academy, it's a good place to be from (laughter).
Speaker 1: Very nice.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact I think it's, it's the and not only the Merchant Marine Academy, I would recommend any of the other academies too.  It's a free education and they're all topnotch schools yeah.
Story_ID: 552025
Speaker 1: Were there external events that you could name that really affected you as well?  You mentioned the Vietnam War, you mentioned the hostage crisis with Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], perhaps 9/11 [September 11, 2001], which sort of external international events had a strong impact on your life?
Speaker 2: Well actually you say strong impact on my life, the as far as one of the strongest would be I guess the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] because you know it's just like we all think in the back of our minds it's just like Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] being you know if he's elected president, how long will he be president?  It's always that and that's here in America.  And still that way and that's crazy, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be. This is 2007 but it's still there.
Story_ID: 552026
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well if I can you know be an influence on one kid at St. Ignatius [St. Ignatius Loyola Academy, Baltimore, Maryland] or wherever, I don't know I may, I may have been actually I have influenced one kid, I thought, when I encouraged him to go into the to apply to become a, a Delaware pilot and he did and he was accepted and he got into it.  But after I think two years or three years he decided that was not for him so he stopped, but just to have that influence to have him do that because I told him you know what to do and he did it and he had was a graduate of--because I saw him when he was an undergraduate at, at SUNY Maritime that state university in New York at Maritime [State University of New York Maritime College] at Fort Schuyler [Throggs Neck, New York] he was an undergraduate then I saw him later as a graduate and he was wondering what he should do and I said this is what you should do and he did it and then decided he didn't like it so.  What can I say?
Speaker 1: Would you like Americans to remember you as the first African American ship pilot?
Speaker 2: Ship's pilot? They can if, if that's what they want to do.  However, like you keep asking about what are my role models.  If I was one to some of these kids that are out of St. Ignatius, that's all I need you know.  Just like when I do something for someone, if I do it for them, the only thing that's required is a thanks that's it, nothing else, so.
Story_ID: 552027
Speaker 1: Do you have a message for kids or anyone who might watch your interview, words of wisdom?
Speaker 2: Well, words of wisdom would be, be your own person you know that, that they lead.  They be the leader.  My coming up you know I wanted to put my ideas forth to to and which I think my ideas were not bad, were only for the good it's just like the, the different clubs that I'm in you know Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] or the Masons, the reasons why you want to be in the leadership is so that you can direct them in a certain way and the best way to do that is to be in leadership and you know not to be the follower.
Story_ID: 552028
Speaker 1: So you are in clubs, Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] and--
Speaker 2: No Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Oh you're like get it right. Phi Beta Sigma and the Masons?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Also have my card, my NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] card, I'm with the American Pilots' Association with that, with the Master, Mates and Pilots [International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots].
Speaker 1: So what about the Masons, when did you join?
Speaker 2: I joined the Masons I guess about '88 [1988], 1988.
Speaker 1: Has that been strong influence in your life?
Speaker 2: It was, it was good and the thing about it like I said I, I like groups and these groups are service groups.  You were here to serve because we've got our--well I'll put it this way, I've got what I need so I can give back and the way to give back is through these organizations
Speaker 1: NAACP when did you join?
Speaker 2: I've only been with them for maybe three years.  I decided I needed to do that.
Speaker 1: To be involved in the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To be involved in at least give my money to that so.
Speaker 1: And the pilots?
Speaker 2: And the pilots you join that as, as being a Maryland pilot you almost automatically you're included in these associations the American Pilots' Association and then the Master, Mates and Pilots (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Phi Beta Sigma?
Speaker 2: Phi Beta Sigma I joined them in 1980 and I joined them because they were the ones that were doing something with kids you know and like I said you know through education kids you have to get them to continue on.  The only--our only hope is through education.
Story_ID: 552029
Speaker 1: What's next for you?
Speaker 2: Well, well I'm retired now.  Like I said my wife [Tamara Durant-Bailey]--they're widening the canal down in Panama [Panama Canal] so she thinks I should go down there and give them a pointer here and there but I don't know whether or not I'll be doing that but we're gonna have a place there, but working with the Captain Avis T. Bailey Mariners' Foundation, I'll be doing that.  I'll also be you know on hand for anyone who wants to me to speak to their kids or what have you.
Speaker 1: A life so far well lived?
Speaker 2: For me yes, yes.  It could have been worse (laughter).
Speaker 1: Captain Bailey [HistoryMaker Captain Avis T. Bailey], thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 552030
Speaker 1: Well this is a picture of myself as a cadet [at the United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York].  I think this was taken maybe my fourth class year for the year book I believe
Speaker 2: Around what year?
Speaker 1: From '72 [1972]], 1972.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my mother.  This is when she was younger probably just had me or something probably I guess about 1950 or so, Dorothy Bailey, Dorothy Heavlow Bailey.
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of my wife Tamara [Tamara Durant-Bailey] and myself of course when I used to wear a mustache.   And this is the captain of the Guayas [BAE Guayas] which is a tall ship.  It was a naval vessel for Ecuador for, naval training vessel for Ecuador and the captain had the ship up the bay and he invited my wife and I to their reception and there we are.  And later on we did go up to New York [New York] to meet him again, had a reception up in New York.  This was around July 4, it's about 2000.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of myself piloting the ship going down the bay.  Actually that little island there you see out of the window is the third island of the bridge tunnel that connects the Delmarva Peninsula to the mainland down in Virginia, entrance to the Chesapeake [Chesapeake Bay].
Speaker 1: This is the type of set up that they're gonna put over at the Myers-Douglass-Myers museum [Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay, and again what year is this?
Speaker 1: That was approximately 2000 yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This picture was taken by Michael Fincham [Michael W. Fincham] for this particular periodical they were talking about at the Chesapeake Bay here and this is the Chesapeake Quarterly magazine that came, comes out and featured myself and our first woman pilot Alison, Alison Ross [Alison Ross Schulte].
