Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what she said.  They couldn't--she didn't want me to have a nickname.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They, they--well, it's--I think it's been observed by a lot of black people that if a black person is named William, for instance, they usually call themselves William.  And they don't shorten it to Bill or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, a Robert is a Robert, not a Bob necessarily and--
Speaker 2: And then, that's why she named me Jerry, so it was already shortened, yeah, Gerald or something (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: Right.

Story_ID: 395151
Speaker 1: So, that completes the slating of this.  And so, now we, I have to ask you five lightweight questions as a warm-up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 1: And they're, you know, I'm always compelled to ask these by management, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite vegetable is cabbage.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And probably beef or steak.
Speaker 1: All right.  And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, not a favorite.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Probably my wife [Pamella Jones Williams] will say--not that I know of (laughter), not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 395152
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family, and your father's [James O. Williams] side, but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her full name, Margaret Nora Williams [Margaret Stone Williams].  You want her maiden name?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Margaret Nora Stone.  M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, N-O-R-A, and then--
Speaker 1: Williams, the same way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Williams or, and the Stone, S-T-O-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was August 25th, 1912 in Gainesboro, Tennessee, G-A-I-N-E-S-B-O-R-O, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  First of all, how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I can only, I can trace it back to, I can trace it back to her grandmother on her father's [Thomas Stone] side, and her grandfather on her mother's [Nora Stone] side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that takes us back to the 19th century, I guess, the mid-19th century, right, I suppose?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were either one of those grandparents of hers born in slavery?
Speaker 2: Let's see (pause)--no, I don't think so, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because, well, the grandfather on her mother's side was white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The rest of them were all black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, would, okay, but the--
Speaker 2: And, and, and they were not, they, they were not born in slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were free people in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: In Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, are there any stories that come down from those days about Reconstruction, or what life was like after the Civil War?
Speaker 2: The only, the only story that she told me about that was interesting to me at the time was when they moved, when she and the family, her father and mother, moved from Gainesboro, Tennessee to Indianapolis [Indiana].  They came by horse and buggy.  That, that was surprising to me 'cause (laughter), you know, but they--all the way from Gainesboro (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, this would be have to be in the--
Speaker 2: This would have to be in the--I think it was when they, she was about five or six.  This was like, the teens, 1918--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --maybe 1920, 1918, 1920, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 1917, 1918, yeah.  There's a lot of people still got around by horse and buggy then, yeah.
Speaker 2: By horse and buggy.  So, they came all the way from Tennessee in horse and buggy with the family.
Speaker 1: All their furniture and everything, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they didn't have a lot of furniture (laughter), she said.  But they, those are family, and the few things that they owned, they had.
Speaker 1: But--is there a story as to why they moved from Tennessee to Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: I--no, I don't remember the story, but I think that her father's side of the family had some connections--I believe, some relatives, and that's why he wanted to come to Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: Did the relatives have good jobs in Indianapolis?  Is that the motivation?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't remember.
Story_ID: 395153
Speaker 1: What did your [maternal] grandfather [Thomas Stone] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was--I don't know if you remember, back in the old days, you know, when they used to till the soil for gardens or farms or things, he had horses.  And he used to do tilling for gardens and farms.  He also used the horses to trough to do handiwork, handyman work.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, he did gardening and handiwork and--
Speaker 2: Tilling, whatever--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --especially with horses or--
Speaker 1: He was self-employed?
Speaker 2: Self-employed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 395154
Speaker 1: Are there any, any stories about life in Indianapolis [Indiana] in the early part of the century that they tell, about what the community was like or what?
Speaker 2: Well, they talked about--well, she talked about the, the difficulties that black folk had.  She, my mother [Margaret Stone Williams], who did not, at first, have a high school education.  She, later on, after my, after the children, went back and got one.  But her mother [Nora Stone] died at an early age and so, her father [Thomas Stone] married again.  And so, she was kind of, like the mother for their children, their, their first set of children.  She was about fourteen, fifteen.  And so, she didn't have a chance to go to school.  And so, she also had to go to work as a domestic.  And so, they would--I don't know if they had, but she, she learned a lot about education, and the value of education from this family, such as when we got, when she had all the children, she instilled in us that she--that education was the way to go.  And even though, there were a lot of racist attitudes and segregation in Indianapolis, she would always tell us that education was a value in itself because it broadened your horizons as to what was going on in the world.  And it was, and not, she never pushed it as a way of getting a job, but she just said that it was valuable in itself.  And she, my mother never talked about limitations or anything.  So, she, she, even if she, she used to always say let every night be a boost.  So, therefore, she wouldn't, she would not let you dwell on a slight or, or a racial situation.  She would say, you just, that should help to make you a better person.  And you're going to push higher and go forth--don't let it stop you.  So, she didn't talk a lot about racial attitudes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have a chance to finish high school when she was in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what she did was, she got married, and she had gone just to the ninth grade.  And then, she went back to night school.  And I have six sisters--the fifth sister, she graduated from school at the same time that, high school at the same time that she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she didn't give up on it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, never, but she used to, she always said she was going to finish and so.
Speaker 1: So, you were indicating that a lot of the education that she received was from people she worked for, and she was able to pick up on things in different perspectives so.
Speaker 2: And she, she was the first--that's when I first found about The Wall Street Journal, the way she saw that from people worked for.  And she had told me that, that's something I need to learn how--I, I need to read because it tells you about what's going on in the business world.  And so, she would bring things back home like that to us.
Speaker 1: So, she had a capacity to read her environment and draw things from the--
Speaker 2: And draw from the environment, to try to improve yourself.  Her whole thing was about improving yourself, making yourself just better--progressing.
Story_ID: 395155
Speaker 1: Now people--a lot of people say--I guess, in terms of racial politics, Indiana is a southern northern state.
Speaker 2: Indiana was--I, I, I could tell you a lot of things about Indiana myself.  But you were asking about my (laughter) mother [Margaret Stone Williams], she didn't pursue it.  You, you know, you lived in certain sections, and you didn't go to certain sections.  And so--well, I first ran into myself, when in, in, in an overt way was when I, at eight years old, because up until then, I--my--I was always in an all-black neighborhood [in Indianapolis, Indiana].  I needed to make money 'cause we had a large family.  And I wanted to make some money, so I decided to try and get a paper route.  And so, I got it from a guy I knew who--it was kind of an integrated neighborhood that he worked in.  But the day they sold it to me, they split up where they were going to send the newspaper guys.  And so, the guy asked me which place was closer to me.  And the two addresses, where they sent all the other black guys, was in the black neighborhood.  I told--he said, I told him, 24th [Street] and Central [Avenue] was closest to me, but it turned out to be an all-white distribution center.  And so, my route was almost all-white crowd.  And that's when I go, the first week when I went to go to collect my, you know, I think it was a quarter or what it was--I, that I got the first time.  Somebody called me a nigger, and they told me to get out of her house.  And so, after that, she would pay me through her front door, and she would just, she wouldn't let me come in.  So, that's when I first experienced it when I was about eight years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did your mother have any--well--
Speaker 2: I--well, I told her about it.  Her, her whole thing was she, she was saying that they were--she called it a lack of education, understand what the world was all about.  But you can't let that stop you from doing your job, and doing it well, and collecting your money, even though she's making it kind of hostile for you to get your money.
Story_ID: 395156
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did your mother [Margaret Stone Williams] read a lot?
Speaker 2: That was the first thing that she taught all of us.  Yes, she read a lot.  And from a very young age, we were, we were very poor, but she--we always, all of us went to the library twice a week, and everybody got books.  And I, as, as early as I can remember reading, I was going to the library, and everybody in the family was.  And she stressed that.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a great regimen--twice a week, everybody would go?
Speaker 2: Everybody went.  And after a while, you know, we just automatically went (laughter).  I mean, we, we, yeah, she, she said that, one, you needed to read that, and the second thing, everybody had to learn music, to play a musical instrument.  Okay.  So, that was, and, and we all did.  And the, and, of course, we all had to do very well in school 'cause she made it very plain to us at a very early age that you all are going to college.  Now, we didn't have any money, but it was an environment.  That's what was fostered--we were all going to college.  And so, when people would say to us, oh, you can't do it, she, she--can't was not in her vocabulary.  It, she always said, where there's a will, there's a way, and so, she would always push us.  And if you say, well, I can't do this, she said, she would just bombard you with, "Did you try this, you try this, you try this?"  So, as a consequence, my wife [Pamella Jones Williams] says, that's what I did with my children (laughter).  You didn't, never, never say you can't.  But can't was not in her vocabulary.
Story_ID: 395157
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is--was James Oliver Williams [James O. Williams].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was September 1st, 1897, and it was a little town outside of Richmond [Virginia] called Lanexa [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: L-E-N-E-X-A, [sic.] Lanexa, Virginia.  It's near--if you ever go on the--get off at the Richmond Airport [Richmond International Airport, Virginia], and you drive down toward, to Williamsburg [Virginia].  About halfway in between, it's a little town called West Point [Virginia], and it's right next to West Point (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Virginia.
Speaker 1: All right.  And well, what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace that group of people?
Speaker 2: I can only go back to his parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: So, your grandparents, and what, did, were they from Lanexa as well?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know because I never saw my--his father.  His father was dead.  And I only met my grandmother [Laura Williams] on his side once before she died.  And I was about eight years old.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go down there to Lanexa (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went to Richmond.
Speaker 1: I mean, to Richmond?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and to Lanexa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went down there only a couple, three times--
Speaker 1: So, you--
Speaker 2: --'cause we were kind of poor.  It was hard for us to get down there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but yeah.
Speaker 1: But you don't have a sense of how, where they were.  They may have always been from around, you know, or had been around there for a long time, I guess but--
Speaker 2: They were from that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Their father, where I spent a lot of time, my, his younger sister [Annie Williams] finally died just a couple, three years ago.  But I used to go visit her every year nearly for a while, and so, she would talk about it.  But she was always either between where she called the country, Lanexa, or Richmond, because she--his, one of his sisters moved to Richmond.  And they finally brought her up there to go to high school and so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was staying, but they were mostly from there.  My father was born there and grew up there.  Now, he travelled a lot 'cause he left home at an early age and moved around, but he would not talk about it.  He ran into some difficulties, but he would not talk a lot about the racism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The only, the only story he ever told me was when he and a guy were in North Carolina when he was young.  And they were trying to get some money for some food, and they stopped at one of the farms to try to get some work.  And the guy put some dogs on them but, but he wouldn't talk about negative side things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did he serve in the war?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't, he didn't serve in the war.  My--I think my father, before, my father was a rascal (laughter).  But he, he, as, as they say, got saved at an age, and his life changed dramatically, and he became a very religious man.  He eventually ended up, becoming a pastor of a church [22nd Street Church of God in Christ, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did, what did his father do for a living?
Speaker 2: I never know what Fletcher [Fletcher Williams] did for a living.  I think most of them just worked in the country there, you know, farming or, or--
Speaker 1: Different labor jobs in the--
Speaker 2: Labor, you know, the migrant worker kind of things, taking crops, or taking care of somebody's family, you know, the typical kind of things.
Story_ID: 395158
Speaker 1: So, you say he [Williams' father, James O. Williams] was kind of a rascal.  Do you have any stories about any of his adventures before he became saved?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My father--my mother [Margaret Stone Williams] was his second wife.  His first wife died, and she's the one that got him saved because she had, she was a rascal herself.  And then she got saved, and she changed so dramatically, she changed him.  But he, he just talked about he used to gamble up.  But one story, he was talking about--one time some of her friends came by the house.  And the ladies had lost--they said, "Geez, what, what happened to our money?"  And he said, "Oh, I don't know."  So, he helped them to, to look for it, but he had taken it (laughter).  That's kind (unclear).  But he was a different guy than when I met him, 'cause he had--by that time he had, has gotten faith in Jesus Christ.  He had become a different kind of a person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what denomination did he join?
Speaker 2: He, he was Pentecostal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that explains the saved part--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --that you believe that you should be, yeah,
Speaker 2: Saved (unclear).
Speaker 1: And did he, did he become saved in, in Virginia or in--
Speaker 2: No, in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Pennsylvania, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he eventually, when he was married the first time, he was in Pennsylvania.  And he got saved in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I think it was.
Speaker 1: That's the home of Father Divine [Reverend Major Jealous Divine] in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Father Divine, uh--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he wasn't part of Father Divine's group (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, he was part of the, the Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 395159
Speaker 1: What brought him [Williams' father, James O. Williams] to Indianapolis [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: His wife, his first wife who died was from Gary [Indiana].  And after she had died, after she'd been dead--I've forgotten, a year or two, he came to Gary to visit her parents.  Then he was on his way back to Richmond [Virginia] to visit his family, and he stopped off in, in Indianapolis.  And we always used to laugh, 'cause he didn't get to Richmond until ten years later, 'cause he met my mother [Margaret Stone Williams] and got a job there and dated her, and then they got married and had some children.  Then, I don't know if it was ten, or nine, or ten years later, he finally go to Richmond (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how they met and--
Speaker 2: They met at church.  And they only, they only dated for three months, and they decided to get married.  She--he was fifteen years older than my mother, and they dated for three months, and then they got married, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, this would be in the '20s [1920s], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They got married in 1932.
Speaker 1: Thirty, '32 [1932], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 395160
Speaker 1: What kind of personalities did they have, and how did, you know, can you describe their personalities?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father [James O. Williams] was a man with--he, he gave--he, he was small.  He was about 5'7" (unclear), but he had a, a, he had a sense of great strength about him.  But he never--I never saw him exercise that.  And what, what I mean by that, and, and so, he had lots of respect, 'cause he, he projected strength.  And when, when I was young, I used to be amazed 'cause, you know, he used to run into a game.  People--and he would walk and say, "How you doing, son?"  And they would just split (laughter).  You know, he'd walk, too, 'cause he had that kind of a person.  As I said, I never saw him demonstrate it, but he did have that.  He was very--when it came to the children, he, he worked hard to provide for the family, never argued, never, we always said that.  And, and he was playful with the children, except that there was a time when, when he meant for something, or he wanted to talk, or he wanted something, and it was the way he said it in his voice.  I wish to say the whole household would snap to attention.  And he, even my mother [Margaret Stone Williams], and he never, but he never, you know, he, he never showed any physical strength.  Most of the time, he was very low key.  All my--I never saw him raise his hand.  If, if they got out of line, he would tell mother, and she would spank me.  He never hit sisters, and I don't remember him spanking me.  My mother did, but the only time you knew he was angry, that I knew he was angry, he would, he would clench his teeth.  That's the only time (laughter).  I mean, that was a sign to me that he was angry-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but that's all.  My mother was mother--my father was also very disciplined, yeah.  If he said he was going to be there at seven-thirty, he'd be there at seven [o'clock].  He'd rather be an hour early than two hours late, just like he was supposed to be at work at seven-thirty--well, he would get to work at six-thirty.  Anyway, I remember when we used to go to church.  He was the Sunday school superintendent at church--started at ten.   I used to go with him when I was young 'til four or five.  And I used to, he used to--we had to be there, ten o'clock. I said, "Well, no one else is going to be there, but--get there at ten o'clock, but you and I."  He said, "We'll be there."  That's the kind of person he was.  He was very--my mother was the opposite.
Story_ID: 395161
Speaker 1: You were describing your mother's [Margaret Stone Williams] personality, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was, she was a disciplinarian, too, but she was more excitable.  And she al-, she was always, you know--my wife [Pamella Jones Williams], and I just tell my wife, she has the same habit.  She was always late, you know--I mean, she meant to be on time.  But, you know, she, she, but she was very much interested in education, wanted all the children to get as much education, wanted us to all to be exposed.  That's why she wanted us to go to the library and to read.  And she also wanted us all to be exposed to the classics of music.  She wanted us all to learn music and to, to enjoy all kinds, not--she didn't, she didn't like all the regular.  She, she wanted us to understand and to go.  And so, every Saturday, when I was young, my sister and I, Betty [Betty Williams Beaven], we used to always go, and listen to the various quintets that were part of the Indianapolis Symphony [Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra].  And we always, also went to hear the Indianapolis Symphony when we could.  And so, she would push us to be exposed to things.  And I get tied down to the neighborhood you lived in [in Indianapolis, Indiana], and the style of life that was there.  And she used to always say, "You can be from here, but you don't have to be of here."  And so, that was her whole thing.  But she was, she was the motivator, always pushing us to do well, and be better, do right.  And she could get excited and might throw a (laughter), throw something across the room at you, but my father would never do that, but she would (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 395162
Speaker 1: Now, you had like, five sisters?
Speaker 2: Six sisters--
Speaker 1: Six sisters, okay.
Speaker 2: --in the end, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're, and where do you come in the family?
Speaker 2: I'm the fourth child, in the middle, there's three older and three younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, was that a good position to be in, or how did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: It was fine.  It was a, a--one, one of the things that when people talk about being poor and everything, but, but we know we had a lot of love in the family.  As meant, a lot of times we used to, when we were small, we used to all jump into our parents' bed.  And my father [James O. Williams] would tell stories, you know, and tell us stories, and how he did this, or what he did and, and so we used to just say--but he was funny and, you know, and he would joke.
Speaker 1: Can you think of any good stories?
Speaker 2: No, my memory is poor, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I can't remember any, but he used to tell us all kind of stories.  And so, but we didn't have, you know, so we spent a lot of time together with the family, with mother [Margaret Stone Williams] and father, just talking and, consequently, and, and most people poor at that time.  But it, we, we didn't feel like we lacked anything because of the fact that we did have this tremendous bond.  As a consequence, my sisters and I made a, a bond, which we still do.  And we had said that in order, when we got older, we wanted to make sure that our families knew each other.  So, at least twice a year, we were going to get together.  And we do, and we still do.  And everybody agreed that they would tell whoever they married that, you know, when July 4th and Thanksgiving, you got to go with me home.  And we'll go with you Christmas, but you got to go with me home.  And, and we, we still do that today.
Speaker 1: That is mainly an attractive compromise by not taking Christmas.  I mean, I doesn't see how you all are doing this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we did the--
Speaker 1: You wanted to guarantee those two days?
Speaker 2: Guarantee those two days and so--
Speaker 1: And not have a dispute about it with anybody, okay.
Speaker 2: --and we get together.  And so, and that's because, for instance, my, my wife [Pamella Jones Williams] is an only child.  And it just amazes her, you know, how the family still, even though they're different personalities, you know, but how they come together in all kinds of things, and get together, have good times, and things like that.
Story_ID: 395163
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I always tell people, my earliest childhood memory is going to church with my father [James O. Williams] (laughter).  I must have been three or four.  I also, you know, I, I, you know, I used to do things when I was, before I went to school, I can remember saying, I was going to dig to the center of the earth, and dug a big hole in the back.  And my father about had a stroke.  I also had a great sense, I wanted to jump out, out of the window at home, and so I did that.  My mother [Margaret Stone Williams] about tore me up, you know, 'cause she had told me not to do it.
Speaker 1: Did you do it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did it, yeah (laughter), I didn't break anything.

Speaker 1: Who do you think you take after the most--your mother [Margaret Stone Williams] or your father [James O. Williams]?
Speaker 2: I, I think, I think my personality is like my father's.  And, and I think that my, the push, the drive I had in life is from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah, so you were willing to risk things at an early age and so--
Speaker 2: Well, I always wanted to know, and know why, you know, why, why, why?  You couldn't just give me an answer.  I would want to know, you know, I needed to see some reasoning behind that and, and, and they both tolerated that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, didn't get you in trouble in church or anything like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh, didn't get me in trouble, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if she didn't know, she'd tell me, well, when you go to the library, you can go get a book (laughter), and you can read about that on it.  And so then, she would push it.  If she didn't know it, she'd tell you, and say, well, okay, go to the library, ask the librarian, you're interested in this, that, and the other, yeah, and she'll show you.  Pretty soon, I could, so I still do that.  And, and I did that when I, if I wanted to know about a subject, you know, I'd picked it up from--

Speaker 1: Can you describe--now, what neighborhood did you live in, in Indianapolis [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I lived on the Eastside of Indianapolis in an all-black neighborhood, the--it's near Eastside at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did the neighborhood have a name?  Was it, did you, would you call it the Eastside, or what would you call it?
Speaker 2: It was just called the Eastside near, near Douglass Park [Indianapolis, Indiana]--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --in the Eastside of Indianapolis.  And, you know, my whole life was black, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the sights and sounds of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was noisy because, you know, we, you know, we always, all the neighborhood children played in the streets everywhere.  We also talked.  You could always tell who's cooking what, you know, for dinner, yeah, those are the smells.  And then, music, various kinds of music, (unclear).  And then, you learned early, you know, to sense dangerous situations or times and places, you know, you learned how to--if, if something looked dangerous, a group of guys or whatever, yeah, so you learned (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you mean, out on the streets?
Speaker 2: Yeah, out on the streets, you know, learned about that early.
Speaker 1: What were some of the dangerous signs out on the street?
Speaker 2: Well, the gangs in those days, they had gangs, but most of them, most was fisticuffs and knives.  This was before--guns were not usually a problem then.
Speaker 1: And what were the names of some of the gangs?  Could you remember any of them?
Speaker 2: There was one called the Syndicate [ph.] that was big that, you know.  They, they thought they ruled the Eastside.  And I lived on the Eastside, but further up, there was a hill.  There was another school, and we used to have factions against each other.  And then, the Westside where Oscar [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson] lived, that was another place that you couldn't go.  I remember I went to high school on the Westside at Crispus Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].  You know, we had a certain amount of time.  We had to get back into our side (laughter), our side of town, you (laughter).  And one time, I stayed late.  We had another guy, and we got jumped, that, you know, it was typical, you're jumped but.  And when you used to date, we, we didn't have any cars 'cause we didn't have any money.  When you dated, if you dated a girl on the other side of town, you had to pick your escape route (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And make sure you (unclear).
Speaker 2: --very, very well.  And so, I had time to bus.  I knew what time we'd get there, so I can go from the house to get to the bus stop before they could get a chance to do a thing.  But it was, it's not, not like it is today where people are shooting you, you know.  It was mostly, you know, the worst thing you could do is usually get cut or something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever have any troubles, personally yourself, with a, with gangs in terms of color?
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: Any conflicts?  I mean, actual altercations or that?
Speaker 2: No, I, I tried to reason my way out.
Story_ID: 395167
Speaker 1: I always tried to reason or avoid.  I, I--my whole thing was, was trying to avoid tough situations, or I had a, I used to have a slogan.  I had a slogan that people used to say, what happens if you get faced (unclear)?  I say, well, if he, if somebody throws, or slashes a knife at me, and he misses by an inch, the next time, he's going to miss by a block because I will be gone (laughter), that (unclear), so I can run (unclear).  But I was small, I was a very small guy.  And so, I'd say my words and leave.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Now, did--what did you enjoy doing when you were a little kid?  I mean, what did you like to do?
Speaker 1: You're talking about when I was very young?
Speaker 2: Yeah, grade school age.
Speaker 1: I, I enjoyed reading--grade school, and then, I started playing an instrument.
Speaker 2: What did you start playing?
Speaker 1: I started with a, the mellophone, eventually, the French horn, and trumpet.  And so, I spent a lot of time between reading.  I, I liked math, arithmetic, math.  I liked reading, and I liked, I liked to read autobiographies, and I liked to read about people, things.  And then, I liked playing (unclear). Are you a jazz fan?  For a long time, there was a good outstanding trumpet player named Freddie Hubbard.  Do you--he and I played together, grew up, and (unclear), and played together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's one of the greats.
Speaker 1: He was one of the greats.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He played with [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey, and all of them.  I--'cause--
Speaker 2: Were they around in Indianapolis [Indiana] in those days?
Speaker 1: They'd come by.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wes Montgomery.
Speaker 2: Art Blakey, I thought was much older than you, is it?
Speaker 1: Right, but his group used to come.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I, I, when I graduated my school, I had to make the decision whether I wanted to play music or not, and because I, I, fancied becoming a jazz musician.  But I wasn't as good as Freddie, so I didn't, but I did play with those guys, Freddie, and, and because of our high school [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], we had a great band teacher who had taught guys like Slide Hampton, J.J. Johnson, David Baker, who became who's--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 1: --head of the jazz school at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  And David did his practice teaching while I was still in high school.  And so, I, I, you know, so I'd come on the (unclear).  A lot of guys in our group went on to play with Ray Charles, and other people.  But then, I decided--man, I, you know, life is too uncertain for me.  I got to have something more certain, even though I did get an offer for a scholarship.
Speaker 2: So, this is in high school or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I started playing in, in the fourth grade, fifth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And these guys were in grade schools with you, with a lot of them?
Speaker 1: Freddie was in grade school, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Freddie Hubbard was in grade school then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people you're naming--I mean, really had good stuff--Slide Hampton, J.J. Johnson and--

Speaker 1: The band director?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: His name was Russell Brown [Russell W. Brown].
Speaker 2: Russell Brown.
Speaker 1: He was a black guy, a unique guy.  He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], grew up in a Hispanic neighborhood.  He could speak fluent French--uh, Spanish, but he was a great musician, but he, he just loved to teach.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, what else?  Were you in the sports at all when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to be a basketball player, you know, I used to fire jumpers and everything.  And when I got to high school, I was only 4'10".  But I, but they put me in--they had a phys ed [physical education] class where the jocks played.  I was in that one with Oscar [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson], and he could do anything I could do.  And he was bigger, faster (laughter), and I'd do then, man, you'd better, you'd better graduate from high school, go to college 'cause, 'cause I wasn't getting any bigger.  I, I grew--I was fourteen when I went to high school.  When I got into high school, I was about 5'6", 5'7"--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I was small.  He was already--when he came to high school, he was already over 6' tall.

Speaker 1: And I played basketball a lot.  I, you know, in the neighborhood, everywhere, I played, played on teams around.
Story_ID: 395168

Speaker 2: We listened to jazz--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we listened to jazz, rhythm and blues.
Speaker 1: Talking about the early mid-'40s [1940s], and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 2: Early in the mid-'40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s], but mid-'40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].

I, I listen to a lot of trumpet players, their, their names, but [HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins was around and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Clifford Brown, not Clifford Brown or--
Speaker 2: Clifford Brown, before he died.  I, I liked, and then Oscar Peterson was being packed in.  He was young, and he was really a great technician on the keys.  So, and there was always, and then, we had in the city there, we had Wes Montgomery and The Montgomery brothers.  Dave Baker [David Baker] played jazz, and until he got hurt in his accident.  So, it was--that's what we listened to, and then we would try to emulate that and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know that television was just in its fledgling state (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, man, no telling, I would--it didn't come in 'til the early '50s [1950s], one station, two stations (laughter).  It came on for a half hour, and then it's (laughter).  That's before your time--about that big?  Only, you know, the first person they got was a neighbor where everybody (laughter), everybody would come (laughter).  Everybody would go to that Tolliver's [ph.] house.  Then, we'd go there to see, yeah.  But basketball and music, same as, what, what, those are the big things.
Speaker 1: There was--know there was a lot of live action coming to town.  I don't know.  Was there a certain place in Indianapolis [Indiana] where live music would come?
Speaker 2: You know, there were some clubs that used to come there.

Speaker 1: Now, was the Walker Theatre opened then, the--
Speaker 2: The Walker Theatre [Madame Walker Theatre Center, Indianapolis, Indiana] was, the Walker is still there, but Walker Theatre was open.  It mostly had, in those days, dances for the youngsters, usually go to the Walker Theatre.  It was tough for us 'cause, see, that's on the wrong side of town.  It was on the Westside, and we're Eastside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And most of the dances were always held in a place where there was only one way out so we (laughter)--you always had to plan your escape, you know, so you could get out of there, so keep from getting hit in the mouth or something.
Speaker 1: I didn't understand that Indianapolis was that stratified--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: --you know, and so it's really a stratified kind of city.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was stratified.  Now, Oscar [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson] got, he got a reprieve because he was a great athlete, so he could go all over town.  But, yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at a early age, yeah.
Story_ID: 395169
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any, when you were in grade school [Francis W. Parker School 56, Indianapolis, Indiana], did, who were your heroes?  Did you have any heroes then that you wanted to be like?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Who was my hero?  I, I really, see, most of the black professionals at the time were either teachers, or dentists, or lawyers, and they always were in the black community.  I always thought the world was bigger than that.  And I wanted to do something big, so I used to read.  I read the life history of Walter Chrysler, founder of Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC].  I, I read the history of Henry Ford, his biography.  I--and, what was his name--I think his name was Charles Wilson [Charles Erwin Wilson], who headed up General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  And so, I, I read stories about industrialists.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense in those days, being right there in Indianapolis [Indiana], of Madam Walker's contribution to the business (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Madam C.J. Walker?
Speaker 1: Did they talk about that in the schools there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we, we had a professor, a teacher at Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], who at that time, wrote--he, he taught a course.  In those days, they called it Negro history, okay, which he had written himself.  And it talked about all the historical black people, you know, like--my memory--the man with all the peanuts.
Speaker 1: George Washington Carver.
Speaker 2: George Washington Carver, he, who is that--our state did all this thing.  Percy Julian [Percy Lavon Julian]---my memory's--but, yes.  And so, he, he--it wasn't a requirement.  Most, most of us took it, and it was a one-semester course because it, it was the first thing that, first time we 'cause, well, none of our books had anything about black people for the most part and--
Speaker 1: Now, who was this man?  Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Mr. Armstrong, Clifford, Clifford Armstrong [ph.].  I think it was Clifford, or Clifton, Clifford, Clifford Armstrong.  And he taught Negro history back in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] at Attucks.  And all, all my sisters who graduated from Attucks took his course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a handwritten book, you know, because there was no textbook at that time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so he had done his research and put this together.
Story_ID: 395170
Speaker 1: What grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to--it was called Francis Parker School Number 56 [Francis W. Parker School 56, Indianapolis, Indiana].  I went there from the first grade to the sixth grade.  That's all the further I went while I was there.  Later on, they added two more grades to it, but I went there.  And then I went to, for the seventh and eighth grade school, I went to John Hope Franklin [John Hope School 26, Indianapolis, Indiana], which is one of the people that he used to talk about, too, school number 26.
Speaker 1: So they had a John Hope Franklin by then, huh, in--okay.
Speaker 2: High, uh, junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's something 'cause he was still, you know, a fairly young man in those days--
Speaker 2: At that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was in Mr. Armstrong's [ph.] book, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Mr. Armstrong a student of [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin by any chance?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But our own see, our own principal at Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Well, he would have been the same age pretty much (unclear).
Speaker 2: Was a well-known man is, because Indiana was a Ku Klux Klan [KKK] state.
Story_ID: 395171
Speaker 1: And I don't know if you remember the John Birch Society?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: It started there in Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 2: But it's a very conservative--
Speaker 1: Very conservative, yeah.  It started, it started in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but I didn't realize it.  Didn't--
Speaker 1: It started in-it was at the Claypool Hotel in Indianapolis where they started.  And I, I, I, you know, things.  But it, 'cause they had lynchings in Indiana up through the '40s [1940s].  And I remember one time when I was driving--my wife [Pamella Jones Williams], my to-be-wife, 'cause I'm going to take you through this town, and this town here.  And there had been some people up to--she didn't believe me (laughter), when I took her to the center of this little town in Indiana.  And I won't name it because now, they're, uh--and they had all these billboards about King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] that he was a Communist, needed to be lynched.  She, she was scared to death.  I said, naw, that's all right, we'll be through.  But it, it was a, you know, the southern half of the state, because I worked at the state library.  I mean, the years we used to go get books and, and you go down to Lawrenceburg [Indiana], and some of these other places.  It, it was like, you know, being in the South.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they had a big strong presence of a--
Speaker 1: Oh, big strong presence of Ku Klux Klan [KKK], right, right around Indianapolis, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they had a big lynching in Marion [Indiana], which is just north of Indianapolis, not--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I want to say in '46 [1946], maybe '45, [1945], you know [sic.].
Speaker 2: I think that's the one that [HistoryMaker] James Cameron from Indianapolis, from Milwaukee [Wisconsin], they--he founded the Black Holocaust Museum [America's Black Holocaust Museum] in Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Yes, in Cincinnati [Ohio] or--
Speaker 2: It's Milwaukee, yeah.
Speaker 1: In Milwaukee, okay.
Speaker 2: He's a--James Cameron survived that lynching--
Speaker 1: He survived it.
Speaker 2: --in Marion.  It was 1930, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty [1930], yeah, '30 [1930].  He was fifteen, I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: He did it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so you were aware of, of the white community, but we were in a black community.  And it was self-contained.
Speaker 2: Is that (unclear), only stayed with it.  The Grand Dragon became the governor at some certain point.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-eight [1928], I think it was.  But--
Speaker 1: So, they were still, it was still hostile.
Speaker 2: Vestiges of that kind of hostility.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 395172
Speaker 1: Now, you grew up during the Civil Rights Movement.  Did your parents [Margaret Stone Williams and James O. Williams] talk about, you know, the civil rights activity in the news at all?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, in the middle of it, and was well aware of the whole--and let's see.  I have--my cousin was going to Kentucky State [Kentucky State College; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky] and so, she was involved in the sit-ins there.  And I went to DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana] in '56 [1956].  And we, we had lots of discussions there.  They had lots of discussions because my next--the guy who I ran cross country with, a white guy, who was from Arkansas, and had been head of Boys State [American Legion Boys State] in Arkansas, so he knew Governor Faubus [Orval Faubus] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Boys State is like a mock state--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --government--
Speaker 2: And state government.
Speaker 1: --and state, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he was head, and so he knew Faubus.  And he was--we, we used to have great discussions about that.  And he, he was, he lived on a plantation.  His father owned a plantation that they were, and so when, when he came to visit, he, he couldn't tell his father that he was going to a black person's house, he said, because it would cause great difficulty back at his--so, and we had lots of discussions.  And then, while I was in college, on a, on one of the cross country meets, you know, I got refused service.  Yeah, Indiana, you know, you still could get refused service, 'cause I used to, in any restaurant, even in Indianapolis [Indiana], or for yourself, if you walked in and saw a sign, saying, "We reserve the right to serve whom we please," admit--
Speaker 1: Admit--
Speaker 2: --you're not to going to get served.  And I used to work at statehouse [Indiana Statehouse, Indianapolis, Indiana], and at the state library.  And there was a restaurant right, right there in the complex who--which would not serve black folk unless you would come to--

Speaker 1: I was thinking, 'cause when we had the break, I said, did you have any idea that Freddie Hubbard was going to be--
Speaker 2: What he was?
Speaker 1: --be, yeah, he--
Speaker 2: Did he have a sense of just all about him then, or did people say, well, he's good, but--
Speaker 1: No.  That's why I, I knew I wasn't going to make a suggestion just 'cause when he was, you know, by the time he was fifteen, sixteen, he was scatting, and doing everything better than I can (laughter).  Yeah, he was good.  Yeah, so we knew he would, he would make it.  We didn't know how, but then he--I think he left with, I think he went with--[HistoryMaker] Sonny Rollins came through town one time, and heard him play.  And then, oh, he went and played for him and, and offered him a job on the spot, and that's how he left.  But he was--think he was nineteen.
Speaker 2: Was Sonny Rollins from Indianapolis [Indiana], too?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he just come through playing for the school, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, well, so--
Speaker 1: So, I, I played music.  And then, that's when I, I first met Freddie, 'cause Freddie grew up on the same side of town I did.  And so, that's where I met him.  He was--that's about fifth, fifth grade or something like, playing music.
Speaker 2: All right.  Now, did you and sisters ever play together in the music (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My, my sisters--the answer is no because they played violins.  And I always thought those were squeaky things, and I'd play a brass horn, although we would practice sometimes together.  And one of my sisters [Betty Williams Beaven] was a very good piano player and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --became a piano teacher.
Speaker 2: Did your sisters spoil you?  There's so many of them there (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: Liggett.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then, my sixth grade teacher was the one that kept inspiring me.  Her name was Lillian Roll [ph.].  This lady, she kept pushing me, and said I could.  My sisters had set a, a high standard, you know.  And she was telling me that I could exceed them, but she, she pushed me hard.  Then, when I was in the eighth grade, I was pushed by a math teacher.  His teacher was--boy, it'll come back to me--he pushed me hard in math.  He had gone, he was like, he had gone to Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts] himself.  It was not uncommon, now you got to remember, this is the '40s [1940s], and '50s [1950s], this is '50s [1950s].  Attucks High School [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], the high school I went to, was started, and was built in 1926, '27 [1927].  And they started it because of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], wanted to separate, didn't want all the black people to go to high school with the white people, so they did.  But the, the principal, Dr. Lane [Russell Lane], got his Ph.D. from Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England].  So, the--we had, I bet we had five or six Ph.D.'s on the faculty.  We had a journalist, who wrote, was a foreign journalist, wrote for French newspapers, and he taught French and journalism at our high school.  We had an engineer who had graduated from University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], couldn't find a job in engineering, and he taught mechanical shop.  We had Dr. Morton-Finney [John Morton-Finney] who taught, who was a lawyer and doctor in Romance languages.  So, you know, we got--it, it was a great high school--
Speaker 1: And this is when you said, what is said, when you mean the Klan, you really mean the Klan?
Speaker 2: I mean the Klan, Ku Klux Klan.  They forced the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Some people were saying, you know, you're--
Speaker 2: --they forced, they forced them to segregate, 'cause there were too many black kids were beginning to go to white schools.  So, they told them to get a separate school, and the state did that, and (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're not using that as an euphemism for--in other words it's a (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, I'm talking about the Ku Klux Klan.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Ku-, the Ku Klux Klan (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The real Ku Klux Klan, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, that's right, make that clear to people that may think that you're just saying--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --you know, saying racist white people, but this is actually the Klan?
Speaker 2: Ku Klux Klan, yeah.  But it was a blessing because we had all, and then, I was telling you about this--Mr. Armstrong [ph.] teaching us Negro history because they had all this good (unclear).  And so, even down in the lower schools we had because most of the black people--if you weren't a lawyer or a doctor for the black community--you, you had to be a teacher.  And so, we had great, outstanding teachers.

Speaker 1: Was it--the one black high school in Indianapolis [Indiana], Crispus Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was one black high school in Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: One--okay, and--
Speaker 2: And we had--but we had several black grade schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to, like I said, 56th [Francis W. Parker School 56, Indianapolis, Indiana] and 26th [John Hope School 26, Indianapolis, Indiana], and then there was 37 [Hazel Hart Hendricks School 37, Indianapolis, Indiana] and 41 [George W. Sloan School 41, Indianapolis, Indiana].  But they all fed into Attucks.  Now, when I--
Speaker 1: So, the segregation, was that marked in Indianapolis that, if you were on the Eastside, you couldn't go to a local high school.  You had to go--
Speaker 2: By the time I got to be a freshman, you could.  But they gave, they gave black students the option of going to the high school in your neighborhood, or going to Attucks.  And I was the first class that got the option, but I chose Attucks, and the reason I chose Attucks was what you just stated.  I felt that I would get more attention in terms of academics, and in terms of counseling if I went there.  And it turned out to be right, 'cause a good friend of mine went to Tech [Arsenal Technical High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], and he transferred after a senior 'cause they weren't, you know, they were telling him--and he was very bright.  They were telling him that he should go and major in shop, and he wanted to major in math, so he transferred.  But, but in the, in the seventh and eighth grade school, I had a real feisty English teacher who pushed me hard to write, and to learn to write well, named Mrs. Taylor [ph.].  And I had a, a great music teacher named Compton, Jim Compton [James Compton], who pushed us.  And Freddie [Freddie Hubbard] and I were--he pushed us to learn how to play a lot of different instruments.
Speaker 1: Was David Baker in school with you at the same time or--
Speaker 2: David Baker student-taught when I was in high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so he was about, he was, he was in my sister's class--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my older sister's class.
Story_ID: 395337
Speaker 1: You hung out with the basketball players, but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I was trying to play.
Speaker 1: Did you play on the team at all?  Did you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't make team in high school.  What, you know, those were the glory years when I was in high school, 'cause they won state title two years in a row with the Big O [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson], and forced the schools.  And, and Oscar, in his book, says that, you know, and they, they say it in Indianapolis [Indiana]--they just had a big article about it.  It forced schools to really diversify 'cause too much black power was there.  We won state title two years--first black school to win the state title, and then we won it two years in a row.
Speaker 1: It's this now, this may not be true, but was--is Crispus Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] the school that they depict in the movie, 'Hoosiers' where the, the small town, white school finally wins it against the big urban blacks?
Speaker 2: It was a big urban black--no, the school that they won against was Muncie Central [Muncie Central High School, Muncie, Indiana].  However, the coach that played the role was Attucks' coach.  Ray Crowe played the role, and his assistant coach was Oscar's brother in the movie, Bailey Robertson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he played the role as being the coach, but, no, I remember Milan [Milan High School, Milan, Indiana] well because that year, we even looked past them, 'cause we, we beat a, the strong team that afternoon--said, oh, man, tonight, we'll kill these little guys--Milan.  But there was no clock, and we were worn out from playing the day before, so they beat us, and went on to the state title.  But then, we won it for the next two years with Oscar.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you won the two years after, after Milan though?
Speaker 2: After Milan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955] and '56 [1956].  And then, they really distributed the black students (laughter).  They closed Attucks three years later, three years later, closed it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) They had to break that up.
Speaker 2: Break that up, man.
Story_ID: 395338
Speaker 1: So did they--I mean, what happened--now, I want to talk about what you, some of the stuff you did in high school.  But when, when they integrated the high schools in Indianapolis [Indiana], what happened to the black teachers?  I mean, did they (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they begin to integrate them into the white schools as well.
Speaker 1: So, were there quite a few of them, they were out of the job, or did they, they retain most of them, and just disperse them?
Speaker 2: For the most part, they dispersed them, dispersed them around.  First, they, they began to bring white teachers to Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].  This is after I left--well, I'm sorry--the first year, my senior year, they brought a white, we had the first white teacher there.  And they took a black teacher out, and put them over there.  And then, they started the process, and about four years, it was just about completed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe, let's see, where my youngest sister [Mary Williams Thompson] there graduated in 19-, now maybe it was, then maybe Attucks lasted a little longer, but then, it became integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was is it still Attucks High School?
Speaker 2: No, they closed it.  And then, they opened it back up as a--they closed it for a long time, and then, I think a few years ago, they opened it back up as a middle school.
Speaker 1: Is it still called Crispus Attucks (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Crispus Attucks Middle School [Crispus Attucks Medical Magnet High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's still there, and they have a big, big, a museum and archives of--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did the students understand who Crispus Attucks was and of the time that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Crispus Attucks, yeah, we, you know, we learned of it, you know, they always say that he was the hero of the Boston Tea Party [sic.], and that he was the first one that led the charge of the--you know, there is a statue of him up there in Boston [Massachusetts].  When I, when I used to travel, I finally saw that there.  We have--that was instilled in you, even in grade school 'cause it was (laughter) (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just want, you know, I probably was but then--
Speaker 2: Oh, man, everybody knew.
Speaker 1: So, so many (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So much so that I was surprised when I went around and said, didn't you know Crispus Attucks?  People never even heard of him, you know, because it was so, pushed so hard in Indianapolis, yeah.
Story_ID: 395339
Speaker 1: Did you run for any class offices or anything, Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, I, you know, I think I ended up being the, the vice president of the senior class, and not the president, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were you pretty popular in the school?
Speaker 2: I wasn't as popular as Big O [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson] in the basketball game (laughter).  But the, the people knew me, yeah, they knew me, yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess the Big O was the most popular person in Indiana (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 1: --in some ways.  I mean, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he used to, if you walked down the street with him, I mean, he, he get stopped for autographs, even in downtown Indianapolis.  Yeah, because, well, because several of the major department stores used to put up a, during basketball season, they would bring Attucks, like they won the state trophy, and they have a big display there.  And so, and because even though he was black, Indianapolis is a basket-, Indiana, Indianapolis is a basketball state.  And so, he became a big hero there because of his, especially his style of playing.  He was not flamboyant, and he, he did everything as they would say, the right way.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the fundamental.  I think he (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was fundamental, he was a fundamental player.  He could do a lot of things.  He just didn't, he said it was no need wasting the energy if you could do simpler.
Speaker 1: I think he wrote a book, 'Play Better Basketball with Oscar Robertson' [Oscar Robertson] about fundamentals (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fundamentals, yeah, he was, he was very fundamental--a strong guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did you--did you take a lot of science courses in, in high school?
Speaker 2: I took, I took, yeah.  You forgot your mic.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took science and math.  I majored in--well, I'm, I, I minored in science, and I (unclear).  I majored in math and history and English 'cause, originally, I was going to go to college and major in math and history.  I enjoyed history.  But after, after my first year in college, I said, man, I gotta, I'm going to major in something that's got objective answers 'cause I'm going to have a problem.
Story_ID: 395340
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how did you end up choosing DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana]?  I'm going to go back to that subject, though, but how did you end up choosing DePauw?  DePauw is a, what I understand, a affluent, you know, mostly white--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --a small institution, but very affluent institution.
Speaker 2: Very affluent institution.  When I became a senior, you know, the counselors started talking to me about colleges.  And this is what I was saying that you would miss if you were at the white high school.  And I had, I was thinking about state schools, you know, 'cause of the money.  And I, I wasn't an IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] fan, so I was probably going to go to Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana], and major in engineering or something.  Can I tell you a little story?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We used to have career day at Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana].  And I didn't want to be a teacher, but I wanted to do something else in math.  And my--I, I think it's my junior year or senior year, one white guy came to Attucks for career day.  It's usually--everybody else was black, and they talked about what they were, and he was an engineer.  And he, he said, "You, you can major in engineering.  You don't have to be a teacher.  You'll make a lot of money," you know.  I forgot what he was making, seven thousand dollars, eight thousand [dollars].  That was a lot of, that was all the money in the world.  I said, "What?"  And so, I didn't know anything about engineering.  And then, I started reading about it.  And he was a mechanical engineer, so I said I'll be a mechanical, I'll just be a mechanical engineer.  I'll go through the mechanical jig.  But the, the counselors at Attucks came to me and said that they had been contacted by DePauw, the director of admissions.  And he was a--you can ask Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], but he was a unique guy.  He eventually became president of the college, but he wanted diversity at DePauw--
Speaker 1: This is DePauw with a W, right?
Speaker 2: --W, D-E-P-A-U-W.  And so, he contacted our high school.  And so, two of us went down to visit, and met Vernon Jordan (laughter).  He said--I'll never forget--diversity, man, they need some black folk down here--just, just have them walking around.  So, man, if you can get in, you guys, you can get some scholarship money, yeah (laughter), so Vernon.  Bing, I met Bing Davis [HistoryMaker Willis Bing Davis] there. He was a freshman at the time.  And the guy's name was John Whitek [ph.], Dr. John Whitek.  He was really a, and he, he pushed hard to get us to come there and visit.  And it was very nice, everybody was very nice.
Story_ID: 395341
Speaker 1: There was only Bing [HistoryMaker Willis Bing Davis] and Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.].  There was one lady.  Her name was--geez, my memory's--there was one lady.
Speaker 2: I know who you're talking about but I can't think of-
Speaker 1: Yeah, he, Bing would know 'cause she was in Bing's class.  And then, there was one guy who was going to graduate that year--a guy named Lenny York [ph.].  And I'd also heard about--I had a, a--my older sister's husband's brother graduated the year before Bing, uh, before Vernon did two years (unclear), the year I was going to go there.  Fred Kramer [ph.] was his name.  And so, we talked about it.  But I went down there, and they really treated us very well.  And I visited Knox College here in Illinois [Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois], and Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] was a massive city to me.  And so, then I got--the counselors helped me to work on getting scholarships, you know, from fraternity, black fraternities.  And then, they, so by the time I graduated from high school, I had enough money to go to DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana] to pay at least the tuition.  And they told me I could get a job, to pay for the board-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so I decided to go down there.
Speaker 2: So, did you graduate with, with honors from Attucks [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] or--
Speaker 1: Well, oh, yeah, I graduated--I thought you were going to say--from, from freshman to junior year, I was always first in the class.  My senior year, I ended up third because I discovered ladies.  And that, I dropped to third.  You'd understand that, don't you (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Distraction--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I graduated third in the class.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oscar [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson] graduated, like in the top, you know, twenty, yeah, he was, he was a good student.
Speaker 2: Well, he sounds like he is--I mean (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was a very bright guy, good student, yeah.  And he originally was going to major in engineering, but then when he got to college, they told him not to because of the demands of playing basketball.  So, he majored in business administration instead.
Story_ID: 395342
Speaker 1: Now, you were an entrepreneur as a paper boy.  And did you have any other business kind of experiences in high school [Crispus Attucks High School, Indianapolis, Indiana] and grade school [Francis W. Parker School 56, Indianapolis, Indiana], high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a paper boy.  Then, I went up to the wealthier neighborhoods, and I cut grass.  Then I got a job as a, at the supermarket in the wealthier neighborhood after school, stocking groceries, and carrying out stuff, and things like that.  Then, my last year in high school, I, I worked at the state library in the shipping in the west neighborhood, you know, packing books to send to the various libraries around the country.  But, I, I always worked, when I was eight years old, 'cause from eight years old, until, you know, I, I paid myself my own allowance, 'cause, you know, we had so many children.  And just like, you know, I had to learn how to iron, had to learn how to, you know, do all those things.  And my, my daughter [Courtney Williams] was amazed when I could braid hair and French press, or how your sisters, you know, (laughter)--they, they always do that.  You got to braid my hair now.  So, but, I, I, I've been working since I was eight.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, just wanted to establish that before we--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked all the way through college, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so-
Story_ID: 395343
Speaker 1: What kind of jobs did you have in college?
Speaker 2: When I went to DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana], I worked on the desk at the men's, the men's hall, so answering the phone, sorted the mail.  There was a, you know, it's interesting.  That was where the, at that time, the university guest rooms were for the speakers.  And so, usually, the speakers came at night when I worked.  And so, I got to meet Carl Sandburg.  I got to meet Dr. Benjamin Mays.  He used to be the head of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  He came to speak.
Speaker 1: He spoke at DePauw?
Speaker 2: DePauw, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: I met Ford Frick, who was the commissioner of baseball, 'cause he graduated from DePauw U.  So, I got to meet a lot of people because of working in the part-time, and on the desk at the hall there.  And then, when I went to Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana], I worked in the university libraries, worked the evening shift.  One of my jobs was to--she probably doesn't know this, but women had hours--you remember that in, in the college?
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: So, they, they had to be in their dorms by certain times, like nine o'clock during the week, and midnight, or eleven on the weekends.  And so, the Purdue, Purdue library stayed open one hour later than the women hours, so it was only men in there.  And so, I worked in, you know, putting books back, and all that, but my last hour every night was to protect the lady at the desk.  Usually, they were graduate students, or something like that, 'cause there were guys did come up and say some things to them, you know (laughter).  But that was my job, and so, and to close it up, too, so, I did that, too, while I was at Purdue.
Story_ID: 395344
Speaker 1: Now, this is DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana].  How did you deal with it socially?  There are only like a few of you there.  I mean, how many black students were on campus when you were at DePauw?
Speaker 2: Three, four.
Speaker 1: And we named pretty much all of them--Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], Bing Davis [HistoryMaker Willis Bing Davis]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you, and there was one black woman?
Speaker 2: Melba Zachery was her name.
Speaker 1: Melba Zachery, okay.
Speaker 2: Melba, you can ask Bing, he knows.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she graduated.  The--let me, let me just say this.  You, you mentioned that there was a Floyd School [ph.].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My first year, I learned more from the students than I learned in school.  Yeah, yeah, you're talking about a guy who came from Indianapolis [Indiana], didn't have no money, and it was only forty miles away.  You know, I, I couldn't even catch a bus to go home 'cause I, I just didn't have any money.  And these students, these girls would sit and talk about going to Europe, like it was going across the street.  I, I remember one time, I'm sitting there, and they said, you know, I'm going to go to Europe this summer.  You want to come and go with me?  She--I'll go with--I, I, you know.  And I just walked, yeah, they--it was just, you know, guys were saying, man, if your father doesn't make about three times what my father was making, you're not, you can't live.  I said, gee, I thought I lived (laughter), I was doing it.  Yeah, they--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) They see, you're still alive, right?
Speaker 2: --they just were not, they, they--we were out of the same, we were just not running in the same social class.  So, some guys asked them, go home with me on the weekend.  And one of the guys, his father owned a big chicken plant down in Batesville [Indiana], which is off-limit town for like, and so he went and visit.  And, you know, I told you we had this family love and everything.  And he wanted to go with me almost every weekend.  And I said, "Oh, hey, man, I," you know, I, 'cause we had a very modest house, you know, all black neighborhood.  He said, "Man, but, man, your, your family, it is so nice.  You know, it's just, they get, you know, I just enjoyed being there with your family."  That was because we, you know, we had all this love, and got along well and, you know.  And that's why I begin to know that money wasn't everything, 'cause he had all this money and car and, and he was, wanted, want to go down to this house where everybody sleeping on top of each other and, you know.  But I learned a lot.  And then my whole, you know, my eyes were open about the world.  I, uh, Bing and I were very careful about--Vern was more, Vernon Jordan was more open with his, but he, he cautioned, too, you know, about--
Speaker 1: In terms of dating and stuff and, okay.
Speaker 2: Dating, relations, and stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And said that there, and, you know, guys would give you hints if they thought you were getting too friendly or something.
Story_ID: 395345
Speaker 1: That's a tough way to get through college, your college years [at DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana].  And these are when hormones are surging and, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Surging rapidly, yeah.
Speaker 1: --youth is, you know.  And so, how did you get through college?  I mean, what did you, did you have to go into, uh, were there any young black women in town, or they were--
Speaker 2: My, my first year, this guy I was telling you, the black, and went with me, and he, he had a girlfriend in town.  There were a couple, three (laughter).  You know, Greencastle [Indiana] was a small town, five thou-, yeah, yeah.  So, social life was when I came back to Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 1: I guess a--
Speaker 2: And Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] used to go to Indianapolis quite a bit, too (laughter), yeah.  So, and my mother [Margaret Stone Williams] used to remind me why I went to college--you went there to learn.  She said that, see and educated and, you know, you (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you complained about the situation to her or that was (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I just told her, you know, it's, it's tough.  I turned--I explained about the professors, too, when I--
Speaker 1: Oh, what is that?  You said that you went with the intention of majoring in history and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: --and math.
Story_ID: 395185
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your experiences with essay-type questions in the liberal arts, as opposed to the more exacting arts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, man, the--
Speaker 1: --or sciences rather.
Speaker 2: When I first went to DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana], I was going to major in history and math.  Well, I was going to be in pre-engineering as well because I was on a pre-engineering program, but it was going to be math and history.  But I took a history course my second semester of my first year.  Man, I thought should have gotten an A and I got a B.  And it was, you know, I had this problem with these essay questions because they would always give you these subjective kinds of things that you didn't expound this more, you could have done this more.  And so, I said, well, maybe it was the professor, so I'm going take another one next year.  And I, I'd study with these guys in, in the dorm and everything, and I knew this stuff better than they did--any.  And I'd, I'd write it.  Now, the second course, the second history course I took was with a professor who was a liberal.  And, and I always claim that when I walk in the door, he said, since this is a black guy in my (unclear), I'm going to give him a B.  He's not going to get a C, regardless of what I did.  And I--did A work?  I know, and I wrote, and I--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, he made your B.
Speaker 2: He gave me a B, and because you didn't expound on this.  And that's when I decided that I'm just going to take the sciences and math courses because, and, and required courses only.  But I'm not going to try to major in this because it's just going to be too much.  As a matter of fact, I called my mother [Margaret Stone Williams] up and told her--I said, "I'm coming home." She said, "What's the matter?"  I said, "Man, these people are racist, and I can't get no grade."  She said, "Somebody call you nigger?"  I said, "Well, well, not, not really."  I said, "But they're not getting the grade."  She said, "Look here, you are there to get an education.  Once you get an education, they can't take that away from you.  And I don't care if you can't get a job or, you know, you--just 'cause somebody just threw a little stick and a little stone at you, you're going to give up?"  I said, "Well, that's not fair."  She said, "Whoever told you this world was fair?  I never told you that this world was fair," said, matter of fact, you can't find it in the Bible, the reference page (laughter).  So, she absolutely refused to hear it.  And so, I stayed on there and went on through, but I knew then that I could not be in any place where there was some subjectivity in the evaluation of your grade.  The only other time it really got bad was--well, when I was at DePauw, I finally went on what they called the 3-2 plan.  I went there to, if you--three years of liberal arts, you had to major in math and science because then you go to engineering school.  And you get your, you know, and two years in engineering school, you'll get your bachelor's [degree] from DePauw in liberal arts, and your bachelor of science in engineering (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's why if you look at mine, I graduated '61 [1961], although they say '60 [1960] for a (unclear), and '61 [1961] from both schools.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay, that, that explains that 'cause we were baffled by that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 395186
Speaker 1: But I just wanted, the only other, only really, the really straightforward racism I ran into was at Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana].  I was taking, and I, I can't remember whether it was a course on circuitry or, or field theory.  I think it was circuitry.  And Purdue graded on a curve, which was different than DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana].  And they also usually only had one midterm and one final.  And then, 60 percent of your grade was at the discretion of the professor.  So, we took a midterm in this class and, and the average was like 50, and I had a 65 [percent].  So, I went to see the professor after one session to figure out what I needed to do to at least get a B or an A.  And, and I, I noticed that there was a line of us to see him.  There was three, me, and three more.  And so, he called in those three, he skipped me, and called in the other three.  And then, I finally went in, and he said, "Williams [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams], Jerry Williams, Williams, Williams, Williams, Williams--you're flunking."  I said, "I'm flunking?"  I said, "Wait a minute.  How, how come I'm flunking?  The, the average was 50, which is a C--I got 65."  He said, "I don't like your--the way you participate in class."  I said, "Why--I don't say anything?"  He said, "I don't like that either."  I said--he said--I said, "Wait a minute, wait, wait a minute."  He said, "You got to understand that 60 percent of the grade," and then he told me that.  So, he said--I said, well, well, now it's too late to drop 'cause I--I said, "Well, how am I going to keep from failing this course?"  He said, "Well, you're, you're just going to have to do very well on the final."  So, I walk out of the class.  And I'm walking across campus, I see one of the other black guys.  And I said, "Jose [ph.], man, I just," and he asked me, said, "Who is he?"  He said, "Oh, man, you should have told me."  He, he flunked--there was one other black guy who had, had to graduate in summer school--'cause he flunked him in his senior year.  I said, "Aw, man, now you tell me.  I can't get out of this class."  Anyway, we had the final.  The average on the final was 65.  There was a 97 and a 92.  I got the 92 and got a C.  Then he told me, so way ahead.  Yeah, 60 percent, I just don't, you know.  So, I--anybody that went to school in that period of time, you know, and especially those, like Vern [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] majored in political science, man.  Therefore, uh, isn't it, uh, Vern, I don't know how he did it.
Speaker 2: He must have had--it's really a struggle now.  I imagine in the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But he was, he was articulate, and he was, he was good.  He was bright and he was smart.  Bing [HistoryMaker Willis Bing Davis], of course, majored in art.  And I mean, they couldn't deny that he was (laughter) very, very good, so, he did very well and it's art.
Story_ID: 395187
Speaker 1: But man, I--it's, so I--engineering school, I, I--this will be the last time.  We had one other professor who told us that none of us were smart enough to be in his class, he said.
Speaker 2: None of the black students or--
Speaker 1: None--of the students.
Speaker 2: Of the students, period?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, he gave his first class, and the average on the test was 15 [percent].  Now, yeah, he gave us another test where you got a zero if you turned it in.  And so, I ended up getting a B with a 30 average, yeah.  And I asked him after I got out, "What's that for?"  I mean--he says, I just want to show you that you all don't know everything, yeah.  You know, I had great difficulty.  And I've always, I've gone back to many schools, and talked to them but, you know, 'cause school, your, your ego is fragile as it is when you're in college.  And you, you know, you can shatter a person's ego when you do that.  But there were some good professors.  I had a good adviser at DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana].  He steered me through, and made sure that I took the right classes, so that I could go in this program, and go to Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] at the end of the two years.  Dr. Gass [Clinton Burke Gass] was his name.  He was a math, a math professor.  The, the admissions guy I was telling you about stayed.  And when I, didn't look like I was going to have enough money, they, they said--it turned out I did get enough, but because I was doing well at DePauw, they told me that they would make sure I got a scholarship to cover whatever I didn't have.  So, they, they, they took care of me those three years.  It was a very pleasant experience, it was my first--it, it, it was a flip.  I flipped from all black to all white.  And I think, as I look back, it was a great preparation for me as I got into the business world.
Story_ID: 395188
Speaker 1: University of Pennsylvania [The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], is it?
Speaker 2: No, no, or did I go to the University of Pennsylvania?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that comes next, right, University of Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yeah, University of Pennsylvania, I was in graduate school.  That was after I graduated and went to work for General Electric [GE].
Speaker 1: Oh, you are, you went to work first before, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I already--
Speaker 1: Now, did you, had you planned to work first, or did you think you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I planned to--well, I hadn't really thought much past, yeah, getting a degree, go out and get some money, you know (laughter), and work.  And I, I enjoyed philosophy, but I decided there's no way I can major in that.  I got, when I come out, I got to hit the ground running, and get a job.  And so, I majored in electrical engineering at Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana].  And my senior year, I wanted to go with GE or RCA [RCA Corporation] or, you know, the large, and got an offer from GE, and went to work for them up in Syracuse [New York].  And it was interesting because I went on the GE training program, which was a, a very tough program.  It was, oh, man, it'd only been one black person who had tried this engineering training program, which is a three-year training program, and he had failed.  And so, I tried for it, and it was a tough.  But my second, my second assignment, it, through, at GE, was in the electronics lab.  And one of the guy, who had been a professor of mine at Purdue, was also at the electronics lab now working.  And he told me that if I took this program at GE, that there was no way about it, no way around it, I was going to have to work those forty hours, but also it was going to take you about forty hours to prepare the lessons, and things that they gave you on this training program.  And he was right.  The first, there were, they, they picked, of the, I, I think it was three thousand engineers they hired that year.  And they picked the three hundred to go on the training program.  And they told you that they were only going to pick a third of them to go through the whole thing.  In my, and they had them in of the hundred, and then five sections of the country.  And in mine, there were about twenty-five people.  I was in Syracuse, New York.
Speaker 1: Oh, what year is this?  Is it '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961], still '61 [1961], okay.
Story_ID: 395189
Speaker 1: At the end of the first part of the year on the training program, I was twenty-fifth out of twenty-five.  I was twenty-fourth--there was one guy less than me.  And so, I decided over the summer, over the Christmastime, that I was going to really pick it up.  And so, I finished third.  And, and I will tell you that many nights, I did not sleep.  Almost every week, I had to stay up at least twenty-four hours to, to, 'cause you had a regular job, plus you had to do this program.  And they, they study subjects.  If, if I'd studied this hard in college, they'd still be talking about me, because, man, this, they give you, they walk in, they, they have a professor, or somebody at GE [General Electric] who knew the subject, and they'd, they'd lecture to you for a half day.  They give you about four textbooks.  And then, they give you a problem that existed in the company, owned it, in this particular area, that might or might not have been solved.  And they wanted you to just look at how you would solve it.  And so, you had to go off, read these books, do all this.  And then, you write a, a technical paper in the regular format of their technical papers that they presented.  And you had to do this outside of working (unclear), so it was tough.  And, but I made it through the three years.  And, and once you made it through, if you graduated, those, those guys used to, people used to say, you, you get the monogram stamped in your forehead 'cause you're one of the chosen.  And, and it was true, they did take care of you.
Speaker 2: That script, GE (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what they said.  You got the monogram, and you're, where you're one of the chosen ones.
Story_ID: 395190
Speaker 1: I'll tell you an interesting story, when I got to GE [General Electric], I didn't have a car.  And there were about, I've forgotten, oh, I don't know, 15 of us starting, 20, 15 of us, 20, same day.  I was the only black, of course.  So, GE, and I mean, you know, I look back now, and a good thing they did, GE also helped you find housing.  So, when we, there was at, people came in various times.  So, when I came in, there were two guys left and me.  There were just three of us, two white guys.  And so, one of the white guys, and they said, you know, "There's a place over in this house in this neighborhood and they--she likes four engineers."  Three of them have gone for the second year program somewhere else, and so, there's one guy there.  And so, this one white guy said, "Well, why don't we all go?"  Yeah, I said, "Oh, okay" (laughter).  And the, later on, the third white, the other white guy said, "Man, I've never been with no black guy before."  We, we got to know each other.  And he said, "Man, I looking at Carl [ph.] like, what's wrong with him?"  But anyway, we did go, and the lady did say fine, and I, and I moved into this all-white neighborhood in Syracuse [New York].  And everybody knew I was there.  I didn't know that at that time.  There was one black guy in this neighborhood, but I was an engineer at GE so that was, you know, they knew I was an engineer.  So, the last year of the training program, and we stayed together for two years in Syracuse.  The last year of the training program, me and one of the white guys were going to Santa Barbara, California.  And the other guy, Myron [ph.], was going to Daytona Beach, Florida.  So, Carl, who is the guy with me, who later became a professor, Carl was naive, and he was going out to Santa Barbara before.  And because I had a lot of problems finding a place in the suburb of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to live, as a matter of fact, I had to, I, I have a little story.  I'll go back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 395191
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961], I finished.  I'm sorry, '64 [1964], I come off the training program [at General Electric].  I moved to, I take a permanent job in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And we're out in King of Prussia [Pennsylvania], which is outside Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: Right, I've been there, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, we are trying to find a place, me and a, a white guy, he was going to Philadelphia.  I'd better back up further.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's some interesting stories you, so let me go back to '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: We first go to this place and we live there.  Then in 1963, Carl [ph.] and I are going to Santa Barbara [California].  Myron [ph.] is going to Daytona Beach [Florida].  So, Carl was going out before me.  So, Carl said, "I'll find a place," and, you know, I said, "Now, Carl, you know, you're going, it, it, you're going to run into some problems."  He said, "Oh, no, no, won't be any problems."  I said, "Well, I'll tell you what you do.  You, you, you tell them you're going to rent the place.  You got a roommate coming later.  And then, when she says, okay, just when you get ready to walk out, or they say, okay, say, ah, by the way, he's--," at that time, they said Negro.  So, he said, "Ah, that's not going to be a problem," (makes noise).  Well, about two weeks later, I get this phone call.  Man, this here was the most down voice ever.  He said, "Oh, Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams]," said, "Man, this place is really racist."  He said, "Man, one lady, ah, she said okay."  And he said, "When I told her, she said, 'Well, I'm not going to say no, no.'"  I said, "Well, that must mean they have a fair housing law or something, huh?"  I said, "That's all right.  When I get there, we'll, we'll find a place."  I get out to Santa Barbara.  The University of Santa Barbara [University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California] is in Goleta [sic.], which is a little suburb, or something (laughter).  And we were having a hard time.  The funniest one was I called this real estate agent that all these other white guys have gotten their apartments from.  And so, I just called him.  He couldn't tell from my voice that I was black.  And he, he said, "Oh, we have many, many, many rentals for, yeah," he said, "Why don't you come down?"  So, I walked in with Carl.  Carl's like--I walk in.  And he's got this, this is an old guy.  He's got this book, this big, sitting on his desk when we walk in.  So, he says, "You won't like this one, you won't like this one, you won't like this one, as a matter of fact, you won't like any of these" (laughter).  I said, "I guess that means I'm not going to get a rental?"  He says, "That's what that means" (laughter).  So, I left.  Anyway, we eventually got an apartment out in Goleta [California].  We're by the college.  And then, one of the guys, who was on this third year of the training program, came from this Schenectady [New York] area, and was in the class with us my last year.  And so, he had told me, he wanted to--, "Well, when you came off this training program, people bidded for you.  They wanted you to come visit and so, they, they would only let you go to six places."  They said, "You gotta, you, you can't go to all the places."  And I had, I had worked in Syracuse [New York] on a job with a HR [human resources] person, and who had gone to Daytona Beach.  He said, "You got to promise me, when you graduate the program, you're going to come down to Daytona Beach."  Now, you gotta remember, this was in the '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you got to come to Daytona Beach.  He said--I said, "No, I'm not going to do that."  I said, "Okay, I will."  Well, I forgot all about it.
Story_ID: 395192
Speaker 1: When the time came to pick your six places, I picked Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and other.  And then, he said, "You got to come to Daytona Beach [Florida]."  And Myron [ph.], the guy who had roomed in Syracuse [New York], was down there.  So I, I went to Daytona Beach on one of my trips.  And, man, we got to the Daytona Beach Airport [Daytona Beach International Airport, Daytona Beach, Florida].  And I was a curiosity thing, but anyway, Myron had met a lady there who had been married before.  She had a little son who was a blond-haired little boy.  And he met me at the airport--he and his fiancee and his little, and this little boy.  He was going to marry her, and he did marry her, and they been--little boy.  Well, they both had to go do something, so they left me with this little boy.  And this little boy is running through my legs, and just, and I tell you.  So, people came through and walked into the doors, you know, it was just such a shocking thing.  Well, anyway, GE [General Electric] had to open up some hotels.  And so, the guy who'd, had me to come there, this HR [human resources] guy, says, "You're going to have to, you're staying at the--," whatever this hotel was.  So, I flew in, and they took me there.  So, I went into the hotel, it's a big old hotel, and a lot of people are in the lobby.  And I told them, "Jerry Williams [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams]," they said, "We'll get back to you, we'll get back to you," and then, and the whole place empty.  They--everybody got their room.  I say, "Is, did you forget me?"  They said, so, finally, they said, they, this, this black bellman, they said, "He'll take you to your place."  Now, this was like April--March, April, again.  So, he took my bag, we went out of the hotel, okay, went down the street.  And I didn't pay any attention and we went to a little cottage.  And I woke up the next morning, I hear all this (makes noise), man, you know, it's one of these beach houses that they have for the summertime, which were closed, and that's where they put me.  And the guy, this, this bellhop told me, I'll--he said, "Listen."  He said, "Where, where you're going?"  I said, "I'm going to GE."  He said, "How are you going to get there?"  He said, "You sure ain't going to get no taxi from here (laughter)."  I said, "What?"  He says, "I'll, I'll get one of the boys to take you to GE."  So then, I go see the guy who had told me kind of, he just breaks up.  He said, "Jerry," he said, "Man, it's, uh, what," 'cause the first place that I was going to go in Daytona Beach, he, he told me not to go there.  So, I went there.  The whole Daytona Beach experience was different.  The--but I did meet, at that time, Dr. Moore [Richard V. Moore, Sr.] was president of Bethune-Cookman [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  And so, I met him because GE was trying, they were trying to get me to come there.  And so, they took me around Bethune and--
Story_ID: 395193
Speaker 1: But anyway, this guy, Doug Baker [ph.], who wanted to move with me when we both decided to go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], he had grown up in a little town outside of Harrisburg [Pennsylvania] and hadn't, didn't know any black folk at all.  So, he wanted to room with me.  He had gone to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].  He'd seen somebody he'd never (unclear).  And so, I said, "Okay, we'll room together in Philadelphia when we get there."  So, we drove back, and we drove to his little town and we drove, driven my car.  I had a Thunderbird [Ford Thunderbird] at that time--remember those Thunderbirds?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, so that, you had what (unclear)?
Speaker 1: My, my wife [Pamella Jones Williams] said to me, said man, "When you got married, you got rid of the Thunderbird?"  Yeah.  But anyway, we had, I had one of those Thunderbirds.  Anyway--
Speaker 2: Did you have, like a '60 [1960], a '61 [1961]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of those--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I had, I had a--
Speaker 2: --had like, kind of, I noticed I--
Speaker 1: They had a, you know, they were, they were kind of like these Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz].
Speaker 2: Like a curvy kind of a front was a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then they were flat in the back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was a nice horse.  Well, anyway, I, I went with Doug into this little town--his parents, who were very nice.  And my windshield had gotten cracked 'cause a bird had run into it on the way across country.  And so, he took me to the Ford [Ford Motor Company] dealership there in town to get it fixed.  And so, I'm talking to the guy about the windshield, and he's talking to me.  And so, I say to him, uh, he said, you know, "We'll have to order it, so come back tomorrow."  I said, "Well, let me tell you where I'm staying."  This--he says, "I know where you're staying."  I--and so Doug said, "Now don't be surprised," said, "you're my guy," said, "the whole word is going out that you're in this town.  Everybody knows you're here, and where you're staying that you're staying in our house."  I, I was shocked, you know, the dealership guy said, "I know where you're staying (laughter)."  I didn't even (unclear).  Then, we got to Philadelphia, and couldn't find a place to live out in the King of Prussia [Pennsylvania] area.  And so, a, a black, there was a black engineer who, in Philadelphia area, who told me about, there was a fair housing group in King of Prussia.  And it was headed by a Jewish dentist and his wife, Dr. Krasner [ph.].  So, I went to visit with Dr. Krasner and his wife, and she said, "Oh, great, we're gonna--" 'cause we want to test this Upper Merion [Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania] and Lower Merion [Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania], this whole area, we want to, so we had a hard time, a very, very hard time.  But because we were single, we could wait it out.  We had the fair housing council guy with us, okay.  So, finally, a, a guy, who was a developer, had bought this apartment house.  He was developing a big complex over here, and he finally, after he went, when we went to him, and asked him to give us: "Could we have an apartment?"  He said, he didn't have any.  So, they sent a white couple behind us, and they quickly wanted them to sign a lease, but they wouldn't.  They brought it back to us, and so, we got into a big legal brouhaha.  They finally said, "We were going to come in."  And I told Doug, I said, "Doug, now, when we go sit down and talk to these people, they're going to tell us that they're not prejudiced, and they're going to go through all this, and they're going to say--don't say nothing because we got our objective.  Our objective is to get an apartment."
Story_ID: 395194
Speaker 1: So, we went to see this guy.  And this is now right after, this is '64 [1964].  This is right after the Kennedy assassination [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].  And they had the special units and they had the special advisors.  And so, this guy let me know, he said, "Yeah, my lawyer, you know, I can win this case, and my lawyer was one of the special advisors on the presidential--," and it was Arlen Specter.  Do you know who Arlen Specter is?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arlen Specter, right, this is the [U.S.] Senate--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he is the senator and senior citizen, the citizen--
Speaker 2: --judiciary committee, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, we got in.  Arlen Specter.  So then, they built this new complex, and because they wanted it to be integrated, they asked us to move (laughter) into it, 'cause we were good.  And, and the doorman--there was a, a white couple that lived next door to us.  And she told us one day, she said, "Somebody asked the doorman in this new place," said, "do we have any black people?"  She said, "Oh, we just have two nice young black guys, you know, that's all we have here."
Speaker 2: That's all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why.  Yeah, so the housing was a problem there, trying to find the housing.
Story_ID: 395346
Speaker 1: You were almost test cases for fair housing, yeah, test cases for fair housing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was a test case and, and them, and helped them make them a little movie, so they can use in their--but, yeah, we were the first test case.  And so, they, they backed away before we went to court 'cause the, the, the evidence was just so great.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They have a not-for-profit now that does that on a regular basis--
Speaker 2: On a regular basis--
Speaker 1: --to try to keep the--
Speaker 2: --to try to--
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: --to make sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the pressure on fair housing ordinances and they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's what they used there to, to do it.  And, and although he said Arlen Specter told him he could win, I think Arlen Specter had some thoughts, you know, "I don't want to get no bad for housing thing on my record (laughter).  I'm going, I'm gonna be governor, or senator, or president, or whatever," you know.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So, this takes us--you're, this is about 19--
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: --sixty-four [1964]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 395347
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?  And did you start attending the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] about that time?
Speaker 2: I started attending the University of Pennsylvania.  I got off the training program then so I started attending the University of Pennsylvania at, at night, that fall of '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, so fall, '64 [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: Fall of 1964.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: GE's [General Electric] very good about training and education.  And, and I got tired about, after two years a night, 'cause, you know, you can only take so many classes, you know.  And so, I, I went to my manager and told him--GE allowed in those days for you, you could go to school one day a week, okay.  They would allow you to do up to one day a week.  So, I told him, I was going to go full time this last year so I could graduate.  And I would take Thursday, but I, you know, and so, he, he said, "Fine," 'cause I was, you know, doing a good job, he said fine.  "I don't know who you're working with."  I said, "I'll come in Saturdays, you, you know."  He says, "As long as you get the work done."  And, so, I went '64 [1964] through '66 [1966], '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '66 [1966] at night.  Then, the last year, '66 [1966] to '67 [1967], I went full time, finished up in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, then you had a master's [degree] in--
Speaker 2: Master's in systems engineering and operations research, or applied math, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now.  Could you break down to us what that really means to us down here on the ground (laughter)?  I mean, what did you really learn, I mean?
Speaker 2: I--what I really learned from that was to look for similarities and things because you learned a bunch of techniques for analyzing all kinds of business problems, whether they're in manufacturing, or whether they were in, wherever they were, you learn some techniques, mathematical programming, and various kinds of techniques, or what you could use to analyze these problems, and come up with some--
Speaker 1: So, you're talking about a statistical analysis of, of--
Speaker 2: Some were statistical, some were opt-, optimization kinds of things where you had some, developed some equations or algorithms, as we call them, where you could look at stuff, and analyze them, come up with some algorithms to optimize.  I nearly--everything in life, you're, you're either trying to maximize or minimize.  And so, that's what I, I studied.  It was optimization theory and algorithms, as to how to solve these various kinds of operation problems, and try to maximize or minimize, or optimize how to make it better.  And so, those techniques and things, I carried with me the rest of my--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is the scientific way of--I guess, solving business problems--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --rather than a--
Speaker 2: --assigned to me.  A lot of people say it's management science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, I took it out at the insurance school, and some courses in the--not as much--in the business school, whatever they call the management science kind of degree.
Story_ID: 395348
Speaker 1: I guess in the '50s [1950s], '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], people started to try to look at everything in a scientific way, every problem (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  And that's when the, that's when the whole field started from--
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything from policing to you name it, as a sociology--
Speaker 2: They started really with the war.  It really started with, in World War II [WWII], George Dantzig, out at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], was asked to try to solve some, some placement of submarines and thing, problems.  And he developed some algorithms called linear program.  And that's what started this process and became a science, so analyzing almost everything scientifically and, and analytically.  And that's, that's where this field came from.  And, and one of the things that I found out, life was at, the best way to learn is by experience and knowledge.  So, if you could spend twenty-five years at something, you knew it pretty well.  And, and I give you an example later on.  But they, but the other way is that you can take data and analyze it, and, and pretty much--
Speaker 1: Come up with a similar--
Speaker 2: Come up with a similar kind of thing, you know, you know, shorter period of time.
Story_ID: 395349
Speaker 1: Where does it, where does that approach to management break down?  I mean, where is it?  Is there any place where it actually breaks down, really, it doesn't really work?
Speaker 2: If you take the concept of, of gathering all the data, analyzing it, and then trying to come to the best solution from the data, it's, it's the same process that lawyers use, you know, when you go to court.  They gather all the data, and then they come up with the--from the data, they synthesize what's the best way for them to argue your case, so it, you know, it's, the, the concept, the overall concept, scientific method is fine.  The place where it breaks down is if you don't have sufficient data, or you can't get, or the data doesn't, you can't figure out the pattern of the data, you know.  That's where it breaks down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know in social science, sometimes things break down when--
Speaker 2: Break down 'cause you can't--
Speaker 1: --'cause human behavior is so--
Speaker 2: So erratic--
Speaker 1: Sometimes.
Speaker 2: --are difficulties sometimes, you know, there might not be a pattern.  And you got to have enough data over enough period of time, so that it does look like there is a pattern that you can follow this.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Something to be able to generalize or make a generalization with, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, you can make a generalization from it.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --but, usually, when you're working with some machines or things, you know, you can, or accounting data or something, you can, you can do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, that was the, the start of my rise out of engineering into other fields.
Story_ID: 395350
Speaker 1: The important thing happened to me in--well, I did a lot of work, you know, back in those days, what they call covert work, did a lot of work for GE [General Electric]--did a lot of work, although you didn't know at the time for the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and for the [U.S.] military, and they had a lot of reconnaissance satellites that we built there.  And so, we used to, I used to work with the generals to tell them what was the optimal things to take pictures of, how to get the optimal, you know, in one of their launches and--
Speaker 2: Now that was about the time of the--well, about '67 [1967].  Well--
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], yeah--
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960]--
Speaker 1: I was there from sixty--I did, I did the work on there from about '64 [1964] 'til to '67 [1967], almost '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that was, was it 1963 when we had the Cuban Missile Crisis and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I think the part of the case again--I mean that the U.S. leveled against the Soviet Union was the pictures, the satellite photos of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  They, and, and, and if you remember, one of them got shot down, one of those guys got shot down during that period of time.
Speaker 2: Well, Gary Powers, the U-2 into Russia, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gary Powers and--no, he, he was supposed to have killed himself before he got (laughter)--he was never supposed to get caught.  Now, there, there was all kind of--as a matter of fact, he worked on this kind of stuff.  And that's why I finally got out of it, 'cause I eventually got married in this period of time.  You couldn't talk about what you worked on.  As a matter of fact, you worked in, I worked in areas that had no windows, and you had to have special access to get in.  And nobody, you know, and you had to be, they had code.  It, it was, and you worked on very sensitive kind of things, so much so, that if you got mar-, or if you took a vacation, you had to tell them, and they would say yes or no if you could go to this place because they had to have people who also were familiar with this program in those areas.  And that's where you would go if you got hurt, 'cause they didn't want you talking with, to just anybody, so it had to have doctors and dentists in the area who were--
Speaker 2: And that can be expensive, you know.
Speaker 1: And, and when I used to go out of town after I got married, I, you know, you couldn't tell your wife where you were going.  So, I'd just tell her [Pamella Jones Williams], "If you need to get hold of me," I'd tell her to call my boss.  And so, years later, we'd be talking somewhere.  And I'd say, well, "I was, I was at the space center at, in Houston [Texas] at the [Manned Spacecraft Center; Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]."  She, "When were you in Houston?"  Yeah.  I started one of the (unclear) (laughter), all right, you know, 'cause you can do that.  But, so, I, I had gotten up very, done very well in that field that I decided I'd get out.  And I, I left GE at the time to do that.
Story_ID: 395351
Speaker 1: But before that, in '66 [1966], I met my wife.  One of the black engineers that I--there were not many of us--but he was a young black engineer.  He was a dating a teacher that was at Overbrook High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is Wilt's old school [Wilt Chamberlain].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Dipper, where they went, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yep.  And, and his, the girl, the lady he was dating, told him about this very nice young lady that taught with her.  And he tried to get me to, he sent me to go on a blind date.  And he had set me up once before, and it was horrible, so, I said, "Ray [ph.], man, don't do me no favors."  And, "No, I'm not going."  He said "No, no, no, no," he said that, but, and it turned out I met Pam [Pamella Jones Williams], and met her in--about eighteen months later.  We got married in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, she was a school teacher at Overbrook, huh?
Speaker 1: She was, she was a school teacher and a, and one the things I liked about her 'cause she was also, she coached the, the gymnastics squad, and the, the, she was responsible for the cheerleaders, as well as teaching.  She taught phys ed [physical education], so she liked sports.  And so, I said, "Man, I have somebody that won't, won't beat me up when I want to watch Monday Night Football or something (laughter)."  And so, and she'll tell you that when Oscar [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson] used to play in various cities, I used to always go see him, and we used to go to this room and talk.  And [HistoryMaker] Wayne Embry, in the early days, was his roommate.  But, anyway, when he came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that time, why, he, "Man, I want to meet your girl," you know.  I, I said, "No," 'cause I thought she was going to drop me.  So, he, he didn't (unclear).  We got married, went to, she, she--said, "No, man, you're not going to meet this young lady," like we went on, and got married.  Pam was a, was a school teacher and we got married.
Story_ID: 395352
Speaker 1: I wanted to get out of the covert program area, and it was hard for me to do that at GE [General Electric].  So, in '68 [1968], I left GE, took her [Williams' wife, Pamella Jones Williams] with me.  And we met--we went to California to Menlo Park, or Palo Alto area, and worked for, at that time, it was the Stanford Research Institute [SRI International, Menlo Park, California], which was a part of Stanford University [Stanford, California], a consulting arm of Stanford.  And I went there to work on primarily transportation models and transport to help the cities to optimize their transportation patterns.  And they were just beginning to get into computerizing traffic signalization, and we were working on algorithms to help them with that.  So, we moved out to the Palo Alto area.  And we had our first child [Laurence Williams] in '69 [1969], and then bought a house out in Santa Clara [California], and had a daughter [Courtney Williams] in late '70 [1970].  They're eighteen months apart.
Story_ID: 395353
Speaker 1: You were out in Palo Alto [California], and had the U.S. Olympic trials and all that, I guess, when, but I just remember that from interviewing a few other people that they, they had some in Palo Alto--track and field, trials, and so forth (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I had--do you remember Tommie Smith?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Who gave about--Tommie Smith worked, we got him to work at, he worked the summer with us at the, at SRI [Stanford Research Institute; SRI International, Menlo Park, California].
Speaker 1: During that same period?
Speaker 2: Right after he, this was in, yeah, he did that at the '64 [1964] Olympics thing.
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], it was '68 [1968]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight Olympics [1968 Summer Olympics, Mexico City, Mexico].  Yeah, so, it was right after that, it was like '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He worked, I worked with Tommie Smith, got to know him well.
Speaker 1: Well, he was, he seemed--well, tell us, did he seem bitter about what happened because, you know, I, I met him in '69 [1969], just as a fan, and to thank him for doing that, me and another, a group of fellows that he said he's sorry he did it.  And he can't get the kind of work he wants.  He was trying out for the Bengals [Cincinnati Bengals] then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In Wilmington [Ohio], but did he seem, at that time, did he seem, or how did he--
Speaker 2: No, he was fine then.  I--maybe I don't want to put this on the record (laughter), but Tommie was not the world's brightest guy, okay.  And he was skinny, he was a track guy.  He was never a football player.  You know, there are some fast guys who are football players who run track.  He was a track guy who tried to become a football player.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he, it just--
Speaker 1: I remember him on the cover of Sports Illustrated with that lean, he had the perfect track lean--
Speaker 2: Aw, he was, he was--
Speaker 1: --and probably ran the fastest 220 [220-yard dash] that anybody--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Well, at that time, anybody had ever seen.
Speaker 2: --at the time, he did, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was--
Speaker 2: But he was, and he hadn't prepared himself in, at school, you know, he hadn't prepared himself.  He really hadn't taken it serious.  So, we, you know, we get, he got a job there, but there wasn't enough--he didn't have any skills.
Speaker 1: I think he went on, though, to do athletics at Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], I think, right?
Speaker 2: He did athletics, became a, and that's what he should have done all the time.  He should have coached, and tried to go up--I, I think, training, become athletic director, or something like that.  It was more than, than industrial, and football (laughter), yeah.
Story_ID: 395354
Speaker 1: We were out there for five years, SRI [Stanford Research Institute; SRI International, Menlo Park, California], got tear-gassed out there.
Speaker 2: And how did that happen?
Speaker 1: You know, you remember the, the students were protesting a lot about the industrial military complex [military industrial complex] back in the mid-'60s [1960s].  And they were having tremendous problems with these, little rich kids at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  You know, they were really--and I had been given a, a critical skills waiver.  So, I never had to go into the [U.S.] military, you know, they used to give you, if you, if you worked in some critical area, they'd give you an exemption because it's as if, if we really have to draft you, we'll just draft you in, 'cause you're, 'cause I was doing work for the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], you know, saying those things so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I, I didn't have to go in.  But, so, I'd missed all that, you know.  And then, in the building, we were in a building in the Stanford Research--in the park, right off the campus there.  And students threw their tear gas bomb through the windows before the troops moved them out.  So, we had to, you know, we had to cough our way out of the building, yeah.  But then, they separated them, so they bought themselves from Stanford University and it became an independent research and consulting firm.  And it's still out there, SRI International, Menlo Park, California.   So, I worked there for five years, mostly in transportation.
Speaker 2: Did you have any thoughts about the war effort at that, in those days yourself, about what was going on in Vietnam and so forth?
Speaker 1: (Pause).
Speaker 2: The country was divided, and some people thought the black people should not have an opinion about it.  And Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got in trouble for saying something about it and for criticizing it.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: So, it wasn't something that was on the tip of everybody's tongue, you know, in terms of a critique but--
Speaker 1: Well, I had the same difficulty with that war that I had with this war.  I never could see the reason why we went into this war.
Speaker 2: This Iraq War today in 2007, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This Iraq War today, and because, you know, they kept saying they had weapons of mass destruction, but they never could, these guys never could find them, right?  And it was obvious that Bush [President George Walker Bush] was going to go into this war anyway for whatever reason, whether it was because they thought Hussein [Saddam Hussein] had sneered his nose at his father [President George Herbert Walker Bush], whatever he thought.  And, and the Vietnam War, you know--I, I don't believe, I don't believe, I don't believe we're the police of the world.  I, I just don't believe that, you know.  And some of these things, they are, they're really civil.  I, I don't, I, I wasn't scared of communism, or any kind of socialistic government.  I mean, that didn't scare me.  I guess it scares our government.  It scared a lot of people.  So, I never could figure out why we were there.  We were just losing people left and right, like we're doing now, although we don't seem to have, to be able to come up with a solution.  The--we should never have gotten into this war.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 395355
Speaker 1: So you were at Stanford [Stanford Research Institute; SRI International, Menlo Park, California].  And did anything else happen there of--see, like, a second child--well, two children [Laurence Williams and Courtney Williams] born by 1970, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, by the end of '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --two children born at Stanford Medical Center [Stanford, California].  And GE [General Electric] used to call me every six months.  Somebody from GE used to call me about coming back and, yeah.  And so, finally, I told them if, because GE had begun to become known as a great teacher and innovator of the field of strategic planning.  I told them if I could get a job in the strategic planning work, I would, 'cause I'd been, you know, I wanted to get into the industrial side, then I would come back.  And so, they said, "Okay (laughter)."
Story_ID: 395356
Speaker 1: My wife [Pamella Jones Williams] always wanted to live in Connecticut.  She was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], boy, she's an only child.  And she lived a much more privileged life than I did.  She--by the way, she went to Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], undergrad and she got her master's [degree] at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], education at the same time that I got mine.  I finished up my master's at University Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Did, did she know Cosby [Bill Cosby]?  I'm just (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes--
Speaker 2: I thought she would.
Speaker 1: --she knew Cosby.  Well, she knew Chamberlain [Wilt Chamberlain].  The reason was, her father was a guidance counselor/coach in Philadelphia.  He had gone to Union, and coached there many years.  And he participated in track for many years.  As a matter of fact, he was in a book 'cause he, he was the second leading only black pole vaulter in 1938, and should have made the Olympics.  But he couldn't get his equipment there on time, or he would have been with Cornelius [Cornelius Johnson], and whatever Cornelius say--it'd come back to me--but anyway, but her father coached.  And so, Wilt and all those guys knew her father.  So, they used to come to, and then, Wilt used to come to Overbrook's [Overbrook High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] basketball games, and things where she was.  And her father would be there sometimes and so, yes, she knew Cosby and Wilt and--
Speaker 2: And Dr. Arthur Thomas [Arthur E. Thomas] used to be president of the Central [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] was from there, too.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: No, she knew, she knew Herb Adderley played football]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --played football for Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For the Packers [Green Bay Packers], yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then for the Packers.  He was her--she knew, she was, she was in the same, she started with the same dance, you know, how I am about Oscar [HistoryMaker Oscar Robertson]--Judy Jamison [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison] who was--
Speaker 2: Judith Jamison, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who's the artistic director now for the Alvin Alley thing [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], and danced with.  Well, she and Judy were in the same dance classes in Philadelphia.  And she said she knew then that she was not going to be a dancer 'cause Judith Jamison was (laughter)--she said, "Oh, man," she'd say.  And my wife also played tennis on the black circuit court with Arthur Ashe.  She was a good tennis player.  Yeah, but they went on a, they had, you know, these, these--I forgot what they call it, something circuit.  And she said Arthur used to come and just beat her (laughter)--just smack everybody down, yeah, 'cause 'cause she knew that he was coming.  This is when she was young, and she played, when she was 12 or 15, she played tennis with Arthur Ashe.
Speaker 2: That's incredible, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And she told--I forgot the name of the circuit that they used to participate in--but she was a good tennis player.
Story_ID: 395357
Speaker 1: So, Pam [Williams' wife, Pamella Jones Williams] and I moved, we had the children [Laurence Williams and Courtney Williams].
Speaker 2: So, we got you-by like 1971, it says here that you started actually working for GE [General Electric] again?
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973]?
Speaker 1: It should be '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I, I got, I got a job.  And I, I always tell people, I know my wife loves me.  They say, how you know your wife loves you?  I said, "I took my wife from the San Francisco Bay Area [California] to Erie, Pennsylvania."  That's where I went to work for GE at the transportation division of GE in strategic planning, Erie, Pennsylvania.  Oh, man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Erie is--
Speaker 1: It's a blue collar town.
Speaker 2: --near Ohio, near, near the Cleveland [Ohio] area (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a--Erie is about halfway between Cleveland and Buffalo [New York], right on the Lake Erie, right up--is that Interstate 90 [I-90]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --one of those interstates.
Speaker 2: That's all football country up there, and it's cold weather country, snow, right.
Speaker 1: Aw, man, it's snow, it's cold.  They dropped twelve inches, the only thing that about it, oh, man.  And it's a blue collar town--Erie is, oh, man.  It was a tough town for me.  GE was good.  And they made sure that I had--we found a nice place to live.  We lived in a little town called Fairview, Pennsylvania, right outside of Erie.  Pam did very well.  I'd, I'd--man, it was, it was, (unclear).  I, I worked there for two years and learned a lot about strategic planning, 'cause GE, I got to work with--there's, there's two premiere consulting groups in this country.  One is the McKinsey group [McKinsey and Company] out in New York [New York], and the other is a Boston consulting group out of Boston [Massachusetts].  Mackenzie, and they all hire mostly Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] M.B.A.'s and high powered, but anyway, I got to work with them for two years on the strategy for the locomotive business at GE.
Speaker 2: So, the strategy for the--
Speaker 1: Locomotive business.  GE, GE is, makes, GE is the largest locomotive supplier now.  It used to be GE and GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  GM used to be, but GE because of the strategy and the cost (unclear) had become the largest.
Speaker 2: So, GE builds the engines for these kind of--
Speaker 1: They build the locomotive, everything--
Speaker 2: Oh, everything.
Speaker 1: --the, the engines, the diesel engines, everything.  They build the whole (unclear) and big test tractor.  It's almost like a little city in itself.  You walk in there and they have traffic lights (laughter) and policemen because it's a big complex.  And they build--if, if you see, if you look at Amtrak [National Railroad Passenger Corporation], all their locomotives are made with GE and a lot of them here for the, for the--
Speaker 2: For the Metra?
Speaker 1: --Metra.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Metra trains.
Speaker 1: The, the sleek new ones are GE, own GE, but anyway, I went there for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we tend to think of GE as just electrical engines.
Speaker 1: Was--they started the diesel engines in, and, yeah, they made the locomotives.  GE was a diversified conglomerate.  They made everything from--in your part of the country, aircraft engines in Evendale [Ohio], right outside Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Evendale (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Evendale. MCG light bulb (unclear).  They make light bulbs in Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, finance.
Speaker 1: I tell--and then, they make big ole locomotives in Erie.  And then, they made, they used to make, you know, little appliances and those things, but--
Speaker 2: Window fans and such, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and such things and now, and then very sophisticated medical diagnostic equipment now.  So, it, it was a very great place and, okay.
Speaker 2: Can you, yeah, just, just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was a very great place.  And, and that's where I really learned about the balance sheet, the income statement.  I really learned how to manage, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 395207
Speaker 1: Go ahead (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At GE [General Electric], the biggest one was I was going to bring you up in here is this guy named Lou Tomasetti [Louis V. Tomasetti].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Lou Tomasetti ran this transportation division at GE.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: T-O-M-E-S--I think, it's two S's, S-S-E-T-T-I [sic.].  I have to look at it.  Let me see if I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --let me see if that's right.  No, Tomasetti, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is L-O-U--
Speaker 2: L-O-U--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Louis Tomasetti.
Speaker 1: Lou Tomasetti at GE, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Lou convinced me to come to--I was going to go work at corporate headquarters in, in Fairfield [Connecticut].  And he convinced me to come to--he said, "Well, if you really want to learn strategic planning, I'll give you the opportunity."  And when I interviewed, he asked me--we talked about, you know, why I left GE before.  And I told him, I said, "Well, I, I just thought that it was going to be hard for me to move on."  And he said, "Well, you're right," 'cause at that time, one of the vice chairmen was anti-black, but he said, "He's gone now."  And by this time, Reginald Jones [Reginald H. Jones] was now the president and CEO, and he was a good man.  And, and so, Lou asked me, "What did, what would it take to get me to come there?"  And he wanted me to come, and all that stuff.  And, and, you know, GE used to be, pretty hard to get, you know, take you three, three weeks to get your offer letter, and all that kind of stuff.  And so, he told me, said, "I'm very serious about you coming.  I want you to come and work and," and so, he had his HR [human resources] guy take me to the airport.  Now, he ran the division, you know.  And there was about, the division was 5, 600 million [dollars], and there were about four, and another 150, 200, 300 million dollar companies in, in the division.  So, he told me, he said, "I'm going to have Allen [ph.] take you to the airport."  And they gave me an offer letter on the way, which convinced, which, which impressed me with him, you know 'cause he was, and it was everything I'd asked for.  So, I went home to my wife [Pamella Jones Williams].  She was with her mother.  And I told her, she is planning to move to Connecticut.  I said, "How would you like to take a little exile to Erie [Pennsylvania]?"  She said, "Where?"  But we went there.  And it was--I was there for two years.  And one day, after I'd been there two years--now I was--Erie was tough, and Lou had left.  He was, forgot where he was--he'd gone somewhere.
Story_ID: 395208
Speaker 1: And I got a phone call from an executive search guy, a black guy that I knew in California.  He said a, buddy of mine, who had a search firm out of Seattle [Washington], he's going to want to talk to you.  And I wanted, I didn't want you to hang up on him.  And I didn't talk to, to many search guys, so I kind of (unclear), and so said, "I don't want you to hang up on him.  So, I want you to talk to him--he's got an opportunity."  So, the guy called me, and what he, what it was, was, there was an automotive parts company here in Chicago [Illinois] called Maremont [Maremont Automobile Products, Inc.].  And Maremont was a publicly held company.  It was about 400 million [dollars].  And he was looking for a vice president of corporate planning and administration.  And I was kind of hesitant about talking, but then I, I decided to come out.  And I came out and talked, and this guy, who convinced me to come and work for him, his name was Richard Black [Richard B. Black], and he had the most profound impact on my life.
Speaker 2: Richard Black, okay.
Speaker 1: Richard Black.  He was the president/chairman of Maremont before me.  He was a young guy, dynamic.  He told me, he said, you know, in the interview, he said, you know, and this is 1975, and I would be coming to this company as vice president.  I'd be the only black person who wasn't in the mailroom at this company.  And he said, I want to make a statement anyway.  There's a--I, I found this out later--there's a group that tries to train youngsters from high school, prepare them for the business world.  It was called INROADS [INROADS, Inc.].  Are you familiar with them?  Have you ever heard of that?
Speaker 2: I was, I've heard of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They, they were here, and he had helped to start them, but they're, they're headquartered in Nashville [Tennessee] now.  But anyway, he always wanted to shake up things, you know, so he said, it, this would be great to have a black guy coming.  And we talked, and but I liked him, 'cause he was a very bright guy.  And he was giving me the responsibility for corporate planning and development for the company.  So, in 1975, I came to Chicago as a vice president of corporate planning and development for Maremont corporation which was a maker of automotive parts.

Speaker 1: They made--this is the first time I learned anything about, between brand and, and generic kind of stuff.  When I came, they [Maremont Automobile Products, Inc.] made a, a muffler for and, and, I mean, well, they made a shock for Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] that was called the Steady Rider.  And it costs--I forgot the price, but I'll say $10.99.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you go to a factory, and these shocks came down the line, and they came to the paint booth.  This one in here came out a Steady Rider, 10.99.  This one here came out a shock called Gabriel King of the Road shock, cost you $39.99.  Now, they don't, they've cut that out now, but I, I was shocked.  I said, wait a minute, I--people not that (laughter).  I kid you not--the same shock.  I couldn't believe it.
Speaker 2: You know, you hear people say that, and I've told people in auto stores, say, that's the same thing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --as this.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, it does, if it does the same function and will last the same, it's the same thing--
Speaker 1: It's the same.
Speaker 2: --say, no, this one is better.
Speaker 1: No, that's what they used to say.  King of the Road and they, you know, they put a lot of market in advertising into it.  And people pay $39.99.  It used, it used to compete with Monroe shocks, but now they're, but anyway, it did.  Sears, Sears was the Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] of that day, and they made things cheaper for us.  Man, I couldn't believe it.  They made--I forgot how many shock absorbers a year.  I said, I can't believe that.  Those, those machines are going (makes noise).  They made--so people, but today, you have struts on your car, so they don't fit, different.
Story_ID: 395210
Speaker 1: One of the things that I did when I got there [Maremont Automobile Products, Inc.] was I took over the mergers and acquisitions program for, for them.  And so, Rick [Richard B. Black] told me, he said, look, after I'd been working for him for six months, and he got to know, and he said, "Okay, I'm going to send everybody that talks about mergers or acquisitions to you.  I'm not even going to talk to them, and you tell me when I should be interested."  And he said, "So, if somebody wants to like, if somebody wants to buy me," and he gave me some outlandish price, our stock was, I forgot, like twenty-two [dollars], prices, forty [dollars].  I don't know--it was some outlandish price, thirty-five [dollars].  But I worked hard.  Many times, we came close to merging to get ourselves to--because Rick was very bright, and people were very impressed with him.  He, he's, he's one, he could talk to you about something, and you wouldn't have to edit anything.  He--the paragraph, it--each subject you asked him to talk on, he would just sit down and talk to you, and it'd be just perfect.  But he was very bright.  The thing that's interesting about him is he grew up in Houston [Texas] (pause).  And I finally asked him, years later, why was he like what he was, because that was not the usual kind of place you expected somebody.  He went to Texas A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas; Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas], and got his undergraduate, and got his M.B.A. at Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts]--very bright, but he liked brains over anything else.  So, if you were smart, and you knew the job--that's what he told me--said, "Now, we got a lot of basketballs hanging around on the floor.  And you're free to pick them up, but you better score.  That's all I ask for.  So, I don't care whether you're green, purple, or black, you just score."  I said, "Fine, that's fine with me."  So, I worked on lots of--I, I got to be, I have to know them all.  And we had so many deals that egos just--I--there's a big law firm here, called, in New York [New York], too, called Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom [Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP].  They're very well-known in mergers, acquisitions, takeovers.  I spend many nights in New York on Wall Street negotiating merger deals.  I spent a whole weekend one time with a company, sitting up in a Westin hotel in downtown Detroit [Michigan].  We're going to merge, and we'd bring back the thing to our, to our CEOs, and they would say, "Oh, man, you just got me cutting ribbons.  I'm not going to do that, and they'd, you know, be good for the, it'd be good for the shareholders.  I'm not going to do that."  And so, they'd scrape the whole deal then.  I'd--so, after about, and we, we made an unfriendly takeover offer.  And so, I've been through all that, and in the court many times to testify.  And 1978, Christmastime, I'd told Rick, I said, "Rick, when you go--," he had a nice place out in Jackson Hole [Wyoming]--I said, "When you go out to Jackson Hole for Christmas, I want you to think about something.  You got to think about how you want to do, 'cause some companies are now beginning to approach that price to me, that you'd said you'd be willing to talk to them about."
Story_ID: 395211
Speaker 1: One story, and I'll--
Speaker 2: Oh, please, please, a story, c'mon (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) just one story on, just one story on the, well--
Speaker 2: Let's hear it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I told you, Rick [Richard B. Black] told I was responsible for mergers and acquisitions [at Maremont Automobile Products, Inc.].  So, and so, he did.  He, he would talk to me, send the person to see me.  So, the offices that we had, had your name on it, like mine did, but it was all glass, so they could see you when they--so his secretary called me, and said she was sending some guy to see me.  He wanted to talk about a potential acquisition.  So, this guy came down.  He stepped in the door and saw me.  He stepped back out, looked at the name.  He said, "Are, are you Jerry Williams [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams]?"  I said, "Yeah, I'm Jerry Williams."  He said, "Are you Jerry O--(laughter)."  "Yeah, I'm Jerry O."  He said, "Oh, so," he started talking about, he wanted to talk about this acquisition.  And somewhere along the line, he started talking about black folk.  And he started talking about, "They're not smart enough to do this, and they're not smart enough to do that."  And I said, "Wait a minute, I'm black."  He said, "You're not black, you're mixed (laughter)."  I said, "I, I--."  He said, "No, you're not black--oops."  So, I, but I, I really, one time, we were negotiating a deal in Toronto [Canada].  And the lawyer was a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] guy, and he looked the part, you know, he wore Harry Gomer [ph.] suits, and he wore these little glasses.  So, when we--he got to the place before I did.  And he, he, and they were talking to him and everything.  And so, he had told them that the decision was mine, but they didn't hear him, yeah.  And so, they just kept talking to him, and just kept talking to him, and they didn't even pay any attention to me when I came in and sat down.  They kept talk--.  They went through the whole deal.  They went through everything.  And so, they finally asked, "What, what do you think about this?"  He said, "Well, I'm not going to make decision--Jerry is."  You know, they were (laughter) they were nonplussed for the fact 'cause, first of all, they didn't believe him, but I, I didn't do the deal--but it wasn't because it wasn't, because of them.  But, you know, I should get (unclear).  I had to prove that I knew about how the, how to evaluate a company, evaluations.  I also had to prove about how you could structure deals, and all kinds of terms and things.  I should do that all the time.  And once they found out that I knew what I was talking about, then it became okay and then after a while--
Story_ID: 395212
Speaker 1: Anyway, we got acquired by a Swiss company in 1979, and Rick Black [Richard B. Black]--the Swiss company was called Alusuisse [Schweizerische Aluminium AG] located in Zurich [Switzerland].
Speaker 2: That's--how, yeah, how do you spell that?  That's--
Speaker 1: I have to--
Speaker 2: I think there's a spelling here.  This is the correct one, just, let's see.
Speaker 1: It's probably (unclear).
Speaker 2: That--is that correct?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, we do have it, so, in case anybody in the company wants to see it, it'd be in the file.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's (unclear).
Speaker 2: But the company is in (unclear) so--
Speaker 1: They acquired us [Maremont Automobile Products, Inc.].  They were a big aluminum mining conglomerate out of Zurich, and they made Rick the head of Alusuisse of America.  And they told Rick that they wanted to put--back in those days, it was a big number, you know, they wanted about several million dollars' worth of assets over here in America.  So, Rick said, "Well, I want to bring Jerry Williams [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams] with me to Alusuisse of America as the vice president of development."
Speaker 2: Now, this is what year again?  This is sixty--?
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979]--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979], okay.
Speaker 1: --when we finally sold to them.  And so, they told him, fine.  So, then, they came to Chicago [Illinois] to hear presentations from Rick's team that he was going to take with him to Alusuisse.  And so, everybody did well.  I was the last one in the program (laughter).  Man, the guys' teeth dropped when I walked into the room.  And they had a, they, they had three top guys that they called the presidium.  And the president and two co-presidents, a vice president and a, and the president's name was Meyer [Emanuel R. Meyer].  Boy, I--it, the disdain on their face was so bad, yeah, so he wouldn't even let me finish my presentation.  He said, he said, "We're not learning anything from this.  We don't really need to hear the rest of this."  I said, "Fine, that's fine, I'll leave."  So, when I came out, Rick asked me, "So how did it go?"  I said, "It went very bad."  I said, "They asked me (unclear)."  He said, "Is that right?"  He said, he said, "Well, I'll take care of that."  Anyway, he did, yeah, it was some kind of way, he got them to let me take, Alusuisse America.
Story_ID: 395213
Speaker 1: Chairman loved Frenchmen, who we had sent over here to run Swiss aluminum mining USA, in Denver [Colorado], which was under Rick [Richard B. Black].  And he needed to, they needed to buy some coal mines, and so Rick asked me to go out there and work with this Frenchman.  His name was Pierre [ph.], and Pierre and I got along very well.  The chairman loved him.  He was a big, powerful school guy.  You could see that the ladies would like him 'cause he was a big, good-looking, rugged kind of a guy, married.  And then, so we analyzed the American Electric Power which is headquartered in Columbus [Ohio].  Now it's been in New York [New York].  They were selling coal mines out in Utah.  And so, we were looking to buy them.  And so, Pierre told me that the chairman wanted to buy them in the worst way.  So, I said, "Okay," so we put the presentation together, and I went to New York.  At that time, American Electric Power was in New York.  Remember, American Electric Power, people had a legal law firm in New York to meet there, and our lawyers.  Ad so, when they, they--I've forgotten what the number was.  They, they wanted ninety-five dollars a term for the coal, and--or the, the number came out to be 95 million.  And I wanted to pay 75 million [dollars] for it.  And they didn't pay much attention, but anyway, at the--so they kept talking and they talked.  And finally, they said that 95 [million dollars] was the last price they could pay.  And so, then, the lawyer from Shearman and Sterling [Shearman and Sterling LLP, New York, New York] asked me, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams], what do you think?"  I said, "Well, if that's their last answer, I think this meeting is over.  Thank you."  So, we left.  They were stunned.  Pierre, the Frenchman who was a good, said, "Oh, man, (unclear)," he say, "No," I told him, I said, "Don't, don't worry.  They got, they ain't got no place, they can sell these gold mines (laughter) (unclear).  I guarantee you he will call me in two weeks."  Man, he called me in a week, said, "Jerry, can you and I get together?  We don't have any lawyers.  I think we can strike a deal."  I said, "I knew you were going--," and, and we were able to strike a deal for my price, okay, close to my price.  But what happened was, because of that, Pierre spoke well of me to the chairman of Alusuisse [Schweizerische Aluminium AG], and I was able to continue there working.
Story_ID: 395214
Speaker 1: After about six months, Rick [Richard B. Black], 'cause I told you, who had been my mentor, he and the Swiss weren't getting along, and so, he decided to leave [Schweizerische Aluminium AG].  We're, we're over in (laughter), we're over in Zurich [Switzerland] at a board meeting.  We're making a presentation.  Now, Rick had always sat with them.  They, they, you know, he's our man.  And so, he came to the meeting, sit with us.  And they came, sit on the other side of the table.  I said, "Rick, yeah, they tell us before."  He said, "Yeah, he was going to leave."  They--he said (laughter), "We came to make a decision."  The French--I mean, the Swiss were looking at a calendar.  He was looking at a watch 'cause they took a long, long time to make decisions.  And they, they wanted to do a joint venture acquisition here in the U.S. with a French company that makes cars, and I can't remember--it'll come back to me.  And so, I was put in charge of the team to do this between the French, the Swiss, and us.  And did the analysis, and said that it wasn't, it shouldn't be done.  The French called up the Swiss and said that I had, I had really smeared the numbers, you know.  So, Meyer [Emanuel R. Meyer] said he would send over his guy in Switzerland to, and Rick was upset.  But I said, that, let him come because the analysis is the analysis.  You know, that's when they--and sure enough, he came over and found out that everything was fine and great, and that also helped me with the chairman.  As a matter of fact, he tried to get me to come over to Zurich for a couple of years to work with the analysis group.  But Rick left, and for the next six months, I reported in to this pre-, presidium.  And so, I had to go to Zurich once a month to meet with them.  And so, they told me, they said, "You know, Mr. Williams [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams], you Americans are too much in a hurry.  That was Rick Black's problem.  And here's what we want you to do.  We want you to come and spend two years in Zurich.  Then we're going to send you two years in one of them places, Brazil, Argentina.  And then, we'll send you two years, and then you can come back corporate as a--."  I said, "Man."
Story_ID: 395215
Speaker 1: But about two days later, my phone rang, and it was Lou Tomasetti [Louis V. Tomasetti] from GE [General Electric].  He had been promoted to head up a bigger division.  It's a, a group in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and he asked me if I'd come by and have lunch with him.  So, I went back to have lunch with him.  What he wanted me to do was--he said, "I have an astronaut here who doesn't know anything about strategic planning, GE, and if you would come and work, work with him, in teaching GE strategic planning, I'd be most appreciative."  I said, "Oh, man, Lou, I'm ready to run something, a division." He said, "Well, if you'll work with him for eighteen months, I'll give you--," and he gave me, he told me a division he'd get me to run.  I said, well, let me meet him.  His name was Bill Anders [William Anders].  He had been on Apollo [Apollo 8].  He'd been the first crew there with Frank Borman.  They'd gone around the moon.  They were the first ones to go around the moon.  And he gave me a picture, and I want to tell you, it's a picture, it's a picture of them coming around the moon.  They're looking out at Earth, and this picture, you know, here's Earth, you can see it out there.  And it is black, the rest of the page is black, and it's just black.  The stain looked like it's just hanging out there by itself.  So, I, I went, I, I left Alusuisse of America and went back to work for GE (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) GE, and now what year is this?  This is--
Speaker 1: This is 1980 (pause).  I--it's probably not on there because I didn't stay long.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, um-hm.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But I went back to work.  Lou told me to come back.  And I went and I met with Bill, and we liked each other.  And so, I went to become his, to teach him how to do strategic planning.  I run this planning operation.  Bill was a good guy.  He, he stayed at GE for a couple of years, then he went to Textron [Textron, Inc.], and eventually went to General Dynamics [General Dynamics Corporation], became CEO there and, and made a whole bunch of money.
Story_ID: 395216
Speaker 1: One of the things that Bill [William Anders]--one day we were having a group meeting of all the division heads and, and they were talking about a guy, who used to be a televangelist, named, Rex Lumbard, Umbard [sic. Rex Humbard] in the--
Speaker 2: Rex Lumbard [sic.], right, in Ohio (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lumbard, in, oh, in Akron [Ohio].
Speaker 2: In Akron, yeah.
Speaker 1: But he had run in some difficulties and they were making some fun of him.  And so, they were going around the table and talking about it.  And so, he came to me--
Speaker 2: Rex Humbard.
Speaker 1: Humbard, Humbard, yeah.  And they came to me and asked me.  I said, "Well, I'm just an old fundamental Bible believer."  That's what I said to them.  So, the next Wednesday when I went to meet with Bill Anders, we were supposed to talk about a strategic plan for the next year.  He said, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams], I know we're supposed to talk about strategic plans," so he closed the door and locked it.  Said, man, he said, "You know, I heard you say you're just an old fundamental Bible believer."  He said, "Man, you noticed that all the astronauts, when they come back, are spiritual."  He said, "You want to know what?"  He said, "I was a Catholic, but I'd become an agnostic."  He said, "But, you know, why you became that way?"  He said, "You saw that picture I gave you?"  He said, "Man, that doesn't do justice."  He said, "Man, when you go out there, there's Earth--it ain't hanging on nothing.  There's a moon--it ain't hanging on nothing.  It's just sitting out in this thing.  And there's an--and he started saying," he says, and "So, you say to yourself, somebody got this whole equation.  So, he said, it must be a God."  So, we spent four hours for me to talk to him (laughter), about the Bible and God.  It's strategic planning.   Anyway, Bill was a good guy.  He--I worked for him for three or four months.  He was surprised, but my family didn't want to move back up to New York.
Story_ID: 395217
Speaker 1: Okay, we were, you were working with Bill Anders [William Anders].  And I guess you were working with him in 1980, you said, but it didn't last too long but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty [1980], yeah, I was still, I was living in Chicago [Illinois] with my family.  And Lou Tomasetti [Louis V. Tomasetti], who was Bill Anders' boss, was the one that told me to come back.  He told me I didn't have to move and so I was commuting.  But it--well, I, I, either, I was going to have to move my family there or something because it was, I was, I was, it was tough trying to commute to Syracuse, New York every weekend.  And so, my son [Laurence Williams], who was about twelve, told his mother [Pamella Jones Williams] that, not only did he not want to move, he didn't even want to discuss it, you know (laughter).  That's the way he told his mother.  She said, "You got a little problem."  But so, the family didn't want to move.  And I came home one weekend, let's see, must have been April, April-ish, and when I came home that Sunday before I was getting ready to go back, I got a phone call.  And it was from Rick Black [Richard B. Black], and he said to me, "I know you're working with GE [General Electric], but listen, I'm going to take over, I'm going to go in as chairman, president of this company.  And I'm going to want you to come and work for, I want you to come and work for it."  And I said, "Geez, Rick, Rick, who, who's the company?"  He said, "Well, I can't--it's, it's a, it's a public company.  I'd be giving you inside information."  I said, "Well, I know every public company that is in trouble."  And he said, "Well, I'll give you this.  They're headquartered in California, and they used to be in, outside of Cleveland [Ohio]."  I said, "It's got to be AM International [AM International, Inc.]."  He said, "Yeah."   I said, "But Roy Ash [Roy Lawrence Ash]," who had been with Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], so I said, "Roy Ash is chairman."  He said, "Well, next Friday, I'm gonna be chairman (laughter)."  He said, "I'll tell you what I want you to do."  He said, "I don't want you to say anything.  I just want you to go--I, well," I told him, I said, "I don't want to move to California.  I just, never, I don't want to move."  He said, "I want you to go, get their fact book, and then, you tell me where the headquarters should be."  Well, I went and got the fact book, and all their plants and things were here in the Chicago area, so I said the headquarters should be, too.  So, anyway, we worked out a deal.  And after about four months, I left Anders, and came back to Chicago to work for AM International as the senior vice president of corporate planning and development under Rick Black.  And he told me, if you help me clean up this mess, then I'll give you something to run.  Now, Lou Tomasetti was very angry at me 'cause he had pushed hard to get me back in GE because I was at a very high level.  But, about three months later, Jack Welch called him, and had him come to New York as the EVP [executive vice president].  I told him, I said, "Man, you would have left me high and low, you know, you know."  So, we both said we were still buddy-buddy, but he, he had helped shepherd me in General Electric.  And Rick--I became the senior vice president.
Story_ID: 395218
Speaker 1: Immediately, the company was in great difficulty.  They had overstated a lot of things, and it looked like to us that, the only way we could do it was to take it into bankruptcy.  And Rick [Richard B. Black] hung with it for about a year, but he didn't want to take it into bankruptcy.  So, he left, and so, but just before he left, I went, and so I had to, to get us enough money to finance us through bankruptcy.  I went and sold about three or four divisions, and we generated about 30, $40 million worth of cash, which we (laughter), you know, you, you had to keep it away from your creditors because they sweep everything.  And so, I remember one, one, one business we sold in Cleveland [Ohio].  The, the general counsel and I, and the outside counsel went there, and we would transaction the business.  And we told them where to send the money, to this little obscure bank in New Jersey, and he asked me, he said, "Where are you guys going?"  Well, I was going one way, and Jack [ph.] was going another way, we thought--he said, "Well, who are you, you, who are your guys?  I mean, you, say, you guys, are you really from here?"  I said, "Yeah, we--," but anyway, 'cause we went into bankruptcy about a week later, but we got the money, and we went into bankruptcy.  And the, they, they made--when Rick decided to leave, the finance guy at AM [AM International, Inc.] came in to talk to me, and told me that why, I'd figured it out that they were--he would become the president/CEO.  Well, this finance guy and I had worked together at Maremont [Maremont Automobile Parts, Inc.] with Rick, and he had tried to, he had tried to get rid of me there several times and by, you know, just crazy things, you know.  What--when I first went to work for Maremont, I'll give you just a little story.  Rick had told everybody, nobody can--their budgets can't be greater than a 5 percent increase, except Jerry's [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams], since he's new and coming in, and everything."  So, everybody came at 5 percent, and I said, "Shoot, I ain't dumb, I'm coming in at 5 percent, too."  And, sure enough, I went to my budget meeting, and Rick was there and this guy, Joe Freeman, this, he was chief financial officer.  He was there and he told me afterwards, he said, "Man, I had come to gun you down, but you came within the 5 percent," but he did all kinds of little things.  And, finally, when I finally had to tell Rick to call him off or, you know, I wasn't going to been able to do my job 'cause I kept trying to answer things.  And I was always, I could answer them and do well, but then, he would come up with something else, you know.  So, anyway, now he's going to become--I, I wasn't going to go to AM and ask, so I asked Rick, I said, "Is Joe coming?"  And he said, "Joe is not coming," so I said, "Okay, well, I'll come."  So, I came, and when I got there--oh, by the way, Joe came.  I said, "Oh, man."  Anyway, I, you know, the company was in so much trouble that he didn't have time to just mess with me, but he, so he became chairman.  He came in to see, see me when I, because I had a better contract than he had.  And, you know, when you go, when you're in bankruptcy, you can disavow all kinds of contracts.  And he told me he was going to disavow my contract, yeah.  I said, "Fine, fine."  So, about three months later, I came in and told him that I was going to leave, "Joe, I was going to leave," I was.  And he said, "What are you--you told him about--." I said, "No."  He said, he had asked me about two weeks before what, what division would I--'cause Rick had told me, I'd get a division after I helped him with the planning.  He asked me, "What division would I really like to run?"  I said, well, "I'd really like to run the Bruning division [AM Bruning Ltd.], but Dieter's [Dieter E.A. Tannenberg] submitted in the seat."  He said, "Okay."  Well, he called me up after he asked me not to talk about it, and said, "How would you like to go run Bruning?  This is Joe Freeman (laughter)."  I said, "I'd love to do that. What are you going to do with Dieter?"  He said, "Well, I'm going to get rid of this guy, and I'm going to put Deiter over in this other division."  So, the guy that I thought was my biggest enemy gave me my first big operating job.  The Bruning division was about a $100 million division of AM.  This is 1982, and I went out there to run it.
Story_ID: 395219
Speaker 1: I should always say that when black guys, during those days, when black people got close to something, you know, to a big job, a big operating job, they would--you remember [HistoryMaker] Richard Hatcher ran Gary [Indiana]--
Speaker 2: Hatcher, yeah, Mayor Hatcher, right.
Speaker 1: --one of the first blacks.  You know, I used to say that, "That they'll give you a Gary to run (laughter)," you know.  That's what they'll give you, guys, you know, so I said, "Fine, I'll do," you know, you just have to learn to turn it around.
Speaker 2: It was, about time we get control, it's been used up for something, you know--
Speaker 1: Messed up, it's, it's in bad shape.
Speaker 2: Carl Stokes got Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, same kind of thing.
Speaker 2: --when the lake [sic. Cuyahoga River] was on fire.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, and that's, you know, and so the Bruning division [AM Bruning Ltd.] was one of the divisions that AM [AM International, Inc.] would hope to keep after they come out to (unclear), but it needed to be really--it had, you know, you had to do it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was it pretty bad?
Speaker 1: It, it was in tough shape.
Speaker 2: What did Bruning do?
Speaker 1: They made a, a machines--you remember blueprints?  They made those machines.  Now, everything comes on plain paper copies.  But in those days, they made them deliver the biggest engineering graphics.  When I was in school, college, the Bruning machines were everywhere 'cause that's where you, you got the blueprints made from these big engineering graphic machines.  And that's what they made.  But one of the things was that plain paper was beginning to come.  And so, this was the business, business, but anyway, you know, so you deal with the hand you got.  So, I went out there.  We had about eighteen hundred people.  There were about a 100 million, and they were making, like, I don't know, 4, 3 or 4 [million dollars], but declining.  So, I put together a plan.  And I, I, talked to everybody, I talked to all three shifts, everybody.  I said, "Look here, and this is eighteen hundred people, profits are declining.  And if we continue as we're going, this company will cease to exist in three to five years.  Now, I believe that if we take care, if we cut a third, that's a big cut, right, six hundred people, and we reorganize it.  And I have a plan to do that--we can save this company for twelve hundred people."  I said, "Now, you're six hundred, wherever you are.  You're saying, oh, what about--yeah," I said, "What we'll do, though, is we'll make sure we get outplacement, training, and do whatever we can to put you in a situation where you can still make money."  So, they said, "Fine, 'cause we know it's going down, you know," people know.  They know that things are going down.  So, man, I spent a year cutting everything, reduced distribution centers from eleven to two, then, you know, just, and we cut out six hundred people.  In three years, I was the toast of the company.  We were making a 100, we were doing a 115 million in sales, and making 12 million [dollars], triple the profits.  I think Rick [Richard B. Black] even mentions it in one of those magazine articles.
Story_ID: 395220
Speaker 1: So, I was just sitting there, minding my own business, figured out what I was going to do next.  And they got rid of Joe Freeman, and brought in a new guy.  We came out of Chapter 11 [Title 11, United States Bankruptcy Code]--a guy named MerleMerle Banta to run the company.  And I said, "Oh, man, I met MerleMerle Banta about, oh, I don't know, six or seven years before."  He tried to sell me a factory from one of his factories and, and it was, it was a flim-flam job, you know, the factory wasn't worth nearly as much.  And, and I had told him that when I (unclear), said, "Man, you know, this, this factory's not worth that, not no (laughter)."  Six or seven years later, he's going to go in, and be the chairman of the company.  So, he came in, and he came and talked to me.  I was running Bruning [AM Bruning Ltd.] and said, said, "You know, I'd like for you to come back to, you know, everybody tells me you're an outstanding planning guy.  Maybe you come back and help me do strategic planning."  I said, "Man, you're kidding me?"  I said, "I'm not running the division.  You will come make me a staff guy?"  I said, "Man, no harm, no disrespect, man, you get hit by the bus, new guy come in, and then, he going to sweep all those guys out of corporate.  I'm not here if you're running something.  I still have a job."  I said, "No, I don't want to come back."  So, I, you know, Bruning was doing well.  And I was trying to figure out what I was going to do because the only job that I would take was, yeah, I thought, running AM [AM International, Inc.], yeah.  I proved that I could do something, come back, and run the whole company.  And so, since I didn't have anything, an investment banking friend of mine called me up and said, "Man, yeah," he said, "I'm working with Sam Zell, you, you know, Sam Zell is a big real estate developer here in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  And, as a matter of fact, he's getting ready to sell one of his things, Equity Office Products [sic. Equity International].  He's a billionaire, a local billionaire, and he's big, so he need something somebody run his industrial properties.  So, why don't you go talk to him?"  Well, I'd heard about Sam, and I said, "Aw, man, I don't want to talk to Sam, I don't need to talk to any--," but anyway, I did go.  And I'd gotten pretty much down the road negotiating in a package to come work for him when Merle called me up one day and said, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams], you have been--I had been working with one of the other division guys."  I had, you know, trying to help him to get his division going, and 'cause, you know, my division was now running well, and I was helping him.  He said, "I know you've been working with Joe and you're doing a great job with him.  So, what I would like for you to do, and I know, just come back down here as a EVP [executive vice president], and I'll put Joe under you, and Bruning under you (laughter)."  I said, "Merle, no disrespect, but, man, you can't sneak up on," I said, "Well, what's got me.  So, what about a year, year and a half, I'll make you president over all of them."
Story_ID: 395221
Speaker 1: I said, "MerleMerle [MerleMerle Banta], I can't do that."  I said, "The two guys, I said, Dieter [Dieter E.A. Tannenberg] and Al [ph.], man, they ambushed me at the pass, no way I'm going to get in, you know, they--you, you can't do that."  He said, "Well, that's what I want to do, I want to ease."  I said, "Well, you, I'm not going to do that."  So, I, I left, went to work for Sam [Sam Zell], and I'd been working for Sam for about a day, and I get a phone call from Rick [Richard B. Black].  He says, "Yeah, I know you're over in love with Sam."  He said, "Put that aside for a minute," he said.  "But Merle," not many people know this so, "Merle wants to, he wants you to come back," said, "I, I told him the terms.  He says he agrees to all the terms, everything, and he asked me to talk to you," said, "so, would you call him up and go see him tomorrow?"  I said, "Okay."  So, I went down there.  Now, the one thing I had told Sam Zell, Sam, was saying I, and I probably should stay, so I can make you one of the richest men in America.  But I told him, you know, my goal is to run a Fortune 500 company, yeah.  And he said, "Well, I can't do that for you."  So, I made the deal with Merle.  I came back to be the president and chief operating officer of AM International [AM International, Inc.].  That was 1985.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Things went very well.  I had started working, and he had asked me to head it up working on an acquisition of a company that was in the same business called Harris Graphics [Harris Graphics Company], and they were about the same size as AM International.  And then when I became president, I just went on, and we helped pushed it through, and you probably don't know this, but in the business world, there was a high-flying guy in the late '80s [1980s] called Mike Milken [Michael Milken]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who got, went to jail, had a lot of money, but he did a lot of junk bonds.  Well, he was the guy that we were working with, to do these acquisitions.  And we acquired, and so I doubled the size of AM with the acquisition, from 600 million [dollars] to over a billion, a billion, two [$1.2 billion].  Now, AM was making $30 million a year.  Merle, who we, we had great difficulty, 'cause he loved to talk to the financial analyst.  And he told me, he was going to tell the financial analyst that with this new acquisition, we were going to make 80 in three years, 80 million, 100 million, 120 [million dollars].  I said, "Merle, no, no, no, man, don't do that.  You'll--we, we got to consolidate and do a lot of things this first year.  Just tell him that we're going to do good to get one and a half time, you know, 45, 50 million this year, then we'll come back to you."  He, he went on and made this thing.  Anyway, we, we came in at 70 million earnings, and they just beat us up because he had said, "We're going to make 80 and then a 100 [million dollars]."
Story_ID: 395222
Speaker 1: I started getting some publicity with these magazines now because I'm president [of AM International, Inc.] and--
Speaker 2: Now, were you at this time, were you the first African American--
Speaker 1: I was the first--
Speaker 2: --to get--
Speaker 1: --yeah, I was the first African American to be--
Speaker 2: --become a CEO of a, I mean--
Speaker 1: I'm a CEO, but to be president of a Fortune--
Speaker 2: --president.
Speaker 1: --500 company.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they had touted that I was going to become the CEO.  And Merle [MerleMerle Banta (ph.)] said, "Yes, he was."  And I thought I was, too.  But I started getting publicity, and this started to--being a problem.  He started talking to our, our, public relations lady, and was telling her that, you know, "Some of these articles should be about me (laughter), not about Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams]."  But anyway--
Speaker 2: So that it didn't, who didn't like it specifically?  Was it the--
Speaker 1: CEO.
Speaker 2: CEO, okay.
Speaker 1: He started having great difficulty with publicity--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that I was getting.
Story_ID: 395223
Speaker 1: We had a strategic plan where we were, to buy this one company, and it was a consolidation strategy, they call it--integrate in, then we go buy another one, integrate it in, and another, and we would continue to grow.  A company that has followed that strategy very well is a company called ITW [Illinois Tool Works Inc.], and they started about the same time we did.  And today, they'll about 13, 15 billion [dollars].  They were about 500 million, like we were 600 [million dollars].  And so, we started with the Harris [Harris Graphics Company], and we were supposed to do another one with that, Mike [Michael Milken] had found for us, and Merle got cold feet, didn't want to do it.  He was scared.  And so, he, he said, he, he wanted to sell part of the stuff that I had bought.  And I said, I told Merle, by the way the, the stock market, I loved it, because when I became president, the stock was like three or four dollars a share and by now, it was eight dollars a share.  It doubled on my reign, and we had gotten an offer from a foreign company to buy the whole company [AM International, Inc.] for 12 [billion dollars], okay.  And I told--and so, Merle said, "I want to sell part of these division."  I said, "Merle, you're going to sell the gross--man, you don't want to do that."  I said, "I'll tell you what to do, let's, let's accept this offer from Heidelberg [Heidelberg Druckmaschinen AG], and we'll have dollar bills hanging out of our pocket.  And we can do this somewhere else, but don't sell part of it."  He said, "No, I don't want to do that."  And so, we had a board meeting coming up, where we had to talk about strategy and so, what we finally decided was, I would talk about the strategy that we were following and present it to the board.  And he would have his meeting where he would bring up what he wanted to do 'cause we now, yeah, different directions, both in different directions.  So, now, Merle was an imperial kind of a guy.  And, and most of the staff--and I'm not bragging to any of the staff--like I was just a regular old guy.  So, the staff helped me with my presentation very much, you know, we got--Merle did his, I don't know, on his own.  Anyway, we went to the board meeting.  And I gave--and he had told the board that, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams] and I disagree now on strategy."  Now, this is a major problem because, you know, can't no company have the top two guys disagree on the strategy.  And I knew I was in a very tough place because, really, you know, there's only one voice, the company CEO.  So, I gave my presentation on the strategy that we were, and how we were doing it, and what were we going to do and everything.  And then, they asked me to leave the room, and Merle gave his presentation of what he wanted to do, what he wanted to do.  And they call us both back in, and they told us they wanted us both to leave the room.  So, we left the room, and then they called us back in.  And they said, "We are going to follow Jerry's strategy."  So, Merle said, "I don't know what I'm going to do," said, "I don't know what we're going to do."  So, he--we didn't see him anymore.  And so, the CFO [chief financial officer] and the--everybody in the (unclear), they, we were all fair, so where did Merle go?  And they all said, "Well, he's off writing his resignation (laughter), that's what, he's off writing his resignation."  Two weeks later, Merle came into my office and said, "You got a problem."  I said, "I got a problem?"  Said, "Yeah, the board accepted my strategy."  And I laughed because then I knew what he had done.  What he had done is he had gone to each of the board, each of the board people, and played the race card.  Now, I don't ever say that in any publication 'cause I wanted a job after that.  And so, I told him, "I'll stay on and I'll--until you sell off this one division--what we'll do."  So, at the next board meeting, which was going to be my last, I told them.  And by this, by this time, the Fortune magazine had come out, and he was really in a tizzy then.  And I told the board, I said, you know, that I was leaving, but I just want to say this.  I said, "In two years, you'll be firing, Merle, 'cause the stock price will go down to--it was eight or nine dollars a share."  I said, "It'll go down to four dollars a share."  The stock price went down to a quarter, and they got delisted before and, and they never did get rid of Merle.  One of the, one of the bondholders came in, and threw out Merle and the whole board.
Story_ID: 395224
Speaker 1: In the meanwhile, I--Rick Black [Richard B. Black] had gone and started a venture, a venture fund, and I went to work for him as a special partner.  And then, they acquired Monotype [Monotype Corporation, PLC] in the UK [United Kingdom].  And he asked me to go over there and turn around 'cause we were going to do a consolidation.  We were going to acquire them, a company called Varityper [AM Varityper Corporation] in the U.S., and a company called Linotype [Mergenthaler Linotype Company] in Germany, put them together, and take it public.
Speaker 2: Linotype treats fonts and they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They, they do fonts now, but then they, it was, it was type.
Speaker 2: Type, okay, actual type, okay.
Speaker 1: All of them were typed, actual type, you know, because we, we hadn't gotten to where we are today.
Speaker 2: To the, so for the type, the Linotype machine was such, and--
Speaker 1: Same, same kind of thing--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --and so was Varityper.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were the American version.  And they all had these type libraries everything, which today, the Monotype library is the one used by Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation] and all their--
Speaker 2: Right, that's right, you see their name on the--
Speaker 1: --and all their, yeah, on all their--
Speaker 2: --on computers.
Speaker 1: --computers.  And, and the, I'm not trying to do, but, but we were in--I didn't do the negotiation, but when negotiate, we'd paid too much for Monotype.  And so, when I, I went over to run Monotype, it was obvious that we had a problem with costs, and we would have to do something there.  But the European laws are vastly different about welfare than America.  You have to pay some tremendous severance packages.  I mean the average was you're going to have to pay almost five years for each person that you want to get rid of.  We just couldn't afford to do all that.  So, the economy ran down and the venture fund ran out of money.  And they had to come back over 'cause they were having some problem with their partners because they had done some things that they shouldn't have done.  They put too much money into Monotype.  And so, I was left high and dry over there.  I used to always stay in (unclear), over there and so, I, I kept it afloat for two years and (laughter) then, my, my biggest customer was Microsoft.  So, I went to Microsoft to get them to put some money in to--we were out.  I was told, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams], you, you made a great pitch, that's great."  I said, "Where's the money?"  He said, "Money," he said, "Geez.  In two weeks, you'll be (laughter) in receivership.  We'll pick this thing up for (laughter)," so, we did go to receivership.  We sold part of it to an investor, and then Monotype backed the management team to buy the font, the font division.
Story_ID: 395225
Speaker 1: We were talking about the corporate board of A and M [sic. AM International, Inc.] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then US West, and there's a third one, 'cause I, I had an agreement that I could serve on three.  There's another one, oh, it's a company that Rick [Richard B. Black] runs now.  It's called ECRM [ECRM Imaging Systems, Inc.].  I served on that board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't run it at the time.  It's in Massachusetts.  It's about 60 million, got up to about 80 million [dollars].  So, I served on that board and I served on that board 'til, 'til the same time that I got, I served on that board 'til 2000, ECRM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we had you at Monotype [Monotype Corporation, PLC].  We're 1990, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with Monotype?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're the chairman of the board and managing director.
Speaker 2: And we had to split it up because we couldn't make it go.  And we sold--I forgot, part of it to a, an entrepreneurial guy in the UK [United Kingdom].  And then, we sold the typefaces of the type business called Monotype Typography [Monotype Typography Ltd.] to a management buyout that was backed by Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation].  And then, I served on that board, Monotype Typography, 'til 1998 when they sold it to a company [Agfa-Compugraphic] called--uh, man, it's a big company--it'll come to me in a minute to--
Speaker 1: But they sold it (unclear).
Speaker 2: They sold it.  It'll come back to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, does that bring us to '93 [1993]?
Speaker 2: It brings us to '93 [1993] when I came back to America and said, then back to America, said, "What am I going to do?  Here I am, fifty-four, going on fifty-five, been gone for two or three years, and"--
Speaker 1: 'Cause when you worked for Monotype, you were out of the country and--
Speaker 2: I was in the UK--
Speaker 1: UK, okay.
Speaker 2: --lived in the UK for two--yeah.
Speaker 1: And did your family go with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and lived in a house.  We lived out in a little village called Kingswood [England], beautiful.  My wife [Pamella Jones Williams] loved it, you know, 'cause, man, the refrigerator is about that big, and the washing machine is about that big.  And, you know, and don't have much heat 'cause it doesn't get cold there, you know, so don't have a lot of insulation, but we had a nice house out in the country.  If we bought a house there, you'd--in this, in this village that we lived in, you had to have at least an acre around the house.  So, all the houses had an acre.  She, she loved it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The United Kingdom in the UK, this is--we're talking about England?
Speaker 2: In the UK, England.
Speaker 1: And it didn't get very cold out there?
Speaker 2: No, it's, it's moderate temperature.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: They don't get any snow much.  It rains a lot, but it was, yeah, she liked it because if you look on there, you'll see I have an address called--we lived in Mulberry House on Waterhouse Lane.  I mean, that was it.  And there was no street light.  You can't come at night time unless you know where you're going 'cause there's no street lights, there's no addresses.  The only thing out there is a sign, says Mulberry House, you know, up in the yard.
Story_ID: 395226
Speaker 1: But, anyway, I came back to America.  And I was trying to figure out what I was going to do 'cause I felt that I still had some energy, and still wanted to run something.  And so, I said, "Well, maybe I will, I'll start my own company, 'cause I've been turning around trying to do this with other people.  I'll just go buy something and turn it around myself."  So I (pause), all right, I, I'd been, I'd, I'd been financing myself trying to find some acquisitions for about a year.  And I stopped in New York [New York] to see a guy named Mario Gabelli.  Mario Gabelli, if you go, is a very well-known money manager, New York.  He manages about 25, 30 billion [dollars] now.  But I first met him back in the late '70s [1970s] when he was working for Drexel [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.], and he was an analyst.  He brought an acquisition to me, and we just stayed with each other.  Then he started Gabelli and Company [GAMCO Investors, Inc.] back in--I don't know, 1980.  If, if you called him up, he, he would say, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams]," said, "he's a fool. Jerry don't--."  I said, "I try to get him to invest twenty thousand in my fund back in 1980.  And if he'd put, left in there, it'd be worth 20 million today, you know," I said.  But, anyway, he asked me, what was I doing?  I said, "Man, I'm, I'm trying to put together a company for myself."  And I said, "But I'm running out of money."  He said, "Jerry, it's not that way with my boys--they get other people's money."  So, he said--I said, and you got to remember now, you know, he said, "You, you got to get these people who would seem like--they got to invest in you."  I said, "Man, I can't go, and then, you know, they'll pay for your living, and you can do all this stuff, while you're looking for companies to buy."  I said, "Man, nobody going to put (laughter)."  He said, "I'll tell you what."  He said, "Go home and put together a plan, and tell me how long it's going to take you to acquisition it," he said.  "I told him eighteen months, or something like that," I said.  So, he said, "Okay, you, I'll give you enough, you're going to need three others to fund this, Jerry."  I said, man--he said, "Well, you know Rick Black [Richard B. Black]."  I said, "Rick," I said, so Rick, and another guy name Bill Givens [William R. Givens] who, and, and so, they, they put together the money for me to start Grand Eagle Companies [Grand Eagle Companies, Inc.].  And by having the name, Gabelli, with me, made it so much easier for me to get deals and things 'cause everybody knows him in New York and Wall Street, you know.  I mean, just now, he had to pay a fine, though, 'cause he, he charged, cheat somebody out of some money.  He had to pay a hundred million dollar fine.  He had to pay a hundred million dollars just last year 'cause he had overstated something.  Anyway, so, he, he, he, he helped me get started.  And so, I took Grand Eagle and bought, made my first acquisition in '95 [1995], bought a 50 million [dollar] company called Eastern Electric [Eastern Electric Apparatus Repair Company, Inc.] that was headquartered in New Jersey and brought it here [Chicago, Illinois].  And then by 2000, I had made--I think, I can't remember whether it was five or six acquisitions, and it, it had become a 215 million company [dollar] in the electrical equipment repair and service.  Remember, I was tell--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and we had become number two to GE [General Electric].  GE was number one in that business.  We were number two (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 395227
Speaker 1: Tell us what they, what you did, you know, tell all, you know, the audience here.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Whoever is going to be watching this.
Speaker 2: --what we did was we bought these electrical repair service shops.  And what it is, is the first acquisition they had about thirty service shops spread around the country.  And they repaired electrical equipment, mostly large motors, like the kinds of motors you would see in steel mills and utilities, things, and transformers.  And the transformers sometimes were as big as this room that they repaired and refurbished and we did, and they'd get another twenty-five years' life.  They cost over a million dollars, and motors were usually five.  These motors cost you five thousand [dollars] to whatever, and we'd repair them and fix them up for you.  Then, the--we, we kept adding on to it, so that when we finally consolidated and finished all the acquisitions by 2000, we had about fifty shops around the country under the Grand Eagle [Grand Eagle Companies, Inc.] name in all kind of cities.  We had one in Massillon [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right outside of--
Speaker 2: --right outside of Akron [Ohio].
Speaker 1: --Akron, yeah.
Speaker 2: We had one up in Cleveland [Ohio].  We had them all over the country, down in Louisiana, Monroe, in places.  As a matter of fact, the Union Pacific Railroad was one of our largest customers, and so was International Paper [International Paper Company].  As a matter of fact, International Paper told me if I'd build a new plant, a new shop in Monroe, they'd give me nine paper plants around it to do this.  And I did, and they did.  And so, it went very well.  The investors, though, wanted to get out, so I sold it to another private equity company in 2000.  And then, I retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was about 200 million [dollars] sales and I retired.
Story_ID: 395228
Speaker 1: So, by retired, you mean you actually are--
Speaker 2: Well, I retired.  I got off all the boards.  I did everything.  About (laughter), about, let's see, I retired in September [of 2000].  Shortly after the first of the year, I got a phone call, and somebody asked me if I would--they asked me if the, if I wanted to do it again.  I got a call from a private equity firm, asked me if I wanted to do this again, like I'd just done with Grand Eagle [Grand Eagle Companies, Inc.].  And I told them no, I was old and tired, but I would mentor somebody, and I would be willing to be on some boards.  And so, they asked me, they called me up because they were getting ready to back a guy who was going to do a consolidation.  And, and they wanted me to work with him and mentor him because he had not done, he had run those kind of businesses, but he had never acquired them and consolidated.  And that led to--then the guys that started that Global Recruiters Network [Global Recruiters Network, Inc.], I knew one of them.  They had worked for me at AM International [AM International, Inc.].  I knew the other one.  His uncle had done outplacement workforce, and they asked me to help them put the business plan together with this business that they were going to start in 2000.  So, I worked with them in consulting.  And before I know it, I was back consulting three, three days a week, so I've been doing ever since.  And then, 2003, Bob Blackwell [HistoryMaker Robert D. Blackwell, Sr.] asked me to mentor his daughter, and help him look at mergers and acquisitions and the financials.  And so, I've been doing consulting work for him, too.  So, I've been--it got up to about five days a week.  So, I said it's crazy, so I backed it back down to about three days a week, but I usually do it--senior executives and mentor and coach.  One of them was a meat company and (laughter), it was a Polish guy who started a meat company.  It was about 400 million [dollars].  He and I got along.  He didn't like black people, but he (laughter), but I showed him how to fix his company up (laughter), and straighten out his company, and brought in a guy to really help him get out of his financial difficulties and so.  But, you know, as long as it's interesting and I can be some help, I try to help somebody, but most of it is trying to help senior executives, especially if they're in turnaround, or having some difficult times, or they want to do an acquisition, and they'd never done it before.  You're a little nervous, yeah.  But you're, it's very simple, you just, you know, as I was telling them, "They're like buses.  You know, another potential acquisition come along in fifteen minutes, so if you, you, if you got some worries, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.  But if you think that's what you need to do, do it."  But so, that's what I do now.
Story_ID: 395229
Speaker 1: So, you've learned the tools of the trade.  You know what to do now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I learned the tools of the trade.  I've been doing that for about thirty years, and--
Speaker 1: And it seems that--I mean, in the context of what you say, and how and your narrative of how you've moved from company to company, and learned these things that racism hasn't been a deterrent.  I mean, it's been, it's been a stumbling block but not a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I, I decided, I decided a long time ago when I first came out of the world, I came out of, I took my job.  I decided that I was going to make racism the other man's problem.  It was not going to be my problem.  I was just going to work, do, and I believed that if you show that you are competent, and able to do whatever it is that you could--this, this country is all about making money, right?  So, if you can show people that you can make them money and you can--they'll figure out a way of rationalize their racism, and I have found that to be the case.
Speaker 1: So, I suppose then, and in that context has become easier over the years the more experiences that you had that have been successful.  You--it's easier to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I--Bob Black [sic. Richard B. Black] would always say, "Well, you, you have this great confidence about yourself."  I'll show you if you call me, or somebody calls me, or I walk in the room, and you want to talk about a subject that I'm well-versed in, like mergers, acquisitions, planning, how to reduce the cost of your company, how to get the profit.  You, you know, usually I will talk to you, and you'll, you'll be convinced that I know what I'm talking about, and that you want to make money more than you want to go try to spend the time finding somebody else who can do this and help you, you know.  And so, I found that to be the case.  As, as years have passed, it's not as overt as it was.  It's still there, though, it's still there.  But, usually, if you show people that you can do it, and if a guy is really in a problem, and you can show him how to get out of his problem, he will put aside his racism for the time being, and do it.  And, and I, and I get paid well for it.
Story_ID: 395230
Speaker 1: I was asked to ask you about, to make sure I ask you about Jim Kaiser [HistoryMaker James Kaiser].
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Jim Kaiser, I met Jim--I think we were on, I think I first met him, I think, we were on the advisory board for the School of Business at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University School of Business and Industry, Tallahassee, Florida] together--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is another black man who's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --involved in mergers and acquisitions and--
Speaker 2: He's done all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, we, we, we stayed in contact over the years.  I talked with him just before he bought his Lexus dealership [Dobbs Brothers Lexus; Lexus of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee], yeah.  And I haven't talked to him in the last year, but we used to talk quite a bit while he was coming through, and when he was having his difficulties at Corning [Corning Inc.] because, by all rights, he could, he should have ended up running Corning.  But the, the (unclear), he just couldn't get hold of the fact that he was black.  You know, I don't know if he ever told you the story.  They sent, they sent him over to run their operation in France.  And Jim, Jim went to the cleaners with the name Kaiser.  You know, you know, how Jim looks.  And the lady thought he was German, and wouldn't, you know, because the French and the Germans (unclear), she wouldn't take his cleaning (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was German?
Speaker 2: German--thought he was German.  He told her, "No, no, no, I'm American."  Jim Kaiser, he's German, he, you know, he walked in.  She thought he was German.  Ask him sometime when you see him about that (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's incredible. That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was a good guy.
Story_ID: 395231
Speaker 1: Like a lot of guys, who came up during my time, as they got close to the, to the top job, they got diverted off something.  There was a guy named John Haugabrook, who became the first black vice president of Jewel Foods [Jewel-Osco], and he got bounced.  Bob Johnson [HistoryMaker Robert Johnson] at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], he became the first black vice president at Sears.  And, and he, he, you know, a lot of--and, and these guys were competent enough to run the whole thing.  Kaiser [HistoryMaker James Kaiser], outstanding.  Mannie Johnson--I mean, [HistoryMaker] Mannie Jackson, when he was at Honeywell [Honeywell Inc.; Honeywell International Inc.], he was bright, yeah, but he wasn't going to get to, so he went on now and bought the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters].
Speaker 2: Right, that's the CEO of the Globetrotters, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, do you know Frank Thomas?
Speaker 1: No, I don't know Frank.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He's written about the glass ceiling and so forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's from Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] and--
Speaker 1: Recently?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think he's got a book about, yeah, about it.
Speaker 1: About it, um-hum.
Speaker 2: What about Dr. Christian Wharton [sic. HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: I, I met him when he was still at CREF-TIAA [sic. Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, he was the president of that.  He had a great, a great career, you know, president of Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], and president of State University of New York [State University of New York System].  And I think he wanted, I think he wanted to talk to me about a potential board or something, and but it didn't work out.
Story_ID: 395232
Speaker 1: How lonely, I guess, is it for black people in the position that you're in--I mean, do you ever, I mean, are there--
Speaker 2: When you, when you were going through that?  It's very lonely.  I always tell, or I should tell, when I used to go interview--I mean, not interview, lecture at the business school over there, I said, I'm, I'd tell them first: "Are you guys married (laughter)?"  I said, "Are you married?"  Said, "Why?"  I said, "You need a good wife, man," I said, "Because you're going to get-somebody's gotta encourage you.  You come over here at night," I said, "You know, my wife [Pamella Jones Williams] comes home."  And I just say, I said, "Do I look like I'm stupid to ask a question like--no, you don't know if this is a pencil.  You don't know what this is for."  Yeah, I said, "This is the kind of question and things they say to you."  I said, "So, you get tired of that every day, and you--."  I said, "But you know what?  She listens to your story, and she listens to you, and she wipes off your brow.  But then, she pats you on your back, pushes in your stomach, and push you back out the door the next day (laughter)--," but I said, "But you got to do that.  Somebody's gotta pick you up."  And I said, "The reason," I said, "a wife, because everybody else you meet is only interested in your career as it helps them.  Okay.  The only other person that's interested in your career, as it helps you, is your wife, so she will be good advice and advisor, and listen, and won't be as much."  So, my wife was, is my best friend.  And she helped me through, as I used to say, the days when we were going through the valley of the shadow of death.  She used to give me emotional support, tremendous emotional support.  So, can I just give a last little thing?
Speaker 1: Well, sure.
Speaker 2: She gave up her career, you know, she was teaching, and got her master's [degree].  She gave up her career to help me, 'cause I'd told her when I first arrived, when I went back to GE [General Electric], I was going to be traveling, and she was going to have to raise the family.  We were going to move.  And she said, did I say I would have a problem with all that?  And she used to--when we moved, I used to drop her into, like I dropped her in Erie [Pennsylvania], and we got there on Sunday.  And I went there Monday morning.  And Lou [Louis V. Tomasetti] and the McKinsey team [McKinsey and Company] told me, "You're making a presentation to the group vice president Friday with us."  I said, man, "I ain't even know what a locomotive looks like.  You're making a presentation on pricing."  So, I dropped her off in this town.  We come there Sunday.  I dropped her off in a motel.  She's got to find the school.  We had already bought a house.  She's going to have to move in the house.  I didn't come home from work 'til two a.m. that night, and didn't come home from work 'til two a.m. every night to get ready for this presentation Friday.  And she put the children [Laurence Williams and Courtney Williams]--that's what I'm talking about, yeah, so, I didn't have to worry.  She took care of the children.  She got the furniture moved in and, you know, and she did that everywhere we moved around the country.  So, she gave up, as I always tell people, she raised the children.  But when we got to be, when she got to be about, when, when my daughter was going to school full time, I asked her, what did she want to do now, you know?  She said, well, Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], where she got her master's, had asked her to come and be assistant instructor.  And they would give her the money to work on her Ph.D.  And I--we were going to move to California, and she had gotten pregnant, so she told them no.  So, she said, "I'll tell you what, I'm, I'm, let me take a course over at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], and if I can get the brain back in gear, I will maybe go back to school and get my Ph.D."  So, she went back in '76 [1976].  In 1980--she went in '76 [1976], '77 [1977].  In 1980, she got a Ph.D. in psychology.  And she works for a while as, in personnel and things, but what she really wanted to was open a store.  So, she got to open a, a Christian bookstore, a gift shop in 1987.  We had to close it when I told her, you got to come to Europe with me (laughter) in '90 [1990].  Then she opened another one in 1999, but she closed that in 2003.  It was just the economics.  And so, she's had the chance to at least do some of the things that she wanted to do, which I thought was the right thing to do, 'cause she'd been so faithful to me.
Story_ID: 395233
Speaker 1: Well, I was thinking about how you were raised, and your family doing everything on schedule, and trying to stay together and keep, you know, in touch with each other.  Do you think, without that kind of background, you would be able to maintain a marriage through all the trials and tribulations of a business?
Speaker 2: I think that it--I had a great advantage of having six sisters and a mother [Margaret Stone Williams].  And my father [James O. Williams] (laughter), I used to tell people--my sisters used to always say when, you know, my father, a lot of times, well, you all make decisions.  My sister would say, "Let's make a vote."  I say, "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait," and so, you know, 'cause I was outvoted.  But, and so, I used to always tell when, when I ran Bruning [AM Bruning Ltd.] and AM [AM International, Inc.] in this country, I used to always tell everybody, if there were six people in the room, I said, "I'm going to do like my sisters did.  You all can vote, but I got seven votes (laughter)."  But, like my father, he would use it once in a while, but most of the time, he wouldn't do that.  But that helped me a lot.  One thing I would like to say, to just tell you about the family, we didn't have any money, so my mother wanted everybody to go to college.  So, my oldest sister [Dorcas Williams Cravens] worked night times with the telephone company, and put herself through the University of Indianapolis [Indiana Central College; University of Indianapolis, Indianapolis, Indiana], it's called now.  And then, my next sister [Rosetta Williams Brown] went to school for a year, but then, she decided she didn't want to do it, and she went to work for the federal government.  And I got scholarships and, but what the, the ones after me--my oldest sister used to, we used to call, we called it the Williams' fund.  And what she would do, is she would check and see how much money everybody needed.  And then, she would allocate it out to us that were working to help, so that everybody could get a chance.  And so, but my sisters, those that wanted a degree--the oldest one is, was an English teacher before she retired.  The second one worked for the federal government for years.  And Betty [Betty Williams Beaven] was a music teacher, and then, she left, she left teaching to go to work for Delta Air Lines [Delta Air Lines, Inc.] 'cause she got double her salary to be a trainer for Delta.  And then, the next one worked for the airlines.  And my youngest sister [Mary Williams Thompson] was the crown jewel for my mother.  She was a, became a doctor, a (unclear) doctor.  And we had, you know, from a family that didn't have anything, you know, they were very, very proud.  I am, too.  And so, by living and working in an environment--now, don't let anybody fool you.  Nobody ever knows women, no, not anybody, and I'm not saying I know any more about them than anybody else.  But I watched the way my father operated in that environment with these six women, and they love him, they loved him to death.  I mean, yeah.  When--my mother died before my father.  My father had been very sick, and we thought that he was going to die before her, and that's why we had the anniversary early, the 50th wedding anniversary early.  My mother was well, but she had always told us she was going to die by the time she was seventy-one.  She was seventy in August, and that November, she, she died.  But what she made the sisters do was promise that they would--she didn't want to put him in a nursing home.  So, she made them, tell them that they had to assure that they wouldn't do that.  And so, they worked out a plan--now they're all married now, you know.  They worked out a plan that a week, each one would go and stay with him.  And, Christmastime, I flew down to stay with him every weekend.  Well, he died about three months later.  But that was the kind of thing that I saw you could do in cooperation if you got the family to work together and, and so, that's what we tried to do.  And my wife [Pamella Jones Williams] is an only child, and I tried to treat her, you know, 'cause she's been a great comfort to me.
Story_ID: 395358
Speaker 1: Sir, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Let me start with the concern.  I'd, I'd always felt that we could build on top of each other, but it seems to me that every generation of black people start and climb the mountain.  And then, the next generation doesn't build on it, it starts back.  Now, they might be a little more sophisticated, but I think we're--and we, we might have a few more people in corporate positions.  But, and, and maybe I'm pessimistic, but we don't seem to be able to incorporate the totality of our knowledge and wisdom.  May-, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm too pessimistic, but that's been my biggest--we, we don't.  And that's why I hope this helps, HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers], that they can say, oh, you know, you're not the first, you're not this, or we are a, somebody did this, you know, twenty-five years ago.  So, go read up and learn about this, so you don't have to go through the same mistakes and same things that they've already done and, you know, what I mean?  That is the biggest concern I have, that we haven't listened to all the--taken all the information that we've gotten, and made it useful in our lives.  I remember the block, the neighborhood that I grew up in [in Indianapolis, Indiana].  And those people had worked hard, and most of them, most of them hadn't graduated from high school.  And they tried at least to get the children to graduate from high school, and not many went to college.  And they worked hard.  And I went back about ten, fifteen years later and, man, it looked like, starting over again, like this crew that I moved in were just, you know, hadn't learned anything from, or nothing had passed over from the previous generation.  They were just starting from scratch.  And, unfortunately, that's the kind of the way I feel, that we're not absorbing all the stuff that's available for us, particularly in the black race.  And maybe I, never, maybe, but that's my biggest concern.  The hope, you know, you see Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons].  You see Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault].  You see entrepreneurs, black entrepreneurs, out doing things.  I see young bright guys come by and talk to me.  And I, I, I think that from a economical standpoint that we are making some progress.  And I just hope that we don't lose, and that's my (unclear).  I hope we don't lose our faith, you know.  We, the black community, was always a faith-based community.  And, but I, I sense that we're beginning to get some of the same problems as the majority races, you know.  And so, we're beginning to have some of the same problems that show that we've lost some of our spirituality and faith.  But we are, I'm encouraged by what I see, and what I meet in terms of the next generation group of people.  Whereas we used to have one every five years go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, we got many Harvard in the business schools, and all the major business schools.
Story_ID: 395359
Speaker 1: Are there any attempts by, or do you think that it might be useful to try to institutionalize some of the knowledge that people like yourself have gained over the years or (unclear)and, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I, you know, one of the things that I tried to do, I tried to help anybody 'cause I, when I went out to work for GE Santa Barbara [General Electric, Santa Barbara, California], it was the first black manager I saw was there.  Man, he didn't have the time of day with me.  And so, I said to the Lord, "If, if, if--I'm going to always have an open door, so anybody can come in and talk to me about anything, anywhere, any place."  And I try to do that.  And so, I try to, even when I was working and now, you know, I get probably two or three calls a week from somebody wanting to talk and pick my brain or whatever, and I try very hard to incorporate this, especially the minority community.  I used to always tell the other people, well, y'all got those, but I, I'd do it for everybody if I can, but I try very hard, up in the minority community.  And that's what I tried to do in speaking, try to speak at black colleges [HBCUs].
Speaker 1: Have you heard about--it's some attempts, and I was talking, we talked to Thomas McLeary [HistoryMaker Thomas L. McLeary] a couple of weeks ago.  He's in insurance.  And Raymond McGuire [HistoryMaker Raymond J. McGuire], who came out from Wall Street, came to Dayton [Ohio], and was talking to the youth about trying to unite with other black business people, and who are making like, you know, who are dealing with millions of dollars--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and billions of dollars, and that sort of thing, and come up with maybe an approach that might, you know, be stronger because it is unified.  I know, like Bob Blackwell [HistoryMaker Robert D. Blackwell, Sr.] does a lot of things in the community and, but I don't know if there's a--is--have you heard of any attempt to try to organize people of these kind of means to--
Speaker 2: Well, enable--trying to do that here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, yeah, that is--
Speaker 2: Enable--trying to do that--
Speaker 1: --that's who Thomas McLeary was a part of, yeah.
Speaker 2: Was, was with--enable--'cause John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] and Bob (Unclear) [ph.] are there.  And, and that's, that's one approach that the community, and I think they've done some pretty good things.  They were, they, they've brought some large CEOs to their meetings.  And I think they've helped other skip contracts and things.  And I, I, that's fantastic, yeah, but, yes, we need other ventures like that, um-hm.
Story_ID: 395360
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done up to this point, is there any major thing, in retrospect, that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  You know, one of the things that my mother [Margaret Stone Williams] used to always teach when we were growing up, that you can profit from every situation, and you should always try to pull something out of it, whether it was bad or good.  And so, I always try to do that, you know.  And so, as I look back on my life, and I was just telling my, my (unclear), one day when I was in the Grand Eagle Companies [Grand Eagle Companies, Inc.], our offices were on the twenty-ninth floor at the Prudential Building [One Prudential Plaza, Chicago, Illinois].  And I overlooked the, the harbor and the lake [Lake Michigan].  And I was looking out the window at tourists, you know, this is a long way from 2215 Sheldon Street in Indianapolis [Indiana] (laughter), you know.  So, my life really had been, has been a good life, you know.  I've, you know, I think the only way you, that, you know, you gain wisdom, and I, I don't mean this, it's, it's still some suffering and pain because then you can advise others that, you know, you don't have to go that way, 'cause I've been that way, and that's, so, here, and so, I think the only thing that you would like to do, and that's what I tried to do, is that you try to be able to expound to people, and give them your experiences and your knowledge that you've gained.  The trouble is that, you know, all of us when we were young, I mean, the last thing we wanted to do was listen to some sixty-eight year-old guy (laughter) that, you know what I mean (laughter)?  So, I understand that, too, but it's been a good ride.
Story_ID: 395361
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I used to always say that my father [James O. Williams] was a great example.  Now, nobody knows my father, but here's a man who raised seven children, I'm sorry, yeah, seven children, and a wife [Margaret Stone Williams].  They were married for fifty years, and death parted them.  A nice household, he worked hard, and these seven children went on, out in the world, and they did something.  And, to me, that's their greatest legacy.  So, I told Pam [Williams' wife, Pamella Jones Williams] that what we want to do is make sure that our children [Laurence Williams and Courtney Williams] don't get so twisted up in this world that we've, we've put them in, so that they can be good citizens and contribute.  And if we can do that, and hang on to each other together, then that's a pretty good life.  And I think, you know, we've been married forty years this year, and it's a pretty good life.  The children are working and, you know, that's, that's the comfort to me.
Story_ID: 395362
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that you think ought to be raised here before we ask our last question?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but probably three weeks from now (laughter), something will pop in my mind--oh, man, I should have said this, but, no, I think we've covered everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered that he was a guy that came in and worked.  He was fair.  He was honest.  He had values, and he lived by those values all the way to the end.  That's the way I'd like to, and that's what I tried to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 395363
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE) Describe that for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's around 1978.  And this professor was writing a textbook and in it, he wanted to have some career profiles of people.  And he had a hard time finding black executives.  And he came across me, and I don't know where.  I think he had seen it.  There had been an article on me in one of the, some magazine.  And so, he called me up and asked if he could have my profile for the textbook.
Speaker 1: And what's the name of this book?  This is the--
Speaker 2: It's a--I have to--I think it's Management, Management, what's it called?  I can't see it. Management--
Speaker 1: Management Concepts and--
Speaker 2: --and Practices ['Management: Concepts and Practices'].  It was a very interesting thing.  About five years after my picture appeared in there, my wife's cousin called, when they said, "I just took a course, and I saw Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerry O. Williams] in there (laughter)."
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Black Enterprise ran a, an issue on the top black managers they had found in Corporate America around February of--
