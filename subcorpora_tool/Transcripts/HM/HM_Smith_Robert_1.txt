Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I love the fall.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: Different places, different times of year.  I love here Lincoln Hills [Colorado].  It is just a place of peace and majesty, and it's a good, calm and peaceful environment.  I like skiing also quite a bit in different parts of Europe.  I love Megeve [France] which is a beautiful French town 'cause it's, it's soft, and it's a wonderful place to relax and kind of decompress.  I also love the Caribbean.  I like fishing in the Caribbean.  And I like Alaska.  So I like to vacation in a bunch of different places.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying, Robert?
Speaker 2: I have a few (laughter).  My kids, I give them three lessons, and they kinda sum up a lot of my, you know, favorite phrases.  I tell them I wanna leave them three things in life.  I, I think they want me to leave them a little more.  But the first one is, "You are enough."  And that means that you are enough to be what it is that you wanna be in this world and in this life.  You don't need anyone else's validation.  You just need your own sense of self and fortitude.  And it leads to the second one, and that second one means discover the joys of figuring things out.  And that means really, you know, enjoy the process of learning and figuring out those challenges and coming up with what I call the elegant solutions to life.  And that process, I think, is one of the most rewarding in life.  And then the last one of dad's three rules is, "Love is all that matters."  So those are my three sayings that I have on signs for the kids to make sure that they are thoughtful about how I think about life, and how I think about them and what I hope for them in the future.
Speaker 1: Oh boy, I'm always impressed with our HistoryMakers and how that favorite phrase or saying comes out.  So--
Story_ID: 624636
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you about your family background.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can we start with your father?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And I'd like you to give his name, and where he was born and what you know about the family background on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  William Robert Smith.  And my father was born in 1932, May 24th, 1932.  And he was born in Denver, Colorado.  He's the eldest of eight siblings.  And his mother was William [sic], Elizabeth North Smith, ultimately, and his father was William Edward Smith.  And he was the third generation born in Colorado.  I'm the fourth generation born in Colorado.  My father was an educator, had a great passion for educating children.  He was one of the first black principals of a elementary school in Denver, Colorado.  He earned his Ph.D. from DU, Denver University [sic, University of Denver, Denver, Colorado], his master's degree as well and his undergraduate and went on to become a principal and administrator and a person who was very thoughtful about the community in which we lived, in educating children, providing infrastructure for kids to be educated and adults, frankly, to participate in, you know, part of what I call the Great American Dream, which is education and living freely.  His mother, my grandmother--we called her "Granny", Elizabeth North, grew up in Pueblo [Colorado] and was a secondary education teacher, administrator and had written curriculum, apparently on secondary educ--oh, not, not secondary education but special ed.  And that curriculum was used to help in the Denver Public Schools and other places for educating special education students.  She was also, again, a teacher and educator.  And she raised eight children most of that time with her husband, William Edward, who was a Pullman porter and a mechanic and then ultimately, in later years moved to Seattle and moved to Hawaii much later.  He was born--where was he born?  She was born in Pueblo.  He was born in Parsons, Kansas.  And, and their parents--well, her parents grew up in Pueblo, Colorado, and my great-grandmother grew up there, and her mother came out from, as we understand it, from Tennessee as part of the Trail of Tears and was marched out in the early 1860s and she married a preacher.  And those two had my grandmother as their daughter, in addition to--I think they had four other siblings, my Auntie Bert [ph.] being one, who was a nurse, and lived in Colorado not too far--in Denver, not too far from us.  But they, most of them grew up Pueblo, but then spent the later years of their life in Denver.
Speaker 1: So you're--how, how was this history that you know on your father's side, how was it communicated?  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Orally.  But my aunt, a few years ago, put together a little book which captured--it depends on which aunt you talk to, the real story or her positions on the story (laughter) as families do, but she put a nice narrative together around different elements of the, of the family history on that side.
Story_ID: 624637
Speaker 1: So what did your father [William Smith] talk about in terms of his growing up?  Did he share stories with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, quite a bit.  So, this place we're sitting in now, Lincoln Hills [Colorado], and we've had a good fortune to take a tour a bit.  You know, it was the first African American resort community, actually founded by African Americans.  There're other African American resort communities in the U.S., but none of them were founded by African Americans, which is one of the interesting distinctions and was founded here in 1922.  And the guy who founded it, his second wife was my grandmother's [Elizabeth North Smith] best friend.  And so my father and his seven siblings spent every summer, growing up, here in Lincoln Hills.  And as a part of that, in these tiny cabins.  And as a part of that, you know, a lot of the conversations and the stories about his youth and growing up came a lot from Lincoln Hills and from conversations with some of his friends later.  My dad died, unfortunately, at the age of fifty-six.  But, you know, as I've met with, you know, some of the artists, [Jess E.] "Mickey" Dubois and others who were his friends, childhood friends, growing up, I heard a lot about my father there.  One of the interesting stories Mickey was telling me, and he's a very famous artist here regionally, was that, you know, my father was always, you know, a really good student.  And he remembers even after they worked, and they worked as Pullman porters together and, and, you know, and other odd jobs and from everything from, you know, selling tamales at Red Rocks for a dollar when they were growing up.  And my grandmother had a little store that's kinda like the old, in a, gotta remember that movie "Happy Days" where it was kind of a corner canteen-type store, soda kind of, you know, soda shop kind of store where all the teenagers would gather.  And she made and sold tamales there.  And then when there were things at Red Rocks, my dad and Mickey would go up there and sell them for a dollar.  But Mickey kept saying, you know, but even after all that work, they'd always see in my dad's room, you know, the light was on 'cause he was studying.  So he was actually a really good student, which, you know, I took after, I guess, and my mother [Sylvia Myrna Smith] is also a great student (laughter).  But that was one of the things I heard a lot about my father, his determination to change his station in life.  You know, as the eldest of six growing up, you know, post-Depression era, here in the United States and, you know, had a great responsibility as the eldest son, to help provide for the rest of the family, which he did pretty much up until his death and even after--
Speaker 1: Now, he was the eldest of six or eight?
Speaker 2: He was a twin--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --and then there were six others.  So that's how that worked, but he was the eldest.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And his sister may have been, you know, they're the twins, he--
Speaker 1: So fraternal twins.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, so how old were you when your father passed away?  I didn't--you said at age fifty-six.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--and so at age fifty-six, I was--what was I, twenty-four at the time, I guess I was, yeah.
Story_ID: 624638
Speaker 1: So, I--what--can we talk about your mother?  Can you give her--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --her, her year of birth and what you know about her background?
Speaker 2: Sure, my mother, Sylvia Myrna Smith, grew up in Washington, D.C.  And she was born April 30, 1935.  And my mother is one of those people who is just absolutely brilliant.  I think she got one "B" in her life.  She was straight As.  She was salutatorian.  She went to the famed, you know, [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C.  She then went on to D.C. Teachers College [District of Columbia Teacher's College, later, part of the University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C] and then finished her Masters and Ph.D. out here in Colorado at the University of Northern Colorado at Greeley [Colorado].  She ended up being a principal at the largest high school here in Colorado which is George Washington--well, the public high school, George Washington High School [Denver, Colorado], for a number of years.  And she helped what was called Knight Fundamental Academy [later, Hallett Fundamental Academy, Denver, Colorado], which was a fundamental education school in the Denver Public Schools who had, you know, the top-ranked, you know, test scores for the period of time she was there and beyond.  She was always focused on childhood education, elementary education, and that was, you know, her life's pursuit.  And she's still alive today at age eighty and, and doing well in that context and very well respected.  And I take great pride she and I go out in Denver, and we'll run into a former student of hers who is now, you know, a full-fledged adult who remembers her as a teacher, or remembers her as an administrator or remembers her and saying, you know, "You changed my life."  And it's kind of interesting to hear those random comments when you're just shopping from people and how they swell with great emotion about how she impacted their lives.  And so you really start to understand the impact of teachers on their lives.
Story_ID: 624639
Speaker 1: So how, how would you describe your mother [Sylvia Smith], besides being really smart?
Speaker 2: She's very thoughtful.  She was very concerned about the position, opportunity of African Americans in America.  If she--my father's, I'm sorry, my mother's father, my grandfather, and his name was Frederick Combs Young, and he was born in 1904 in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  He ended up, he, you know, his--part of, you know, we chuckle and we have, we had a great relationship before he passed away.  My grandfather went to Armstrong Technical High School [Washington, D.C.], which was the big rival of [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School] in Washington, D.C.  And he was head of what was then kind of the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] or not kind of, but the ROTC.  And it was under his watch the first time Armstrong ever beat Dunbar in the drill competition which was a big deal back then apparently.  And he received a scholarship to go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], which was quite unprecedented at the time.  But he at that time, got together with my grandmother, and they had my mother.  And so he decided he could not go to college then.  He needed to now take care of his family and raise the family, ended up being the--you know, ran three post offices in, in Washington, D.C., was a lieutenant in the Army, so took a commission and went to the World War II and was in the Philippines and actually served under one of the majors there as an MP [military police] and as a driver.  And, and in any event, my grandfather with his wife, my grandmother--her name is Jewell, Bernice Jewell Henricy .  And she was born in Columbia, South Carolina, but then lived and grew up in New York, and then moved in high school to Washington, D.C.  And that's where they met, then had, you know, my mother, her brother, who died when he was nine years old, and then two sisters after that.
Story_ID: 624640
Speaker 1: But that framed a lot of my mother's [Sylvia Smith] thinking growing up in Washington, D.C. because at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.], for instance, you know, she was taught by some of, when you think about it, the most famous, you know, educated African Americans 'cause they all taught at the high school level there 'cause they couldn't work in the college level.  And, you know, she had a high social consciousness, and she felt that the best way to advance the position of African Americans in America was fundamental education and teaching and training.  And that's where she spent her life's work and pursuit.  So when I think about my mother, she thought about our community.  You know, she obviously thought about our family, but she thought about our community and how we can best uplift ourselves.  When I think about the conversations at the dinner table, you know, every Sunday and every night to a great extent 'cause we did have great family dinners for many, many years, going through that, it was discussions around the challenges associated with the Civil Rights Act, the challenges associated with education, you know, Brown versus the Board of Education [1954] and how they were going to, you know, move forward in the Head Start Program, which was one of the programs my father [William Smith] and mother were both very active in, in Colorado, how they were gonna equalize what I'll call, you know, teaching opportunities for African American teachers, but most importantly, teacher, for students.  And then we went through the period of desegregation in the U.S. and in Colorado, which forced busing then occurred and how that affected my brother [Allan Smith] and I 'cause we were--I was a kindergartner--well, first grader, I guess it was.  It was the first time busing was implemented in Colorado, and rather than get to go to the neighborhood school which was six blocks from where we lived, where my dad was the principal, I was then bused across town to a different school with a busload of African American kids to now be the only one or two in each classroom.  And so that took on a different significance in the family around how were my parents gonna ensure that, you know, we had the best quality education, greatest opportunities, but not just my brother and I, but all the others who looked like us in the school district.  And that was on the forefront of their minds, it seemed like every day.  And, you know, it was every conversation, and when people would come over, which seemed like constantly over the weekend, they'd kinda stop 'cause they were, you know, leaders in the community in that regard, that's where the conversation centered, you know, how, how were they going to improve the, the station of African Americans in this country.
Story_ID: 624641
Speaker 1: So, did your mother [Sylvia Smith] talk about her time in high school, at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.]?  Did she ever share any stories?  Can you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --share like one or--one story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you should actually meet her and talk to her about it.  But, you know, she'll give me the certain stories.  (Laughter) It was funny.  I was sitting with her and my, one of my daughters, Eliana yesterday, having breakfast.  And we were talking about--'cause my daughter's heading off to boarding school this fall.  And, you know, like all, all parents and grandparents thinking about children going off now, they are gonna be exposed to things that you didn't give them access to like alcohol or, you know, and drugs and those sort of things.  And we're talking, and my, my mother said, well, you know, when she was growing up and in high school and going into college and D.C. Teachers College [later the University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], and all the girls would throw parties.  And, and my mother was telling her, "Oh, we'd serve cookies and punch, and that's all we served, but we never had a problem having boys lined up outside the door to, to come to these parties."  It's because, you know, they were, you know, they were, of course, you know, the type of women that you wanted to be associated with in that context.  And my mother said they would dance the night away and have a lot of fun, and served no alcohol, and I know she's doing that for the benefit of my daughter to help her understand that those sort of things aren't required to have fun.  But my mother loved to dance.  My mother, my mother loved to go to socials, and in Washington, D.C., one of the biggest stories she told me about was they would always--and she and my grandmother would make dresses, and they'd go to these formals and events.  And that was a, you know, you'd get asked out and you wore these beautiful dresses, even in high school, you know, at dances and that sort of thing.  And it was very, very in that regard, and she just loved going to those sort of events.  And she was shocked when she came to Denver [Colorado] because people wouldn't, you know, they had formal events, but they wouldn't dress up the way they did in D.C.  And that was one of her biggest disappointments in moving to Denver is, you know, I'll call it the fashion sense here.  And she's a very beautiful woman, you know, very, very shapely and pretty, with a big beautiful smile and a very social person.  And that's part of, you know, what she enjoyed in Washington, D.C.  She also brought a, brought forward a number of stories about how they were, you know, what it was like living in segregation.  And in that context, how they didn't feel, to some degree, there was a lack on the one hand because, you know, everybody who lived around you provided, I'll call, the layer of professional services.  You know, you had black doctors and black lawyers and dentists and those sort of things.  But they could also feel, you know, the economic disadvantage because they knew they didn't have access to the same level of resources, you know.  That said, you know, with Howard University [Washington, D.C.] around and some of the doctors and such, and, you know, they, they felt that they had a very vibrant community in which, you know, that could continue to grow.  But they also knew there was, you know, there was opportunity out there that, that we didn't have access to, frankly, because of racism.
Story_ID: 624642
Speaker 1: Now, Robert, the question--and I wanna ask how your parents [Sylvia Smith and William Smith] met, but I want to also understand, was there a different narrative coming from your father [William Smith]'s side, you know, from the [Washington] D.C. [sic, area]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you've got a, you know, so if you think about Washington, D.C., you're living in an all-black community in Washington, D.C., just the mass in numbers, right?  You know, you could, you could find yourself in that community feeling, what I'll call full, right, in terms of inner--engagement, social engagement, inner-activity opportunities (unclear) set, those sort of things.  And, you know, you could go to what was then the best colleges for African Americans, you know, being Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], maybe not Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but, you know, and you could come out and be a dentist or a doctor and afford a beautiful house on the Northeast side, and, you know, and, and raise a family and have a nice, new car and all those sort of things.  And that's part of what was then perceived as a great American dream in that context.  You contrast that versus coming to, you know, being in Colorado.  My mother [Sylvia Smith] decided she wanted to come to Colorado because one of the teachers she had been following, working, actually taught at the University of Northern Colorado [Greeley, Colorado].  His name escapes me right now.  And that's why she went there.  It's one of the best teaching schools, and she wanted to become, you know, the best teachers she could, which is all she ended up out here.  But my father's experience on the other hand, if you think about Colorado and Denver, while a vibrant black community in the Five-Points area, you know, there were two--you know, one of the more historic areas, and you think in, you know, where, you know, a number of the entertainers came and there was, you know, owned black businesses of different types, you could tell--and in my conversations with my father as he got, you know, as we, you know, had become--became an adult and started talking about it, he said, "You know, Robert, you had just a couple options in what you were gonna become", you know.  They always said, you know, "preacher, teacher, doctor, lawyer", right?  And he said, but, you know, mostly it was preacher or teacher and very few became doctors or lawyers.  And he always wanted to become a lawyer, but never felt that he could break into that opportunity.  And so he studied actually school law and got his Ph.D. in School Law because that's what he really wanted to do, but felt that there was--you know, I always felt him--in the presence of my, in my dad's mind--and he said it.  It was, there was a deep, segregated degree of racism that existed here in Colorado, which he felt absolutely limited a number of opportunity sets.  And even when I met with--and my dad had some very educated friends, you know, they just felt like career progression would often get stunted here, lack of opportunity.  And so they'd end up moving to different places.  You know, we've talked about [HM] Dr. Asa Hilliard, and, you know, my Uncle Brad Robinson, some of those sort of folks, very educated, very smart and ultimately had to leave 'cause they didn't feel like there was a--the opportunity set here in Denver, part of its mass, you know, just, you know, x number of, of African Americans and, and people and opportunity versus being in Colorado, which in that period of time was not as populated a state, obviously.
Story_ID: 624643
Speaker 1: So your mother [Sylvia Smith] came from Washington [D.C.] to go, you said to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: To the University of Northern Colorado at Greeley [Colorado]--
Speaker 1: Because it had a very good--
Speaker 2: Teachers program.
Speaker 1: Teachers program.  Okay, how did your parents meet then?
Speaker 2: That's because when she moved here, you know, she got involved in the black community.  And my dad [William Smith]'s family with, think about it, you know, eight siblings, right.  It was huge as a family, right?  And they owned, you know, that little soda shop where all the teenagers went so everybody, my--so it was my dad.  Then he had six sisters, very beautiful sisters.  And they were, you know, beauty queens and, you know, "Miss Five Point", all those sorts of--you know, they won, you know, the prom queen.  They were very beautiful, still are, beautiful girls.  So everybody knew them.  And then my uncle, my Uncle Wayne, Uncle Buddy, (unclear) was a jazz musician.  So he played the bass.  So when folks would come through town, he would play the bass, you know, it's a back-up band or the pick-up band or whatever it was.  So they were very well-known family in that community, in the "Five Points" community, etc.  So when my mother came, so you have this beautiful girl coming from Washington, D.C., and then go to like the Owl's Club, which was, you know, the debutante balls and all that and so to those social events, you know, my dad, of course, got his eye on my mother, and, and, and history kind of started there (laughter), at least from my perspective.  So that's how that happened.
Story_ID: 624644
Speaker 1: Your siblings, give their names?
Speaker 2: I have one brother, Allan Montgomery Smith.
Speaker 1: And he's--
Speaker 2: Older.  He's a year and a half--
Speaker 1: Older.
Speaker 2: --older.  He was born in June 21st, 1961.
Speaker 1: So there're two boys?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That they have. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Just the two boys.
Story_ID: 624645
Speaker 1: So can you tell me what your earliest memory is, of growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory, hah, that's interesting, you know.  I have a number of them.  I mean I remember growing up and being in, you know, the backyard of, you know, when I was probably one or two years old, with my brother.  And he was in the swing, and I remember just being there, you know, with, with my mother [Sylvia Smith] and a part of that you remember, part of it you remember 'cause it's a photograph of those sort of moments.  But I remember growing up in, not too far from--you know, in the East, what was called East Denver [Colorado], and growing up in this one tiny, little house with my mother, my father [William Smith], and my brother [Alan Montgomery Smith], that was filled with activity.  And when I say "filled with activity", some of that's kind of self-started activity.  But we also had a lot of visitors to the house over the weekends.  My father played the piano.  He played the organ.  He actually went to school on a band scholarship, so he as a very accomplished musician, as most of the family members on that side were.  And so he and my--his twin sister, on Sundays, would come and they'd play.  You know, he played the piano or she played the piano, and he played the organ, and they'd play duets.  And people would stop by and some would play with them, and some would just kind of hang out and just, just seemed like all kinds of people in and out of the house on Sundays.  And they just--we were on one of the main thoroughfares on 26th Avenue, 26th and Cook [Denver, Colorado], and people literally just stopped by and come, stop in and just hang out and hang--have a glass of lemonade and talk or whatever, and my parents to have Friday fish fries, which I do here at Lincoln Hills [Colorado] again, where the community would come, and they'd, you know, literally people--the kids would be playing, you know, playing around and parents were playing Dominos or cards and watching slide shows and those slide projectors in the backyard.  And that was a lot of fun.  I remember my dad ran a group called the Avant-garde.  And it was a club.  It was a all-male club.  I say that, and it was basically all my--we called them all uncles, right, and every summer, you know, they'd have different sort of community-based activities, but they'd take the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] usually over the 4th of July and rent out the whole thing and have an open, kind of family, you know, barbeques and races and all that sort of stuff.  So I remember those from, you know, kinda day one.  I remember spending the summers with, you know, looking forward to the Avant-Garde, you know, picnic on 4th of July.  So I remember that--it's kind of funny that the community felt again, full.  You know, I didn't think that we lacked anything.  I do remember one memory once where, you know when I telling you we started segregation or desegregation, right, so I was bused to the other part of town, went to Carson Elementary School [Denver, Colorado].  And so now I had these parents, very educated, you know.  One was a Ph.D. and one working on their Ph.D.  And I looked at the house that we lived in, which was a fine, well-kept tiny house.  And then over time, I got to know some of the, you know, the students who I went to school with, white students and Jewish students, and I got to know their parents who were nowhere near as educated, but yet their houses were like four times bigger, and they lived in a much prettier neighborhood.  And I couldn't reconcile that when I was a kid.  I didn't quite understand that.  Well, how can it be?  I have the most educated parents of any of my friends, but yet, we don't have the best house or we don't live in, you know, the best neighborhood.  I didn't--I couldn't quite understand that.  And that's where things started kind of hitting me in the face about, you know, how a little bit of American society worked.  And I wasn't too happy about that.
Story_ID: 624646
Speaker 1: So what, I mean what age are you when you start not being able to reconcile that?
Speaker 2: You know, it was kinda age six--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Six.
Speaker 2: --seven, eight, you know.  That's--'cause it's kinda hitting you in the face, right, okay.  And why do I have to get up in the morning, go get on this bus and go an hour to this school or forty minutes, whatever it was, and this other kid lives in a nicer house, and wakes up and walks across the street and now he's in school.  Well, my dad's [William Robert Smith] a principal at a school five blocks away, and why can't I go to that school, right?  And then I look at that kid's house versus the house we lived in, and I find out well, what's that kid's dad do, right?  And what's his mother do?  His mother may be a homemaker, and, you know, dad, you know, is a, you know, construction, you know, or construction--and it just didn't make sense to me.  I didn't quite get all of that, you know.  And so those are the things that, you know, didn't make a lot of sense in early childhood education for me.
Speaker 1: And you were talking about sights and so Carson, Carson is a street?
Speaker 2: No, Carson Elementary [School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Oh, Carson was elementary.  But, but the street you lived on?  Was it 26th--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Twenty-sixth and Cook [26th and Cook].
Speaker 1: Twenty-sixth and Cook [26th and Cook].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 624647
Speaker 1: So can you, can we go back to that, that neighborhood?  Now, you lived there how long?
Speaker 2: Until I pretty much graduated from high school [Denver East High School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you--so can you describe the neighborhood?  You've talked about some--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --sights, but can you--I'd like to know even the sights--I wanna know about the neighborhood, but I also want to know the sights, smells and sounds that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sure, I lived, we lived on the corner of 26th and Cook [Denver, Colorado].  And it was across the street from City Park Golf Course, which is why all my friends play golf, I think (laughter).  And that's why I started one of my first businesses collecting and selling golf balls because they'd hit them into our yard, and I'd polish them up and go back out there and resell them back to the golfers, and, you know, make a good, good living that way as a young boy.  I lived across the street from Gary Rose [ph.] who was one of our, you know, state representatives, and next door to George Brown [ph.] who was the first black Lieutenant Governor in the State of Colorado.  We had a Pullman porter who lived in our neighborhood, you know, Mr. Moore [ph.].  Then, Miss Buzby [ph.] lived down the street from us.  I'm not quite sure what she did now that I'm thinking about it.  But then, we had a couple who were dentists, and another family who was a contractor.  My best friend, his dad was a, you know, a general contractor.  We had a real estate agent, you know, a guy ran, owned his own real estate company, Dave Smith who was a big real estate company in the area.  So it was, it was a true middle-class, American neighborhood that was, you know, 98 percent African American growing up.  Our neighborhood was filled with lots of kids, like all neighborhoods were then.  And, you know, you kinda had little block, block-by-block type loyalties, but as you grew up and you had the ability to go and meet more kids, you figured out they're pretty much like you and then you have races in the streets which was always a lot of fun.  And you'd get together, and you'd have a football game over on the golf course in the evening, and, you know, it'd be twelve on twelve as substitutes.  I mean it was that many kids (laughter) running around, which was actually pretty neat.  And then the sights and sounds.  Growing up in Colorado, it was always, you know, hey, it's a beautiful state, and you get, you know, decent and, you know, variable weather.  So, you know, sometimes in October you'd have a two-foot snowstorm or in May, you'd have a three-foot snowstorm.  Or sometimes in December, the sky would be blue, and it's 78 degrees.  And that was one of the joys of being here.  One thing about Colorado, it's always had blue skies.  You get the snow, but then it'd clear up.  And so it was a very happy, feeling place.  You got a lot of sunshine.  You had an opportunity to go out and, you know, we would ride our bikes during the summers all day.  You know, you'd get on the bike.  You would leave in the morning, and pack a sandwich, and, you know, and, and go.  And, you know, I'm surprised our parents let us do that.  I don't know if they knew we were doing that.  We'd just get on bikes and just ride, and, you know, just you had to be home before the street lights were on, right.  We had neighborhood stores, and I remember there was one store, he used to crack me up, Mr. McGee [ph.].  He'd make the best hamburgers, but he'd go down and he'd sell golf balls and earn some money and you'd go down to his store, and his hamburgers were like $0.50 cents.  And you'd go in and say, "All right, Mr. McGee, I'd like a hamburger.".  And, you know, you sit down at the counter, and then he'd give you--he'd say, it's $0.50 cents.  You give him $0.50 cents, and he'd give you a dime.  Then you had to go to the store, which was down the block, and go get a quarter pound of meat (laughter) hamburger.  And then you'd bring it back to him.  (Laughter) And then he'd make a hamburger for you, right.  (Laughter) And, and you'd sit there and watch him cook that up.  So that was actually a lot of, that was kind of funny.  It's one of the stories I tell my kids.  That was a guy who really understood "just-in-time inventory" management systems for sure.
Story_ID: 624648
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you were talking about the, the--
Speaker 2: The neighborhood.
Speaker 1: That's the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was a fun neighborhood, you know, lots of kids and, you know, lots of, you know, bicycles.  I remember when I was growing up I had a bunch of different businesses.  So everything--I had a bicycle parts business.  I had a lawn-mowing business.  I had a golf ball business.  In fact, I missed out on my first billion dollars--maybe not a billion, with golf balls.  Let me tell you the story.  So every--we lived right off the third fairway, just at the point if you actually had a really good slice in your game which most golfers do, you're gonna end up hitting your ball on our front yard (laughter).  Okay, and they'd collect along the fence, and we kept the grass sufficiently high that you would never find it.  Well, what my brother [Allan Smith] and I would do, would go out, and we'd go collect these golf balls and, you know, we'd sort them and clean them up.  And, you know, the ones that looked pristine, you know, you sell those for a dollar or $0.50 cents or whatever it was.  And then the ones that were chopped up pretty bad, you'd bundle them up and sell them a bag for $0.25 cents.  Well, we also liked to play golf, but we couldn't play golf 'cause you couldn't afford the green fees, but we'd play at night.  So when we saw them starting to put the sprinklers on, we'd get out, you know, the two or three clubs that we had, and we'd go out and we'd hit the golf ball around.  Now, of course, during dusk, you start losing sight of these golf balls.  So my brother and I decided we're gonna paint these golf balls fluorescent colors so we can see them at night, okay.  So we went and got fluorescent paint, green and orange and yellow and started painting golf balls fluorescent colors and that's how we could play golf at night and see the balls, right.  Well, fifteen years or ten years later, you started seeing people actually sell fluorescent colored golf balls, and I'm like, man, we should a just stuck with that idea and life would have been easy from there.  But we enjoyed that.  You know, we enjoyed that whole process of, you know, being in business and making money and we'd sell some on the third tee, and then my friend, Peter Howard [ph.], lived up the road.  We'd get him to sell it on the fourth tee and 'cause they, 'cause it was off the fourth tee.  He couldn't actually get a whole lot of golf balls 'cause they wouldn't hit them directly over to his room.  So we did a little franchise model which actually worked out pretty well (laughter).  And we'd take all our money and either go to Mr. McGee's [ph.] or really Celebrity Sports Center and play, you know, what were then the, you know, real-time video games which was, you know, car racing and all that sort of stuff and bowling, and, you know, it's a lot of fun growing up.
Story_ID: 624649
Speaker 1: So, it was a very happy time growing up in that context.  I didn't feel--I felt safe.  I didn't feel--and my parents [Sylvia Smith and William Smith] and because, you know, it wasn't a whole lot of TV watching.  Honestly, you know, you did--you weren't as in tune with the news or what was going on in other parts of America.  Now, I want you to think about this.  This is 1968 through 1972, '73 [1973].  Some of the volatile times in Civil Rights history in the United States.  And I was six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old.  And while you would hear about it at the tables and my parents would talk about it, it didn't affect your psyche 'cause you didn't feel like, you know, you were being attacked every day.  We weren't having necessarily those sort of sit-ins, although my dad was very instrumental in helping the teachers' unions here in, in Denver [Colorado] in that period of time.  So, you know, I heard about some of that sort of strife in that context.  But you didn't feel it until, and I think it was like '71 [1971] and '72 [1972], one of my uncles was killed.  And it was Uncle Roosevelt.  Now, my parents would always talk about education and working hard and, you know, working hard was what I call leveling the playing field.  And I think it was 1972, in fact, 1971, '72 [1972].  So I was eight, nine years old.  And this was one of my really cool uncles 'cause he had a Corvette.  And I was like all youth, into cars.  So, you know, he had finished his degree and was working for the State of Colorado.  And he was an inspector so he went like, you know, went from like place to place and did inspections, etc.  And he went to a gas station and was filling his up using a state credit card.  And the gas station owner decided that an African American should not have a state credit card.  He must have stolen it.  So he shot him and he killed him at a gas station.  And my parents had a hard time explaining that story to me.  I'm like why would they kill Uncle Roosevelt.  He was just, you know, cool, had an Afro, you know, smart, educated, had a cool car, why would they kill him?  How do you explain that to a kid?  And that's when you start to understand, you know, how racism has no explanation.
Story_ID: 624650
Speaker 1: So you didn't, you know, you talked about sights, and were very good with sights, but what about smells and sounds?
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  I'll start with sounds.  That's the easiest one, right.  So music was the sound that was everywhere growing up.  As I told you, my father [William Smith] played the piano and he and his sister would play pretty much every Sunday in our living room.  And people would come by and come through when, you know, he, he would love to play the organ and played the piano.  And so he'd play everything from, you know, gospel, to opera, to ragtime or whatever it might be.  And he'd play for a couple hours on Sundays.  And that was kinda his way, I think, just to relax.  It's kinda interesting to watch him get into that Zin-like, you know, kind of position.  He played from memory, right (laughter).  And was, it was actually pretty and I, when I think about it, it was, it was warming in that regard.  So, you know, I learned to play the piano.  My brother [Allan Smith] learned to play the piano.  Then I took up the saxophone.  He took up the trombone, but music was always really pervasive in our whole community.  You know, my uncle played the bass, you know.  There, like, you know, my aunt, like I said, played the piano.  My dad also played the drums.  And, you know, so we're always in the band, and I had my own little band growing up.  We won a couple of talent shows and all that sort of stuff, you know, and, you know, junior high school and high school-timeframe.  And so it was just very much a big part of life.  So the sounds that I heard a lot were musical sounds being created in what are called analog instruments for people to enjoy, you know.  Growing up where we grew up, it was, it was--because we were across the street from the golf course and the city park, you know, when I started going to my high school--or I'm sorry, my junior high school which, before I had a car.  And then I go (unclear) high school, you know, you're in nature quite a bit because you're just walking through the park, back and forth.  So you got a chance to hear, you know, the--we had the Canadian geese that landed on the, on the, on the golf course every wintertime, and as you're walking, you know, you're seeing birds and, you know, all sorts of, you know, to the extent there's city wildlife.  And that was kind of a neat part of growing up.  So, even when you left school, you walked four blocks, and then you hit a park, and then you've got a good, was that eleven, twelve, you know, fifteen blocks of greenery every single day.  And that was kind of a neat part of living.  And then I remember when I first started going to junior high school, you know, you used to have, you know, the, the, you know, the ninth graders would try to beat up the seventh graders, you know, to chase you home kind of thing.  And so, you know, a buddy of mine, we, we'd go to the museum every single day and kinda hide out until we knew they went home, right?  (Laughter) And, and so that's kind of, you know, and then you're walking through the Museum of Natural History every day.  And after a while, you just start looking at everything, and after a while you start studying everything, and after a while, you know, you start to create an appreciation for the things you saw in natural history.  And that's probably part of why I enjoy the outdoors as well, right, 'cause I got a chance to really see the different exhibits every single day, if you think about that, for, you know, seventh grade at least.  And then, you know, less so in eighth grade.  But, you know, that was a, a good period of time to actually just do some augmented fundamental education at that time.  So those are some of the sounds, I guess, that, that I heard, the nature sounds and music.  Smells, a little different.  You know, you know, my mother [Sylvia Smith] once she had me and was then, started pursuing, you know, she worked every day and then drove to Greeley [Colorado] to work on her Ph.D.  So, you know, while she was a, a great homemaker in that regard, you know, she wasn't there cooking all day, you know, and the house filled with those sorts of smells.  But, you know, she was, what I'll say, a good cook, but, you know, those weren't necessarily the smells that I remember growing up.  But I do remember the smells of my dad's barbeque 'cause he was a really good barbeque chef and making sauce and all that.  But, you know, he did that in the summers, on the weekends and anytime he started barbequing, everybody--remember all the people came over.  Even more came over 'cause everybody kinda liked his sauce and all that sort of stuff.  And that was a fun part of, fun part of growing up as well.  And then, of course, you know, when we, you know, on the weekends, going visiting the different local shops and the foods and all that, but that, that was, that was kind of a neat, neat time 'cause, you know, there were local shops owned by local people.  And, you know, you'd smell whatever it was that they were cooking or making that day.  And, you know, "Daddy Bruce's Barbeque"--I don't know if you interviewed him.  But, you know, Bruce Randolph.  There's a street named after him, and there were those sort of places that, that we frequented to actually enjoy what I call, you know part of the, eating, cultural part of living.
Story_ID: 624651
Speaker 1: So, what--how would you describe yourself as a young boy?  We know you were entrepreneurial, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, very curious, you know, very curious.  I enjoyed math and science.  I enjoyed reading and history.  I mean I was a good student.  So I would say I was a student.  Some would say a nerd, but, but also, I was a pretty good athlete.  I had an ear injury which was a ruptured eardrum and had, I think, seven surgeries before I was into eighth grade.  And so that inhibited some of that early growing of participating in sports, but I participated in high school, in varsity letters and, you know, football, wrestling, track, and all this kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: And how did that happen, that you got--
Speaker 2: You know, it's, just the--you know, it's one of those things.  The Eustachian tube was closed and built up pressure, and it kept pressuring, rupturing the eardrum, and ultimately, I got a, you know, patches ear graft to patch my ears.  So just one of those things.  So that kept me out of sports for, I'll call it, elementary school going into early junior high school, but then got back into sports in late junior high school and high school.  And I enjoyed sports.  I enjoyed teamwork, comradery.  I was captain of the football team and all those sort of things.  So I was, I was, I was social.  I was a fairly popular kid.  I had a good group of friends who were also, you know, dedicated to trying to improve their station in life.  And we talked about it--and we still get together.  I mean it's, we, it's we get together as if we haven't been apart.  And they've been friends since--some of them since, you know, junior high school, one of them since I was born, but some since, you know, high school.  And, in fact, they were just at my, my wedding a few weeks ago, and it's as if we hadn't parted, right.  And when we sat and talked about it, you know, me and one other guy--we're the only ones with fathers in our house, you know, and the guy who had the other father didn't have a mother in his house.  And, you know, one was a foster kid, you know, and the others were basically raised by, you know, single mothers.  And my dad [William Smith] was kind of one of the people in the, that they all viewed as the, you know, the person they wanted to be like.  In fact, one of them became a principal because, you know, he said, I liked the way your dad's lifestyle worked, and that seemed like that was a good way to live.  And so he went out and got his Ph.D. and became an elementary school principal as well.
Story_ID: 624652
Speaker 1: So where does the business come from?  If you have two, two educators, where is the entrepreneurial part coming from--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with you, and I'm just curious.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's a good question.  So, you know, growing up, and I think I told you, you know, I had little businesses where, you know, selling golf balls or, you know, selling bark--bike parts and trading them or shoveling snow or cutting grass, whatever it was.  And then--and this is kinda where the, the story begins, right.  And I've always worked.  I've always, you know, everything from flipping burgers and--
Speaker 1: Is that your father [William Smith]?  Is that your parents insisting they're gonna have two boys, make them work or is that you?  That's what I'm trying to understand?
Speaker 2: I grew up with an older brother and the way I thought about it, I always wore his clothes until I was probably fourteen years old.  You know, it was hand-me-downs, right.  So it was a constant life of hand-me downs.  You know, it was the beginning of the year, you know, we'd go get a couple pairs of jeans at Sears [Sears Roebuck & Company] and, you know, a couple of shirts.  And that lasts you all year.  And then those jeans became your shorts for the summer 'cause you cut them off (laughter).  And it was between that and the hand-me-downs.  That's, you know, how you had clothes.  So if you wanted clothes or anything, you had to go earn some money or if you wanted to go out and do--if you wanted gas for your car.  If you wanted insurance for your car.  If you wanted to buy a car, I mean you had to go earn your money, period.  If you wanted to go to, you know, the Golf Celebrity Sports Center, which was, you know, a little, local arcade, you needed money, right.  And, you know, our parents, our allowances, whatever to the extent there was one, you know, $0.50 cents a week kind of a thing.  That wasn't gonna do much for you.  So I always liked to have and do things that were fun, you know, going to the amusement parks or anything.  So you had to work and earn money and save that money.  So I've always worked as far as I can remember.  And, you know, besides, you know, birthday money that you might get from time to time from relatives, etc.  But as you started, as I started to getting to high school, now, I've bought my first car.  You know, I was a sweeper boy actually at my junior high school.  So, go to school, junior high school, go to wrestling practice and then you're a sweeper boy.  (Laughter) So, you know, every day, right.  So after that, you know, then you, then you go home.  Well, I earned enough money to buy, you know, a '69 [1969] Plymouth Satellite.  It didn't work, had to push it home with some friends of mine.  And my mom [Sylvia Smith] was mad 'cause she didn't want me to buy the car (laughter).  And I, you know, she took the keys away.  So then I had to earn money to get it working, you know, buy some motor mounts and fix it and all that sort of stuff.  But, you know, that's part of that joy of figuring out, you know, what was wrong with the thing and getting it working.  And then, of course, you had to have insurance, and then, of course, you had to have gas, and then you had to actually make it so it's ridable.  So, you know, work was natural, you know.  I always thought about work was just a part of life, and you had to do it. So--
Story_ID: 624653
Speaker 1: Now, how is your older brother [Allan Smith] differing from you?  Is he the same, you know, in that way?  Is he--I'm talking about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean he, he--my, my older brother --he's funny.  He was always, I always say the biggest guy in the school, right.  Even if he was in third grade, he was bigger than sixth graders (laughter), you know, and he's still, you know, he's just--physically, physical specimen, just, you know, big and strong and all that sort of thing and a very good athlete.  And so that was one of the things, you know, growing up, you know, I was always referred to as "Little Smith", you know.  So it's kinda in the shadow of your big brother all the time.  And he worked, and, you know, he worked at, you know, various jobs, you know, working at the hospital or, you know, as an orderly kind of a person or, you know, cleaning up or, you know, working at the, you know, one of the local pizza joints, etc., you know.  And then he started working at the water department, and he decided to go into a career in engineering and, you know, went to CSU [Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado] in engineering.  He was a year and a half older than I was, but two grades ahead.  So, yeah, so I mean he worked as well, so that was a model that I also saw in terms of working.
Story_ID: 624654
Speaker 1: Where it became professional working as opposed to just nickel and dime working happened in my junior year in high school [Denver East High School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So my junior year in high school, I was actually working at a local ski shop, Garr Brothers, selling skis and stuff like that and cleaning up.  I started off as a stock boy, and they figured out I had a, a gift for selling.  And so I started selling skis and poles and all that sort of stuff.  But that year I took a class in computer science, and this was, computers were just getting, first getting introduced.  This is, you know, 1980s, okay.  And as I took this class, you know, the teacher at the time--this is the high school, you know, was talking about this thing called a transistor which basically is the fundamental, you know, building block of computation in computers.  And it was developed at this place called Bell Labs.  And I said, wow, and I remember hearing there was a Bell Labs in Colorado.  And I found out.  And so I called--well, first I talked to one of my mom's friends who said, "Oh, yeah, there's a Bell Labs."  And somehow or another I got the telephone number of the Bell Labs in Westminster, Broomfield, Colorado.  And I called the human resources woman.  This was in January, and I said, listen, I'm a student, a high school student.  I'm a junior, and I'm interested in seeing if you have summer internships.  And she said, you know, if you're between your junior and senior year in college, then we have summer internships.  I said, well, that's terrific 'cause I'm a junior in high school, and I'm taking AP classes, and I'm getting all A's.  So it's just like being in college.  And she said, "No, it isn't.  Why don't you apply when you become a junior in college?"  And so she hung up the phone.  Well, I called her the next day.  And we had a similar conversation the next day.  And I called her the next day, and I called her every day for about two weeks.  Now, after, of course, that second day, she stopped the call, and I just left a message.  And then every Monday, I would call her, and I'd leave a message until June.  So it was about the week before school was out, 'cause remember back then, we got out of school in late June or mid-June, I get a call back at the house.  And my dad says, this woman calls--remember there were no answering machine, so he just happened to be there, so he took the message.  He says, this woman from Bell Labs called and wants you to call her back.  I said, okay.  So I called her back.  She said, "Listen, a student from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] didn't show up.  We have an extra space.  We're not guaranteeing it to you.  We don't know you, never met you, but why don't you come down and interview?"  And so we set a date for later that week, and I got $2.00 worth of gas to put in my, my '69 [1969] Plymouth Satellite and had, you know, put on the one suit that I owned and drove out to Bell Labs and had an interview, and had another interview that day and another interview.  And I ended up getting a job at Bell Labs as a seventeen-year old, high school student.
Story_ID: 624655
Speaker 1: And they partnered me first with a guy who was a master's degree, you know, student.  Then they put me with a guy who was Ph.D. in solid states physics.  His name is Vic Houser [ph.], lived in Boulder [Colorado].  And that was my mentor, and we shared an office.  And Vic helped me understand that whole concept.  He didn't say it in these words, what I call discovering the joy of figuring things out.  And so, you know, he, he had this high school guy kinda sitting next to him and looking at him, and he said, "Okay, here's our problem.  This is an operational amplifier", and he held up his integrated circuit.  He said, these are failing in the field, in our Merlin systems.  And we need to figure out why so we can fix it.  And he put the operational amplifier on the desk, and he slid a sheet of paper over to me.  He said, "If you have any questions, ask me.  And the library's down the hall," and he turned around.  And I said, "Wow, okay.  First of all, what's an operational amplifier?  What's it supposed to do that it's not doing and why is it not doing it?"  And so now, the great process of discovery began.  And it was a practical Socratic method.  So I'd go to the library and I'd actually go look, what is an operational amplifier and figure it out.  What's a PN, what an MP junction?  How do these actually work?  And I have to get some real fundamental research (laughter) done to come back and ask him an intelligent question.  And when I asked him, he--an intelligent question, he would go to the white board and start to diagram the answer to that intelligent question and then leave it.  And I had go ask the next series of questions.  And over the course of that summer, I ended up having the best project and the best set of solutions.  I ended up building what's called a dynamic test oven which basically exercises these devices to force a failure.  And then when you force a failure, you could figure out which one's failed.  Then you cut them open and basically (unclear) them and look and see where, what the problem was.  And it was a leakage between a junction and basically one of the, you know, insulators was applied inaccurately or inconsistently.  And as a result of that, you know, you had failures in the junction, okay.  And so you could go back to the manufacturer which was Fairchild at the time, and then go to the manufacturing process and change it. So, that's where I discovered the joy of figuring things out because at the end of that summer, here I am, a high-school student, with a better project and a better answer and result and something I built with my own two hands.  And with his help, of course, discovered, you know, what the problems were and solved it.  That was one of the greatest moments of my life.  And from that, you know, I started really--and the good news about Bell Labs was, you could ask anybody any question at any time.  And you had the greatest scientists in the world at this place.  You know, this whole cell phone technology and all those things, that was all developed there and commercialized there.  I remember walking into one of the labs way back when and seeing the first basically, video conference call, unprecedented type stuff, right.  You know, and the first telephone back then.  I mean this was, this was amazing technology.  And that's when I realized that I wanted to be in the technical field 'cause I started to understand the implications ultimately of what technology can bring to not only everyone's life, but to business.
Story_ID: 624656
Speaker 1: Now, that had set me on that path.  Now, let me tell you a story that I don't think I've told many people.  Every day I'd get up at 4:30 to get in my car to drive to Bell Labs because that's what time I had to leave to get out to where it was and be at work early 'cause I didn't wanna be late.  I always wanna be there before anybody got there and leave after everybody left, and I'd go in on Saturdays, right, 'cause I really enjoyed this.  And I ended up co-oping with them and working with them for the next couple of years.  And every semester I'd come back.  Over Christmas, I'd come back, and they kept giving me a raise, and I got $145 a week.  I said, "Oh, my God," I mean how can--that's a lot of money, right (laughter).  And it was, it was an experience for me that I'll never forget.  But every day when I got up and drove at 4:00 o'clock in the morning, I would drive by an oil refinery.  And it was the Vickers Oil Refinery.  And I don't know if you ever seen an oil refinery when it's dark out.  It looks like a little city with all the lights and all the little ortho [ph.] crackers and distillation columns, etc.  And every day you go by this thing, and you start wondering, well, who owns that things, and who gets to own one of those things?  It looks like a little mini-city, right.  And then I started thinking about, that's what--I said, you know, that's how you can actually be wealthy in America.  You gotta own a business like that, (unclear) now, you see a city, you gotta own a city.  I said, one day I'm gonna own a city like that, own a refinery and be a successful business person.  And as I started thinking more and more and doing more research on it, and started reading about people like Carnegie, okay, and J.P. Morgan, you know, Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan and, you know, [James] Fisk, and all these sort of guys, I--you just, you start saying, oh, wow, okay.  You know, if Cornelius Vanderbilt (unclear), some of these folks started from nothing.  Some started from, you know, a good base of wealth, but some started from nothing.  But they came up with singular, individual ideas that no one else had, that they knew would ultimately transform an industry or a way of life.  They were dogged in their pursuit.  They typically figured out some way of doing it that no one else had figured out.  They made it, what I call sustainable.  And that kinda set me on that path of thinking about, I wanna be in business, and I wanna be in business in a big way and come up with something that has all those dimensions, changes life, changes pattern, creates massive amounts of wealth and creates an opportunity to, to change the way that, frankly, and it kinda gets back to the station of African Americans.  One thing that I realized, I wanted to ensure that African Americans were going to be relevant, just not in the past of American history, but in the future.  And America is a capitalistic country.  And it is those who have accomplished in that capitalistic world that are often the ones who become relevant.  And I said, we need more of our people to be accomplished in that world.  Yeah, I was familiar with Madam C.J. Walker's, but, you know, contemporaries.  Who were the contemporary African American business leaders?  You, of course, had the, you know, the publishers, you know, 'cause we all read, you know, Ebony and JET all the time, Ebony at house and JET at the barbershop, you know, kind of a thing.  And you knew about a few of, we'll call it the automobile dealer type folks.  But there weren't many.  Like there was the Mel Farrs of the world, way back when, right.  I had a couple of uncles who owned real estate businesses, but they were principals and owned a real estate business.  I'm like, well, why do you have to do both?  You know what I mean?  And there weren't any really big African American business owners that I looked to when I was growing up, okay, outside of the publishing world.  Sure, we knew all about the sports guys who made money and some entertainment guys who we heard made money and all that sort of stuff, but not in business.  And that was when you--when I really started to understand that that's what was respected, you know, the company like AT&T, right, and Ma Bell, all the--these were big businesses based on technology.  And I said, okay, that's a good way to go.  So, ultimately--Go ahead, I'm sorry--
Story_ID: 624657
Speaker 1: I wanna, not to jump in, but, Robert, I wanna take you back just a little bit just to find out the education.  So--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And you went--elementary school was Car--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I went to Harrington kindergarten [Harrington Elementary School, Denver, Colorado]--
Speaker 1: First.
Speaker 2: Yeah, which is right across the street (laughter), right across the street from my, my aunt's house, my dad's [William Robert Smith] twin sister, who basically raised all the kids up until they, you know, went to first grade 'cause, you know, all the parents would drop them off at her house, and they'd--we'd all kinda play together until our parents came home from school.  And so Harrington, which was right across the alley from her--I'm just laughing as I was telling the story to my daughter, that every week for "Show and Tell", I brought rocks, 'cause I didn't have anything.  But when you walked from my aunt's house to school, we had to walk through an alley.  It was about ten yards, and I'd look for the most interesting rock I could find for "Show and Tell", and that's what I brought every week (laughter) to "Show and Tell".  Anyway, maybe that helps with my, my--you know, and then I had to come up with something different about these rocks (laughter) unless you--so anyway, Harrington Elementary.  Then I went to Carson Elementary School [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: And that's when you were bussed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from first grade through fifth grade.
Speaker 1: So how was that experience in this class?
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  It was, it was good, I thought.  So here you had this whole busload of kids showing up at Carson, one bus, Bus Number 13, of course, right.  And we'd show up at Carson (laughter).  And it was all the kids from my neighborhood.  Now, the good news was there were sixth graders there.  I was a first grader.  You know, these are the big sixth graders, right, and some of them now are, you know, [Allegra] "Happy Haynes" and, you know, all that, these--yeah, Khadija [Haynes] and all.  I mean those, that's (laughter) that's my neighborhood right.  And so they were the older kids.  So that I'm sure they felt the brunt of us walking into this school.  As a first grader, you know, we walk in, go to the right, go to the first-grade classroom and, you know, I was in there with--there were three other first graders on my bus, me and Chuck and Mary Ann Robinson [ph.].  That was it.  Those were the first graders in that class, period.  And there were two classrooms though sometimes two of us were in one room.  But they put Chuck and I in separate rooms 'cause we were boys.  And Mary Ann kinda jumped between the two, and, you know, she, she was, you know, his sister, but they were actually foster kids or adopted kids.  But, you know, nobody knew it, but anyway.  That's how that worked.  So we just kinda went through, right.  And that was interesting.  And it was fun, and I thought things were, you know--in the playground like all things else, you know, everybody was just worrying about who was the fastest and in the classroom, who was the smartest, right.  And I just turned out to be, you know, if not the smartest, one of the smartest in the classroom, and, you know, I was just mad that I just couldn't be the fastest, right.  So, you know, I was always working on my speed but (laughter), you know, for field day and all that sort of stuff.  But it was a good, it was a good, happy way of growing up--
Story_ID: 624658
Speaker 1: Okay, you--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: So my, yeah, kindergarten teacher was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So it's almost like the neighborhood is bused out?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Harrington [Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] wasn't in my neighborhood.  It was in my aunt's neighborhood.
Speaker 1: It was in your aunt's.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, but it was still a all-black neighborhood, right.  But there were still--my kindergarten teacher was white, my teacher, and she was very nice.  And I liked her a lot.  Then when I went to Carson [Elementary School, Denver, Colorado], I had, you know, again white teachers up until third grade where I had Mrs. Olivier [ph.].  I'll tell you about that one in a minute 'cause she reminded me of my aunts 'cause all my aunts were teachers.  And here I had this brown-skinned, third-grade teacher named Mrs. Olivier.  And I liked her a lot.  She was awesome, you know.  She helped me understand and, and just be excited about writing and music and all sorts of things.  I mean it's third grade, and all, you know--but up until then, you know, they were, you know, white teachers in first grade, second grade.  But they were nice teachers.  You know, I had a young teacher, Mrs. Biorck [ph.].  Oh, my God, I can't remember her name, but, you know, Mrs. Austin, second grade, Mrs. Olivier, third grade.  I mean that's funny, right.  (Laughter) But, but good teachers, and I, I never felt that I was what I'll disadvantaged in the classroom being the only African American boy in my classrooms, from kindergarten till fifth grade, okay.  I was--well, there was another guy, Kenneth, actually, Kenneth--but Kenneth, I don't think he was in my classroom but once in fifth grade.  And he lived there, and his dad was an architect, an African American, dad's architect--I think he was an architect.  I'm pretty sure he was a architect, lived out there, Kenneth Hudson.  But that was it, right.  But, you know, I was gonna say, the thing that you did feel is, when kids would come back and talk about the birthday party they had over the weekend and you weren't invited, right.  And that's that sort of, huh?  And then, you know, one of my buddies, Albert Habercamp [ph.] invited me to his birthday party and his Bar Mitz--you know, Bar Mitzvah, but his birthday.  And that was the first time I was like seeing those houses.  And I was like, oh, my goodness, these people live really well, right, kind of a thing.  So, but in the classroom, K through five, it was fine.  But then an interesting happened, and then they, in sixth grade, they decided to do a half day at our local school and a half day at a different school, strangest thing.  My class--'cause I'm gone through first grade.  Nobody's experienced it but my class.  So then we went to Columbine Elementary [School, Denver, Colorado].  That was in my neighborhood, different direction, okay.  That was rough.  That was a rough school.  And it was one of those, you know, dealing with what I call--now, I'm dealing with, you know, African Americans in my class, and African American boys in my class every day.  And, of course--not of course, but, you know, I was a great student and, frankly, a better student than most.  And so, at Harrington [sic, Carson Elementary School, Denver, Colorado], they actually separated my workload from all the other kids, which wasn't necessarily the greatest thing socially for me.  So sixth grade, they give the assignment to the classroom and say, but, "Robert, you're gonna work on this assignment."  Now, I got these guys from the neighborhood, who I didn't know 'cause they were from a different part of the neighborhood, further out, right.  Well, who's this kid wearing glasses, all that sort of stuff.  So now everybody wants to beat me up, kind of a thing.  So now, you learn to fight, right.  And those were good experiences then 'cause fighting back then was truly just wrestling and fighting, not what fighting is today (laughter), you know what I mean, where, you know, true life and limb is, is put at risk.  So it toughens you up in that regard because you had to walk there to school and walk home every day.  But the, it was the craziest thing.  So we spent a half a day a Columbine, and then get on the bus and get bussed out to University Park [Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] for another half a day, and that's an all-white school.  And then you got a whole nother inversion 'cause now that group of black kids are out at this other school, and now they separate the class differently that way.  It was the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Speaker 1: Did you remember your parents talking about this at all?
Speaker 2: Of course.  Yeah, and I told them, this is ridiculous.  And they said, we agree, but remember my parents are DPS, Denver Public School people, and so, you know, they have to tow the party line.  Now, that next year--
Speaker 1: Now, a couple of things I also wanna understand.  By this, remember you said when you had the ear surgery, that's earlier?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, I'm going through that too, right.  So I'm coming up, showing up at school with half my head shaved 'cause they had to shave the head, to take the skin, to take to make the skin.  And I'm going--I mean it's crazy, right.  And I'm still trying to play sports like basketball and still trying to fit in and still playing a few--it was rough.  I mean sixth grade was horrible from that perspective.  That next year, was it that year or the year before, my brother [Allan Smith]--there was an outreach program at Phillips Exeter Academy.  And my brother got selected 'cause he's--my brother is really smart.  He's like my mom [Sylvia Smith], right.  But if he likes a class, he'll get an "A".  If he, if he didn't like the teacher, he was gonna get a "D".  That's just who he is, but, you know, test wise, you know, blows it away, right.  That's him.  He's that kinda guy.  He gets into Phillips Exeter [Exeter, New Hampshire], and they want him to come.  They were heavily recruiting, plus he's a--you know, physically, just a strong dude, plays golf and wrestles, but, you know, (laughter) you know what I mean.  And he decides not to go.  And I was sitting there saying, man, you should--and I'm sixth grade now, right, and I'm going through all this hell.  I'm like, oh, man, I, I just can't wait till it's my turn.  I really wanna go to, go away to boarding school, and this and that.  And so, you know, he doesn't go and goes into Denver East High School (unclear), okay, where my dad [William Smith] went to high school and half his brothers and sisters, where his sisters went to high school, and the other half went to Manuel High School [Denver, Colorado].  And I'm like--I, I can't wait till it's my turn 'cause I know Phillips Exeter is gon' come calling on me (laughter), right.  Well, as that time came, my mom and dad were just like, nah, we--you cannot, you're not gon' go away to boarding school.  And now I'm like, okay, and I really wanted to, but what are you gon' do.  And that's why my kids, they go to boarding school.  They, you know, one's finishing Hotchkiss [School, Lakeville, Connecticut], one's going to Cate [School, Carpenteria, California] and got, you know, two more now, but, you know, now, I'm gonna go to Denver East High School.
Story_ID: 624659
Speaker 1: Okay, so, then go to Gove Junior High School [Denver, Colorado], and I had a great experience there.  So that, I went from Columbine University Park [Denver, Colorado], sixth grade.  Then I went to Gove Junior High School, okay, and Gove was the feeder school to East [Denver East High].  Now, Gove was awesome.  It was one of the most diverse schools in the Denver Public School system, just 'cause of where--it's on 15th and--well, 14th and Colfax basically.  And for whatever reason, it just fed, it was fed by people from, you know, Park Hill [Denver, Colorado], from Marlin [ph.] (unclear) here where we grew up, from Southeast Denver and kids from all over, and from that neighborhood.  So it was diverse.  You had Latinos, you had, you know, Caucasians, you had blacks, you know, one or two, you know, you know, Asian.  And it was a cool school.  It looked like a prison, the new one.  The old one, we start off with the new one, looked (unclear) horrible school physically, but it was one of the greatest experiences that you could have in junior high.  A lot of people say that junior high was horrible.  Mine was actually pretty fantastic because I was in the band.  Even though I, you know, showing up with half my head shaved on the first day of school 'cause I had to have another ear surgery and all that sort of stuff, people were actually pretty cool.  And, you know, we played sports and, you know, you know, we had, of course, tracking.  Now, all of a sudden it's tracking again.  So I'm in the, in the high-level classes, and then there's, you know, all your buddies who you walk to school with go to the regular classes.  And so you don't see them except in sports and gym and (laughter), you know, in those sort of things.  And so you start to live and think about living in a couple of different worlds, right.  There's an academic world, and then there's a real day, you know, an every-day world.  And, you know, and it's funny, many of the guys who I have gotten to know through college and business school and all, had, also had similar experiences, right.  And it's that duality, and how do you handle that duality and how do you create convergence in your life where you talk a certain way in one set of classes, half the day and then have to talk another way when it's time for sports and, you know, and living every day, right.  And, you know, and then I was always a person who did well in school and got lots of awards.  So then when you had the award assemblies, and you're getting these awards and your buddies are like, well, why is this guy getting an award in math and why is he getting the award in science and we had no idea, you know, (laughter) because they knew, but, you know, you know what I mean kinda stuff.  So then you're starting to feel like, oh, gee, maybe I should downplay part of that, part of my being so I can get along a little more socially because as you get into junior high school, the social part of your life becomes, as a kid, of course, a little more important in your mind than some of the other parts academically.  So that was Gove Junior High, right.
Story_ID: 624660
Speaker 1: Now, was--are you experiencing, you said, I thought you had started to say that race maybe entered in, that everything was cool.  Was race entering at all, even in junior high school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know, junior--it, it entered insofar as the social dynamic for sure, but not is--not, let me put it that way, not necessarily as it related to how the kids engaged and interacted.  You know, I had friends of all races that would, that were present and available while we were in school.  And every now and then, like, you know, some of my friends like a leap, certain guys we'd hang out with, even after school.  But when you got, when you get older you figure out some of those guys were like, you know, the Greek family that moved into that white neighborhood.  And I'm hanging out with them, and so I'm thinking I'm in the white neighborhood or the Jewish family that's living in that white neighborhood, right, and I'm hanging out with them.  Then you're like, wait a minute, you know, that other, you know, never invited me over their house and never came to any of my birthday parties or, you know.  So I don't know if that's the kids or the parents.  But that is something that you, you didn't notice so much 'cause some of your friends that you got closer to, that wasn't an issue, but then when you look at their family in the context of where they lived, they were actually the outsiders in their neighborhood anyway.  You know, I don't realize that until ten years later 'cause they're just kids, right.  And that just kinda is what it is.  You see what I mean.  So it had an effect.  You know, I remember in high school, you know, I remember overhearing, you know, certain of the students angry with me because of either how I was performing or that I got a good job at Bell Labs and those sort of things because I'm black, right.  And I just remember those sort of conversations, you know, and the embarrassment they had when they saw me catch them saying it, and that sort of stuff.  Yeah, I mean that stuff and that's how racism works today.  They kind of say it in their own group, and then don't say it in front of you, right, except if they're quoting a rap lyric or something, right.  But that's, that's the challenge because it's not as overt, but yet, there's, you know, there--and can be that underlying tension in that regard.  You know, I saw a lot of that come out, of course, in high school when people were talking of where they got into college.  I got into great schools.  You know, I had great grades, you know, great test scores.  And I got into great schools.  And some of them had good grades and good test scores and didn't get into as good a schools, and so then you saw a little more of that visceral reaction, right.
Speaker 1: You're saying like, it's affirm--or he's getting in 'cause they have special programs for the black people or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you're kinda hearing that, right.  I'm like, hum.
Speaker 1: And what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It could be the fact that I just actually did better than you, but okay, right.  So there's those sort of interesting dynamics.  And the fact that, yeah, maybe you did a little better in your grades and test scores, but you don't play any, play any instruments and you don't play any sports, and you don't do any community activity and you don't work.  You go to school and go home and are proud of your 3-6, and I got a 3-6.  You may got a little better on the test scores, but you don't do anything else.  Now, you're on the (unclear), you're a big Editing Committee, so you can put all your own pictures, your own friends in the yearbook, whereas I'm varsity sports, you know, three different sports.  I'm working, you know what I mean?  So,--
Speaker 1: So, you're in three different sports?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, football, wrestling and track, yeah.  And I worked.  So after practice, I went to work in high school and worked at the hospital, you know, the night--basically, I was a grill chef at night.  So after practice, I'd go there and take over for the person who was there.  And so, you know, when you're at the hospital, somebody, you know, they cook hot dogs and hamburgers, all that sort of stuff.  Then I start working Garth Brothers, stocking shelves at night, and then ultimately, stayed over late, and, you know, selling skis.  But, yeah, that's what I did.  I worked after practice (laughter), you know, school, practice, go to work, go home, sleep, do whatever homework you can, go do it the next day.
Story_ID: 624661
Speaker 1: So are your family taking vacations?  They're not really family vacations during this time?
Speaker 2: You'd, every, you know, I remember taking one family vacation down at Durango [Colorado].  And we got in the car with the Scott's and we drove down to Durango, and it was like a ten-day trip.  Of course, my dad's [William Smith] smoking the whole way in the car.  So, you know, that was how it happened back then, right.  We went to San Diego [California] once, I remember doing that, you know.  When we were really little, we'd go back to Washington, D.C. with my mother [Sylvia Smith], you know, which was where her family was.  And, or they'd come out here, and we'd go fishing and that sort of stuff.  But it wasn't like in the summer, oh, we're going on family vacation.  The summer was when the parents as teachers were off, and you got to get on your bike in the mornings, and we'll see at, you know, at, you know, street lights.  And typical story up until, up until high school, you get up in the mornings, 7:00 o'clock, and you go down to the "Y" for swim lessons, walk down to the YMCA [Young Mens Christian Association], and you go swim, freezing cold outdoor pool (laughter), right.  And you have swim lessons till like 10:00 something, and then you would go have, you would have lunch usually there.  You have a sandwich or whatever it was.  Then you'd get on your bike or mom would drive us to the park, and you'd have tennis lessons, okay, 'cause these were all, you know, free tennis lessons.  You go have tennis lessons till about 2:00, whenever it was.  And then you'd get back on your back or your mom take you and then you go back to the YMCA for free swim, and you swim till 5:00.  And then you go home.  And you do that every day (laughter), right.  And then they had the programs at Manual [High School Denver, Colorado], where you'd go, and, you know, free programs.  You'd learn how to play golf and tennis and football or whatever it was.  And that was kinda what it was until you started working.  And then once you started working in junior high school, then you had your summer jobs working at Arby's or working at the, you know, at the, at the hospital or wherever it was.
Story_ID: 624662
Speaker 1: What else is forming you as a person?  I mean you've talked a lot, this is a very actively middle-class family, good, good solid, work ethic--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you're doing well.  You know, that's being encouraged.  What other things, you know, as you become aware of the--how much are you aware of the world around you?  And--
Speaker 2: You know, it--that's what I'm saying, you know, not so--remember, this is during the major surges in the civil rights area.  And besides, you know, of course, you know my Uncle Roosevelt being killed, and now the busing thing and what's that mean?  And now, I'm, I'm becoming aware of a difference in economic lifestyle between the races.  While we had great little neighborhoods, you know, when I'd go over to those other neighborhoods, they had great big neighborhoods, right.  And where I'd go buy a '69 [1969] Plymouth Satellite, I'd see a kid show up with, you know, a '73 [1973], you know, Dodge Dart or something, right?  And you're like, you know, and a '75 [1975], and an '80 [1980] and a brand new, and how are these kids getting new cars?  This kid got a new car in high school, and we're trying to keep ours running every day, right.  So you start to see that there was an economic disparity, even in the little community in which I lived, okay.  So now, let's talk about junior, I call it junior year in high school [Denver East High School, Denver, Colorado].  So I start working at Bell Labs.  Now, I'm exposed--now, you gotta remember, they're bringing in summer students from the best colleges in the world, right.  Now, there's no Internet, you don't, you know--the only thing I knew about Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is my dad [William Smith] used to say DU [Denver University, Denver, Colorado] is the Harvard of the West.  But I don't know what Harvard is, but outside of everyone says it's a great school.  And then I learned at Bell Labs about Ivy League education 'cause they had this one kid there who was actually going--where'd he go?  Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  And he's telling me about the Ancient Eight, Harvard, Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] and Princeton and Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and I'm like, wow.  And now, I'm starting to do a little, you know, talking to some folks, and then, you know, kids go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I started (unclear) Caltech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], right.  Then I started hearing about, you know, schools like, you know, Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and I'm like, wow.  I mean I hadn't heard about these sort of things.  You know, my mom [Sylvia Smith] went to University of Northern Colorado [Greeley, Colorad].  My dad went to DU, right.  And dad kept saying, DU's the Harvard of the West (laughter), right, and I heard about the Colorado School of Mines [Golden, Colorado] and all that sort of stuff.  My dad, and then my brother [Allan Smith] decided that he was gonna go to CSU, Colorado State University, which is in Fort Collins [Colorado], okay.  Then he got into the Air Force Academy, but that's where he wanted to go.  And so the exposure I started getting at Bell Labs was what I call the most eye opening, the first eye opening experience that I had that there was a whole world out there.  And when some of those students finally took the time to talk to me, 'cause remember I'm a high school kid, right, and then the next summer, of course, I was the guy who had been there one year, the (unclear), you know.  And when they finally started taking the time to talk to me, and I'd ask them questions about what it was like in college, it was like, oh, my goodness.  The things that they saw and were exposed to and got to do and the places they lived, right.  I mean my mother had taken us back to New York [City, New York] when I was in probably fifth grade to go see a play.  That was my New York experience, and when we went to Washington, D.C., I was like every other kid, you know, I'm playing in my grandmother's backyard and go another aunt's house.  So it kinda felt just like anywhere else you were, and, yeah, you may go see the Smithsonian [Museum], go in the Aerospace Museum and something like that, but that was kinda your exposure.  You know, like (laughter), what I'd teach my kids now when I take them to Italy, when they were little, they remember the pizza and the ice cream, right.  It didn't matter where you were, you know, you're trying to expose--but that's, you know, when you're a kid, that's kinda what you saw.  But that experience at Bell Labs opened the world to me, not only the world of technology and the world of science, but also the world of different schools and what these different schools were all about and how they were different and expansive in opportunity and like, wow.  Okay, now, of course, you know I had not long forgotten, you know, the opportunity, I wanted to go to Phillips Exeter [Exeter, New Hampshire] 'cause I heard that was "the" place to go, right, for boarding, but my parents--and my parents weren't gonna let me go to King Country Day School [ph.] 'cause they were public school teachers.  And what would it look like for public school administrators to send their kid to a private school, right.  All right, so you knew that wasn't gon' happen (laughter), right.  But that's where the expansion came in those conversations.
Story_ID: 624663
Speaker 1: That next year, I then applied to what was called the MIT[E] Programs, Minority Introduction to Engineering, okay.  Actually, it was that year, that summer.  And you would go away, and so I had to get a pass or whatever from Bell, to leave and go for one week.  And the one I got accepted into was at Cornell [University] in Ithaca, New York, which I'd never heard of.  And so now, I go to this school, Cornell for a week, and you're in there.  And they bring a whole bunch of African American kids for one week, introduction to engineering, Minority Introduction to Engineering, MITE.  And you take--they're not classes, but, you know, they'd have graduate students, you know, and talk about the classes in science and, and over a week.  And you got to know some of these kids and actually, one of the kids turned out to be my roommate when I went back to Cornell a couple of years later.  And that was expansive, 'cause now you're walking around these campuses.  You're going into these labs.  You're meeting--they're not professors.  They're TA's, you might meet a--but they're TA's, but, you know, as far as you know, they're brilliant anyway, right, in Ithaca, New York, okay, in the summer for--I'm like, wow.  So that's why I support those programs in my philanthropic work where it's so important because just the exposure changed my life.  And now, I realized, no, I didn't wanna go to, you know, not that they're bad, Colorado School or (unclear) Mines [Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado] or CSU [Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado] or DU [Denver University, Denver, Colorado] or UNC [University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado], I wanted to go to one of those Ancient Eight schools, okay.  I wanted to go to one of those Ivy League schools where it seemed like to me, the smartest people on the planet went to school.  That's where I wanna go.  And so that changes the dynamic of what it is that you're working for your senior year, you know, your junior year and senior year in, in high school.
Story_ID: 624664
Speaker 1: So what schools do you end up applying to, you know--
Speaker 2: I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --'cause you said--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I applied to good schools.  I got into good schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of this (unclear).  So I, you know, I applied to, just to give you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And what year is it?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: This is 1980, so the summer of '80 [1980] 'cause I graduated [from Denver East High School, Denver, Colorado] in '81 [1981] and junior year, right.  So I did well on what was then the PSAT.  So I did well on the PS--so now, I'm starting to get a whole bunch of letters, right, from schools I never heard of and some schools I had heard of.  And now, I'm trying to decide, and they were all academics.  There were a couple athletic, but we'll get to that in a bit.  But so, then I get letters from and I applied, you know, that next year, you know, Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I applied to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I didn't apply to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  (Unclear) can't remember.  I applied to Stanford [University, Stanford, California], Caltech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland], Air Force Academy, Notre Dame [University, Notre Dame, Indiana].  I think those are--and then, Colorado School of Mines [Golden, Colorado], CSU [Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado], some of those sorts of schools.  And I got into almost every one, got, wait, no I didn't get into Caltech.  I got wait listed originally at Stanford, and into the rest of those.  My dad [William Robert Smith], of course, wanted--not, of course, wanted me to go to the Naval Academy because it was free.  And my parents [Sylvia Smith and William Smith] divorced when I was a senior in high school, the first semester of senior in high school, okay.  So I was literally starting, you know, the first semester of varsity football, that sort of stuff, and then my mom's like, "We gotta go.  This isn't gonna work."  And so, you know, after the football game, get my guys the next day, and we--my mom and I move out into an apartment (laughter), you know.  And this is, this is all in the middle of all the application process and--
Speaker 1: That's a lot going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a lot--and I work, right.  It's a lot going on, right.  And I visited Cornell, and my mom then, later in the spring 'cause I got in all the schools.  And Stanford was like, "You wanna come for a visit?"  My mom's like, "You're gonna visit Stanford."  And I said, I said, "Stanford can't be any better than Cornell.  So I might as well just go to Cornell."  Now, it's a funny story 'cause later I go visit Stanford, when I'm working, and I'm looking at these palm trees.  I was like, "Oh, my God, what was I thinking," right (laughter) 'cause, you know, Ithaca has some brutal winters.  Great experience.  I loved it there, but (laughter), you know, like all these things, you know, we didn't have college visit times then.  You know, I got in MIT, didn't go there 'cause I heard they didn't have any girls at MIT.  So it's like I'm not going there. Naval Academy, I decided not to go 'cause my dad wanted me to go, right, so I'm not gonna do that.  And then I got actually football scholarships to SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas] and to Notre Dame.  And, and this was, of course, you know, in the spring of 1981, which is when I graduated from high school.  And I decided on Cornell.  And that's where I decided to go to school that fall.
Story_ID: 624665
Speaker 1: So you show up at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] in the fall of 1981, right?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: And tell me, what is the campus that you come onto like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How, how many African American students--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who's your roommate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: --here's the situa--so we, the good news is they then had what they called a pre-freshman summer which was when they brought you in for a couple of weeks.  You know, and it was African American--that's when good programs, MITE [Minority Introduction to Engineering] program, then leads to pre-freshman summer.  So pre-freshman summer, you had some upper-classmen who were kinda your mentors or whatever, and you took some classes, you know, like five or six weeks in the summer, just to get you ready for college 'cause not all kids were ready for college.  I went to Denver East High School, you know.  I told you how busy I was.  How much time did I really have for homework?  I did homework at the edges and still maintained a 3-6 or whatever it was.  I mean that's how rigorous the program was.  But the context of the day.  So, I go to this pre-freshman program, and I'm like, whoa, this is real stuff.  Now, the good news was, I actually, you know, could figure most of it out and actually did pretty well, pre-freshman summer.  Some of the folks were like outstripping, you know, but I was, working hard and doing well, kind of a thing.  We lived in, in a dorm room.  So the disadvantage with pre-freshman summer, now (unclear), hell, this actually is subtlety like all things.  I heard about, it was called COSEP, Committee on Special Education Projects.  And remember that MITE program I was telling you about?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 2: One of the--and I kept in touch with a couple of guys from the MITE program, okay, and one of them says, are you going back for pre-freshman summer.  And I was like, what is that?  It's called COSEP, Committee on Special Education Projects, so I'm, I didn't get invited to that.  So I called the guy, Ron Simmons [ph.], beautiful man who was responsi--African American, Ph.D., who worked on that project and those projects in the engineering school at Cornell.  And Ron said, Robert we don't think--you're not in COSEP because, you know, you got really good grades and test scores and we don't think you need to be in COSEP.  You'll be just fine as a regular student.  And I talked to my mom about that, and she said, "Boy, you'd better go to that program because any advantage you can get, you need to go get."  So I called Dr. Simmons, I'm like Dr. Simmons I really wanna come.  Well, we don't have really room for you.  I'm like, but I really wanna come, right.  And so he let me come to this program.  Now, it was funny because the course had all the other students in the dorms 'cause they had them all allocated.  I'm in the other side of the dorm, down in the bottom (laughter) 'cause they, you know, I'm this kid who just showed up, kind of a thing, which is good on one hand, but not so good on the other.  But anyway, so here you got the outsider story again, but, but part of what that led to is, now I got a chance to get engaged in what is college life actually like, okay.  And so I'm going through and getting that experience firsthand, which I actually, was very helpful.  The problem with that program is, then when the rest of the students came on campus, 'cause then you go home for a week and then you come back, you only know the African American students.  And then, of course, you've bonded, and so I was supposed to be in U-Hall, something, something, on West Campus--no, I wasn't in U-Hall.  I was on the, still on North Campus.  And I said, I wanna change.  I wanna go to Ujima which was the African American dorm, and I wanted to be roommates with this guy who we did the MITE program with and now the COSEP program with, and I wanna be roommates with him.  Some greatness about that community.  You're part of a community, community of black engineers in that case, many of them finished and did well, and I'm still friends with and all that sort of stuff.  The problem is you also isolated yourself against the rest of the Cornell community, okay.  So there's problems with both of those, but the campus you walk in on, okay, and this was a first time, and Cornell had made a big push to bring in a lot of African Americans through this commit, you know, COSEP program across all the different schools, not just engineering.  So you had arts program and, you know, and, you know, you know, architecture and human ecology and, you know--so each of the colleges and engineering.  Engineering, I think had more of the students on average.  But now all of a sudden, that's a great community to be a part of, but it also, you know, you end up isolating yourself from the rest of the Cornell experience, okay--
Story_ID: 624666
Speaker 1: Now, freshman year [at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  Since I'd done well, done COSEP [Committee on Special Education Projects] and had tested out of a couple of the classes, I had enough credits to pledge a fraternity that spring 'cause you're supposed to have a certain amount to pledge.  And as you may or may not know, the first black fraternity was Alpha Phi Alpha, founded on the campus of Cornell University [Ithaca, New York] in 1906.  And one of the guys--my dad was a Que, by the way, Omega, Omega Psi Phi.  One of the guys who I worked with at Bell Labs was an Alpha.  And he was an Alpha, and he went to--it wasn't Morris Brown [University, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was one of the other schools--
Speaker 2: Clark-Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: It wasn't Clark-Atlanta.  It was--
Speaker 2: Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 1: No, what's the one in--it's a big one in Atlanta [Georgia].  What am I missing?
Speaker 2: Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Morehouse, that's it.  He was at Morehouse.
Speaker 2: Sorry.
Speaker 1: Me too.  He was at Morehouse, and he kept telling me about Alpha Phi Alpha, right, founded at Cornell, this and that.  So then I get into Cornell, and I'm up there, and then I--and so I'm with all the guys in my engineering thing, and now it's time to start--you usually don't pledge till your sophomore year.  And I said, man, this Alpha, Alpha is supposed to be pretty cool.  So I go check it out with a couple of my suite mates, 'cause we lived in suites at the time.  I said, we got to pledge Alpha.  This s the deal, right.  So we pledge Alpha, spring semester, freshman year, which, you know, for those of us who had done COSEP, and had enough credits to actually do it that spring semester.  And this was in the old school of pledging (laughter), not the new school of pledging.  So it was a very challenging and tough experience, but worthwhile in that context.  So that's how I ended up pledging my freshman year at Cornell.
Story_ID: 624667
Speaker 1: So, so what is the, can you describe your whole Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] experience?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean you become part of the, the fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha].  So is that a big part of the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, for sure, first few years--I mean it's, I mean fraternity life is great, right.  And at Cornell's campus, it was time that, you know, my pledge class was, we started with eleven and ended in five.  You know, there were only I think seven brothers on campus at that time.  So that was a huge pledge class.  And, you know, my group of guys, then when we pledged, I mean we were kinda the big, popular--'cause we had been together now in COSEP [Committee on Special Education Projects] and, so I mean we were like a whole--
Speaker 1: Group.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and force, in and of itself.  And the good news--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How many did you say there were?
Speaker 2: We started with eleven.  We finished with five, but because we had been part of this COSEP program, we knew the guys who pledged Que [Omega Psi Phi], the guys who pledged Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma], the guys who pledged Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi], all that sort of stuff 'cause we played--'cause I had an intermural football team that fall year.  And we all played on it together, and we were friends.  Now, all of a sudden everybody pledges different fraternities, but now we're all still friends, right.  So we support each other in parties and social events and all that sort of stuff.  So it just brought a whole new dynamic and life to that campus, which was quite vibrant and exciting based on what I heard it was like years before that.  So now, that's that, that part of life, the social life at Cornell, was awesome.
Story_ID: 624668
Speaker 1: Now, we're gonna switch to the academic life (laughter), right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm with the group of engineers, and like in all engineering curriculum, you know, you go through the first couple of years, kinda taking the same stuff.  But now you gotta decide if you're gonna be EE [electrical engineering], computer science, mechanical, and as I started looking at it, and engineering, electrical engineering was kinda the hottest field for jobs at the time.  But remember, my mentor was a chemical engineer back at Bell Labs, Ph.D., solid-state physics from Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  And as I started spending time and talking more about it, I decided chemical engineering was the way to go, for two reasons.  First of all chemical engineers are the modern-day alchemist if you think about it.  They're taught the art of transforming one form of matter into another.  And there're very few people on this planet who know how to do that, who can take something out of the ground, like sand, and make a silicon wafer.  Chemical engineers do that, who can take oil and make plastic, okay.  You start thinking about the art of transforming one form of matter into another.  And it is a very disciplined art.  So the first reason, that's the one thing.  The second reason, it was the hardest curriculum at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  And everyone knew it.  And I tease, the only people the chemical engineers looked up were the applied and engineering physics folks.  But they were all really weird.  But you gotta be if you're gonna in applied and engineering physics.  They kinda get the things that are very different fundamental level (laughter) of analysis.  When I decided to go into chemical engineering, there were only two African Americans who had finished in chemical engineering in like the prior six years, no, three.  That was it.  And everybody said, you know that's the hardest and it's a racist school--and I'll tell you about, a little bit about that, like Coors, Coors Beer.  They are all Cornell chemical engineering graduates and what I understand was they stopped supporting Cornell School when they changed admission policies and let people like me in, who look like me.  People don't realize that, and they do the Juneteenth [June 19th] and give 'em a bunch of beer and all that.  But they don't support the institution because they start letting African Americans in, became more liberal in their admission policies.  These are things I know and I remember, and I think about, which is why I support the scholarships at place like Cornell for engineers who look like me.  And I said, I'm gonna take that on.  And I'm going to not only do well in chemical engineering, but I'm going to thrive in that environment.  And as--and I figured out how to get Bell Labs and Cornell to agree, to make sure that I was a co-op student, where you work and go to school every other semester, "A", because I needed the money 'cause I had to pay for college, right.  I had some scholarships.  I got a [U.S.] Navy ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] scholarship that paid for all of college, but I didn't wanna do that 'cause I didn't wanna do five years in the Navy afterwards, okay.  So I took some partial scholarships, work study, and then I paid for the rest and earned the rest, okay.  So I needed to work.  So I got into the co-op program so you work and go to school every other semester, which is awesome, by the way, 'cause you actually learn some skills and experiences, which is why I offer internships at my current firm.  You know, we had I think ninety this year across all our portfolio companies, 'cause those are the experiences to me that help young people determine, if they don't wanna do something or if they can do it.  They need that real-time work experience.
Story_ID: 624669
Speaker 1: There was then only one open competition at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], and it was called the Procter and Gamble Technical Excellence Award.  All the other competitions, you know, the Dow Award and all those sort of things, in the School of Chemical Engineering, were awarded by the professors.  So you know who got those, you know, the kid whose dad or the kid who was the favorite.  They got those.  This is the one open competition where you actually had to present a project that you worked on, either in school or a problem that you solved and present it to an independent set of judges.  And they were employees, chemical engineers from Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio].  And I won that award.  I was the first one to ever win that award.  And there's still a plaque in the School of Chemical [and Biomolecular] Engineering [at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] with my name on it because I won it.  And one of the co-op processes I did, I worked at Rockwell International, which is here in Colorado 'cause I wanted to get out of just the, what I call the Bell Labs experience, and go to a process experience.  And we did actually--at that time, Rockwell International, they ran the Rocky Flats Plant and they did recovery of basically plutonium.  And I--
Speaker 2: So, it's Rockwell, R-O-C--
Speaker 1: Rocky Flats, Rocky Flats Plant.
Speaker 2: Rocky Flats.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rocky Flats was--you've heard of Las Alamos [sic, Los Alamos National Laboratory]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so it was actually one of the, you know, stations in our, in our nations' arsenal for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons.
Story_ID: 624670
Speaker 1: Now, now Robert, if you are the only--you win this award, what is the difference--you almost indicated that it was a really difficult program.
Speaker 2: It absolutely was.
Speaker 1: So did you struggle at all?
Speaker 2: What do you mean?  In chemical engineering?
Speaker 1: [No audible response].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  It was hard.  It was the hardest curriculum at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] for good reason.  Chemical engineering at Cornell used to be a five-year program.  They shortened it to four, but didn't take out the classes, okay.  Now, one of the reasons I did the co-op, and I ended up going to school basically an extra semester, okay, to finish my undergraduate, but I also finished with, you know, three quarters of the degree for electrical engineering if you look at my credits, right, was you had the work-study piece of this thing.  But when you cycled into co-op, your class size got shrunk down from thirty kids, down to fifteen.  And there's more one-on-one with the professors, okay.  So there's an advantage to that kind of point number one.  Point number two, it was hard.  So remember I talked about how awesome the social life was at Cornell.  Freshman and sophomore year.  Junior and senior year, I was working.  It was Friday nights, you're in labs, okay.  They had this one thing called Unit Operation Lab, which is actually--the way they graded, you got two grades.  One was on content and one was on style.  And you multiplied 'em.  So if you got a ninety on content and a ninety on style, that's an eighty-one.  That's a "B".  And you got a chance to rewrite it and resubmit it, okay, to get your grade up.  You see what I mean?  So, you worked hard in chemical engineering.  And one of the things that I'm most proud of, not only the Procter and Gamble Technical Excellence Award, I got the highest grade in our senior, basically, unit, our process class, process design class.  For whatever reason, I just, you know, I'm good at that, really good at it.  In fact, so good, I was like thirty-plus points ahead of whoever was behind me in second place.  But the interesting thing about, you know, our environment at Cornell was, you know, they used to give--they gave A-pluses to everybody except when I got thirty of what everybody else, and I got an A like everybody, you know, the other, right.  Just one of those things.
Speaker 1: But what are you wanting to be at this point, you know, because--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Chemical engineer.
Speaker 1: I know, but do you, do you have a desire about which company would be your--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, what I wanted to do was to, to invent something that no one else on the planet had ever invented.  To me, that was the pinnacle of living, was to come up with a unique idea, that no one else had come up with.  And remember I talked to you about, you know, the Carnegies and the (unclear) and all that, said, if you could come up with something that no one else had come up with--I mean not just the fortunes to be made out of it, but that's, to me that was the most important thing.  Can you do something that no one else has done?
Speaker 1: So, that was similar in some respects to your Bell Lab experience--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, no question.
Speaker 1: --with what you had done there.
Speaker 2: Oh, no question.
Speaker 1: Now, who are the other African Americans in your program then?
Speaker 2: In chemical engineering?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: There were two girls who didn't finish the year I did.  I was the only one my year who finished.  And they finished a little bit later.  I was the only one in my year, African American.  There was a woman who finished a year before me, Evelyn.  I think she's still with Dow [Dow Chemical], Michael Belt finished two years before her.  That was it.
Speaker 1: And are there other people that were there in the African American community that we might know, you know, that were--not in maybe science and engineering, but who attended school with you and that you--
Speaker 2: At Cornell?  I have to think.  I don't know who you might know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's a lot of 'em, but, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 624671
Speaker 1: So you, you do well.  Now, how do you go then--and this, you gradate in 1985--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: '86 [1986], no '86 [1986], yeah.
Speaker 1: '86 [1986], in 1986, so I see that--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I did that co-op program so I ended up--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  So you then--is that when you go to work for Air Products and Chemicals [Inc.]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, no.
Speaker 2: So here I come into graduation, and I've, you know, got some wonderful job offers from every--from, you know, Exxon[Mobil], DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]--did I have Dow [Chemical Company], yeah, Dow, Midland Michigan, Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, Air Products.  And then this little company comes along called The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.  So Goodyear had figured out that they really had a dearth in, what I'll call, potential senior leadership, i.e., budding chemical engineers, okay.  And Goodyear, of course, make tires and plastics and chemicals.  And one of the guys who graduated a year before me, a Latino, by the name of Paul Rivera [ph.], he worked at Goodyear, and he contacted me.  He said, "Robert, you should think about Goodyear."  I'm like, "Well, why would I ever do that?"  (Laughter) And he says, "Because they have this thing called the Squadron Program.  I said, tell me what that is.  "What their plan is, is over the next five years, they're gonna recruit five to six of the highest quality chemical engineers and put them in this squadron, and then you're gonna rotate.  You're gonna do one year in--two years in production, one year in engineering, one year in, in research, one year in like marketing.  And then they're gonna send you back to business school, top business school.  Then you come back in as a, basically, a senior-level manager at Goodyear," 'cause they realized they had a lot of, you know, fifty and sixty-year olds, but not a lot of thirty and forty-year olds who they felt that they could actually turn this business over to.  And I said, "Okay."  And he said, "You need to think about it as a career, as opposed to a job."  You can go get a job at Procter & Gamble and, you know, product development or Dow Chemical or Exon or whatever and those guys were all heavily recruiting me and taking me out to dinners, having me eat stuff I'd never heard of before, right.  Or you can think about a career.  And so I go interview, and I said, this is pretty neat.  Now, one of the other contenders was Air Products and Chemicals.  They had a group called applied research and development, and I'll get to that in a second.  And they were recruiting me pretty heavily.  Well, at that time, as I started looking at it, I said, you know, this process experience isn't a bad idea and business school or graduate school probably isn't a bad idea.  I didn't know what kind of business school I wanted to go to, I said, but that probably isn't a bad idea.  So I then look at it and say, this makes sense.  Now, at the time, you know, my, my girlfriend at the time, who I ended up marrying, we, you know, subsequently divorced--we have three kids together, was two years behind me--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and still in Ithaca [New York].  And I said, "Okay.  Now, if I go to Bayport, Texas or Midland, Michigan," and I said, "Well, you know, that, kinda end of that deal, right."  But Goodyear had a facility in Niagara Falls [New York], basically, in Grand, Grand Island, New York.  I could go there and do production for a year or two and then go to Akron, Ohio.  And so I took a job at Goodyear Tire & Rubber as part of that Squadron Program.  And it was neat.  They had some of the top chemical engineers from, you know, the best graduate--undergraduate schools in this program.  I was the third year of the flights, okay.  So they had two years before me, and I was that third year.
Story_ID: 624672
Speaker 1: So I start [at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company] that fall, and I start in production in the Niagara Falls [New York] facility and lived in Grand Island, New York.  And so now, I'm walking into this plant that makes an antioxidant and an accelerator that's used in tired.  So this is gritty, grimy work from a plant that was built back in 1943, okay, managing shift workers, all of which were older than my father [William Smith](laughter) okay, would have been in--you know what I mean, who had been at that plant since about 1943, right.  So, I mean they've been there a while.  So, you know, they're all in their fifties and sixties and, you know, and it's, you know, this is all during Superfund cleanup, toxic wasteland, all through Niagara Falls.  So, it was--but now, I learned how to manage shift workers, you know, from Alabama and, you know, and Tennessee and, you know, I--you know, big southern white men who work at the plant.  And we bonded, believe it or not, over fishing 'cause I'm a fisherman, and they were fishermen, and we ended up fishing a lot together.  And so, you know, fishing kind of breaks down a lot of those bonds.  But we'll get fishing, I'm sure, you know, I'm a big fly fisherman, and that's where I learned to fly fish, 'cause I decided I was gonna learn how to fly fish.  Anyway, that experience, that first year, something interesting happened.  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company got jumped by Sir James Goldsmith who was a hostile raider, with Hanson plc out of the U.K. [United Kingdom] and said, their assets are undervalued, let me make a hostile raid on this company.  Well, because we're part of the Squadron Program, they invited us every quarter to the board meetings.  And then after the board meetings, they'd talk about where the company's going and all that sort of--which is kind of a unique experience, which is one of the reasons I took it, 'cause I didn't know.  What's a board of directors?  What do they do?  How does this work, right?  And as I'm spending time, and they're saying, they came out, and they said, you know, we're gonna have to suspend this program because the money we're spending on it, we've got this hostile raid, all these sort of things.  And now all of a sudden, this is turning from, you know a career to a job (laughter), right.  And I said, "Well, I wouldn't have gone to Goodyear for just a job."  I'd have taken one of these other ones.  And, of course, the people at Air Products [and Chemicals, Inc.] continued to call, and that's when I switched from Air--from Goodyear going to Air Products.
Story_ID: 624673
Speaker 1: And I worked in applied research and development there [Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.]. I developed a whole line of gases and industrial--modified atmosphere packaging and what they call, consumer atmospheric packaging, that extends the shelf life of foods, and branded it FRESHPAK and created a whole new business line for Air Products and Chemicals, which was actually pretty neat, made a presentation on it at one of the food conferences my first year--oh, maybe second year out of college.  And now, I'm inventing things, and I'm solving problems, and I'm working for companies like Tyson Chicken to extend the shelf life of their chicken.  I go down to--they're opening this new place called Disneyworld and they wanna extend the shelf life of their salads by one or two days.  And I'm--came up with a blend that does that.  Their little things that went into, you know, to, to beer, to Little Debbie Snack Cakes and things that actually, you know, where you basically remove the oxidated gases out of the packaging and actually put in different sorts of, you know, nitrogen--basically inert gases, nitrogen, argon and those sort of things, carbon dioxide, to actually extend the shelf life for foods, and, you know, fresh pastas like Contadina pasta and those sort of things.  And that's where I actually started to actually develop some things that were in commercial experience.
Story_ID: 624674
Speaker 1: And it was actually pretty neat.
Speaker 2: That's exciting.  I mean you're all of--
Speaker 1: Very.
Speaker 2: --what twenty-four, twenty-three--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, very.  I'll tell you one thing, I didn't tell you about Goodyear [Tire & Rubber Company].  My big win at Goodyear was--and it's actually interesting.  When we're making a product and you actually have a batch processing in that product.  You have to heat this bunch--you add a bunch of chemicals into a, basically a reactor.  You heat it up.  And it goes through reaction, and then you take it out and you flake it, and, you know, bag it and all that sort of stuff.  And there were some problems in the flaking, and I figured the problem out there, it's solved, you know.  And it was a couple hundred thousand dollar problem, and I solved a multi-million dollar problem there because the reaction times kept going down.  And it's actually, you know, or extending, right, where you could do, at some point in time, when you look at the history, you know, two batches in a shift.  They were only getting one batch out every couple of shifts, shift and a half.  And, of course, the old chemical engineer there, oh, you know, it's just process problems.  This thing's falling apart.  And I was like, it can't have that kind of an effect, right.  So I do my theoretical analysis.  I said, something's actually wrong.  So I spend time, in my own time, trying to figure out what's going on in the heat-up time and the resonance time in this reactor.  And then I trace it back to a maintenance thing they'd done like three years earlier, want you to think about this, three year earlier, where all of a sudden it went from normal cycle times to these extended cycle times.  Well, it turns out that someone actually didn't put one of the--it's a steam compressor, components in properly three years ago.  And so it wasn't actually going through the condensative heating.  It was a convective heating which has like one-tenth the input which is why it extended the, the cycle times, made that one change, and all of a sudden this plant went way back to being more efficient.  Of course, that engineer didn't wanna talk to me for the rest of my time there.  But the plant manager recognized (laughter) it, which is actually pretty cool.  But what that taught me is, don't listen to what a whole lot of people have to say about why something's wrong (laughter) with something, right.  And I did another project when I was at--by then I went from Air Products to, to Kraft General Foods.  One of my clients at Kraft General Foods was--one of our clients at Air Products was Kraft General Foods, and, you know, working on--they had this fresh line of products.  God, I forgot what, the name of 'em, but they were selling, you know, fresh grocery products in the grocery store in the refrigerator shelf for, you know, working parents and mothers who could take it home and heat it up.  And it would be just like home cooking as opposed to frozen.  Remember, frozen dinner were the deal then, right, but now, you could actually have fresh dinners that you could cook, and developed a line of products for them.  Well, anyway, I ended up getting a job at Kraft General Foods in the product--in the process development area a few years later and used that same sort of technique--it was interesting, where we were starting up the line of Log Cabin syrups in the individual packs.  And same sort of a deal.  They couldn't start the plant up for months, losing millions of dollars 'cause they had high, too high of a bicarbonate level and, you know, the engineer has told me forty times, "We've measured this thing."  Well, it turns out they didn't calibrate it right over a long period of time, over--any rate, so I go and solve that problem, which was, you know, awesome on that side.  And then from that, I also developed and earned my first two U.S. and European patents working in that environment, and which I just loved.  You know, I loved solving problems that nobody else could solve.
Story_ID: 624675
Speaker 1: So, is this typical of people's experience in corporate America?
Speaker 2: I have no idea (laughter)--
Speaker 1: I mean the patents, the being able to solve problems--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't think--it's very rare that people get patents, believe it or not.  It is actually hard to come up with something that nobody else has come up with (laughter) and then make it commercial viable, right.  Like one of my patents, I, I remember years later I was sitting with Howard Shultz who runs Starbucks, at a board meeting for eBay.  And I said, "Howard, you have no idea how close I came to putting you out of business."  He said, "What are you talking about?"  I said, back when you had two stores in Seattle, I had worked with this company in Germany, with Kraft General, called W-Meth (unclear) and developed and brought the first microprocessor controlled coffee brewing equipment into America.  And I was out doing a test market with this equipment, okay.  And it's a microprocessor, you know, computer controlled, right.  And while I'm out there in Seattle [Washington], 'cause I'm doing a bunch of tests on the West Coast to see how it works, and, you know, we were doing high volume coffee stuff 'cause it was for food service, you know, all the, you know, you go to a, to a, you know, truck stop, and you want, you know, they got all those coffee machines.  It's that kind of a service where you can just, you know, serve thousands of cups of coffee in a, over the course of a couple hours kind of thing.  I go into this little place called Starbucks.  And I see these people making coffee, you know, lattes and it's foaming and steaming it, and putting this coffee in, and paying $5.00 a cup for this cup of coffee.  Coffee at the time was $0.50 cents a cup, all you could drink, right, remember, just keep filling it up, and put your $0.50 cents and go on.  So I go back to my boss--and he runs the food service division with this, you know, $300 million revenue business out of Philip Morris [International, Inc.], right, multi-billion dollar revenue company.  And I say, "You know, we can take this, this microprocessor-controlled equipment that we've developed.  And we can actually do everything and make these lattes and cappuccinos and all that."  I said, "We should set up a whole bunch of kiosks and do this."  I said, "We'll make a fortune" and they're getting five bucks a cup as opposed to the--remember, it's $0.50 cents a cup retail, so wholesale, it's like four cents a cup with what you're actually selling it to the hotels.  And he looked at me.  He said, "Americans will never pay $5.00 for a cup of coffee."  It's a lesson I tell my kids.  Don't listen to these people.  They don't know.  Follow your heart, right.  You are enough.  I knew--so remember the golf ball story.  I missed out on my first fortune.  Well, this is a coffee story.  I missed out on my second fortune (laughter). Okay--
Story_ID: 624676
Speaker 1: How large is their, their [Kraft General Foods] chemical engineering area?
Speaker 2: I was, in my group, the only chemical engineer.
Speaker 1: Oh, so they have a--
Speaker 2: I was in--so you gotta think about it, Kraft.  And at the time, it was Kraft General Foods 'cause when they did that merger, General Foods had all the General Foods products.  And then they had product development people.  So I was in product equipment and process development.  And within product development, we had the Maxwell House brands, Boboli, Birdseye, Jell-O--what else did we have?  Crystal Light, those were the brands that we had, but it was dominated by coffee, Maxwell House, Yuban and all those, right.  So they would have food scientists.  You'd have mechanical engineers.  You had, you know, you had--but I was the only chemical engineer in that particular division for the food service division.  So I got to work across all the different products.  And because coffee was the biggest one and one of the things we--because it was food service, we did coffee for hotels, restaurants, quick service, you know, prisons, hospitals, all that sort of stuff, big bulk packages of stuff for coffee.  So yield is important.  So here's where the economic analysis comes in.  It isn't just the latest and greatest.  It is the efficiency and the price and the cost of making a product that becomes important in food service.  Most, you know, product designs--you remember when we're kids--I hate to use this example, but it's a good one, Twinkies.  They used to be so good.  If you taste 'em now, you know, the company's gone bankrupt, they taste completely different.  They're horrible.  Now, did our taste buds change that much?  No, they have actually just replaced a lot of the products that made it good for us, with, you know, went from cane sugar to high fructose corn syrup to, right, okay.  So, part of what they do in engineering, and what you're doing is, you do these tastes tests where you say, taste this versus that.  And you trial a thousand people, and you figure out if it's the, you know, statistically significant that no one can tell the difference.  But this formulation is three cents cheaper.  So you go with that formulation.  And now, you have by--two years later, you have 'em taste against that one, and slowly, you start moving it.  Next thing you know, it tastes nothing like what it was, but taste like what it, what they've, what they're most used to lately, right.  But now, you've cut the product costs from, you know, from a $1.40 to $1.12, right.  Anyway, so, one of my big accomplishments at Kraft was I developed and designed a process that saves them between .07 and .14 cents a pound on every pound of coffee that they manufacture.  And we never patented it because we didn't want Folgers [Coffee] to know how to do it.  And that was one of the things that I conceived, came up with, came up with the solution, designed it, did it in a test plant and then did in production.  And then all the Maxwell House coffee runs through that process, called "blend after grind", okay.  So, when you start thinking about--so now, here I am--and this was one of these pivotal moments in a man's life or a person's life.  And I'm sitting with the head of our division, and the head of our development organization, research, the head of marketing and the head of our strategic planning.  And we're talking about the six most important strategic priorities for our little $300 million revenue division.  And I looked at that list, and I was leading five of those projects.  And I looked around the room, and I was half the age of everybody in the room.  And I know I'm making a third of anybody in the room.  So I figured out I was doing something extremely right or extremely wrong or probably a little bit of both.  And that's when I said, I gotta go back to school.  I've gotta change my direction in life.
Speaker 1: And that's when you decide to go to (unclear).  But how, wait, how do you know what--you're thinking business school at that time?
Speaker 2: Here's what I'm thinking.  So, now, since I've done these good thing, I get to meet a whole lot of different people in Kraft.
Speaker 1: What year is this, Robert?
Speaker 2: This is, what, 1992.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were there from 1986--
Speaker 2: So '86 [1986] when I graduated, I was at Air Products or sorry, for--
Speaker 1: Goodyear.
Speaker 2: Goodyear for about a year.  Air Products for about two, a little bit of a break when my father [William Smith] died.  Then I ended--then I went to Kraft General Foods.
Story_ID: 624677
Speaker 1: So your father [William Smith] passed away, so that was a hard period?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that, that--
Speaker 2: I was at Air Products [and Chemicals, Inc.] at the time, and I was going through a little bit of a rotation, just left applied--I was in applied research development.  Now, I'm working in sales, there learning how to sell air, basically, right, which is selling industrial gases to, you know, to companies that need them for, you know, everything from medical services to, you know, food processing or whatever it might--'cause I wanted to get some sales Goodyear, I wanted to replicate that program and go into different areas so I could see how businesses actually worked, which was a great experience for me.
Speaker 1: And so you're, so you're--had your father been sick?
Speaker 2: No, well, he had a stroke, but nobody actually knew.  But you could tell that there was something wrong, okay.  And so he was taking some time off, you know, on leave from school, okay.  He was a principal at Brown Elementary [Denver, Colorado] at the time.  And then I get a call that my aunt found him on the ground, on the floor in his house, basically passed out.  And he had had an aneurysm.  And he went into a coma and he never came out of the coma.  So I came back here for about a week.  He never recovered from the coma, went back and then he passed away.
Speaker 1: So, you--did you take any time off, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I took some time off.
Speaker 1: Just to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, just kinda to figure some stuff.  My brother [Allan Smith] had just left to go to India.  And so I had some stuff with my dad's house and the debt that he owed and all that sort of stuff.  And, you know, just the whole dynamic around that, and it was just a very tough period.
Speaker 1: And your parents are div--at this point--
Speaker 2: Divorced.
Speaker 1: --they're divorced.  So it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 624678
Speaker 1: Okay, so business school.  So, here's how, so--I mean like I said, I just finished this conversation and figured out that I'm leading these six projects.  And so I said, you know, I need to go back to school.  So I started looking around.  One of the thoughts I earlier had was medical school, believe it or not.  So I looked at Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] and met some people down there, investigated, and I said, you know, I don't know if I really want to be a doctor.  I then looked at dental school, believe it or not, okay, professional school.  And I said, I don't wanna be a dentist.  And one of my buddies from college had gone on to dental school.  I went and spent some time with him, sat down with--he's actually, I think he, he might be head of, either something associate head or something at Columbia [University, New York City] now in dental school.  But one of my fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha] brothers.  But anyway, I said, I don't wanna do that.  And then I started looking at law schools and business schools.  And I said that probably makes some sense.  So, took the LSAT [law school admission test], did well, then took the GMAT [graduate management admission test], did well and then got into the J.D. M.B.A. program.  I got a bunch of law schools, but I got into the J.D. M.B.A. program at Columbia [University, New York City, New York].  And before I was gonna start that fall, one of the things, actually [HM] Paula Sneed was very helpful.  I went to go see her.  I said, you know, I created this process that saves Maxwell House $0.07 to $0.14 cents a pound on every pound of coffee that we make.  I've got these other two inventions out there, and, you know, Log Cabin, all that sort of stuff that, you know, with two patents and the value.  I said, you guys ought to pay for me to go back to school.  And she said, well, we don't have a program like that.  I said, let's create one.  So she introduced me to some people at Philip Morris, and so I created the first Kraft General Foods Fellowship.  As far as I know, I'm the only one who ever got it.  And they paid for my school and gave me a stipend (laughter), basically, to, you know, to go back to school.  And in that, as I applied to schools, I got into the JDA-J.D. M.B.A. program at Columbia.  Well, between my, you know, starting my freshman year or my first year at business school and law school, (unclear) start in law school, I spent a lot of time with the lawyers at Philip Morris 'cause we were working on some of the patent stuff that I was working on with the projects and some of those things.  And I said I really don't wanna do that for a living.  So I called the dean of the, the law school, and said, I'm just, I'm not gonna matriculate into law school.  I'm just gonna do the M.B.A.  I'll take a couple classes in law school.  At any rate, not happy, but okay, right.  So I start in the fall of, I guess that was 1992 in business school.  And, and just doing great, loved business school.  Business school for me as chemical engineering was actually kind of a breeze, right.  Good classes, engaging, fun and did really well.  So the end of my first year, I got an award for being the top student.  So it was a Roswell C. McCrea Award, you know, top grades and most dynamic or interactive but most contribute--contributes the most to the, to the classroom dynamic award. So I had to come back for the summer graduation.  So that's the summer of 1993.
Story_ID: 624679
Speaker 1: Well, I come back for this graduation, and there's this guy by the name of John Utendahl, Utendahl Capital Partners is the name of his firm.  And he was on Wall Street, and, you know, had his own company.  And he's a keynote speaker.  So they go up, they talk, they give me my award.  And after that, he gives his keynote speech.  After the speech, he pulls me over and said, "Hey, you got an interesting background.  Have you ever thought about a career in investment banking?"  And I said, "Well, it's a bunch of investment bankers in my class.  I don't like any of 'em."  And he said, like, "Well, why not?"  I said, "These guys think they know everything and they're pretty arrogant."  I said, "You gotta understand, I'm an engineer.  We do know everything it bothers us (laughter)."  And he kind of chuckled.  And I said, "In all honesty," I said, "John, I actually don't know what you all do for a living to create value.  And maybe just the guys I'm talking to or they don't spend time.  I just don't understand."  And he just laughed.  He said, "Why don't you come down and have some lunch with me some time?" I said, great.  And since I'm at Columbia [University, New York City, New York], you know, it's a subway ride away.  So, I, of course, call him like the next day and set up lunch and go down and sit down and talk to him.  And this is another one of those pivotal points that changed my life, right.  And as we're talking, and I'm telling my story, and what I do as an engineer and what I work on and what's interesting and exciting.  He says, you know, and I said, "I really don't understand this whole world of investment banking."  He says, "Let me call some of my friends."  And he literally picks up the phone right there.  And he calls guys like, and he calls [HM] Ray[mond] McGuire, okay, who had just left, you know, CF First Boston, and started this firm called Wasserstein Perella.  He called a guy by the name of Stan O'Neal [Stanley O'Neal], who was actually the CFO of a big firm called Merrill Lynch, became the CEO, called a guy by the name of George Van Amson, okay.  He called a guy by the name of Eugene Flood.  And these were like "the" dudes on Wall Street.  And I had no idea, you know, grew up, you know, the son of educators in Colorado working as a chemical engineer (laughter).  You know, I didn't know who these people were.  So I just called them.  And he said, you ought to talk this guy.  He's an interesting guy, and, you know, spend some time with 'em.  So I call these guys and go have lunch, just like that.  And I have real basic questions.  And this is something I learned way back when, when I was at Bell [Labs], you know, that whole question.  How do you ask questions?  What do you like about what you do?  Why do you do it?  What else did you think about?  What's the best thing about what you do?  What's the worst thing about it?  You do all those sort of questions to these folks, and what is it, your industry?  Why do you this and how do you create value?  And why do you do this every day?  Well, I've been doing it for twenty years, two years.  Why aren't you doing something--you know, those sort of questions.  And I literally had that sort of conversation with about a hundred people 'cause they'd introduce me to one other and five other and ten other.  My fall semester of my second year in business school.  And I figured out that there's only one business I really liked in investment banking, and that was mergers and acquisitions [M&A] because with the exception of warfare, it's how assets get transferred on this planet.  Well, now, I say warfare and divorce, but that's a whole other conversation.  And it's a CEO-level discussion.  It's a board-level discussion and it's strategic.  And I said, that's interesting.  And I also realized that it was an apprenticeship business.  You do not learn how to be an M&A banker at business school.  You learn it from somebody who's a practitioner.
Story_ID: 624680
Speaker 1: And as a scientist, I did my work, and there were only six firms that did it really well, and I identified those six.  And I figured out a process, and I ended up getting an offer from all six.  So it was Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Wasserstein Perella, Bankers Trust and what was the third one at the time?  It wasn't Citibank.  It was one other.  Yeah, I think it may have been Citibank.  No, Lehmann Brothers.  That's who it was.  And I looked at that, and I said, okay, and I got offers in different departments, but M&A [mergers and acquisitions] (unclear).  And I said, where am I really gonna learn this craft?  Certainly, those firms had a person who had five or six bankers surrounding him, junior people who'd been with them for three, four, five, six, seven, eight years.  What's the likelihood I'm gonna get to work on interesting or good deals in that environment versus places that actually had real teamwork environment, Goldman Sachs, where at Goldman Sachs, every deal was staffed differently.  Every deal had a different team dynamic to it, and you could work with every partner in the M&A group which at the time was only six.  That's why I went to Goldman Sachs 'cause I figured I could go there and learn this trade.  And I also figured out that there's this thing called hostile raid defense.  You know, when I talked about Sir James Goldsmith, you know, jumping the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.  Well, you had to defend against that.  Way back then, there's a thing called "green mail", (unclear) defended, just paid 'em off ultimately.  But it was illegal to do, so you have to have very strong defenses.  Well, a raid defense, if you think about it, if they end up selling, it's basically a sell-side process compressed.  If you're selling a company, it might take nine months.  If you do a raid defense, it might take nine weeks.  So the fact pattern of experiences are accelerated.
Story_ID: 624681
Speaker 1: Now, here I am having worked for six years, going into, as an associate with folks who came straight out of business school.  And I'm four years behind--I gotta accelerate my fact pattern of experiences.  So I said, I'm gonna work on hostile raid defense, point number one.  Second thing I did was I actually developed the training program--I think they still use it at, at Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.], called real-life training for the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] group.  I did it for me.  Here's what it is.  Every Friday, you figure out what senior partner or senior vice president's in town.  You have them pick one deal that they worked on that's unique and different, put together the book, you know, the little blue books, and just clip 'em.  And any associate or analyst who's in town would go into a lunchroom, where you have the firm pay, buy lunch.  And now they just walk you through that deal and the fact patterns and what's different, and why and what happened, and how it occurred.  It gives them practice, first, as a senior person.  But as a junior person, you now get to aggregate a hundred and something years of experience every Friday, through five or six deals.  And I created that process, and I ended up winning an award for it at Goldman ultimately, for that.  But I did it selfishly so I could actually learn what this business was and accelerate my fact pattern of experiences.
Story_ID: 624682
Speaker 1: Can I ask you?  What did you do between the first and second year of business school?  Where did you work?
Speaker 2: Oh, Kraft General Foods.
Speaker 1: So, you--oh, okay.  I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked in strategic planning and what I did was, did acquisitions--
Speaker 1: Because they were paying, right, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did acquisitions of food distribution companies on the East Coast 'cause what we needed to do was roll up all the distribution companies so that we can actually get more scale--mass and scale and how they actually now go do that.  So that how I got exposure to the business.
Story_ID: 624683
Speaker 1: So you decided on Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Right. (Simultaneously)
Speaker 1: Who's at Goldman at the time?
Speaker 2: So what's interesting at Goldman, it was run--[Willard J.] "Mike" Overlock ran the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] department, okay.  The firm was being run by a guy by the name of [Robert] Bob Rubin, who ultimately became the Treasury Secretary.  And then he had a couple folks beneath him, one by the name of Hank Paulson, another guy by the name of Jon Corzine, okay.
Speaker 1: That is an interesting team.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they ultimately--so, when Hank--when, when Bob left, remember, Hank and John became co-heads of Goldman, okay.  Now, the interesting thing, Mike Overlock who I worked for, and I actually worked with him on his last deal at Goldman, was head of M&A.  He as the architect of Goldman M&A and also took and created all the products groups, so took some of the talented bankers and put 'em in the energy and into financial institutions and into, you know, Telecom and media, okay.  But they were M&A bankers, but he made them separate, you know, if you think about it, they ended up being separate, you know, divisions--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, areas.
Speaker 2: --departments, right.  But then you had the M&A group which was generalists, and there were about six of us.  Below, and then Mike left, and then [Steven] "Mac" Heller became head of the M&A department.  Then Mac asked me to become what's called the "staffer", okay, with a guy by the name of [Mitchell] Mitch Scherzer.  Now, I was, from a tenure perspective, the youngest guy to have ever gotten that position.  And anybody who got, made staffer, got made partner early at Goldman.  So it's a good anointment.  The guy I worked for, my big buddy, was a guy by the name of David Baum, who ran, you know, supermarkets, a bunch of supermarket acquisitions and, and all that sort of stuff.  I also worked in food, of course, 'cause they, you know, came out of the food area, so I did acquisition of Earth's Best by Heinz and some of those and worked with Grand Metropolitan and Unilever, Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, all those sorts of companies, way back when.
Speaker 1: You were on the Ben & Jerry's deal then?  You worked--
Speaker 2: There's a bunch of Ben & Jerry's deals (laughter) so--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 624684
Speaker 1: Why did you decide that you were gonna be on the defense side of the hostile takeover?
Speaker 2: One, Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.] focused on defense.  Now, here's the way you gotta think about it.  You can stand there and say, you know, it's on the side of the angels.  We're defending a company against a hostile raider.  Now, whether or not the company is being run well, being ex--you know, being supported by the senior management team, whose taking the excess rent and not giving it to the shareholders, that's a whole nother set of conversations.  And you can argue that all day long, okay, as to if, if that's the right answer.  But hostile raiders can actually create some efficiency in the marketplace.  But the reason Goldman mainly did it is because you're on the sell side.  Remember, if you're on the "buy" side, or you're buying a company, you may not win.  So you may not get paid.  If you're on the sell side, if it ever sells, you always get paid.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And one of the dynamics we created was the pricing such that and you tell the client this, "I will price this raid defense so you're indifferent to selling the company or indifferent to keeping it private."   So, now Goldman got a sell side fee for keeping the company private or a sell-side fee if they sold it.  They're brilliant people at Goldman Sachs, and you could see why, right.  And, but in that case, from my perspective, you had a--you wouldn't know on a hostile raid, typically, if it was gonna happen in, in nine weeks as opposed to nine months.  So you got to work on many more of them in shorter periods of time.
Speaker 1: So can you take us back to that time period--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and talk about--because who's the main takeover guy--
Speaker 2: Oh, but you had every--you had T. Boone Pickens, you had--I mean this was, you know, the height of a lot of those hostile raids, right.  And, you know, some of 'em are still around a little bit, right, problems of the world, but, you know, that was, that was, you know, Sir. James Goldsmith, and all.  I mean those guys were still kinda around there, you know, kicking and, you know, going after these companies.
Speaker 1: So what are you learning about the business too, you know, I mean on, on that defense?  What are you learning, 'cause it's interesting--(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a couple, I mean there's, there's learnings at the Goldman level on how to run an M&A [mergers and acquisitions] business, okay.  And if you think about what I do now, private equity firm, it's an M&A business, a big part of it is the M&A business, an investing business, but it's an M&A business.  How do you actually construct, have a machine for mergers and acquisitions, efficiently?  How do you do, you know, how do you do defenses and how do you take privates, okay.  So we've now, I think it's eighteen "take privates," right, fifteen take privates in the last thirty-six months, right.  So you gotta know how to take a private--company from a public company to a private company.  And there's an art to that, and there's an art, and it's different to do it in the U.S. than it is to do it in the U.K. and different in doing it in Australia (laughter), okay.  So you got, you learn the art of doing the deal and the deal making, is one of the pieces that you learn.  You also--and dynamic associated with the board and governance and fiduciary responsibilities, and all those overlays that are important to be an effective dealmaker.  Okay, you learn that stuff as an M&A banker.  In markets like we were in then, when there was a high activity level, we--I was always working on six or seven active deals every single day for about three years straight.  It's just intense.  And you see a lot, and you learn a lot, okay.  Now, what do you learn about the people?  At the end of the day, a lot of these are personality driven.  You know, a hostile raider.  I remember one of my first hostile raids, a company, California Energies jumping this little company called Magma Power.  And on the board, I had, you know, a very senior board member from Dow Chemical, right.  And here was this alternative energy provider being jumped by this upstart.  And you can do all the math that you want, but at the end of the day, it came down to the personalities of the people on the board, on the special committee and on the--by the hostile raider as to what carried the day and how they approached them in the conversations and the discussion and the rationale, and to why--and as to why that made sense or not.  You see what I mean?
Story_ID: 624685
Speaker 1: And so you start to realize that it's not just--and here's the big departure as an engineer.  It's not just the IQ [intelligence quotient].  It's the EQ [emotional intelligence quotient] that's important.  How do you relate to people?  And what are the sort of conversations do you have that carry the day, that make the difference or not between the successful transaction or successful outcome being no transaction.  Who are the constituencies involved?  How do you understand what their needs are?  And how do you articulate that in a way that's digestible by a set of decision makers that may not even really know constituencies well outside of names and numbers on a piece of paper.  All that becomes a part of your business intelligence that if you haven't been privy to that and seen it, multiple times, may escape you and you think it's just the numbers.
Speaker 2: But what prepared you for the EQ?  What prepared you for that?
Speaker 1: I don't know what prepared me for it.  You just start to see it.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: You sit in the board--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But you saw that, you're saying you saw it at Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because, well, I not only see it at Goldman, with Goldman, but you're sitting in a board room after spending the last nine days cranking through series of models and the last forty-eight hours being up straight, preparing these books, making sure there's no errors, look at the contingencies and five different options.  And then you see the dialogue that happens in the boardroom and the dynamic that occurs between the principals, and you realize that, sure, some of these analyses are based on all that heavy and hard work.  And you thought it was plain and simple because it's a numbers thing.  But it's more than that.  It's the people that are involved, right?  And that's where you start to see that, and when you see it in the context of board discussions moving billions of dollars of assets from one group of ownership to another, effecting tens of thousands of lives, you start to understand how important that is from a developmental perspective.  And the good news, you know, is, you get to see it at an age where you can then build that into an area for development for yourself, so that you can be an expert in that field.
Story_ID: 624686
Speaker 1: Now, who, is there any other African American that's ahead of you and is doing, is a rising star when you're at Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gregg Gonsalves, ultimately made partner there, and he's retired now.  He just retired last year.  Jide Zeitlin.  He was, made partner, I think a year or two, and he was like one of the youngest partners ever made at Goldman.  He's out of the M&A group and he's retired years ago now.  In terms of African Americans, at the time, and it could be today even, that may have been it in terms of African American partners.  There were some over in the trading division, I think, one or two over there, but that's in the I--investment banking division.
Story_ID: 624687
Speaker 1: But, was it, you said Gene Sykes, who--
Speaker 2: And Gene, yeah.  But Gene, not African American.
Speaker 1: No, he's not, but he, he, he becomes your mentor (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, let--
Speaker 2: So, so--
Speaker 1: What does he see in you that--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) A capable, able-bodied person.  No, and Gene's told me about this.  It's kinda funny.  So, here I am in New York [City, New York].  I get made the staffer, so I'm doing all the conflict clearing and hiring and, and, you know, compensation, and, you know, you know, what deals we're gonna work, setting fees and fee integrity, and in terms of all the stuff it takes to run an investment banking business.  And they give me three special assignments in addition to that.  One, is, we're going pre-IPO [initial public offering] and evaluating who are the investment bankers we need to go bring onboard the Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.] team before we go public, which we do, which is kind of an interesting--that's how I learned strategically how to think about your marketplace.  Also, a study on what makes women successful in investment banking, and we can talk about that another day, if you'd like.  And the third piece was analyzing this little thing called technology.  Now, at the time, we didn't have a tech group.  Technology for us was Northrop Grumman [Corporation], General Dynamics, you know, those sort of--Lockheed Martin, and a whole bunch of defense contractors, a little company called IBM, a little company we took public called Microsoft.  And we had a bunch of technology-focused, what we call, you know, corporate finance bankers out on the left coast in San Francisco, working on IPOs of start-ups, okay.  But we didn't have anybody focused on M&A in that space in San Francisco [California].  We had one of our folks down in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with Gene [Sykes], and he was mainly doing defense, and one guy on the East coast who was maybe doing some IBM-type stuff, mainly and a few other services businesses.  And I did a study, and showed it to our senior management, and the senior leadership, Gene and Mac [Steven "Mac" Heller] and others, that showed Morgan Stanley and this group called the HARM Group which is Hambrecht & Quist, Alex Brown, Montgomery Secur--Robertson Stephens and Montgomery Securities, all of which have been absorbed into different businesses, you know, and bought over time, who are doing, just, just doing a great job relatively speaking in M&A versus Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.], in technology.  So now, this is 1996, going into '97 [1997].  And, you know, I talked with Gene and Jeanine [ph.] and Mac and beside--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: By that time, how long have you been at Goldman?
Speaker 2: Now, two and a half years--
Speaker 1: Two and a half--
Speaker 2: --three years, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you joined--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so Gene says, "We need to start a tech group."  He said, "Robert, I'd like you to be, help me start this tech group out in the West Coast."  He wanted to start it in L.A [Los Angeles, California].  I said, "Gene, it needs to be in San Francisco [California]."  He said, "L.A.'s a better place," meaning he lived in L.A. and still lives in L.A. (laughter).  He said, the weather's better, you know, more comfortable environment.  I said, Gene, but all the deals that happen in Silicon Valley, "Oh, easy fly."  I said, "Gene, we gotta be, we gotta be in San Francisco."  So he said, "All right, fine."  He said, "So, will you do it?"  I said, "Gene, I will only do that if you become my mentor."  I said, "I've worked with every other partner in M&A at that point in time now, okay."  I worked with Cody Smith and, you know, and Mac Heller and Joe Gatto, and, you know, all the partners that were in M&A at the time.  But I hadn't worked with Gene.  And arguably, Gene is still in my mind, the best M&A banker I've ever seen on the planet, ever.  And he said, "Okay."  He said, "Well, I'll come--I'll buy a house in San Francisco and I'll come up, and I'll work with you and all that."  So he bought a house in San Francisco, came up a few times, but he's--we still, has been become a good mentor and good confidant and all that sort of stuff.  So I was our first M&A banker on the ground in San Francisco, focused on technology.
Story_ID: 624688
Speaker 1: So who's there?  Who's, who are the companies and what are you focusing on at that point?
Speaker 2: My first clients were a company called Octel [Communications] voice messaging system.  It's a voice messaging system you use today on your voicemail.  They've been resold to Lucent, sold back to Lucent.  I advised the company called Apple Computers when Gil Amelio was running the company and [Edgar] Ed Woolard said, you know, we need to make a change here.  We fired Gil, got rid of the board and convinced Steve Jobs to come back to Apple Computer.  I advised a little company called Texas Instruments, a little company called Hewlett-Packard, spin-off of Agilent Technologies, which was the biggest spin-off of the time, you $26 billion spin-off, right.  Advised a little company called Microsoft, advised a company called eBay, and a company called Yahoo, and got to work on many deals of that type, stock-to-stock type public transactions, but what I really enjoyed was the more complex deals.  Stock-to-stock public, you know--trees are growing to the sky at that point, right.  The tech market's just booming, '97 [1997], '98 [1998], '99 [1999], right, I mean the market is just going crazy.  And everybody was doing stock-for-stock mergers with a lot of Internet start-up type companies.  But I liked the hard asset, enterprise software businesses because they were difficult, and you had to come up with the creative solutions to make these things work.  You know, I've worked on some, you know, leverage and sale recaps of supermarket companies, and I liked that sort of stuff, and worked with people like, you know, [Samuel] Sam Zell and others in those sort of businesses, which was fun way back when, right.  But now in this world of technology, it is stock-for-stock trades of companies that just became companies, right (laughter), except when I got--that's why I liked to work with companies like Hewlett-Packard and others 'cause they were complex deals.  Well, in that period of time--well, I don't know what you want, where you wanna go after this, but, you know, in my mind, that was where the action was.  And so we went from nowhere to being first in M&A [mergers and acquisitions].  I went from me to about forty people, to almost eighty in M&A in San Francisco [California] and in Menlo Park from '97 [1997] through 2000.
Story_ID: 624689
Speaker 1: Now, is, is, is--do you ever come across [HM] Charles Phillips in life?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, and at what point do you come across him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so Charles--this is good.  So Charles was actually a research analyst at Morgan Stanley, and he covered a number of the software companies that were my clients and ones that I was looking to take over.  And Charles will tell you, he coined the phrase, "enterprise software", okay.  And I used to use his research all the time, to justify whether we should buy this company, keep it private, all that sort of stuff.  And we had a bunch of research analysts as well, of course.  But that's where I first came across his name and his work, was back in those days.  But, I didn't meet him until you know, I don't know, seven, eight, nine years ago.
Story_ID: 624690
Speaker 1: But when you go out to, to San Francisco [California], you're not focused on just enterprise software.  You're focused on tech.
Speaker 2: I'm doing tech.
Speaker 1: Tech, just--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, what's so funny at the time, the folks at Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.] didn't believe tech was a big market.  And they said, "Robert, you do technology, you know, go out and build a team and all that sort of stuff.  But also keep some of your food clients 'cause we're not sure this is gonna be a good business (laughter) for us."  So I still had, you know, some of my ice cream and food clients.  So I still did tech and food (laughter) for a while until we finally convinced them that, that this was a big business, and we created a tech group finally.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that whole process of creating--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and the growth and is there any difference between the mainline in dealing with them and the tech industry 'cause there's--so, I'm just trying to understand you--
Speaker 2: As it related to Goldman or the industry?
Speaker 1: Goldman and the industry.
Speaker 2: Very much.  And so here's the interesting thing.  So, when Gene [Sykes] made me this offer, I went to Mac [Steven "Mac" Heller], who ran the department.  And Mac admitted, he said, "Gene is the best investment banker--" he said, "We're really good, Robert," he said, "Gene [Sykes] is way up here, okay."  And he is.  I mean this is singularly, I think one of the most brilliant people I've ever met in my entire life.  And I've met some brilliant people in my life, and just a delightful guy, okay.  But he said, "Robert, don't go to San Francisco."  I said, "Well, why not?"  He said, "'Cause everybody who goes--" he said, "Everybody who goes outside of New York, their partner track slows."  He said, "With the exception of Gene, 'cause everybody knows just how good Gene is, right (laughter)."  And it's true.  If you looked at everybody who was in San Francisco, partnership, couple cycles later, and, and he's like, "Look, you're just finishing the staffer.  All the partners know you.  You're doing great, all this."  He'd say, you know, and Mac was committed to actually helping and driving what is the right answer, and that's when Gregg [Gonsalves] and some of those guys got made partner, okay, 'cause Mac was behind, and he is brilliant and great.  And it was force in and of himself.  And he was, he saw that I could do something like that and could be made partner at Goldman.  You see what I mean?  But I said, "Mac, I gotta go out there."  I said, "(A), 'cause I really wanna learn from Gene, to be frank with you, right, 'cause of the fact I don't--I said, but second, this world of technology--" and it kinda comes back to it, there was, their--Morgan Stanley had a couple folks out there, who ultimately went to BMG and some other firms, okay.  But no one else had any real, real talent.  They were good, but they were kinda split, you know, in M&A.  And I said, if I go out there, (A), I'll get experience with a high--without a whole lot of people, you know, claiming credit, okay.  (B), I can build a team.  So, if you look at my team at Vista now, almost all of my senior team of folks who I hired as analysts and associates from 1996--1998, '99 [1999] and 2000 at Goldman and trained them, okay.  And I said, now, in a fact-pattern-based business, you get these young, sharp people, and you train the heck out of 'em, they're just gonna (making exploding upward noise), okay, in terms of driving the opportunity set.  And so that's why I went out there and took that risk in that context.  You gotta take a little risk in life.  But it pays off big if you get it right.  And the neat thing was, I'd work on a two and a half billion dollar deal in New York, and I'd have three senior partners taking credit.  I'd work on a $5 billion deal out there, and I'm the only one there.  And it's not just the credit.  It's the experience.  You are the person having the day-to-day conversations with board, with the CEO's about what their options are and alternatives are.  And the more practice you get, the better you become.
Story_ID: 624691
Speaker 1: Is Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.] really for you, in many ways, a golden track?  Is Goldman really--
Speaker 2: Here's the thing--hum, that's a good question.  Goldman is a highly-competitive environment.  And it is, like all environments where there is a, where there are big stakes.  It is, "What have you done for me lately?"  And, "What have you done relative to what others have done?" okay.  Now, the good news is I became really good at my craft.  And in certain circles in Silicon Valley [San Francisco, California], people believed I was absolutely the best at my craft, okay, because I took it very seriously.  And I was really, really, really good, M&A [mergers and acquisitions] banker and gave great advice and tactically and strategically.  And I had great mentors who helped me when I needed help in looking at some different fact patterns.  I was really good at that.  That said, there're other people who also got good.  You know, one of my buddies, and one of my close friends, you know, is now co-head of the M&A group.  He's really good too.
Speaker 1: And who's that?
Speaker 2: Gregg, Gregg Lemkau, okay.  And we're very close, okay.  Another one of my buddies, Marc McMorris, really good, okay, at his craft.  He runs his own firm, Carrick Capital now, just like, he does what I do at his firm, okay.  And that's part of the joy if working with really talented people, is you spur each other on and help each other become better in that context.  And you can be in a nice cooperation, coopetition environment, which Goldman promoted.  It was very much teamwork.  I would anything those guys asked me to do, okay, but I knew at the end of the day, they're gonna measure my $56 million in revenues versus their forty-eight or fifty-eight, okay.  You see what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But that's a part of the dynamic, and you also see the dynamic of who gets good deals handed to 'em, versus who creates good deals.  Now, this is something that I talk about a lot with a bunch of junior bankers, not at Goldman, at other places, 'cause I got disgusted for periods of time looking at some of the folks who had come out of our competitive firms, African American who had been systemically underdeveloped as bankers, taken along by a senior banker, sometimes African American, saying "I'm gonna take care of you."  And then when I look at their deal experience, it is a fraction of the experiences that their counterparts actually got.  They may have been politically protected, but they got underdeveloped.  And the thing that you have to understand in this business is you're as good as the fact pattern of experiences that you have accumulated and how you exercise them.  So forget the big sexy clients, okay.  What you need to work on is a lot of different challenging deals, a lot of difficult, challenging deals and gorge yourself with the opportunity to learn in the first five, six years, seven years of your experience as an M&A banker because then you're gonna get measured to be senior vice president, partner, MB, whatever the title is in whatever firm it is, versus others at that same tenure.  And if you miss that cycle, and if you miss the next one, you're done.  And if you miss that cycle because your deal experience is thin or your judgments aren't refined, then you're done.  And so the big brass ring in that opportunity set is no longer available to you, not that you weren't smart.  But you got underdeveloped.  And you may not realize it until it's too late.  And so that's a little bit of a bone of contention that I have with some of, you know, the folks in this industry who could have done a much better job in accelerating the experiences of other, young African Americans, Latinos and women in this lucrative market.  I'm not saying they're bad people because they're probably thinking that they're doing a good job protecting them politically.  But they under develop them.
Speaker 1: But you're say--are you talking about, they're underdeveloped by the black partners or underdeveloped by everyone in senior positions?
Speaker 2: It can, it can be both, but if you end up with a black senior person, and I'm not saying, partner--
Speaker 1: Senior person--
Speaker 2: --who is looking to protect you from the harsh realities of the political shark-infested environment, you can often end up working on deals that aren't A, as challenging, B, as, you know, fast-paced or have (unclear) as frequency or the volume because if someone's, oh, they're protected by so and so, you're gonna work on three deals that year, not seven.  Okay, and then multiple it by times three years.  Someone's got twenty-one deals.  You got nine.  Where are you?  You see what I mean?  On a relative and absolute basis.
Speaker 1: So, it's a numbers' game in terms of number of deals, but it's also, it's the size of the deal too?
Speaker 2: It's not necessarily the biggest deals that matter, although big deals matter because the biggest deals, I'll guarantee you the big partners will all come swimming around that one.  And how you, and it'll be two associates on that team or three associates on that team.  And so, it depends on what you work on, you know.  Are you the person actually driving the model?  And a lot of folks say, "Well, I don't wanna drive the model."  You know, you better go drive that model 'cause that's where a lot of that--oh, and then you also gotta be the one preparing the books.  And you see what I mean, you gotta, you gotta push yourself and not shy away from that dynamic in order to be recognized as a person who can then take on the next biggest one, and oh, by the way, then you need to be the one who's the only associate on that deal, then managing other associates on that deal.  And it, that all compounds.
Story_ID: 624692
Speaker 1: Okay, Robert--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You see.
Speaker 1: --so when you started, you were a team of one, and then you said, it grew to eighty people.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: About what period of time?
Speaker 2: Oh, shoot, from 1997 through 2000, oh, massive expansion.  I went out there in March of '97, and when I left in April of 2000, we had about eighty people in and around the tech group.
Speaker 1: But why did you leave?
Speaker 2: Ah, this is where the Vista [Vista Equity Partners] story starts.  So I go out in the spring of 1997, and I gave you my client list, right?
Speaker 1: Which is a great client list.
Speaker 2: These are all top, tech businesses in the world, Apple, most valuable public company in the world now, Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, eBay, Yahoo--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I run into this little company. I get a call--remember, I was a staffer.  I was telling you about that.  Well, when you're the staffer, you get calls from all the partners at Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.] to clear conflicts on deals.  Every day, you wake up and you got sixty-five voicemails you gotta go through and figure out where's the conflict?  Can you work on this deal?  What's the price?  And so I get a call from one who is in our high, net worth division, says, "There's a client that I have, you know, a family trust owns his business.  They need some strategic help.  He's thinking about selling the company.  Can you call the guy back?  Can you work with him?"  I call that partner back and say, "No.  Never heard of this company.  We're too busy."  I'm sitting down, saying I'm no longer the staffer, and why you calling me?  "Well, you're in technology.  It's a tech business.  Robert, can you please call the guy?"  I call 'em back, I--no, I can't call this guy.  I--it's got me.  I'm hiring a bunch of twelve-year olds, you know, (laughter) to be my (unclear) and associates.  I got 'em all sitting in one room.  I mean it's literally a tiny room with, with six and eight people, I mean it was just no elbow room, trying to build the team, got no floor space, you know.  Says, Robert, says, "Robert, you gotta call this guy back."  So I call the guy back to tell him that he needs to call like Broadview or one of the other smaller investment banks 'cause we can't take him.  I've never heard of him, right, and I'm working on all these big, fancy clients, right.  He figures out I'm giving him the brush off.  And we start talking history and background, like, he's, "Where you from?"  I'm from Colorado.  "You fish?"  Yeah, I'm a fisherman.  He says, "Well, I'm a fly fisherman too."  He said, in fact, I'm gonna be in Telluride [Colorado] in August.  Now, this is June.  Said, okay.  He said, "Why don't you come see me?"  He said, I'll have my trustee there and CFO there and we can talk.  We'll go--we'll work in the morning and go fishing in the afternoon.  So back then we didn't have Outlook.  They had little black books, right, and I'm--find a day.  I said, "Okay, well, I can go, fly into Colorado and go meet this client, go fishing in the afternoon, go see my mom on Saturday and get back, right."  He said, "Perfect (laughter)."  You know, so I pick a day.  Well, low and behold, the day comes.  I'm, oh, man, I gotta get there, right.  So I fly in.  Of course, weather is a pain in Colorado, so I fly into, it wasn't Telluride.  It was booked.  It was Montrose and have to drive and all of this, and so I go sit down with the CEO, CFO, trustee guy, and I was like, you know, there's no, remember, there's no Internet, right.  So you don't, you know, you got Dunn & Bradstreet reports on companies.  Well, it's not a whole lot of information about you guys.  Tell me what it is you guys do for a living.  And then they chuckle, and then guys say, you know, remember this he said, "Some years you make money and other years you make a lot of money."  And here's a company, private company that did $300 million in revenues and $150 million in EBITDA in 1996.  And I gave you my little fancy list of, of, you know, clients.  None of 'em had 50 percent EBITDA margins.  The average software company is at about a 13, 14 percent EBITDA margin.  Even now, it's only about 16 or 17 percent.  Fifty percent EBITDA margins.  Ninety seven--
Speaker 1: When you say EBITDA --
Speaker 2: Profit.
Speaker 1: Profit, okay, profit margins.
Speaker 2: Profit margins.
Speaker 1: But what, how--what is that term that you're using?
Speaker 2: EBITDA, "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization", E-B-I-T-D-A.  Okay, term of art for our--
Speaker 1: Right, in your industry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  None of those folks had that kind of profit margin.  97 percent retention rate with their customer base.  Average remaining contract was about, life left, was 7.2 years.  I'm like this company has visibility on over a billion dollars in cash flow, owned by one family trust.  What is it you people do?  They sold software systems, forms and solutions to the largest retail channel in the United States, automobile dealers.  So if you think about it, your biggest retail purchase in your life is your house.  Your second biggest retail purchase is your car.  And your third is your second car.  Automobile dealers if you think about them, their inventory sits out in the rain every single day.  They spend tens of millions of dollars in inventory that sits out there that they hope they can sell, that they buy from the OEM's, right.  And they gotta spend a bunch of money to get you to come in to buy a dealer--or to buy a car.  And then you've got tens of millions of dollars' worth of parts sitting in a, in a service department run by people who typically have high school degrees, making $12.00 an hour.  Well, how you gon' make any money in that business unless you have really strong systems?  And these people had the best systems to manage parts, inventory, cataloging, you know, human resources, inventory planning, floor planning, marketing, all those sorts of things.  And they sold them to the biggest automobile dealers in the United States and in the world.
Story_ID: 624693
Speaker 1: And being a scientist, having never seen that outlier before, with all these companies I've now looked at (laughter), okay, I needed to understand why that company was an outlier because when I looked at, you know, [HM] Mr. [Charles] Phillips' reports on enterprise software, they were 17 and 18 percent EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] margins and this was 50 [percent].  What do they do that's different?  So I go back to Gene [Sykes], and I said, "Gene, I wanna go work and figure this client out."  He says, "We never heard of these guys.  Robert, go work on, you know, Texas Instruments and all that."  I said, "Gene, I gotta go take a look," he was like.  So I get a sale side assignment that I start working on.  But as part of that, I start really understanding, in order to actually sell a company, you need to understand the company.  So I start going, doing due diligence on this company.  And I bring one of my analysts with me, and I'm looking, and I was like, "Oh, my goodness.  These people have figured out some things that no one else has figured out."  And I start recording that in my mind.  Hum, so ultimately, during the whole set of processes, they decide they don't wanna sell that business for different reasons.  I get 'em a good price for the business.  They say, "Nah, we're not gonna sell."  But this company is now minting all this money, and I'm like what are you guys do with all this money?
Speaker 2: So, the name of the company?  What is--
Speaker 1: It was called UCS, Universal Computer Systems.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I said, what do you all do with all this money?  And they said, well, you know, they invest it in CDs, certificates of deposit, don't believe in the public markets and all that sort of stuff.  Now, you gotta remember the stock market is going like crazy, and remember, this is '97 [1997], '98 [1998], '99 [1999], remember the tech bubble and all that sort of stuff.
Speaker 2: Everything is block--just blowing up.
Speaker 1: Trees are growing to the sky.
Speaker 2: You could get financed for any kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And I said, "There're some other investments you all ought a think about."  And they said, "Well, what do--what's on your mind?"  So I'm a good Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.] solider, so I take them back East to go meet with, at the time, Hank Paulson, and Jon Corzine who were running our firm, and the guy who runs our asset management business, the guy who runs our, you know, our, our, you know, private equity business.  And they come back from those meetings.  They say, "Ah, you know, they're real, still public-market focused, and we believe the public markets aren't necessarily right for us, you know.  We got burned back in the '70s [1970s] with public markets, and we just--we only focus on things we know about.  What else you--can make sense?"  And I said, "Well, just so you know, it's just not Goldman. You should go talk to the guys at Morgan Stanley."  So they went over and did the same thing, came back with the same response.  And they said, "What else you thinking about and what else makes--" I said, "Well, y'all ought a think about private equity business."  And they said, "Well, how's that work?"  So I walked them through how private equity businesses work.  Then I introduced them to a few.  They had met some through the process earlier, and this was the platinum list, you know, Blackstone [Group], KKR [& Co. LP], Hicks Muse [Tate & Furst, later HM Capital Partners], right, and some of these aren't in business anymore, right.  You know, Bain Capital, who was only investing out of a $1 billion fund then, a bunch of folks like that.  And after that they came back and said, "Well, you know, if we invested in like their Fund 5, what happens if that fund doesn't?"   And I said, "Well, you lose all that money."  And they said, "Well, that doesn't sound like a good deal to us."  Well, you know (laughter), I said, "Okay."  And they said, "What else you thinking about?"  I said, "If I were you, I would go buy these enterprise software businesses and I'd take a lot of your, you know, business practices, and I'd push 'em into those companies.  And you can make 'em really profitable, and you can make a lot of money."  And they stood back.  They said, "That's the best idea we've ever heard."  And after a while, they said, "Would you be interested in running a private equity firm if we're one of the limited partners, and you did that?"  I'm like, "Well, why do you think I brought it up?"  So we struck a deal.  And I would build this private equity firm and they would be the limited partners in this private equity firm, and we'd go buy these enterprise software businesses, and we'd bring a whole series of improvements to those businesses, which I ultimately codified in the form of what we call Vista Standard Operating Procedures, of which we're over seventy of 'em now--everybody calls it our playbook, that actually improves the performance of these businesses.  And now we've done over a 180 transactions, $45 billion in value.  We've now been ranked the top private equity fund in the world for the decade 2000 through 2009 'cause that's all they've measured so far.  Zero losses on a buy-out deal ever.  That's where it all started.  That's why I left Goldman.
Story_ID: 624694
Speaker 1: How long did it take you to negotiate the arrangements--
Speaker 2: A long time.
Speaker 1: How long is a long time?
Speaker 2: It's hard to categorize it all completely.  And it's hard to talk about what's negotiations, okay.  The first part of it was education because, again, I'm doing client service.  This is a client of mine, and they add--you know, I talked to them about private equity.  How does this actually work?  So I now have to educate them on how private equity firms work (laughter), right.  And once, how--you know, what's management fee, what's carry, what's clawback, you know, and help 'em understand the terms, okay.  Then, of course, they being different, you know, and once we said, well, this makes some sense to pursue, I said, well, I first gotta go talk to Goldman [Sachs] about this.  So I take this idea to Gene [Sykes] and Joe [Joseph] Gleberman, and I say, "Guys, just so you know, I've had these conversations with these folks, and we should do this in Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.] in our PIA [personal investment authority] group, where we do buyouts of these enterprise software, do these improvements."  And they kinda looked at me, they're like, you know, we kinda ain't in that business, but--and it was kind of--I'll give Gene credit, Gene's like, "But if you wanna do that on your spare time, we'll move you into the pri--in our PIA group.  You can do web vans, right, which is a venture kind of stuff we were doing, right, and you can focus on some of this in your spare time."  I said, "Gene, you know, there's no such thing as spare time here at Goldman, right.  So what are you saying?"  And he said, well, that's what we can offer.  So that's when I left Goldman to start Vista [Equity Partners, LLC].  And the negotiations, I spent a lot of time over months--part of it was when I was at the end of my Goldman, you know, experience there, and I told Gene and those folks that, that's what I was doing.  And I still have some clients that I wanted to finish up with.  And in negotiations with 'em, I mean it was long on the one hand.
Speaker 1: Like you say, what long?  A year or longer?
Speaker 2: Months though, but months.
Speaker 1: Months, just months, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because there's, I mean this is something new, and they had terms I'd never heard of, and came up with structures I'd never heard.  And so, you know, I--there were two kind of firms out there that did this.  They picked one law firm.  I picked the other one.  I picked the, you know, a buddy of mine who I was in, in business school with.  I said, hey, I'm thinking about doing this, and would come on board and wanna do this.  And he was a lawyer, okay.  And he said, sure, I'll help you, you know, and brought him on.  So he was one of the founding partners there.  And then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: Stephen, Stephen Davis [ph.].  And then, so he worked with the lawyers to help, you know, me understand and them understand what, right, and then I brought my number two now, Brian Sheth, who was an associate that worked for me, or analyst and associate, and went to Bain Capital.  And nine months later, I said, remember we were talking about some of these ideas?  He said, yeah.  I said, I think these guys are gonna do it.  If you wanna come onboard.  And so after I pretty much got it signed and done, and he joined on board in April or May of 2000.  That's when Vista got formed.
Story_ID: 624695
Speaker 1: Now, this is though, this is forming, still in a difficult time period.
Speaker 2: God, yes.  You know, we formed this thing, and then guess what happened?  A month later, the market crashed.
Speaker 1: So how--
Speaker 2: Now, if you've ever gone into the private equity business, and you've started your own firm, your first fund terms are typically way off market, which mine were.  I didn't have preference.  I had hurdle, which means rather than making sure you cover eight percent, I had to pay eight percent.  I didn't have management fee.  I had budget.  I had not only clawback, but I basically had an escrow agreement that we'd put money away that would stay in there until the fund was closed.  I mean last deal closed, and if they didn't make their eight percent, they got all of that GP [general partner] carry, plus whatever I had personally, they could come back after that.  I had to countersign on that.  I mean--
Speaker 1: So a lot of these terms were part of your negotiated deal?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that helped.
Speaker 2: Helped what?
Speaker 1: It helped, that helped the beginning, put the beginning structure in place to make you successful, do you think?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: It, it, it was the deal I had to agree to in order to go do this.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: It isn't like it was--it was not a GP-friendly deal, by any stretch of the imagination.  But they had all the cards.
Speaker 1: So how do you end up being successful?  And this is, I mean, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, that's a good question.
Speaker 1: Right, that's a, the only question in the room, right now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because, I mean to read about Vista, you know, you see, oh, my God, these fantastic returns, no money lost, you know, you look--it seems somewhat unbelievable.  So, what, how did you--you bring in this person who used to work for you?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You have this lawyer.  Who--where are you located, first of all?
Speaker 2: San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: That's where I was living at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--you're in San Francisco [Califronia].  How many do you--where is your first office?
Speaker 2: My first office is in the conference room of my accountants.  And then I find office space in the new building being built, 150 California Street, and I go take that space before there're even windows up on that building.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's our first office, in 19--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And so how small, how, how--what size, is it 1,500 square feet, I mean--
Speaker 2: I think 3,600 square feet, 3,800 and then we expand it, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how many people does it take to build--I mean how, for those first--
Speaker 2: Five, start off with five, went to seven, went to nine, went to eleven.  Now, I got 150.  I mean it's, it is, it is--the way it's, the way you become--we became successful, okay, is sticking to a very defined formula.  And let me tell you what that actually means.  The critical factors for success have to be under our control.  So you're not gonna invest in things that you can't control, like the market changing or someone buying, you know, buying patterns changing.  What you could control was the operational base of a company.  How they write their contracts, how they price their contracts, how they price their product.  Okay, how they hire their people, how they train their people, okay.  How you develop your, you know, how you do your contracts administration process.  All of their fundamental components to running a business--
Story_ID: 624696
Speaker 1: See the reason most enterprise software companies actually aren't that profitable because they're actually not designed to be profitable.  They're actually designed to go do customer acquisition.  Well, why because every investment banker in the world is gonna tell a new software company, get more customers, grow faster.  It makes your company more valuable.  They don't really talk about profits.  But now, I want you to just think about--sit back and think fundamentally about what is software?  It's not a widget.  It's an intellectual property if you think about it, housed in the construct.  It's a 95 percent gross margin product.  You build it once, you sell it many times.  The same product I can build for you, I can sell to a million other people, 10 million other people if it's consumer.  But if it's in the marketplace, it may only have 10,000 customers, I can sell that same product to that same set of customers because my cost base has changed, only to the extent my sales bases changes.  You see what I mean?  Ninety-five percent gross margin, build it once, sell it many times.  Every time you sell it, you don't use it up 'cause there's no inventory.  Inventory doesn't par--isn't perishable, right.  It actually doesn't require Cap X.  If I were to start a real estate business, and had the good fortune of Donald Trump, and my dad gave me some money, I need money to go buy real estate.  I don't need money to write software code.  And I will argue with you, I can probably write software code today that's more valuable than the most valuable building Donald Trump has.  If I write a software program that cuts, you know, that increases the fuel efficiency of every single car on the planet by two percent, is that valuable?  If I wrote a software program that actually, for a mid-sized utility decreases their fuel usage by 20 percent, is that valuable?  If I wrote a software program that decreases the, the frequency of you getting a blood test back that isn't yours, is that valuable?  Or if I gave you one that made sure the ones that were yours, were actually tested on a machine that was calibrated right before (unclear), was that valuable?  Well, how valuable.  In some cases, I can actually calculate.  In some cases, it's incalculable.  But it's huge.  That's the advantage of enterprise software.
Speaker 2: So I understand it, but not all enterprise software companies are created equal.  So--
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: --so, how large, one, is the market?  You know, when you get--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Enormous.
Speaker 2: Now, how, what--when you say enormous, how many companies are in--
Speaker 1: Our best estimates today, 50,000-plus companies.  Some say 75,000 companies, okay.
Speaker 2: So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to think about it today.  Thirty years ago, I was graduating from college, okay.  And if I wanted to take a flight from Denver [Colorado] or from Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] to Denver, I used to have to go down to the office of, you know, U.S. Air, say here's what--I wanna go to Denver.  And then they'd write up some slip, and they'd put it on a tube, and they'd slip in the back and people, okay.  Now, I can do it on my phone.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, if I wanted to do payroll thirty years ago, I'd have to go to the payroll clerk, go to the department of payroll clerks.  Now, I can just type it on my machine or it gets done automatically.  How efficient is that?  How many companies are out there that start every day where somebody says, "I got an idea.  Let me automate the way that property and casualty insurance brokers actually manage their business" or the way that the claims processing for a dented car is gonna be managed or the way that you're gonna receive your utility bill or the way that you're gonna actually check into a hotel or the way that you're gonna actually tonight, book your, your, you know, your reservation at a, at a restaurant.  Tens of thousands of these ideas manifest themselves every day in the form of software, in the form of businesses.  And so, as big as Vista is, we've got now about $15 billion in assets under management.  Today, you can put 50-50 debt and equity.  So double that in purchasing power, $30 billion in purchasing power.  We do more deals than anybody.  We do more deals than Oracle and IBM and every other private equity firm out there, in terms of volume of deals.  We only make up one percent of the purchasing power in that market.  That's $3.3 trillion market today.  And it's growing faster than every other market out there.  So even as fast as we are growing, we're still getting outstripped by the growth in our marketplace because people are realizing how valuable enterprise software is, especially now that you can take BETA content and deliver it to you in a way that it's helpful and useful to you.  One of the most valuable companies on the planet today, which is private, is a company called Uber [Technologies, Inc.].  You familiar with them?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: What's Uber?  It's an enterprise software company.  It's a capacity planning tool.  All it does is figure out where is the capacity.  People driving around in cars that they wanna rent out, and where is the demand?  Someone on the street who needs a ride.  And I could match it up real time, and I can charge you $60.00 for you to take that cab and guess what, I take $12.00 and give the cabbie $40.00, pay the rest, taxes or whatever it might be.  You see the point.  That company didn't exist five years ago.  I will guarantee you there's a couple hundred Ubers under development right now in every single industry that's out there, some of which we're doing.  That's how fast and how it proliferates.
Story_ID: 624697
Speaker 1: How have you determined which companies you go after?  How do you source those and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and decide this is a good prospect?
Speaker 2: Sure, got it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the targets are simple from my perspective, complex from others.  And you gotta make it, you know, think about do I want mission critical, business critical, enterprise software companies?  This is software that creates a lot of value for its customers.  The customers rely on it.  It's important to them, and they're willing to pay for value and not cost, okay.  So if I went to a large insurance company and said, you know, this is a software system that basically powers everything, mission critical, business critical, it actually powers everything that they do or powers their customer engagement or how they do their underwriting.  If they didn't have that software, they wouldn't be in business that day.  That's mission critical.  That's, this is critical.  You see what I mean?  That's how I think about what products do we want, what companies do we wanna buy?  If you look at all our companies, they're mission critical and business critical.  It is the software that powers, you know, the largest, and again, you know, utilities, okay, in terms of how they do their work.  It's a software that runs the blood tests in hospitals, okay.  It's a software that's used for cyber security, okay.  It's a software that's used for real-time information for baggage claim or whether or not, you know, the airplane has a, if the airplane has a parts problem, when the next part's gonna come so they can put that airplane back in service, that every minute that that airplane is out of service, costs that airline $20,000, mission critical, business critical.  You see what I mean?  So that's what we look at.  Now, the question is, how do you see all of them?  You scourer the world.  We have relationships with over 500 intermediaries, banks, investment banks, okay, that know that all we do is enterprise software.  And then we look at them and actively target--I've got a database now of over 40,000 companies and we actively look at which ones fit our model and where are they?  Are they too pricey?  Are they ones we should be going after.  And then you cultivate relationships to go after those companies.  Sometimes, they're CEOs, sometimes it's the board, sometimes it's someone who has a relationship with them.  If it's a public company, then you figure out how to go take it private.  It comes back to that.  How do you take a company private, right?  If it's a private company, how do you go build a relation with the CEO and say, you're better off selling your business to us.  We're good stewards of the business.  And if it's a banker-led deal, bankers get companies all the time where an executive says, I wanna sell.  I've been at this twenty years.  I'm done, okay.  And we're after--we happen to be in that market.  If you think about it, it's my generation that were the purveyors and starters of the first enterprise software businesses.  We're the ones who automated the insurance industry and the banking industry and all those things.  Well, you know, these folks are getting in their--and ten years older, right, getting into their fifties and sixties and seventies.  And they're saying all right, let me go pass this on to somebody else and let me sell this business.  And so we get a part of that, and our job is to make sure we see all the deals that we can, if not everyone, and get the first call or the last call or the only call.
Speaker 1: What does that take to put something like that together?
Speaker 2: A lot.
Speaker 1: A lot.  That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So my senior folks, my next level, most of 'em have been with me eighteen, nineteen--one has been with me twenty-one years this year.  None of 'em are over the age of forty-two.  I hired 'em as analysts and associates at Goldman [Sachs].  And some went off and worked different places and then re--and then joined Gold--and then joined Vista after we got it up and running, okay.  Now, you've created a phenomenal wealth creation engine for them individual, plus an opportunity for them to expand and to grow and a camaraderie and a culture where we depend and rely on each other.
Story_ID: 624698
Speaker 1: You're African American.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how are--there're lots of people out doing deals, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and lots of people try to get--I don't--in terms of African Americans in this space, the only other person I've known to be in this space, but not on this side, was [HM] Charles Phillips.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But when he was at Oracle, he was doing a lot--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's basically--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, did a lot when he was Oracle [Corporation] (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --with Larry Ellison, he did a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of buying.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's our biggest competitor, still is, Oracle.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Oracle is still your biggest competitor?
Speaker 2: I think so.  They do, they do--well, you know, they're doing fewer deals.  Once they bought Sun [Microsystems, Inc.], they've kind of gotten more into the hardware business and not doing as much enterprise software.  But anyway, yeah, they do a lot of enterprise software deals.
Speaker 1: But what did you feel was important in terms of building your team?  I mean--
Speaker 2: So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have to, 'cause you're not, otherwise, you're not telling the story.
Speaker 2: I am telling the story.
Speaker 1: I know but--
Speaker 2: You know what, you know, it's culture.  Now, you also have to look at the folks that I hired, right?  My number two in command, Brian [Sheth], his father is Indian.  His mother is Irish, grew up in Boston [Massachusetts].  Here's a guy who I also know always viewed a little bit differently, brilliant, but viewed differently 'cause he's got an Indian father, okay.  One of the nicest, most delightful, most brilliant guys you ever wanted to meet, okay, but always viewed, was--got viewed as being different.  Of course, right.  So, then you look at my next group, you know, like Jamie [Ford] and, you know, Christian [Sowul], you know, they--Christian, you know, parents are divorced, but, you know, once--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Jamie's last name?
Speaker 2: Ford, but Jamie's dad ran asset management at Goldman [ Sachs Group, Inc.] but raised the right way where he sees people for who they are as people, Christian the same way, okay.  You know--
Speaker 1: And Christian's last name?
Speaker 2: Christian Sowul, right, grew up in New Jersey, you know, two brothers, you know, parents were divorced, went to, went to U-Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], 3.9 in MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], graduated early, one of the hardest majors there which is business and engineering together, absolutely brilliant, okay.  So when you start going through, you know, Rob Rogers, been working with me at Goldman [Sachs], Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] guy.  You know, his grandfather was a governor of Missouri, okay, was at Goldman, brilliant guy.  Alan Cline, grew up in Vir--you know, grew up in, you know, in--dad was at IBM.  He went to UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].  He was one of--he was the first analyst we had Goldman, working on technology.  And I've known him since '94 [1994], been working ever since '94 [1994].  You see what I mean?  When you bring people with the right heart and brilliant minds and a desire to do something differently, and to be the best at it together, that's how we centralize and the elements of how we centralize our culture.  That's who we are.  And we go to battle every day with each other, for each other to create the lives that we want.  And I told 'em, look, when we first stood this thing up, I said, "Guys, look, we can go hire, a bunch of seasoned private-equity guys, and learn from them.  Or we can go figure this out ourselves."  So it gets back to that lesson, I said, "There's gonna be more joy in us figuring this out ourselves."
Story_ID: 624699
Speaker 1: We spent the first seven years, with our first fund, figuring it out ourselves.
Speaker 2: And your first fund was how much?
Speaker 1: It was--it started off at $300 million and we did the second tranche at a billion.  Well, the original commitment from the LP [limited partner] was 1.2 billion, but they only had 300 million in cash.  So we're doing a recap to get the rest.
Speaker 2: Now, the LP was--
Speaker 1: It was a family.  It was the--
Speaker 2: This is a charitable trust.
Speaker 1: Charitable trust, the A. Eugene Brockman Family Charitable Trust, right, okay.  And when I looked at that, and they gave the, come in, they said, "Let's, let's do our first deal at a billion, 250 [$1,250,000,000 billion], but we'll do the first 300 million in cash.  And we'll do a, you know, a recap and a tranche at 950," 'cause they were gonna sell one of their assets.  And that would go and be the second tranche.  And then midway through, we said, "Well, let's not sell it.  Let's do a leveraged recap."  And then, you know, and then at that point, they said, "Well, let's do a bigger fund."  I said, "No, let's cap it at a billion 'cause I had some real tough terms in that first deal."  And I was like, "I need to get to market terms 'cause this thing's gonna choke us (laughter)," you know what I mean?  So that's why I capped the first one at a billion dollars.  We ended up investing 890 million and made about 3.4 times the money on that $890 million.
Speaker 2: Wow, so the terms, so when were you were saying it was important to meet those terms?  That's what, I mean--what was critical for you to meet those terms?  I mean to be successful in meeting the terms?
Speaker 1: We had to have companies that could return well over eight percent annually for the period of time that we invested in those businesses, principal.
Speaker 2: And your average investment length was how long?
Speaker 1: Well, 4.7 years, but some of those investments were nine and ten years ultimately, had to sell--you know, and that's when the--and it was, went until the last company was sold, which happened last year in 2014.  That's when the last company was sold.  And that one, we held on, I think it was for eight and a half years.  So it was, they were tough terms 'cause if you think about it, at some point in time, some of those businesses, that--you know, once you make the improvements taken from the mid-teens EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] to 40 or 50 percent EBITDA, if there's no growth, you compound eight percent, it's gonna catch up with you.  And all of a sudden, you're in clawback mode, and you're paying money back.  You see what I mean?  And they had a little thing called the veto, so they actually could veto every deal that I did.  So they could say, you know what?  You're gonna sell this company, and then I'm paying 'em eight percent on the money that's invested forever, forever.  And that would clawback everything that ever been put in that GP set-aside and every dollar I'd ever made 'cause I actually cross guaranteed that.  Tough terms.  And you gotta decide if you gotta enough confidence, and can you build a structure to go after that.  And I said, if I don't do that, if I don't take this risk and try this, how am I gonna feel about myself twenty years later 'cause I could a stayed at Goldman [Sachs].  I was getting paid extremely well.  I was in the top of my class.  I was getting well-compensated, compensated at levels, two levels above where I was and lived a fine life.  But I wanted to try this.  "You are enough."  "Discover the joys of figuring things out", right.  And with my guys, I said, "Let's go try this.  And let's not just try.  Let's figure out what it is that we want to do."  You know what we decided that we were gonna do?  Be the best investors of our generation.  That was our goal.  So far, we're meeting that goal.  We just named the top private equity fund in the world for the first ten years that we've been in existence.  That's a heck of a feat.
Story_ID: 624700
Speaker 1: With your employees, did you have to pay them more or guarantee them more.  I'm just asking as a--
Speaker 2: They, they absolutely, you know, originally--everyone laughs at private equity, "Oh, you guys make a bunch of money two and twenty" and all that sort of stuff.  I didn't have this two percent management fee.  I had a budget.  Every year I had to come up with a budget and had to get it approved by my limited partner.  It was not market terms.  But the carry, my guys, I know their carry was higher than other people in their position.  But you weren't gonna make carry until we were profitable on our deals.  So here it is, okay, you're gon' starve a little bit, but when we make these bigger deals, you're gon' make a little bit more than others might in your position.  That's the nature of risk and return.  But now, you've got them focused on what's important which is returning money to the investors, not management fee.  We've never been management fee-focused.  I think that's one of the differentiating features of our culture.  My folks don't argue.  All of us make the same salary, partners.  And it's a lot relative to the average American, no question.  But we make our money on carry.  And as the senior executive of the company, I take our excess--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: When you say carry, carry (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Carry is profits.
Speaker 1: Profits.
Speaker 2: When we sell a business, there's a certain amount of profit.  We get a percentage of that profit, and the rest goes back to our limited partners. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So how long did--so you're saying--was, did it take four years then, the first four years?
Speaker 1: No.  We didn't make our first profitable deal, in terms of when we sold it, seven, eight, nine years from after we started the firm.  Our average right now is 4.7 years, but this is fifteen years later (laughter), yeah.  I mean that was, those first early years, you know, first you go through a big tech bust in 2000, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Oh, and remember in 2007 and 2008--
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: --the big financial crisis, remember that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 624701
Speaker 1: Now, our EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] increased 47 percent over that period of time showing the robust nature of our model, okay.  And we're in a position to make great investments then because now, we had shown what we've done.  We've raised additional capital and we're making great advance--and we had a system for creating value in those businesses.  But it's investing.  And investing to me--and I tell our limited partner, investing isn't just putting money into companies.  It's investing in your people and your infrastructure.  That's why you have a whole group that's responsible for what we call the, you know, the transformation engine of a business.  You know, all these little seventy VSOPs [Vista standard operating procedures], I've got groups, subject matter experts that focus on going into the companies and implementing those changes and creating value in those businesses.  And it's investing in your senior executives, teaching them this, helping them understand why this model works and then giving them the opportunity implement it, not only at that company but at the next company.  So the hundred or so senior managers who've worked with us over the last fifteen years, 60 percent them are on their second, third, fourth or fifth company with us.  That's investing to me.
Speaker 2: I see.  So you would take someone from one company and put them in another company--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Once we train them.
Speaker 2: Once--I see.
Speaker 1: Let me, want me to give you my--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --my stump speech (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if it's your stump speech, but I'm trying to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, it's just a--
Speaker 2: --to understand--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, this is what I tell my limited partners, okay.  I'm a collector of watches.  Okay, this one's a gift, right.  It's a beautiful, fine Swiss watch, multiple complications in it.  If I said to you, go find the 20 smartest people you know.  I'm gonna leave my watch with you, and I'm gonna come back one year from now.  And if you can make a watch that's just like mine, give it to me, you and those twenty people, I'll give you each a million dollars and pay your taxes on it.  Nine times out of ten, you wouldn't be able to do that.  But I gave, if I gave you that same challenge and then say, here's my watch.  Let me do my test, my aptitude tests, personality tests on everybody you know, and let me pick the twenty smartest people you know--and they're not likely gonna be all the same.  You may get some of 'em, right, but I will tell you who the twenty smartest people are that you know.  I'm gonna bring them in this room, and I'm gonna give 'em that watch.  And now, I'm gonna say, I don't want you to make this watch.  I'm gonna pick one of them out and say I just want you to make this one gear.  Here's what it looks like.  Here's the blank you're gonna make that gear out of.  I'm gonna put the lathe and the cutting materials in that other room.  Here's a twenty-nine-step booklet with pictures on how you make that gear.  Here's a telephone number to fifteen other people who work for me in my organization, who make that exact same gear at another company.  You're gonna call them, and they're gonna call you.  And twice a year, I'm gonna make you get in this room and talk about how you make that one gear better.  Guess what happens?  You're gonna become an expert gear maker, aren't you?  And I'm gon' take the next person and have them make another gear, and the next one to make a rocker arm and the next one to make a spring.  And then I'm gon' put the two gears together and the rocker arm and the spring together, and what am I gonna get?  I'm gonna get movement.  And I'm gon' put the movements together.  I'm a get a complication.  I'm a put the complication together, and I'm gonna get a watch.  That's what we do at Vista [Equity Partners, LLC] that's so different.  That's private equity three dot 0 [3.0], okay.  It is enabling your management teams to be highly effective creators of value consistently, every single time, not relying and hoping that they know what they're doing.  Teaching them, proven processes on how to run, functionally, a software business.  And when you lay that on top of a 95 percent gross margin business that has 97 percent conversion from EBITDA to cash flow, with high recurring revenues, multi-year contracts, guess what happens?  You create a Vista machine.  And that's what we do.  The first seven years was spent teaching my team what this is, how this is, how we do it and actually going in.  And they do that work.  The next seven years was now expanding from us doing it to a VCG organization of seventy and over a hundred executives.  And now I got seventy, you know, deal professionals working with those two groups to now find those companies, put together the transformation plan, implement and put the solutions across it, and get the management teams who manage, and then as you become an expert gear maker or rocker arm maker, I take you out of that company and move you to a new company that we just bought.
Speaker 2: So you have a trusted team--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And then the fly-wheel effect.
Speaker 2: You have a trusted team.  That doesn't--
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: --that doesn't happen a lot in the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] business.
Speaker 1: It may not, but I've only lost two senior people in fifteen years, only parted ways with two senior people in 1fifteen5 years.
Speaker 2: So how did you know how to do that?  That's what I'm saying.  You're talking about, I had to train my people in the first--but--
Speaker 1: What's the most successful investment bank that you can think about in the world, ever, in the history of investment banking?
Speaker 2: Gold--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Goldman [Sachs Group, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Goldman, that's what I was gonna--so you took the Goldman--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Goldman, if you think about it, every single partner for decades all grew up there.  You look at the United States Navy.  Every single person grew up there.  If you look at high performance organizations, across the planet, stand back and be a student of those high-performance organizations, they typically have their founding people and all the successors started there.  And like I tell my people, I never taught them the bad habit of losing money gracefully.  That's culture.  So you have built that culture of reliability, of dependability, of reliance on each other.  And like I tell our folks, the only people we can rely on is each other.  So if we can't make this critical factor for a success under our control, if we can't make this investment work, relying just on what we know and what we know how to do, we're not gonna make that investment.  Now, that has probably kept us from doing, you know, companies doing 10X and 20X and 30X 'cause somebody took a risk and said, you know what?  Uber.  Why not?  Had Uber [Technologies, Inc.] come across my desk, we'd have absolutely said, no, ten years ago.  Come across my desk now 'cause we understand capacity, planning software and other--hum, different deal.  And, in fact, we take some of that methodology and think about it in the context of everything we do, capacity, planning, which is one of the reasons we bought companies like TIPCO [Technologies, Inc.], real-time information systems for publishing and subscribe type models.
Story_ID: 624702
Speaker 1: So in those first seven to nine years, what were the things, what one thing or two things did you made--that you did wrong or that you had regrets about or were learning, significant learnings--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Hah, there's only, you know, I tell everybody, you know, we've only lost money--we've never lost money on a buy-out deal ever.  But I gave you a little bit of the story on, theoretically, why this works.  So twice, way back then, not a lot of money, out of our $15 billion, $38 million, I had conversations once with a venture capitalist [VC], very well respected, one of the largest in the world, explained this.  And I said, that sounds great.  We got a company this will work for, and why don't we do it together.  You guys come in as an investor, and we'll bring another investor.  We'll do a third, a third, a third, and we'll do this.  Said, great.  And we took that company and made it profitable and got it growing.  And now the same VC came back to me and said--two years later, said, you know, I need this to save one of my funds, so I can no longer follow this model.  I gotta go to the VC, VC model and take all our cash and plow it into sales and try to make this thing a homerun.  Otherwise, I can't raise money in my new fund, and I got outvoted, two to one, 'cause there's two VC's versus us.  Only time.  Now, the company's still out there.  We're getting money back and it's not written off.  I've written it off completely, but, you know, it's still out there, and, okay.  That's one thing I did wrong.  So that's why we don't do those sort of deals anymore.
Speaker 1: I see, and, okay, so what about the capacity building--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --the, handling the growth that came as a result?
Speaker 2: All still from the bottom's up.  Well, for the most part.  I just hired one other--we've hired one senior person seven years ago to co-head our Chicago [Illinois] office, hired another one to be part of our, our foundation fund, and just hired another one from another firm.  But now, we've got enough mass underneath to train them effectively.  But by and large, every single person who makes, you know, VP and partner at Vista [Equity Partners, LLC], starts as an associate.  My number two in command started as an associate, every one of 'em, number three, my guy who runs our credit fund and our hedge fund started as an associate at Vista.  And you come up through the ranks and you learn this craft.  You learn your trade, and you become an expert at it.  Critical factors for success under our control is you're gonna be an expert at this before you advance in our company.
Story_ID: 624703
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about some of your most significant deals.
Speaker 2: Okay, I think one of the most significant, Aspect's [Aspect Software, Inc.] one, is an interesting one.  Ventyx [Energy, LLC] is an interesting one.  There's a bunch of 'em, but I, you know, in terms of--you know, one of the reasons I like Ventyx, it tells a very interesting narrative.  Ventyx, we ultimately sold to ABB [Group], made about five times our money on it.
Speaker 1: So, you bought it at what?
Speaker 2: No, so that's why it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the first piece of that was a company called MBSI which was a publicly-traded company in Toronto [Canada] on the Toronto Stock Exchange, actually based in Western Canada.  And it basically was software that's used in the utility systems business.  So you know when the power pole goes down, somebody has to say, well, what guys on what trucks have the right materials to go get to that power pole and fix it.  Okay, so it's a services type business, but software.  We bought that company, okay, took it private for $46 million.  And then there was a publicly-traded company in the U.S. called (NDES?).  (NDES?) actually had a different sort (unclear) when it's long, you call it, you know, long cycle and short cycle.  Short cycle is stuff that happens in a day.  Long cycle is, you know, the, you know, your cable guy, you know, you book it three days later.  He's gonna come between the hours of noon and four o'clock.  I'm not responsible if he came at five o'clocl, but, you know (laughter), that sort of stuff.  But also, in terms of maintenance and for utilities, okay.  So maintenance and so if you have a utility, you got generating assets.  You now have to perform maintenance on 'em.  Sometimes you gotta change out the pump or the capacitor or whatever.  Well, how do you actually have those--there has to be systems.  You gotta lock this out first, turn this left, do this before you do this, and then you have to go backward in order to get it back up and running.  Well, that works, you know, any time you're doing maintenance, you should have those sort of steps for safety reasons and doing it right.  So they had that kind of software.  So we merged those two.  Then we added another couple of, one piece out of Siemens [AG], and another couple of add-on acquisitions.  So over the course of four years, basically, we put five companies together, okay.  Now, why this is significant because doing that we actually aggregated and built the largest independent utility software company in the world.  And we took a company that was basically break even, losing money to doing, you know, 25 [percent] going to 40 [percent], going to 50 percent EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] margins.  And it was run by, so that one of our first deals was a company called SourceNet [Solutions], and the two founders and principals of that business, once we sold that company, we made 2.6 times our money, we had then run Ventyx.  Over that four-year period of time, created a business that we then sold to ABB for $1.2 billion.  It made basically a billion dollars in profit.  Those two principals--this is why this is interesting, Vince Burkett who was a CEO back at SourceNet, became the CEO there, and Bret Bolin, who was the CFO at SourceNet became CFO there.  Vince is now a operating partner at Vista and Bret has managed five companies for us and now is on the board of the sixth and will likely come back as an operating partner later.  That's an excellent story.  And it's not just the story of how we put these businesses together but also invested in these managers, and also built this VCG engine below to help, you know, do the construction, but also out of that we have about six managers who came out of their tutelage who now run other companies of ours.  That's how that market, or that's how our model works.  And that's how we get leverage in our model.  So while not our highest returning deal at five times cash-on-cash, not a bad one, top in the world, okay, it demonstrates what Vista's about, operational improvement, excellence in execution, development of talent, high returns and an expansion of our network.
Story_ID: 624704
Speaker 1: So can you give me, can you give three, three other descriptions of deals that you think are illustrative of Vista?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You mentioned A, A--
Speaker 2: Aspect [Software, Inc.]?
Speaker 1: Right, Aspect.
Speaker 2: I bring Aspect up because it was an early deal where we--
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: Aspect, 2006, and then I think we got out in 2008, okay.  And Aspect was interesting because it was a publicly-traded company that wasn't for sale, and they didn't wanna sell.
Speaker 1: So how did you--
Speaker 2: We bought a PIPE, which is a private investment in a public entity.  And we only bought $50 million and it was a hundred million dollar market cap, so $150 million post money.  This was a business that basically was a, was the pioneer way back when in what are called "contact centers".  So you've seen these big phone banks of people, you know, you call American Express and someone needs to answer the phone, and so, "Oh, may I help you?"  And then give me your card number.  That's a contact center.  You put some information in, they pull up your account, and they can be helpful to you, hopefully, right (laughter) over some (unclear).  That's a contact.  So they were one of the pioneers in that space.  It was a publicly-traded company that had been losing, you know, declining sales over the last three or four years, was, you know, unprofitable.  And we went in and invested $50 million, but I said, we're gonna have to have a couple of things.  One, is operational control, control over the operational budget, control over the hiring and firing of the senior management team, control over, you know, the issuance of equity and debt.  So in essence, control the business, but not actually control the business.  So it remained public during that period of time.  We then went in and started implementing our VSOPs, our standard operating procedures in transforming that business across a whole host of, you know, functional areas from sales to support, to pricing, to product development, etc.  And in that short period of time, ultimately, over two years, being the short period of time, made the transformation and sold that business for five times our invested capital in that period of time, okay.  Why that one is significant, it was early on, as one of the earlier proof points of our model.  We could do it in a shorter period of time in a public entity, okay.  And that's why that deal was significant in that context.  And I'm trying to hit significant deals, significant for a specific, you know, specific and different reasons.  So that gives you a sense for why that deal was, was significant in that--
Speaker 1: How did you end up taking that investment position?  Was that--that seemed to be--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was a negotiated position.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Negotiated through a banker.
Speaker 1: Did someone else bring--did the bank bring the deal to you?
Speaker 2: We knew about the company.  The banker, I think it was Thomas Weisel Partners at the time, started advising 'em, and so we ended up prevailing in the, in the conservations behind that deal.
Story_ID: 624705
Speaker 1: You know, another one similar--I'll take another Silicon Valley [California] company, SumTotal [Systems, LLC], okay.  And this SumTotal was in the learning management space, in the learning management and compliance space.  So, for instance, you know, Walmart [Stores, Inc.] was one of their customers, to give you an example, and at Walmart, you know, they have two million employees.  They have pretty high turnover, those employees, 'cause a lot of 'em are short term.  Well, how does a Walmart employee learn how to stock the shelf or clean the bathroom or, you know, or run the cash register.  Well, they take classes.  They take basically on-line classes which are taught through learning management systems.  And most companies use learning management systems for that.  Or if you're gonna, you know, if you've got an offshore oil rig, how do you make sure that the person who goes out there has the right compliance statistics and knows what to do in certain circumstances so you don't have oil spills.  Learning management systems are, are huge in big businesses and this was one of the largest in the world.  Well, this was a classic, public company, learning management system, and we had, you know, talked and looked at the company and said, you know, we, we like this company quite a bit.  But we were rebuffed by the management team.  So we then took a position in the company, bought stock, and then said, we'll see how they do.  Well, they didn't do so well.  It was continuing to decline.  And so then we went and said, we'd like to buy the company.  And they said, ah, well, guess what?  We're not gon' sell it to you.  We're gonna sell it to these other people, Accel-KKR.  Okay, let's see how that works out for you, right.  Well, as they started that process, now, you realize--and I'm saying this factiously, I've done more hostile raid defenses and hostile raids than anybody in Silicon Valley probably at this point.  So, not surprisingly, as we tactically execute on this, we prevailed and bought the company.
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was 2009, I think was when we actually bought that one.  And we just sold it 2012 for a little over three times our money, okay, and did some add-on investments, etc.  We then took that business, okay, relocated a bunch of those operations to Gainesville, Florida 'cause they had an office there, 'cause it was a much more stable workforce.  You know, you didn't have the Silicon Valley effect of high turnover.  We took one of our senior people, you know, from Oracle, Nadeem Syed, and made him the CEO, brought in a second in command and made him the C--you know, the COO, ran that business, took Nadeem off, and now he runs one of our business--biggest companies, Misys, which is the large corp-banking, treasury management, risk management, software companies in the world in London [England].  He runs that.  And the number two in command, we then sold the business, and now he's running one of our businesses, PowerSchool [Group, LLC], Hardeep, okay, Gulati [Hardeep Gulati].  So that's another example of what I call the deal-making expertise of Vista, taking a public company private when they didn't necessarily wanna sell it to us, right.  So, public to private, did some add-on acquisitions, relocated a big part of the business to Gainesville, Florida, put our senior management in there, trained that senior managers.  When Nadeem got expert at it, moved him over to become part of Misys--and I'll hit the Misys story in a second, okay.  Hardeep became the number two, sold that business, and now, Hardeep is back to run one of our companies, PowerSchool, which we just bought two weeks ago, so his first day on the job was two weeks ago, network effect again, okay.  Expert in transactions, experts in transformation, okay, building out our network of expertise in, you know, the transformation process and enabling our management teams to be effective so they can now go do other things with us in that context, and still make a handsome return, top one percent return for our limited partners.
Story_ID: 624706
Speaker 1: So Misys is an interesting company, publicly-traded company that's been around a long time, and, you know, I probably had my first meeting with them back in '02 [2002] because they had a bunch of different businesses.  We got our first business out of Misys which was Sunquest [Information Systems, Inc.], and we bought Sunquest in 2010, which was a division of Misys, and they actually were the largest enterprise software company for lab systems for hospitals in the world.  So if you had a 400-bed hospital, you were likely using Misys.  So what is a lab system for a hospital?  Well, the way Western medicine works typically is, you're not feeling well.  You go see your doctor.  Your doctor takes something out of you, blood, some tissue samples, something and sends it to a lab.  Well, somehow that sample has to get broken up into smaller components and put on different analytical pieces of equipment, you know, liquid chromatography or gas chromatography group equipment, to test it.  And then that data has to get reassembled to your clinical file for your clinician to look at, and then they're gonna decide to take something else out of you or put something else in you and then retest you, right.  Take a part out or put some drugs in or whatever (laughter), right.  That's how it works.  And about 85 percent of the clinical decisions are done that way.  This is the system that when it gets to that lab, keeps track of that sample, and when it gets on this piece of equipment, you know, all that little pieces of data get reassembled back into your clinical file, right?  That's what that stuff does.  So we bought that company.  That company had been declining in sales for five years when we bought it, and when we bought it, it was doing about 147 million in revenues and $46 billion in EBITDA, so 30 percent EBITDA margins which for enterprise software companies, looks pretty good.  But for knowing a mission critical, business critical, enterprise software business, clearly was not running as well as it could.  We bought that business and over the next four years, in a set, in essence--I'll skip all the details, transformed that organization so that when, the time when we sold that business to Roper Industries, it was doing 200 million in revenues and a $120 million in EBITDA.
Speaker 2: So you sold it in 2010?
Speaker 1: Two thousand thirteen [2013], right, okay.  So that's a business that we transformed over really four years to be effective in what we do.  And Richard Atkin, who ran that business when we bought it and ran it when we sold it--sold it in early 2014, but anyway, when we, when we sold that business, he now runs VCG [Vista Consulting Group] for me now, okay.  Kathy Yaley [ph.] who was a CFO at the time, now sits on the board of two of our other firm--our other companies, and I think we have three or four of his executives that run other businesses or parts of other businesses for us today, okay.  So that's how that works.
Story_ID: 624707
Speaker 1: So--now, getting back to the other part of Misys, two years later or a year later--no, two years after we bought Sunquest or three years after we bought Sunquest [Information Systems, Inc.], we then bought, through Thompson Reuters, a business called Turaz and Turaz is one of the risk management software companies out there for banks.   Thompson Reuters was divesting their software businesses and focusing on data.  Well, what was left out of Misys 'cause a sold a couple other businesses, it was the holding company, you know, sold Allscripts [Healthcare Solutions] and some others, was their corp-banking and treasury management business.  And so, through again, tactical execution of a U.K. [United Kingdom] publicly-listed company, we were able to buy Misys and merge it with Turaz and then create the largest global banking software business.  And that's Misys.
Speaker 2: That's the new Misys.
Speaker 1: That's the new Misys.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not your grandfather's old Misys.  And now that business is doing a billion in revenues and just under, it's $400-plus million in EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization].  That should return all of Fund IV, that one deal.
Speaker 2: And Fund, so wait, Fund I was 350--
Speaker 1: It's really roman numeral II.  There is not roman numeral I, believe it or not, because--remember the family.  They wanted to make a Roman Numeral I that had a bunch of assets they had already bought.  Roman Numeral II was the fresh money.  So that's our first fund.
Speaker 2: And so that fund was how many?
Speaker 1: A billion.
Speaker 2: A billion?
Speaker 1: Invested $890 million.  Fund III was $1.3 billion.  Fund IV was $3.5 billion, Fund V is $5 billion.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that Fund IV, 3.5, is that the fund that I read that you were trying to raise 3.5, but you closed at five?  No--
Speaker 1: That's Fund V.
Speaker 2: That's Fund V.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Fund IV, I put 2 billion on the cover and raised 3.5 and actually, Fund V, I put 3.5 billion on the cover, raised 5.88, but it's really six, but anyway.  That's--
Speaker 2: And is that typical, the--I mean that you would over rank, I mean when did the--
Speaker 1: We, our funds are three to four times oversubscribed now because of our returns.
Story_ID: 624708
Speaker 1: So has anyone looked at skeptically and say, "What's under the hood" or--
Speaker 2: Everybody looks at us skeptically, and say "What's under the hood?"  Where do they think the whole due diligence is for these LPs [limited partners]?  I've got--where it started from one LP, I've now got 158, and every single one of 'em, does the due diligence and skeptically looks under the hood.  But, that's why you do a 180 deals and pick one, look at one.  We'll talk about it, and look at it, and you can make your own assessment.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, I had asked the question during the, you know, when we were off, about intellectual property because IP is extremely important with software because it's what--I mean are R&D--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --well, I don't know if they do.  But that, that is extremely important.  So how do you protect your intellectual property?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you have to.  There's different levels of intellectual property.  There is an intellectual property around Vista [Equity Partners, LLC].  These VSOP's, Vista Standard Operating Procedures.  So there's over seventy of 'em, right, these best practices.  And so if you start off, there's--first, there's a way you do it.  So if you start off as a sales manager for one of our companies, you don't have access to all 70.  You only have access to the VSOP's that pertain to your area.  You see the point?  And if you're an LP and you come in, and you say, I wanna do due diligence, fine.  Come on in.  Robert, send me a copy of your VSOP's.  No, come on to Austin [Texas], and you can stay as long as you want and sit in this room for years if you want to and read it all, but you can't take any copies with you.  And then we'll walk you through how it works and you can spend time with executives.  You see the point.  So you protect the things that are valuable in that context.  And all that is still intellectual, proprietary and confidential information that belongs to Vista.
Speaker 1: Have you had any people that have tried to use what you, you know, or stolen or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, of course, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you see it, you see people all the time as they are trying to steal the Vista Playbook and some of 'em try to do it by poaching our employees who are, you know, running one of our companies.  And they try to do it when, you know, when we sold the company, and that employee--and we can't hire that employee 'cause we have a non-solicit, non-hire, and they'll go after 'em while we can't hire 'em.  Yeah.  It's the nature of competition.
Speaker 1: Okay, but after all this time in the business, aren't there other copycats and people who are--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They don't do it this way.  See, the good news about enterprise software and software in general, it's a big industry.  And you can make money in this industry different ways.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: We just happen to have a very systemic way of doing it that limits our losses and, you know, gives us, you know, reasonable assurances and upside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 624709
Speaker 1: Where do you go from here then?
Speaker 2: Constantly innovate.
Speaker 1: How do you constantly innovate?
Speaker 2: We, like, for instance, in VCG [Vista Consulting Group, LLC], I've got a data team, and, you know, installing and getting that data team to think about how do we take the second order effect of software which is data and create new products around that data that we can sell to our customers, to our customers' customers and then people who want to know information about our customers.  You see what I mean?  You take Uber [Technologies, Inc.].  What is Uber?  We keep talking about a capacity planning tool, but really it's data.  It's organizing data, unstructured and structured data in a way that's useful to a person standing on the street who needs a ride and useful to a person who is, who has a car, who would like to offer a ride to.  And there's also information around, well, how you pay and the credit card and how--well, okay.  Then there's all that data and information.  Well, if you think about it, every business that has software liberates data, okay.  And you actually take that data and put it into a product format that is useful and valuable to someone else that you can now sell that to.  So that's the next wave of where we go at Vista, right.  So, innovation in terms of helping our companies be more effective in their product development cycles.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where does that, is that synonymous, what you just said with big data and the way things are going or is that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, some kind--you know, like all things, big data.  What's big data?  It's a whole lotta information out there.  Ninety percent of the data out there in the world has been created in the last two years, but can you harness it and use it and is it helpful to you?  Most executives will tell you, there's too much information out there for me to be actionable.  So, part of what we need to do is create information that's helpful and actionable to the executive, but also to the customer.  That's the focus.  So get something that's effective to the customer, that's actionable to them in a way that makes the producer of that data a more reliable source so that customer continues to go to them.
Story_ID: 624710
Speaker 1: So, I, I wanna also understand your offices.  So you start out in the Bay Area [California]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right.  When does Chicago [Illinois] come on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Two thousand and eight [2008].
Speaker 1: When does Austin [Texas] come--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Two thousand and nine [2009].
Speaker 1: Those were bad years.
Speaker 2: For who?
Speaker 1: I mean for (laughter), for the rest of the world.
Speaker 2: But it's a good time to buy, isn't it?
Speaker 1: It is a good time to buy.
Speaker 2: See, that's the interesting thing.  A lot of people don't realize it.  During the great economic crisis is the best time to buy assets.
Speaker 1: If you have cash.
Speaker 2: If you have cash.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And so you had--
Speaker 2: --I'm in the business of raising funds and having cash, (laughter) being in a position to buy companies, right.  Now, I can't say, it's, you know, again, it's not a function of our cyclicality and why we're successful is our systems that actually work.  But, you know, you have to rel--you know, have resolve in who you are and what you do.  And like I said, our EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] increased by 40 per--47 percent across our portfolio companies during 2008, 2009, 2010 because we do those things that we do.
Speaker 1: But are--you're in New York [City, New York] also, right?
Speaker 2: No, I, I spend probably 20 percent of my time or less in New York, but that's because 80 percent of my LPs have offices in New York.  And I--LP's, limited partners, our investors, and, of course, they want to see me and from a fundraising perspective.
Story_ID: 624711
Speaker 1: So how have you handled all this growth?  I mean, you know, like, you know, I guess the, the elbow years were like the first seven to nine years, you're, des--you know, describing.  I would assume that the team got honed during that time period.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, but what--where do you go from here, and--
Speaker 2: Onward and upward.
Speaker 1: But, I mean someone would say Steve Jobs was onward and upward, and some people, like--take you, take Oracle, Oracle is--Oracle grew by acquisition.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they're your number one competitor.  But they also--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They're also in a monopoly.  There's a difference, right.  We get to operate in alagopoloies when we're lucky, right.  We have to constantly innovate from a product perspective across our entire portfolio, period.  So I have create tools so that our executives and product managers can constantly innovate.  We, as a firm, have to constantly expand our opportunity set from private equity to credit, you know, public equity, right.  So we have to provide more of that opportunity.  My job for my people is to provide what I call an opportunity for them to become their best selves, right, which means some of my top executives, I now have split up and have a foundation fund.  Start with one fund, and if we get bigger, the one fund starts to do bigger deals.  Well, do you leave those small deals behind?  No, you start a smaller fund.  It does the exact same thing.  That's foundation fund.  Take my two, two of my senior guys and have 'em run that foundation fund.  Deals get bigger, foundation fund.  Now, should I split that 'cause I'm thinking about, into another foundation fund on the growth equity funds.  So now, I do growth equity and Foundation Fund I and II and the big firm does bigger companies 'cause now market capture growing bigger, of software companies 'cause people are realizing how valuable they are.  In addition, when I first started Vista [Equity Parters, LLC], you couldn't put credit, debt on a software company.  Now, you can get seven times EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization].  So why not create a credit fund and create--and return that back to your investors.  Now, you got a credit fund.  Oh, by the way, because of our infrastructure, we see more and know more about what's happening in the environment of enterprise software, so why not create a public equity fund that just trades on public equity?  You see.  So it's building out products even within Vista so that we can become a broader asset manager within our space.  So we can serve our LPs [limited partners] more effective.  They can put more capital to work with a higher return, with a relative lower risk because of the way our platform is built.  That's where we go with Vista as a product side of the house.
Speaker 1: So that's Vista as a product side.  What about Vista on the investors' side.  Okay, is there a difference?
Speaker 2: In terms of number of investors?  Or, what do you mean?
Speaker 1: No, I meant you're talking about on the product side.
Speaker 2: When I say products, and we can offer that to our investors--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So, now, we have a private equity product, a credit product.  We have a private equity big product and private equity small product.  We have a private equity growth product.  We have a, a credit product.  We have a public equity product that our investors who now say I want--they wanna put a billion dollars with Vista and divide it up these ways.  You see what I mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, you know, the only thing--and I know what you do is totally different from what Ariel Investments does.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: There's no comparison--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --he's public.
Speaker 1: Oh, he's public.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he, he often talks about how he created his competition.  And I'm saying, so, in all of this, you're not, you're not creating competition that's going to impact your business.
Speaker 2: I hope not.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, you--there's a lot of competitors out there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I mean people see the returns that us and others are making in software, and so everybody says, oh, well, I'm gonna be a software investor for a while, and while all boats are being, you know, NASDAQ is hitting its highs again, and, you know, software companies are now, you know, the new, new thing.  Well, everybody's gonna start to think that they can go invest in software.  And they'll start to put money against it.
Story_ID: 624712
Speaker 1: What would be very significant for your organization [Vista Equity Partners, LLC], you know, for the company to do, like that would take you to the next (unclear) level--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I just sold a piece of Vista to a investor group to help establish what I now call permanent capital.
Speaker 1: And who was that investor?
Speaker 2: Dial, Dial Capital [Management, LLC] ran the deal basically.  They're part of Neuberger Berman.  I sold basically 10 percent in primary shares and some secondary shares, okay.  And the point was, now, we have balance sheet capital.  I can invest more across my infrastructure, invest more in some deals.  You know, this is our money, right.  You know, me and the partners' money basically, and invest in building out our teams to be more effective and grow, you know, with a little more robust nature.  You see what I mean?
Speaker 1: So essentially--yeah.  What you're saying is that before you would always have to raise the funds.  Now, you have a permanent--
Speaker 2: There's a piece of it.  It's--I still have to raise funds, but now we have the ability to put more money in each one of the deals that's our own money as opposed to investors' money.  And we get a percentage of profits.  Remember I talked about the LPs get this much return, and we get this much.  Well, now, we get to be part of, participate in this, okay--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --with our own capital, right.  So that's an advantage on that side.  But what it really does is give me investment capital to now build out my teams, make VCG [Vista Consulting Group] bigger and more effective, build out my credit team, build out my private equi--my public equity team and the private equity teams so we can compete more effectively and actually garner more of what I call market share opportunity, okay.  Now, when you talk about what's the next new thing.  True permanent capital.  Call it a hundred year capital.  Ultimately, the nirvana for me--Oracle is a wonderful model, but it's public.  If Oracle were private, it'd be one of the best businesses on the planet if you owned it.  So why not take Vista and make it a private Oracle, multiple verticals, tremendous amount of revenue in reach and growth.  You basically, you know--we've been able to create our business model which actually isn't effected by recessions (unclear), recession-proof and the ability to generate tremendous amounts of cash and have a return on invested capital annual between 30 and 60 percent kind of forever, right.  But you need a significant amount of capital to do that at scale.  We could do that in a small way today, but at scale.  And so that's kind of the nirvana.  Now, when I get there, and that's a good place to say, okay, let me just focus all my time on philanthropic activities 'cause then that thing--I don't have to worry about it so, so much.  Investors understand.  They're getting a nice hefty return.  My people have a great place to enjoy and work, work hard and develop things and come up with new products and that's a neat place to be.
Story_ID: 624713
Speaker 1: People always say that 'cause it's catchy, untraditional hires.  What I look for is smart people, period, who wanna work.  And when you think about traditional hires in enterprise software, people thinking, oh, they gotta come from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], or Stanford [University, Stanford, California] or Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] or Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  That's traditional hiring in enterprise software, right.  Well, there's a whole bunch of smart people out there who just didn't have the opportunity to go to Stanford and Cal-Tech and MIT and Cornell.  But does that mean that they shouldn't have an opportunity to be a good, strong programmer?  Okay, well, no.  You know, I think about--we talked about my background.  There's a whole bunch of guys I grew up with who wouldn't and didn't get a job at Bell Labs who would be great programmers 'cause they're smart and organized, and they know how to think.  Well, how do you figure that out?  Well, way back in the day, fifty-something years ago, forty-something years ago, this group called IBM were starting to have data processors.  So remember back in the day when you wanted to do payroll, you had to bring all the payroll slips in, and you go to this time-sharing organization.  And somebody had to type all that stuff in and create these little punch cards.  And they figured out that if they could find people who were effective at recognizing fact patterns, said, wait a minute, I saw this pattern, you know, ten slides ago or twenty slides ago, whatever it is, go back in (unclear).  It was a much more efficient way to processing things.  So, they created a data processing aptitude test that they used to figure out who was gon' work at IBM.  Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio], and Johnson and Johnson used that same test as long--as well as a number of large organizations.  And now, over time, it came out a favorite for whatever reason, PC, whatever it was.  I don't know.  Well, we have adopted the methodology.  We've modified the test and done some different things to it, but basically, it's that.  And so what I look for is scouring the world for the smartest people who will be effective in an enterprise software company.  So the last three years, we had over a million people apply to jobs at Vista [Equity Partners, LLC] companies.  I've got 38,000 employees or so, okay, worldwide.  We tested over 300,000, and we hired about 14,000 through that test.  Now, remember I, we were talking about you making a watch, remember the watch example we talked about a little while ago?  And I said, you can go get the twenty smartest people you think you know, and I'm gonna test everybody you do know and tell you who the twenty smartest people actually are.  And I'll take them and I'd need to know that they're the sort of people to work in this kind of environment.  And I'll use those people to do this work because smart people at the end of the day, I tease 'em, smart people are lazy.  They don't wanna do the same mundane thing over and over.  They're gon' come up with a better system, and it's gonna be more efficient where you have to fix it once.  We call those engineered solutions.  You fix it once, and it's fixed forever.  Well, that's what software is.  You want somebody who fixes it once, and it's fixed forever because if you fix software forever, you have fewer bugs.  You have fewer bugs, then you need--you get fewer calls.  You have fewer calls, then you have less people in your support organization; less people in the support organization, you can plow that money in development.  And you can build more products and develop it faster and help your customers make more money, all that sort of stuff.  You see what I mean?  That's the nature of what that--that's just one of the VSOPs [Vista Standard Operating Procedures].  I got seventy of 'em (laughter), right.  That's just one that helps in creating a systemic efficacy to creating value in a software company.
Story_ID: 624714
Speaker 1: And then what about the minority piece?
Speaker 2: Okay, what'd you like to talk about?
Speaker 1: Well, just--you've said that you've--I mean first of all, on the outside, it's incredible.
Speaker 2: What is?
Speaker 1: I mean what you've been able to do.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 1: Looks totally incredible, totally incredible.  But you have said that, you know, that there is that, the minority, the, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: ---piece that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Let me ask you a question.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: State pension funds, right.  Who are the majority of state workers?
Speaker 1: African Americans.
Speaker 2: Okay, what's the largest state in the union today, by people?
Speaker 1: Is it California?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so their largest fund is CalPERS [California Public Employees' Retirement System], and then there's CalSTRS [California State Teachers' Retirement System], which is teachers.  What's the next largest in your mind?
Speaker 1: New York or Texas--New York, Chicago [Illinois]--.
Speaker 2: Okay, take--
Speaker 1: --Illinois.
Speaker 2: Take Illinois.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And what's the next?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if it's not--New York has to be in there.
Speaker 2: Okay, take New York, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Florida.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Florida, Florida, yes, Florida.
Speaker 2: Michigan.
Speaker 1: Michigan.
Speaker 2: Texas.
Speaker 1: Texas.
Speaker 2: You agree, all big states.
Speaker 1: All big--
Speaker 2: All probably have pretty big pension plans, right.  We don't have any money from CalPERS or CalSTRS, none from the State of Illinois, okay, none from Florida.  I just got my first investment of $50 million from Texas last week, okay, and New York has been great.  They've been a great supporter, New York City and New York State.  Now, you tell me, I don't know, we're the Number One preforming private-equity fund in the world, run by an African American, but I don't have money from the top four states whose principal contributors are African American.  And it isn't as if I haven't called on them multiple times.  We just have to go do our good work and hopefully, over time, they'll recognize that we are worthy of the investment dollars that are being invested on behalf of people who look like me.
Speaker 1: What is the response when you pose it that way?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You just don't--the business doesn't come, investment doesn't come.
Speaker 2: I have to go do my job.  I have to raise money where the money wants to be raised.  And so I'll spend time and raise money in China, in the Middle East, in Korea, in Canada, in the City of New York [New York], in--you get the sense, right, in the State of New York, in the State of Massachusetts, the State of Connecticut.  These are the folks--State of Arizona, yes.  Okay, State of Oregon.  I go where they recognize a strong investor and want their constituencies to be the beneficiaries of an efficient model in a marketplace that will return enough, and, you know, return money for them to live comfortable pension lives, that take care of the teachers and the police officers and the firemen who support that community.  I'm a son of school teachers.  I am happy to be helpful to 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's what people complain--that, that needs to change, really.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: You think.
Speaker 1: No one seems to know the answer, but it's just--
Speaker 2: Especially when you look at some of those states and the returns and some of 'em are actually bankrupt in their pension systems.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But yet they don't put money with the top investor in the world?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I'll leave that to the politicians and I'll leave that to the journalists.  Me, I just gotta go do my day-to-day work.
Speaker 1: I don't think that there's enough knowledge out of it and the public.  I don't think there's enough knowledge of that to make a, you know--and there may be some coalescing that needs to occur, but I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That very well may be true.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, I don't think there is.
Speaker 2: But, you know, I gotta do my day job and part of my day job is also educating some of the younger fund managers so they can be effective and grow, which I do.
Speaker 1: That's fair enough.   So, you, so essentially, you're really trying to also create future Robert--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We have a group of folks, and I spend a lot of time, and I chuckle 'cause a lot of the best performing ones are guys who worked for me when I was at Goldman [Sachs].  They were analyst when I was a staffer.  And they're running some phenomenal firms now.  They're now busting through the multi-billion dollar mark, and I'm excited for 'em.
Story_ID: 624715
Speaker 1: Before you, we started the interview, I was lucky enough to see your property and to talk some about your philanthropy, and I wanted you to talk about that in terms of why it seems to be so much of your core--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and, and how that even came to be.
Speaker 2: It has always been that way.  You have to give, and you have to give the best of yourselves for those who don't have the same opportunity.  You know, and I--we talked earlier in this interview hours ago about I was one of only two of my buddies growing up who had a father in the house.  And the importance of having a resource like a father who could actually impart wisdom, knowledge, information, sometimes a laugh, whatever it is, sometimes a hug.  All those things are important as people are growing up, and understanding that your role and my role is to ensure that, you know, for those who have the desire and the capability, get some opportunity.  And for some of those who, in some cases, like what we do with our wounded veterans here at the ranch, have the opportunity to feel whole and to provide for their families' experiencing and to cook for their families, and to fish with their sons and daughters.  And for the foster kids who we have come here, to have a place that they can spend Christmas when schools are out and they can't be in their dorms, and they can't go to a homeless or don't wanna go to a homeless shelter and no longer can go back to the home 'cause they don't get the, the "parent", quote, unquote, doesn't get the state money or an opportunity for inner-city kids to work with mountain kids here in the summer, where they don't know each other and afraid of each other.  And by the end of the summer, they're the best of friends, and become lifelong friends.  Or to bring a child up here to catch a fish for the first time.  All that is an important part of being a human being and providing an opportunity for others to experience some of the things that shaped me, being in the outdoors, spending time with other people who have similar interests, feeling loved, being a part of the family, being able to take care of somebody, having someone who cares for you, being thanked for providing some freedoms that I know my grandfather [William Smith, Sr.] and my father [William Smith] who both served in the [U.S.] Armed Services and lost uncles and those sort of things, it's important to thank them and give them a place to come with their families.  We had an Anglers of Honor program here this past Saturday, just a couple days ago.  We had twelve families, and I probably saw fifteen kids out there fishing and their fathers out there fishing in the river, and the mothers, some of 'em still nursing some of the kids up at the, at the eco center, and I'm watching the kid's face when he caught his first fish.  I mean there's nothing--you can't replace that.  And you need to give 'em a place to come and people to train and help them, and for them to have fun 'cause, you know, they do a great service.  It's a challenging world out there and our Armed Services people, I mean it's hard, (unclear) it's hard.  And then there's kids who are coming up without parents and all that's important.  So I had the good fortune of growing up with two parents in my household for most of the time, growing up, in a community that cared, that if Ms. Busby [ph.] saw me doing something, she'd call my mom, and I get a spanking when I got home, so I kind of was on my best behavior even when I wasn't in the eyeshot of my parents.  And then the YAC-YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], where they cared, you know, if I was able to swim and survive.  And teachers who were thoughtful about making sure I understand how to play music, Mrs. Buckner [ph.].  And that's why it's important in the music programs 'cause it helped me understand that there's harmony in life.  And there's some joy in listening and playing music, and some kids don't have that.  So we gotta get that back into the school, so that's an important part of what I do because I think that's one of the reasons we got some of the challenges.  These kids don't see the harmony.  They don't feel the harmony.  They don't have the places to go, to create and feel human and see the joy and the beauty in life.  Yeah, it's part of what I gotta do.

Speaker 1: Can you describe the ranch and can you describe this beautiful place.  I have to say, it--
Speaker 2: Well, you have the history.  I mean it was founded in 1922.  It was the first African American resort community, founded by an African American being my--his wife, second wife was my grandmother's [Elizabeth North Smith] best friend.  So my grandmother started coming up here in 1924 and brought my dad [William Smith] after they were born in '35 [1935] and others.  And they spent every summer growing up here.  I first came up here when I was seven months old, in a bassinet, according to my mother [Sylvia Smith].  And it is a place where African Americans would find a kind of a peaceful respite from all the challenges that they were going through in the segregated United States.  As many of the jazz musicians were traveling from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to San--to, to Kansas City [Missouri], and they couldn't stay in the hotels because of segregated Denver, they'd come here and stay at Lincoln Hills.  So that's why we've had everyone from, you know, Duke Ellington and Count Basie and, you know, some folks even like Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes used to hold salon readings up here and Sarah Vaughn and others.  And so it's got that storied history.
Story_ID: 624717
Speaker 1: And back in 2006, I believe it was, I first--bought the first part of it, which was the lower part of what was traditionally in Lincoln Hills [Colorado].  Then in '08 [2008], '09 [2009], from a couple guys who had bought it.  In 2007, I bought the rest and expanded it beyond there.  Then I bought Winks Lodge, the traditional old Winks Lodge and restored that so they can, we can do all sorts of neat, historical reenactments and actually, it's now made a place of National Historic Registry.  Then bought the Ridge House and I've expanded that which is where we now have our program for students who were foster kids who have aged out of the foster care program.  So they can come here now over Christmas.  And this is where they spend their Christmases and during the summer.  And we're now getting them integrated into our teen works program and our summer program and we have an Angulars of Honor program here for wounded veterans and recovering veterans and their families where they can fish--I've got ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)]fishing ramps and ADA-graded banks so they can even get down there with some of the tractor systems we have and also just in normal wheelchairs and fish in the river and fish in the lakes.  I just bought another place down, called Lincoln Hills--which I'm creating.  Lincoln Hills Park would be a full-time park for veterans, and designed and now have these new barbeque grills that you can work from a wheelchair, so they can provide for their families as, as, you know, you know, folks like to do and cook for their families, which is part of it.  And the kids programs.  We bring the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] up, the Boys and Girls Club [of America] up, and, you know, various clubs, and, you know, young kids.  Everything from fishing to outdoor experiences to knife throwing and, you know, hatchet throwing and, you know, archery and target shooting and dance and, you know, biology and field studies and, you know, you know, we have, we had a seminar the other day on birds.  And we had rafters and they also cut open owl pods and, you know, analyzed and, you know, studied birds.  And that's neat, you know, to see--it's neat to see these kids go through that.  So it's outdoor field studies on science and nature and for fun.
Story_ID: 624718
Speaker 1: And this even started as a place where your, you and your family and your kids would come, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the camping 'cause you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so the camp site, and--
Speaker 2: Yep, we used to camp outdoors, me and my kids before I built the lodge here and all that.  And that was fun.  We'd all get covered in mud and (laughter) take showers every three days (laughter), and it's funny.  They were like, "We gotta take a shower today?"  We like being muddy, you know, everybody likes muddy.  But that's a lot of fun, and, you know, we still do a family camp every year.  It's getting shorter and shorter as the kids get older with, you know, demands of school and sports and all that sort of stuff.
Speaker 1: So give your kids' names and--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --because family, you talk about your, you know, your kids in a very positive way.  So talk about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're beautiful kids.  My oldest is Zoe.  And Zoe is her name, "life", right, is just full of life.  She just finished at Hotchkiss [School, Lakeville, Connecticut] and she's going to NYU [New York University, New York City] this fall.  She's excited about the film program.  She's in the Tisch School there.  And she has written a number of screen plays and actually when she was at Hotchkiss, she was in seven plays and was a lead in three, and just, you know, what I call a typical, first-born, good at everything.  Got her first black belt when she was twelve, and, you know, all those sort of things, and just an absolute delight and a fun little girl, young woman now.  Moving out into, you know, from Lakeville, Connecticut to New York City.  Eliana is my second, Eliana Frederick, and when, you know, her mother was pregnant and went to tell Zoe, and we said, "Zoe, we have something to tell you".  And Zoe said, "I know what it is.  You're having a girl and her name is Elianna".  And at the time, we didn't know what we were having in terms of the sex.  And I looked up Elianna, and the name means "gift from God".  And then when we found out it was a girl, we said, "Well, we gotta name her Elianna."  And she, of course, has the Frederick middle name which is a family name, and that means "God has given us a peaceful ruler".  And she is just that.  She is an absolute delight, and she's heading to Cate, the Cate School, which is in Santa Barbara [California], to boarding school this fall.  And she's an exceptional athlete, very good sprinter, but this year, I'm encouraging her to try different things.  And so she's gonna try some different sports, but I think she'll end up back into running for some period of time, but is an absolutely delightful young lady, very smart, straight A's and all that sort of stuff.  My, the next one is Max--Maximos Robert, my son.  And his goal in life is to play for Chelsea [Football Club].  So he is a soccer player, a footballer.  He's left-footed.  When he first started standing up, he was kicking.  And I've never seen anyone with a more powerful left foot in my life.  So like all things, hopefully, he stays healthy and he stays motivated, and I think he'll have a wonderful opportunity to enjoy that game of sports of soccer.  And I don't know if it will be as player or coach, whatever, but he seems to enjoy that game.  He also has one of the attributes that I have which is kind of interesting, but the ability to kind of walk in a room and know where everything is.  So he has kind of a, a special awareness that is uncanny (laughter), and hopefully, that will be harnessed to some degree, that will be helpful to him in his career going forward.  He is a--thinks of himself as jokester, a really good student, all A's, except for a B in Chinese, but we're working on that.  And I've been recently remarried, and now I have a seven-month old.  And his name is Hendrix Robert.  And he already is displaying a number of exceptional gifts and talents.  And I'm kind of excited to see his level of understanding the nature of things.  He studies things in a way that I've never seen a baby study things.  If I give him a pair of glasses, he doesn't just bang it, and lick on it and sucking on it, he actually looks at how the hinge works and squeezes it and feels it.  It's kind of an interesting thing to observe.  And so we'll see.  So it's always fun, to me, to see how different these children are, and I'm excited to see their development and look forward to them being human beings who make great contributions to the communities in which they live, and hopefully, make great contributions to society overall.  And I want them to be happy and discover those joys of figuring things out and to have confidence and to love each other.
Speaker 1: So your first--your current wife is Hope [Dworaczyk], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And your previous wife?
Speaker 2: Suzanne [ph.].
Speaker 1: Suzanne.  So, when you--I mean the--your children, I mean you were gifted with educated parents and a very--you, your kids are monetarily gifted, and so how--
Speaker 2: Maybe (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I'm teasing.  Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But how are you going to inculcate in them the same drive that you, that, obviously, was very much a part of who you were besides--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the challenge of kids--children of privilege, right.  And so you hope that they find their passions.  Like I told you, those three things.  You know, "You are enough", "Discover the joy of figuring things out", and, you know, "Love is all that matters".  I don't want them to ever feel that money is all that matters.  I want them to understand that community and the joy of giving and expression and developing and creation, creating things, and creating ideas and opportunities in businesses, that's what is fulfilling in life to me.  And I say that to them all the time.  And, you know, you hope with repeated sayings that some of it will resonate.  But the thing that I've learned also in life is people take their own path too, and you must celebrate them as individuals and let them take their own path, and live with the consequences, good and bad, of their own path.  And I'm preparing for that.  You know, I'm excited and hopeful 'cause all of 'em are at this point delightful and fun and exciting, you know, and positively oriented people (unclear).  And I'm trying to help them understand the importance of the power of intention, having the idea of who you want to become, you know, creating intention around that idea, putting the actions together that support it and living the life that is that.  And I think if they understand that power, that they will live the lives that they wanna be and make themselves very proud and give me a chance to smile wherever I am, at their accomplishments and who they are.
Story_ID: 624719
Speaker 1: You said that if this one fund works, then I would like to devote all my, you know, my work to philanthropy or--and I, you, free-market philanthropy, you've used that term.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What does that mean to you?
Speaker 2: That means, you know, for what I do, and the way I think about it, is like I do this thing called Project Realize where I go and adopt companies, urban-core companies and bring intellectual property and wherewithal, and a know-how and bring trained people to help them.  I don't buy the company, take any interest in 'em or anything of that sort.  But it's enabling.  So when you think about our first company was a company, Cedar Concepts, who was--and think about it, a, a specialty chemical company on the South side of Chicago, run by an African American woman, right.  That company isn't necessarily gonna get access to the best business processes, skills, talent because it's just the size relative to, you know, a high-quality person like my guy, Stephen Ballantine, you know, Kennedy School, you know, 3.9, just brilliant, would never go work at a company like that 'cause he's gonna have 15,000 other offers.  But I say, "Fine, I will pay you a salary that you would have gotten at those 1,500 other offers, okay, and train you in some business skills.  And now you go work there to help her build her business."  And now it's increased her revenue, quadrupled her EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization]  so now she can spend her money in, you know, on things like, you know, her Women in Science program where she can expand it.  That's what I call free-market philanthropy.  I don't ask for anything in return.
Speaker 1: But that's a company, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a company.  But--
Speaker 1: And she'll sell it and make money on it, and that's all her money.  I don't want anything back, but what I want to do is to be able to help her be more effective in--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --training, and, again, my executive to be effective.  So now, they can create another business.  Now, you can have other, three or four other African American businesses that are run by these folks who I've trained and her, that they're gonna be more effective and become relevant in this economy going forward.
Speaker 2: So you, when you look at, so how did that deal come to you though?  How did--how were you aware, when you're here, how did that, that--
Speaker 1: Which one, finding the company or the idea?
Speaker 2: Finding the company.  How did you find--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, what I did, I just, so I hired a guy, you know, Joe Watson, and I said, Joe, this is what I wanna do.  You go call the Chambers of Commerce's, go to every one of the churches.  You go figure out how you figure out who the black business owners are.  You put out an ad.  Here's what we're gonna do.  You gotta apply.  You gotta write an essay, and then from those, we'll pick.  And we've now done that in Chicago [Illinois] and we've now done it in Austin [Texas], and we've now done it in San Francisco [California].
Story_ID: 624720
Speaker 1: Okay, so, let's look at the African American community and let's look at the point where we are right now. It's been, you know, whatever, six years ago we were saying that we were in a post-racial society.
Speaker 2: Who was saying that?
Speaker 1: No. Many were saying. You, you were not saying that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. Many were saying that we were in a post-racial society and--but, you know, we've had Ferguson [Missouri], I mean there--it just, it seems like every--Eric Garner, you know, every--almost, it feels like every couple weeks or every, whatever--
Speaker 2: South Carolina.
Speaker 1: South Carolina shooting, what, when you sit right here, what do you think is really needed to--what is needed?
Speaker 2: Understanding.  And understanding comes from interaction and engagement.  It's one of the reasons why I do the teen works program here and bring the youth up here and have 'em mix.
Speaker 1: The mountain youth and--
Speaker 2: And the city.
Speaker 1: African American city--
Speaker 2: You got it.  And bring in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] groups up and the Boys and Girls Clubs [of America] groups up.  That's an important part of understanding 'cause when they get to know each other, they figure out they're more alike than they are different, okay. The world, the U.S. needs to see more people like me, which is why I mentor a lot of younger fund managers who look like me and Latino, okay, because the more the business establish sees that people like me, who look like me can be effective in what we do, the more it becomes commonplace and the easier it becomes.  The more they see us managing money and creating effective businesses, like a Linda, you know, Boasmond [Linda Boasmond], with Cedar Concepts [Corp.], the more she won't have a problem selling, you know, Procter & Gamble, to buying or becoming a contractor to them.  So you gotta create the opportunity for these leaders to emerge and the opportunity for people to engage, at very basic levels, you know.  It kind of breaks down, but it has to be natural.  You know, you do in this, in the school systems.  In college now, you know, you don't have forced desegregation any more, right, so you have natural segregation, right.  But when you go to these colleges, you know, people need to engage and interact and work in teams and all those sorts of things.  That's an important part of it.  But people have to mix in order for them to get to know each other.  And I gotta tell you.  You know, we watched the Republican debates the other night, and all these guys standing up there.  And Ben Carson [HM Benjamin Carson, Sr.], had one of the most wonderful answers about race when the commentator asked the question.  And he said, you know, and how do I feel about black--well, he said, "I'm a neurosurgeon 'cause when I open somebody up, they all look the same inside."  I hope one day that America gets to that point, where people realize, we are just all the same inside.  You know, we all have different cultural influences and proclivities and all that, but, you know, we all, frankly, wanna raise a family, wanna live in a safe community and wanna have opportunity.  We wanna live in a meritocracy, we wanna work in a meritocracy.  And so I just try to create my world around, and looks like that.  Vista [Equity Partners, LLC] is a meritocracy.  Every place that I have a place is just--I make it a meritocracy.  I don't care what you look like, where you came from, if you went to this school versus that.  If you perform, then you should be rewarded.  And every one of our companies, I look to shape that way.  So that's what I think is needed, and we can stand and talk about it all the time, but you just gotta do it and hopefully, people follow the lead and hopefully, see the wisdom and hopefully, people realize the importance of being a good, solid human being 'cause there's some great joy in that.
Story_ID: 624721
Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: It's a bunch of things.  You know, you want 'em to all--yeah, but when you're dead, you don't care, right.  I want my children to know that I was a good father, and I want 'em to know that I was a very strong business leader and created opportunity for people who didn't, cared for the weak, provide opportunity for the willing.  And I want the community to know that it's okay to reach across the aisle and talk to somebody who doesn't look like you and to hire them and to train 'em and to teach 'em, and to employ 'em and to be a part of their family and to be a part of their lives.  So dad's rules.  "You are enough", "Discover the joy of figuring things out" and "Love is all that matters".
Story_ID: 624722
Speaker 1: What will the legacy of your generation be?
Speaker 2: That's a real good question.  I think we will have presided over one of the greatest expansions of economic opportunity this planet has ever seen, and I think we will have destabilized in the U.S. to some degree, some of the advancements in human rights, you know.  As you know, I'm the chairman of the Robert F. Kennedy Center [for Justice and Human Rights, Washington, D.C.], and one of the reasons I took the job when Ethel [Kennedy] asked me was I think I can be helpful in helping people understand what human rights actually is.  And it's from the bullying that goes on, online and how do we prevent that to teaching people about, you know, what is actually occurring in places like, you know, Uganda and Nigeria and China, and, you know, and Sweden, right.  I mean we've got to be thoughtful about human rights throughout this planet, and I think we can be effective in that.  And I think I can be effective in that role.   So, you know, we can just stabilize that, a lot of that social networking has to stabilize some of that human rights.  You know, we have created an environment where people can get online and say whatever they want under the mask of anonymity and be cruel and inhumane.  And that's just wrong, and I think that's gonna be unfortunately, one of the legacies of our generation.  Positive legacy, I think we're gonna create opportunity, and I think we're gonna enable some of the, you know, disadvantaged folks across the planet through the leverage of technology to actually put themselves in positions of middle-class and beyond.  And we're seeing it today.  That's a beautiful thing about technology.
Story_ID: 624723
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns then for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my hopes are, again, that we realize we have a tremendous amount to contribute to the world, and that we actively build systems and institutions and infrastructure to contribute that as a group of people and as individuals in the boarder group and recognize that those contributions can be the same.  It doesn't always have to be within the community or outside, not vilify those who are outside of the community, and, you know, that they have been successful.  We have to get back to a point of celebrating success, not just in African Americans.  That's one of the issues in the earlier question, right, you know, we are vilifying, you know, people who have been successful.  That's just wrong.  We have to fix that.  That's just wrong, because we want to celebrate those who work hard, play by the rules, you know, and achieve success and then convey it to others, the opportunity to others.  So part of my hopes are that that's where we're going as a society and as a group, and I'm a do my part, of course, and I'm figuring out that I've got a bigger role than I originally thought I had because of what I've been able to create and do and scale and build.  And so, now, that's part of the, the mantle I now must take on.  As it relates to my fears, that younger generations lose hope because they don't see the onramps to the economic environment, and we see that in Baltimore [Maryland].  That's why I think we got problems there, 'cause I mean, we basically embargoed a whole group of citizens, that they don't have jobs and job opportunities, and so that's a part of one of the things I wanna figure out how we can solve some of those problems.  And I do that through some of the work that we're--that I'm working on at, you know, Fundo Foundation and also at "Vista and Me", you know, just, just focus on how do you create those onramps, what's the easiest internships and creating those sorts of things where, you know, you bring that to certain societies and all of a sudden, people have hope.  But if they don't feel there's hope, then you got a problem.  So that's what I worry about.
