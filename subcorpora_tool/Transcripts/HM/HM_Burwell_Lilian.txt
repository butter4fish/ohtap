Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is [Edgar] Carey Lane. Ma'am could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Lilian Thomas Burwell, L-I-L-I-A-N, Thomas, T-H-O-M-A-S, Burwell, B-U-R-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: My middle name was Virginia, and the reason that I started using Thomas again, was because I no longer have the husband that gave me the Burwell, but my father [James Burchett Thomas] will always be my father and I really started putting that in there in homage to him, to honor him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Especially as I attained more professional recognition.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on June 7th in 1927, in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is--
Speaker 2: I was born here because this was my mother's [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] home, my family was living in Miami, Florida at the time that I was born, but she came to D.C. to have me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because her mother was here--
Speaker 2: Her family--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: My mother's family is Washington family.  One of her ancestors came to the City of Washington in 1817, before the Emancipation Proclamation.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'm gonna ask you about that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in a minute but--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --I'm just trying to establish like a slate right now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm an artist.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Twenty-four years retired from being a teacher of art.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And--
Speaker 2: I also still do curatorial work.
Speaker 1: So, an artist, a curator and--
Speaker 2: You can say art activist in general.  I've been quite involved in the art world up until very recently.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 3rd of August, in the year of our Lord, 2004.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Highland Beach, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the only municipality outside of Annapolis [Maryland] in the county.
Speaker 1: And as in--
Speaker 2: Thanks to--
Speaker 1: --Anne Arundel County, Maryland, right?
Speaker 2: --Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it's the only municipality outside of Annapolis in the entire county?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Hm. Now this--
Speaker 2: Because it reapplied for the, the citizenship in honor to Frederick Douglass whose son, Charles [Rolland "Charley" Douglass], purchased this initial land about, oh, what year was it, in the 1890s.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah well you wanna tell us a little bit about that for, well I don't know how far we wanna get into that but, Charles Douglass bought this in the 1890s?
Speaker 2: Charles Douglass was the son of Frederick Douglass, and he came down to the Annapolis area to, to get to bring his family to a beach and found out, because of the discrimination, he was not allowed in.  So, he crossed the creek, Black Walnut Creek, and came into this area which was then farm lands, twenty-six acres of farm land and it just so happened that the owner, a black farmer, was planning to retire. So after a couple of days' negotiation, the land belonged to Charles and he then subdivided it and sold different sections to friends in Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay so this--
Speaker 2: And it has become a resort, it's really one of the first resort that was just, you know, occupied by black people in the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we noticed on the way in the streets are named Douglass and there's one, I think maybe for Aris, I can't think of his last name.
Speaker 2: Aris T. Allen.
Speaker 1: T. Allen, right.
Speaker 2: He, he was, a black physician in, in Annapolis, not, I don't think he ever owned property here, but, I can't think of the name of another street that's named for a person.  There's Walnut Bay, Douglass, there's another one, I can't think of who it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--
Speaker 2: It's a small community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And most, most of the property has been handed down through the family or to close friends of family, so when I moved down here three years ago, I found that there are many of them where descendants of people that I knew or my parents knew, it's been a very homey community.
Story_ID: 202774
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight People magazine-ish type questions I am compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: The first, (laughter), the first question is--
Speaker 2: You know my tendency.
Speaker 1: The first question is, ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I like everything except, I can hardly think of anything I don't like.  If it's fixed well, I like it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's simple enough.
Speaker 2: I don't have a favorite food, because of my age, I try to stay away from fried things, but I still love fried things.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry I don't fit into your box (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I think I like the, the moderate temperatures of spring and autumn.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'm here [Highland Beach, Maryland], for the rest of my life, I hope.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, lastly do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: The one that I quote a lot is [Johann Wolfgang] Goethe, who says, whatever you can dream--whatever you can do or dream you can do, you can begin it.  For courage has power, genius and magic in it.  You like that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that along with a quotation from the Bible, are my guidelines.  "In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths" [Proverbs 3:6].
Story_ID: 202775
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [James Burchett Thomas] side of the family. I'm gonna start with your mother's side. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: She was Margaret Elizabeth Wilkinson Thomas.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1898, in Washington D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back, first of all, can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: On one side I can, on her father's side, I can trace it all the way back to Lord [Thomas] Fairfax [6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron] of Virginia and a woman that was in his service who was described as being half-[Cheroenhaka] Nottoway Indian and half--uncivilized African slave.  Isn't that amazing?
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now this is what?  What year are we talking about with Lord Fairfax?
Speaker 2: You should have asked me to research this before we sat down.
Speaker 1: Well roughly, would he be in the 1700s or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the 1700s.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the 18th century.
Speaker 2: He had come here to settle in the colonies, he was one, was one of the first colonists.
Speaker 1: And, and he purchased the freedom of this woman or he owned her or what was?
Speaker 2: No.  That was another--
Speaker 1: That was--
Speaker 2: --relative and ancestor, that was on my grandmother's side, Fairfax was on my grandfather's side, this is on my mother's family.
Speaker 1: So Fairfax, I'm just trying to get his relationship to the, to the woman straight.  I mean he was--
Speaker 2: Fairfax and the slave were the ancestors of my grandfather, of my mother's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right, the ancestry of my mother's mother goes back to what is described as an English ne'er-do-well, he's the one who purchased his bride out of slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the father of my grandmother, that's as far back as I can take that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And who was it that came here, as a, as a free woman, and get all these, one of the ancestors came to the City of Washington [D.C.] in 18--
Speaker 1: I think you said '13 [1813]?
Speaker 2: Thirteen [1813]?
Speaker 1: Eighteen thirteen [1813] before, yeah.  And she had free papers you--
Speaker 2: She had free papers, which said that she was not born a slave, she came to the City of Washington, they had to carry free papers then before the Emancipation Proclamation, so nobody would capture them and send them to some plantation.
Speaker 1: Well this is, I mean it's, it's wonderful to know so much about, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where you came--a lot, lot of people have no idea who their ancestors are.
Speaker 2: Well we're fortunate in that those papers were in the hands of my mother's eldest sister whose executor I was.  She was also my mentor as an artist, she was the other artist in the family in that wing of the family and I gave those papers framed to my grandson when he graduated from law school.  He's the one in the family who's really traced the ancestry as far as he could on every, every single angle--
Speaker 1: And he's--
Speaker 2: --he can.
Speaker 1: I know he's published a little piece for the family.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Spiral bound piece that we saw--
Speaker 2: On my f--that was on my father's family, he's still working on four other family trees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'll probably be at it most of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I feel very blessed to have had only one child who lived who had one child who is doing this because otherwise a lot of history was getting lost.
Story_ID: 202776
Speaker 1: Tell us about your grandparents, what were they like and what did they do on, on your mother's [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was a postal employee, which was about the most honorable thing that a black person could do in his day, if he was not a physician or a teacher.  My grandmother was an attendance officer in the public schools, as a matter of fact, she and [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett's mother [Mary Carson] were very good friends; she was also an attendance officer.  Both of them had very high ideals which were passed on to children in terms of character, of not giving up on things of making the most of the best of yourself that you could.  There was a certain element in there that probably worked against them.  One of my mother's sisters told me that the reason that they lost a house that they owned was because my grandmother would not allow her mother-in-law to go to work as a domestic.  She was living with them at the time and she said no, no Wilkinson can get down on her knees, and they lost the house that they had apparently refinanced in order to do some decorating and some renovation to the house, in the days when it was almost impossible for a black family to even obtain a loan, but they were very unsophisticated in terms of understanding the finances involved, so somewhere in that, they got lost.  They'd gotten the loan through a white family that was a friend, but they ended up losing the home by not being able to meet the notes and part of it was what I call false pride (laughter).
Story_ID: 202777
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas]--what do you know about how--your mother grew up and what she did when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the family was very fortunate in that every one of my mother's siblings and my mother did--were college-educated.  When you say growing up, she went to what was originally called the M Street High School which became [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School], in Washington, D.C. And then you know, I don't know where she went to college but she did graduate and she became a teacher, she taught in [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt's WPA Program, it was Workers Progress Administration [sic. Works Progress Administration], during the '40s [1940s], '30s [1930s], and '40s [1940s], and she was a very primary example to me of how to make things out of nothing.  I watched her take practically nothing and create a very beautiful home and, do you want me to go on with that now?  Or is this one of those details you don't want to hear right now?
Speaker 1: Oh no, go ahead.
Speaker 2: For example, she had a job in a factory at one time in which they did painting on silk and hers was, I'm trying to think of what the method is called, stenciling and the silks came from Japan, a pongee silk is what the bags were made out of, in which the silks that they printed on were contained and now these pongee silk, which is a natural unbleached silk with, with no color, those bags were thrown into the alley to be collected by--trash.  My mother would collect these bags, bring them into the house, we had silk curtains hanging in our kitchen windows, because she took linoleum and made linoleum block print designs on these--on the silk and sewed curtains.  And that's an example of the type of thing that I was exposed to all the time I was growing up.  Without television and the intrigue of advertising to make us aware of what somebody else had that we didn't have, I grew up believing that you made things out of nothing.  We collected discarded boxes that produce had come, that were in the alleys of grocery stores and brought them home, pulled the nails out of those, turned the nails upside down on the basement floor which was concrete because my father [James Burchett Thomas] was a janitor at that time, and hammer those nails straight so that we could use them and then cut the boxes to make toys out of.  I thought that's the way toys came about and it was, nothing was more fun, but I, I really grew up with that very strong influence of believing that anything that you could think of with your head and, and do with your hands you could make something, you could produce something from.  And I credited it for the fact that I'm an artist to this day, my brother grew up to be an engineer, but still there again, he was putting things together in a different kind of way to make a new product.  But it was a natural way of being, which I'm afraid is lost very often to this generation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, it's different.  The process--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is different, they don't see that--
Speaker 2: But that type of example.  I went to a private school [Little Red School House; Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York] for the first four years and saw my mother making dresses for me out of the less worn parts of sheets that were worn out and embroidering them and putting appliques of other discarded fabrics, or people discarded clothes and she would, would take the colors, the good looking colors of prints of discarded dresses and shirts and applique flowers all around my dresses and nobody in school was as well dressed as I, but my clothes were really made of discards, that was her whole mentality.  A result of being well educated, she taught arts and crafts.  She and my father met when they were both on faculty at A&T Institute [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] then in North Carolina, in Greensboro [North Carolina].  And she was teaching English as well as arts and crafts and he was teaching photography.
Story_ID: 202778
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your father and his side of the family, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James Burchett Thomas.  Burchett is spelled, B-U-R-C-H-E-T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1892, in Centerville [North Carolina] which was then called Alert, A-L-E-R-T, North Carolina.  I can't find it on the map anymore so I just imagine that the name has changed, that, that it, this area that's now Centerville.  He was born on a farm, one of twenty-six children.
Speaker 1: And that's amazing.
Speaker 2: Yes it--
Speaker 1: --I mean you had to stop for a second.  You know, I, I heard it before we started the interview, twenty-six children.
Speaker 2: Granddaddy [James S. Thomas] had three wives, two of them were sisters, his first wife [Mary Williams] died in childbirth when the second child was being born and my grandfather married her half-sister and she gave him, I can't keep up with the numbers, I just know that his third wife, Aunt Mallisa had nineteen of those children and he was land rich, child rich, but they had very little.  And there again, they worked with their hands in tobacco fields and cotton fields, cotton was his main product and he had a couple of hundred acres there which eventually were divided among the children as they grew up, and eventually the children moved away. And I think as hard as they worked, the younger children would work to see that the older child got an opportunity to go to school and then that older child then would bring some of the others up to the city.  They all eventually moved away from North Carolina except for two, and two of the twenty-six children died in infancy, by the way, one I think shortly after birth, but they all worked to help each other on up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The girls got the less, the smallest piece of the pie, though.  I remember one aunt telling me how angry she was because she didn't get the grades that were, were required of the family, so she didn't an opportunity to go to more than one year of school. But the boys were given much more leeway.  In those days of course, it was generally the man that was responsible for taking care of his family, so I can understand that mentality.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess they figured there was--
Speaker 2: For the times, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, more at stake, I guess, for him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 202779
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace that [paternal] side?  Is it, how far back can you go with--
Speaker 2: Back to my grandfather's father, his name was Joe Thomas, that's all I know.  And apparently there was some Indian blood but I don't know what tribe it was.  I asked Aunt Elna [ph.], once when I walked in on her and saw her looking like an Indiana squaw, I said, "What tribe, you know, and, you know who was my grandmother and who was my, who was my great-grandmother and my great-grandfather?"  She said, "You sat right there in that chair five years ago and asked me that same question, his name was Joe, I told you his name was Joe and I don't know about the woman, I just know that she was, she was some Indian."
Speaker 1: So that would have been back in, what would you say, the early part of the 19th century or the mid-19th century?
Speaker 2: I think granddaddy [James S. Thomas] was born in, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Oh so this is your grandfather you're talking about?
Speaker 2: This was my, my grandfather, my grandfather's father, was Joe.
Speaker 1: Okay, so yeah, that would at least be the middle part of the 19th century, I guess, I would think.
Speaker 2: I would think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least.  So 1850 is--
Speaker 2: But daddy [James Burchett Thomas] was one of the first born and he was born in 1892.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we say his father must have been born, let's say, maybe 1870 or '60s [1860s].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Speaker 1: Then his father--
Speaker 2: He must have started pretty young.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: If he had twenty-six kids, although you can't tell about the power of the Thomas sperm.  (Laughter) And that was twenty-six.
Story_ID: 202780
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [James Burchett Thomas].  What did--how did he grow up with--
Speaker 2: On the farm.
Speaker 1: He was the second oldest of twenty-six.
Speaker 2: That's right, he grew up on the farm, and he was almost like second father to many of the siblings.  By time Aunt Mallisa, was the only grandmother that I knew and she was really my step-grandmother, she was the, she was the half-sister of my grandmother [Mary Williams] and when she married my grandfather [James S. Thomas], daddy was almost as old as she was, does that sound right?  It doesn't sound like it makes sense, but I do remember my father saying that they were not far apart in age, maybe Aunt Mallisa was just that young.  And so the  children were as obedient to daddy as they were to my grandfather and he sort of ruled the roost in a way and he was the first one that got away and went through school, he ended up teaching both at A&T [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] as well as Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and one by one he brought many of the children up to New York [New York], which is where he was living.  We were part of the migration north when the crash hit in 1929; moved up north so that daddy could find a way to support the family.  So we lived a pretty impoverished life as far as material possessions were concerned, we never felt that we were disadvantaged in any other way--in any way at all because of the richness of the things that we were exposed too.  Growing up in New York City, there were free puppet shows in Greenwich Village [New York, New York], we would spend parts of Saturdays at the Museum of Natural History [New York, New York], I knew about wrapping mummies and doing Egyptian hieroglyphics and it was fun.  And we, we did things like playing family games together, just simply the matter of having dinner together and cooking together around a table when we sat down, they were, those were very important things that made our life very rich.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said--your parents met at North Carolina A&T, yeah AT&T [sic].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A&T.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were both, they were both teaching on faculty then.
Speaker 1: Your father taught photography?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is so, I mean, that, that must have been, well I don't know, it must have been very interesting, not that, you know, the, did he shoot, did, did he have a large body of work that, that you were able to see?
Speaker 2: Most of the work that I've seen that he did back in that time were mostly documentary work.  He would have loads of photographs of the buildings of A&T, and lots of snap shots of the campus life, but I don't know how much of it he did because a lot of the snap shots are of him and he had the equipment and I even have a photograph, which I'll send to [Edgar] Carey [Lane], showing his studio there at A&T which would be very interesting to see, with all this equipment, very similar to what I see here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Big umbrella, I see, so--
Speaker 1: Did he document any, any of the famous people from that time at all?
Speaker 2: I don't remember seeing any, no.  Only portrait I see that he did are those that he did of my mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] and of his own father.
Story_ID: 202781
Speaker 1: So well, you grew up in New York City [New York, New York], where did you live in New York?
Speaker 2: I grew up during the [Great] Depression and when I went into the government as a cartographic draftsman, I went in during one of the wars and I had to get secret clearance and I named sixteen addresses and my mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] told me that I had missed one, so apparently we lived in seventeen different places in, in New York.
Speaker 1: Mostly in Manhattan [New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: About every borough except the Bronx [New York, New York].  Brooklyn [New York, New York], the places that I remember most are, were the Dunbar Apartments [Harlem, New York, New York] which were in between 7th and 8th Avenue and 149th and 150th, we lived there a long time, we lived at 435 Convent Avenue a long time, I remember those addresses very well, I was in high school when I was there.  I remember living on Edgecombe Avenue, on Edgecombe pl- no not Edgecombe, St. Nicholas Avenue, and St. Nicholas Place, I remember living on 153rd Street, I remember two addresses in Brooklyn, 34 Jefferson Avenue, my father [James Burchett Thomas] was a janitor there, ooh, I remember 112th Street, I remember 116th Street, that's down the hill, the addresses that we had they were up the hill, what they call Sugar Hill, where S--St. Nicholas Avenue, 152nd or 3rd Convent Avenue.  I went to junior high school, the Stitch Junior High School [(ph.) I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt School, New York, New York], which is 164th and something, I don't remember the other street, it was, it was above Yankee Stadium [New York, New York], I remember that, adjacent to Yankee Stadium, the Brooklyn address I remember most was 34 Jefferson Avenue because I was living there when I went to Music & Art High School [The High School of Music & Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & the Arts, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 202782
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: You'll be stunned to remember the first thing that I remember.  I remember my first association, my first realization, that pain that I felt was felt by other people. It was, it was a very strange thing, I remember consciously being aware of the fact that if I hurt and I did something to somebody else, that that caused them to hurt.  I know I was an infant, I can see myself sitting on the floor with that awareness coming to me, it's amazing, but I'm still sensitive to other people's feelings, must have been in my DNA, but I remember that moment of realization. I remember a little later real--the first time I realized that we had, we were monetarily poor, as a matter of fact we were living in New Jersey then, or I guess it was before we moved across the [Hudson] River and it was winter and we were sitting at the table which was in sort of an alcove where there's like a bench on one--each side of a table and we were having pancakes and mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] sprinkled sugar on these pancakes and I said, I, I wanted syrup, and she said we don't have any syrup, and she, I said I'll go buy some and she said, we don't have money for syrup.  I don't know how old I was, but I know that when we moved to Manhattan [New York, New York], I was something like three or four years old, so that was pretty early.  No, it must have been four or five because we were still in Jersey when my brother was born.
Story_ID: 202783
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The thing I remember about growing up was the unlimited sense of possibility that growing up in New York [New York] gave me.  Of course these were back in the days where a kid could get on the subway when they are in grade one and the parents weren't concerned about their safety, so I learned the city young, I knew how to take the A train and the biggest mischief I got into on the A train was probably getting off of the express and getting on to a local and screaming and yelling in the subway station when the A train went past, that was like considered nerve and bad and rebel and I could never figure out why my father [James Burchett Thomas] knew exactly what I had done, even though I had been told to come straight home from school 'cause I was going to school at the Little Red School House [Little Red School House & Elisabeth Irwin High School (LREI), New York, New York] which was all, I would get off at West 4th Street near Greenwich Village [New York, New York] and I lived way uptown, I think at that time it was 112th Street.
Story_ID: 202784
Speaker 1: Tell us about the Little Red School House [Little Red School House & Elisabeth Irwin High School (LREI), New York, New York] some.
Speaker 2: The Little Red School House was the first progressive school in the United States, I think it was [John] Dewey's philosophy in education, I still remember things from those first four grades like Egyptian hieroglyphics and how papyrus is made. We would build a sand table showing the [Mississippi] Delta.  I don't remember my teacher's name but I remember what she looked like.  It was an open classroom concept so that years later when I was teaching a third grade class as well teaching art to the entire school, I used the same approaches of keeping the children's heads out of books and into reality.  For example we were studying the solar system, the children pushed all their chairs to the outer perimeters of the classroom and I asked what is the center of the universe and the first child who said the sun, could stand in the middle of the room and be the sun and I said, "Okay, what's the next planet," Jupiter, the first child who raised their hand and said Jupiter could be Jupiter and if he didn't know what rotate meant, or revolve, then he had to sit down.  And they built, we built that and those children never forgot those things, this is the way we were taught, those are the concepts of teaching that I learned way back at the Little Red School House because it was an opal- open end multi-faceted approach to learning which I still don't see in many of the schools now.
Speaker 1: And this is based on the philosophy of John Dewey?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's really progressive education, in terms of today, I still consider it progressive.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah it's--
Speaker 2: The business of working with your hands, there was a carpentry shop in the basement, there were little kids down there making violins, we were dipping candles, we were doing things with our hands.  Maybe some of it was the times, I don't know whether they're still doing that at the Little Red School House or not but, while we were dipping candles, we learned which cultures made candles that we imported into this country.  I was there when [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt was running for president and I remember we're down there in the basement in a craft shop singing, "Landon, Landon, sis-boom-bah, put him in the trash can rah-rah-rah."  We were aware of what was going on politically in the city even though I was somewhere in first, second, third or fourth grade.  Everything was multi-faceted in the way we approached learning.

Speaker 1: This says something about your father's [James Burchett Thomas] political stance I guess, and his--
Speaker 2: My father is the one that chal--taught me to challenge facts.  I used to think that because my father's English was not perfect, I translated that as being not so smart, but I changed my mind about that very, very fast.  If I were to make a statement for example, he would say, "What's makes you think that?"  "Well I read it in a book."  "Who wrote the book?  I could write a book.  What makes you think that he knows what he's talking about?  If you can't tell me who he is, tell me why what he said makes sense to you."  So he taught me to challenge, he taught me to think, and this is just a farm boy, who, of course, by now had been teaching, he'd been exposed to a different level of education.
Speaker 1: Where did he go to college?  I don't think we, I, I don't remember--
Speaker 2: You know?  I'm not sure, I'm not sure.  I, something makes me think that it was A&T [Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] also, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: That's interesting though.
Speaker 2: Was it, when did it come into existence?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: North Carolina A&T, I'm not sure, I would think probably the latter part of the 19th century, you know, well of course all of them--most of the black colleges in the South came into existence in 1870s and '80s [1880s], but you know, '90s [1890s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure exactly when.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure, I know he went away to--
Speaker 1: And North Carolina
Speaker 2: --school.
Speaker 1: --A, A and, A&T was a state supported--
Speaker 2: It was, it was institute [sic.] at that time.
Speaker 1: --a state supported school?
Speaker 2: Was A&T Institute.
Speaker 1: Was it state supported?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Oh, well okay.  You just, that--
Speaker 2: You're the historian, you should know.
Speaker 1: --that's interesting too.  Yeah, I mean I think it is, I think it, it perhaps was state-supported as a place for black students to go.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause some of the states like Alcorn [State University, Alcorn, Mississippi] in Mississippi was a state supported school, Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 2: What about Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], what do you know about Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Tuskegee Institute was not state supported, it was a private, you know, institution, you know, the Booker T. [Washington] founded, but it had, it got a lot of foundation money and that's what I think for gifts.
Speaker 2: Well I was always in trouble with my father for being too much like him, he taught me to think the way he thinks.  But of course, for a child, a woman growing up in that period of time you weren't supposed to question your father, he taught me to question things, but not him.  And to ask him why he thought such a way, was almost forbidden.  You don't, you know, but, but he is the one that nurtured the rebel in me, but of course I wasn't su--you know, his father was a, a Baptist minister and I'm supposed to, not supposed to challenge just because your father said so, that was why.  But I was much more like him than my brother who was much more passive, much more of an introvert.  He knew better than to open his mouth and I never did learn that.  I always said what I thought, a combination of my father and the Little Red School House [Little Red School House & Elisabeth Irwin High School (LREI), New York, New York], I was constantly expressing my thoughts whether they were asked for or not.
Story_ID: 202786
Speaker 1: Do you think you take after your father [James Burchett Thomas] more than your mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas], in terms of personality?
Speaker 2: My ideal of the kind of person to be is my mother, she was--she acted out and lived out the perfect, forgiving, loving, giving person.  She had a little mischief in her also, but she would never, was never as outspoken as my father.  I think I'm a pretty good combination of the two, but I'm moving more toward being the kind of person my mother was, wishing that I could be because she was more controlled than I am, even here at seventy-seven.  I'm still challenging things and still exploring and my mother was always rather amazed at me wondering where did I (laughter), where did I come from because she knew that I was unlike her in that, (unclear) myself.  And, for example a contradiction of being an artist, when the certain amount of self-promotion is necessary, you've got to blow your own horn, you've got to be in love with what you're doing or else you don't continue to do it.  And yet, modesty, humility, were the qualities that my mother had and I was trained to have those be the admirable traits so there was sort of an inherent contradiction that I grew up with and still have about tooting my own horn, this interview is a little difficult to me, although I do think I am an important person, I have to be convinced of that.  I think we're all important people and I think that's very important to realize that we don't pattern ourselves after some model of what society says is in.  But that each one of us has a particular journey that we need to go on to find out what it is that we are and have to contribute just in being our own best selves and not imitating what somebody else is.  I think role models are important, but then we need to learn to come out of our, our shells and, and try to move toward what our own particular purpose in life might be.
Speaker 1: And try to break some new ground.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I see us all as different facets of the same creation.  Like a diamond cut many may--many ways, not necessarily agreeing with everybody else and seeing what everybody else see's but knowing that we're still part of one whole and are important to each other in that we allow each other to see things from different views.  As a teacher of art, I've always emphasized that the necessity of following your own vision of going towards your own goal, if you're really smart, by the time you get near to where you think you're going, you've moved your goal to something else and you can keep--you continue to grow.  The older I get, the more excited I get about the idea of life because it's the more I know, the more I realize I don't know and I also realize I can never know it all and the result of it is the sense of absolute freedom and limitless possibility and for everything that changes, that decreases the quality of life in one direction, it's like pruning a tree, the life sprouts out in another direction.  Something else can happen.  I walk slower than I used to, to walk, and what I found out is that buttercups, who I thought--I thought they just didn't exist anymore, I'm getting to see buttercups when I walk now because I was, was going too fast before.  So, you know everything, but, what is the saying?  "There's a season for everything," and I'm very excited about wondering about what I'm going to learn today that I didn't know yesterday.  I'm a talker, obviously, I'm learning to listen and realize how much I've missed by not listening.  And, so life is fuller.

Speaker 1: Tell me did questioning what was going on around you ever get you in trouble when you were coming up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Always.
Speaker 1: Can you give us a story about a time when you got in trouble for asking too many questions?
Speaker 2: Always, I don't know when I didn't, especially as a Negro as the word was when I was growing up.  The question in a existing institution.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: I always asked why.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you got to church when you were --growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Sunday school was a very strong element in my growing up.
Speaker 1: And where did you go to Sunday school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I grew up as an Episcopal, that was my mother's [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] religion and I went to John [H.] Johnson, John H. Johnson's church, Saint Martin's [Episcopal Church] in Manhattan [New York, New York], 122nd and Lenox Avenue, which was down the street from Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.]'s church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York].  Powell tried to talk me into getting into politics by the way when I, when I--the family knew his family and we would go over there and because I had a mouth I guess he thought I should get--I always had an idea of what should be that wasn't and he thought I should go into politics, but I wasn't really, wasn't interested in that.  But, when I was growing up, I had a very Alice in Wonderland sensibility about how things should be and I think I was very innocent but not really that naive.  I learned, my marriage was not an easy marriage, I tried very hard to make it work, but it was really doomed and things didn't make sense to me, you know, if you try to do everything right and make things work and try to make everybody happy, and try to be a good person, everything was supposed to turn out right, but I was Alice in Wonderland, that was the, the sense of religion and spirituality that I had in growing up.  And I started searching for answers and started studying the theologians, Thomas Merton, Augustine, Jacques Maritain, and I found a deeper reality in another faith.  I became a Catholic when I was in my twenties, I never could understand how Catholics practiced their faith, because it seemed to be so contradictory to the basic truths that I had learned in studying it, coming at it intellectually, which also, by the way, saved my life because life made more sense to me when I realized the relationship of suffering to reality, how to, to, well it was a lot of things, I could go on, and on about that, I don't think you want me to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's, you know
Speaker 2: But, I--
Speaker 1: It seems, it seems maybe sort of--I, I wouldn't have guessed that, that--well, I don't know, it's just me I guess, but I never guessed that deep reflection would, would, would, make you become a Catholic, I don't know, I don't think it's--
Speaker 2: Well, it could have saved my life because things made sense to me that were not making sense in my life and I found answers.  By the way, I've just finished editing my own book of poems, called a '[A] Dichotomy of Passions: The Two Masters,'[Lilian Thomas Burwell] because I do believe that you can serve both the world and the creator, one within the other and when I look back over what I've written through the years, I found that there was a pattern that just developed and evolved, which I found very interesting, between being very much in love with life and being very humanly, a very passionate person and at the same time being very keenly aware of my source and knowing that there was someone that loved me more than I loved myself and was probably the only reason that I survived through some difficult times, was through my faith.  And there were times in my life when I found a contradiction, but I've evolved into something where I don't see a contradiction anymore.
Story_ID: 202788
Speaker 1: Let's try to go back and pick up a chronology of you--now you're at the little--we had you at the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York], and did you go to grade school, all the way through at the Little Red School House?
Speaker 2: I went to the Little Red School House, as I said, we had no money, and I went to the Little Red School House on scholarship.
Speaker 1: Were--
Speaker 2: My brother was four years younger than I and when it was time for him to start school, they wouldn't offer both of us a scholarship, so I was taken out of private school, and we both went to P.S. 46 [Arthur Tappan School, New York, New York] up on the [Sugar] Hill, we gave false addresses even though we were taught not to tell lies, so we could go to a better school than the one that was in the neighborhood where we lived.
Speaker 1: Well, how old were you then--
Speaker 2: Fourth grade
Speaker 1: --when you went to P.S.?
Speaker 2: I would have been ten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Going into eleven, I guess.  I went first to P.S. 46 and then to junior high school 164 [I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt School, New York, New York], in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now PS--
Speaker 2: --if you--
Speaker 1: --P.S. 46 is in, is that uptown in--?
Speaker 2: It was at 155th [Street].
Speaker 1: 155th.
Speaker 2: And, I think it was St. Nicholas [sic. Frederick Douglass Boulevard].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It doesn't exist anymore.  I understand there's another school there with a new number.  In those days, if you could attain a certain average you could take the entire seventh year of school in one semester, it was called R.A., you could take this whole eighth year in one semester, that was called R.B., so by going to R.A. and R.B., I gained a whole year, so--I was able to go into ninth grade which was where Music & Art High School [The High School of Music & Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] started at something like age fourteen. So, just to, I guess just to make this clear that your education at Little Red School House, sort of accelerated you or, or--
Speaker 1: I think I, I think it--
Speaker 2: --you think it--
Speaker 1: --set my way of thinking, it set my sense of open-endedness about things of limitless possibility. That combined with the thinking and the actions of my parents [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas and James Burchett Thomas].
Story_ID: 202789
Speaker 1: Did your father [James Burchett Thomas] teach photography in New York [New York]?  Did he do that in New York?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What did he do?
Speaker 2: No, he was a janitor, by the time, he--at first he was digging streets, I remember him telling me a story of, of having to pull his hat down over his head because he was part of a street gang that was, I guess using something like a jack hammer drill to, to dig up concrete outside of the house of a socially prominent friend of theirs who was--happened to be a doctor and he was, he was doing manual labor.  Now, I don't remember that, I remember that story, and I remember him coming home being exhausted.  What I remember is his being a janitor but there was no, no work in New York that really paid good money, by being a janitor that was really good because we had a basement apartment and we had lots of space even though we were down on a concrete floor and he was always highly respected, I can see him now leaning back in his chair with a cigar hanging out of his mouth.
Speaker 1: So did he ever get back to teaching at all?
Speaker 2: No he never went back to teaching.  He got back into photography when we came to Washington [D.C.], the family moved to Washington in '42 [1942], I think it was '42 [1942], and he got a job with the [U.S.] Department of Commerce doing photography then, but it was, he was doing documentary work and working with cameras in the lab there, I don't remember him having any kind of creative photography in his work at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then he learned to be a press man, running one of the hu- huge press which was really quite, there were only something like three or four of those presses in the whole Department of Commerce and he was one of the few who knew how to operate them.
Story_ID: 202790
Speaker 1: You were at P.S. 46 [Arthur Tappan School, New York, New York] and then, and you finished seventh and eighth grade--
Speaker 2: Stitt Junior High [I.S. 164 Edward W. Stitt School, New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: --early.
Speaker 2: --school, 164.
Speaker 1: Stith [sic.] Junior High School?
Speaker 2: And then I went from there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to The High School of Music & Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now in your elementary and, well in, well the latter part of your elementary school years and in junior high school did you have any mentors or any, any teachers that really stick out?
Speaker 2: Well I remember that when the fourth grade ended at the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York], the school year was, it was still another month of school for, for public school but they wouldn't put me in the fast track because my arithmetic skills were very poor.  And I remember a teacher named Miss Helfand, H-E-L-F-A-N-D, who didn't think I belonged there in that slow track and she would give me special tutoring after school to make sure that I caught up so that by the time I got in the fifth grade, they would put me in the fast track where she thought I belonged.  And that was very unusual I think for a white teacher to, to pay particular attention to a black child at that time because they thought that I was misplaced and that I wouldn't learn as much as I was capable of if they kept me in that slow track.  And that usually, if you got in the slow track, you stayed in the slow track.
Speaker 1: Why did they put you in a slow track anyway?
Speaker 2: Because I didn't--
Speaker 1: You didn't--
Speaker 2: --have my arithmetic skills.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, Little Red School Houses is kind of weak on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They look for excuses, you know, to keep us back (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, the Little Red School Houses didn't, didn't do as good a job in teaching you mathematic.
Speaker 2: No, that wasn't as, that wasn't the priority, apparently the emphasis wasn't there.  I think it was long division, I didn't know how to do long division, they hadn't--that wasn't part of the curriculum.
Speaker 1: And that's something that you have to do as a rote skill--do it over--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and over again to get it right.
Speaker 2: And I was never good at memorizing anything.  I remember getting in trouble in high school in [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] because, what is the, the math that has a hypothesis?  And then you ha- you prove the hypothesis and come back to, you have to prove the hypothesis by going through a certain number of learned steps.
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't (laughter).
Speaker 2: Is that algebra or geometry?  I think it's algebra.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 2: But I remember flunking an arithmetic class because the teacher thought I was cheating because I couldn't memorize the steps.  I could always, by using my own logic, this is my father's [James Burchett Thomas] influence, by using my own logic I could prove the hypothesis, but I was making up my own steps, I went through my own thought processes to prove that this formula was correct and she wouldn't accept it, because she said I had to learn it this way.  They would have fired her in this day and age I think.
Speaker 1: I don't know now they--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: They, it depends on where you're at, I think they pretty much still try to teach the steps in order.
Speaker 2: That just rote learning.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And to me, knowledge is not a matter of memory, it's a matter of thought process.  The only other thing I was in trouble for in school was digging too deeply into one thing, asking too many questions when they want to move on to the next thing.  I wanted to know why, and now I think that's allowed more in school, but back in my day, I was a troublemaker, I slowed things down. I wanted to understand and, I don't need those, I don't need 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 202791
Speaker 1: When you were in public school [in New York, New York], were you in school with mostly other black students or was it mixed or what?
Speaker 2: It was definitely majority white because of the schools that I went to.  If I had, had gone to the schools in my neighborhood they would have been predominantly black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But I moved up the hill and gave a false address so I could go to a different, (laughter) better school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when did your family move to [Washington] D.C. again?  How, how old were you when they moved to?  Now, you you, you were already in high school when they moved to D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, I was half way through high school when they moved to D.C. and that was, had to have been in '42 [1942], and what had happened is my mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] had been, had left New York to look into the possibility of setting up, what do you call it?  Lip reading courses in the public schools in the District of Columbia.  She'd gone to see about getting that job and she didn't get it and the day she came back, well I don't know if she was there for a week or a few days or whatever, that was the day that she walked into an apartment--house that had no roof on it because there'd been a fire in the house and we were, the family had moved out within those few days and were living with an uncle while we got ourselves together and so that was a decision that was made that instead of starting all over in New York, that they would move to D.C.  Mother didn't get that job, but she got another job, daddy [James Burchett Thomas] eventually got another job also working in the government in D.C.  The decision was that I should stay in New York because I was going to this very special school, The High School of Music & Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York], that I had to, you know be, you know, submit portfolios and have certain grades and what not to get into and they knew that the schools in D.C. were segregated and that I probably wouldn't have the same opportunity.  So, I stayed in D- in New York, with two cousins and an aunt, but I couldn't get along with the aunt because I was always saying what I thought and I wasn't supposed to and I got in trouble with her.  But I think we were a little bit too much alike and I was a child, I wasn't supposed to be answering back and what not. And I wasn't bad, I just spoke my mind.  For example, my mother's oldest sister had said that it was alright to wear lipstick or rouge as long as nobody knew that you had it on, that if you, if you wore it artistically enough, that you just looked healthier and I remember going to church one Sunday morning and coming back from church and my aunt said to me, ooh, must be really chilly out there you look so healthy and I said, oh no that's not healthy that's Tangee natural lipstick on my cheeks and my lips and she forbade me, you know she called me a bad name and what not, I was just too big for my britches sort of thing and I shouldn't be wearing that.  I was in high school, half way through high school, (laughter), and her daughter, oh no, that was, that was not the time her daughter got in trouble.  I wrote to my mother and I said I can't stay up here with her that was just one incident that I can speak of, but there were others, but I was in trouble for--you know, we were, we had been taught to discuss things and things that had to do with our own lives and I really talked about it and parents made an attempt to make us understand what their decisions were, but we always abided by their decisions, but we always discussed things.  You didn't do that in most households at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, I was always in trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She blamed the Little Red School House [Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York] for a lot of it but it was also the family (laughter) and I, so I ended up writing to my mother and father and saying, "I wanna come home," and they let me come home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I finished up high school in Washington.
Story_ID: 202792
Speaker 1: Now, before we can get into [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], I want to go back to whenever it was that you first started producing art and--
Speaker 2: I have a picture from the African American paper of me at age twelve, it says little miss [HistoryMaker] Lilian Thomas [Burwell], the artist.  I think I always thought I wanted to be an artist even though I didn't think I could draw, which is strange.  It was strange for that time, because the things I drew didn't look like the thing that I was drawing, it was my version of something, I was always a little bit off, taking it somewhere else.
Speaker 1: It was an age when representational art was, was--
Speaker 2: Was in, they had--it was something in the [New York] Daily News where it, there was a picture of a profiled person and it said draw me and send the picture in and then you could come to this art school.  I was drawing that figure forever and ever and ever; I never got into their art school, but--
Story_ID: 202793
Speaker 1: So, [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School], Washington D.C., this is one of the famous Dunbar high schools in the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, Thurgood Marshall went there, we've heard a quite a few very prominent graduates of, of Dunbar.  You know, that was the advantage of the segregated high schools because--of the segregated schools--because there was such a lack of opportunity for our intelligentsia, to teach in the universities, you know hardly any, any of the teachers who were really qualified could teach in the universities except Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], there was Howard in Washington, then they, they, they filtered into the segregated high schools and every teacher you had was like another parent, you know, by time you got home on a Saturday or Sunday, your parents knew that you had raised your voice on the streetcar, 'cause you were making too much noise, or that you were running when you shouldn't have been running or something like that, because everybody was your family.  And, I won't trade it for anything now, wouldn't trade it for anything. And Dunbar in particular prided itself in having college preparatory courses and I mean we were whipped into shape whether we liked it or not. And the fact that the community was a small community of blacks, your teachers knew your parents or knew who they were at least and they knew how to get to them if you didn't behave in class, they, your parents had the information before you even got home.  And everyone was raised, it was literally the whole village was raising each child and there was tremendous advantage to it.  I don't know that I ever realized it really until after my daughter had come out of school.  She changed colleges three different times, I didn't want her to go to an all-black school because I thought that was not the reality of life, I felt she needed to be prepared to compete in what the reality of the entire, of the, of the world was, that when she went looking for work, it was not going to be just among her people, necessarily.  And the school that came closest to satisfying both of our needs was Lincoln [University] in Jefferson City, Missouri, because the schools had become desegregated at that time, she, the--Lincoln was about the best college level school in that whole area, white or black, so most of the classrooms were evenly divided, fifty-fifty, black and white, but the campus life was black and of course she wanted that socialization of being among her people and that was the compromise that we reached, she went to Lincoln.  And years later, hearing adults talk about their experiences in the historically black colleges [HBCU] and the kind of nurturing that they benefited from and being those easily compensated for any of the short comings that might have existed in some cases academically, and I think that they're stronger human beings as a result of it.
Story_ID: 202794
Speaker 1: What happened at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?  I mean, how did you fit in at that time in Dunbar High School?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  There was--I came from what was considered one of the old Washington [D.C.] families.  Washington was at that time and maybe still is to some degree, very conscious of class differences based on who you were, the color of your skin, the shade of color that you were and all of that stuff, and I had not been raised like that at all.  And, I remember feeling very wounded at some of the situations that I ran into where my best friend, because she couldn't present the credentials, was left out of situations, so I just refused to go and participate in them at all and I was--your real institutionalized rebel and I wasn't particularly interested in belonging to any group at all and there were, there were, were children that were, were in school at the same time with me who were the offspring of people that my mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] had gone to school with and I had two or three very close friends in that group, but they were what I call real people, who were genuine.  And they didn't value people according to what groups they were in or who they knew and the education of their parents and all of that.  I ran into trouble because I'd grown up in New York [New York] where the values were, were much broader.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I wouldn't have fit in even if I had chosen to.
Story_ID: 202795
Speaker 1: How was the art instruction [at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?  Did you find any, was there any support for what you were doing?
Speaker 2: There wasn't anything that they could give me at Dunbar, I was very fortunate in having, because I'd gone to Music & Art High School [The High School of Music & Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & the Arts, New York, New York] for two years, and that was more advanced than many of the college art courses so, I had--I was very fortunate in that I had an art teacher who let me do anything I wanted to do and I did huge murals while I was there, and she let me explore and we worked together on projects almost as if we were partners. But I also went to Armstrong [Manual Training High School, Washington, D.C.], which was a few blocks away from Dunbar, to take some of the courses that they offered so that I could take things that Dunbar didn't offer.  They didn't have an emphasis on the fine arts, it was just a studio art class period, so I went over to Armstrong and I took, I learned different craft skills there ceramics, I learned, I took drafting, so that's what happened there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Armstrong was more of a, a--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --vocational--
Speaker 2: It was like a manual--
Speaker 1: --manual.
Speaker 2: They called manual training.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, m--manual training school, right.
Speaker 2: But they were also college preparatory.  I mean I know, you know a lot of my best friends went onto college from Armstrong.
Speaker 1: Okay, Armstrong is one of the oldest black schools in--
Speaker 2: It is?
Speaker 1: --[Washington] D.C., I think it is yeah.  I think it was there back in the 19th century, one of--yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I do believe.
Speaker 2: And the other school was Cardozo [Senior High School; Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], I don't, I didn't know anybody that went to Cardozo.

Speaker 1: Did you find any teachers that were interested in you at all at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] that could really help you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Well, it was inherent because some of the same people were there that had taught my mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] actually, I'm trying to think of the name of that speech and drama teacher and you--the, the really good influence was that this sense of not letting your parents down because somebody knew who your parents, your teacher knew who your parents were so they wouldn't let you get away with anything, and so you had to, you know, you had to put your best foot forward, it was a matter of family pride, and that was a tremendous advantage there at Dunbar.  And they were very finely equipped teachers too, I learned well while I was there.  And nobody gave me any leeway.  I was basically lazy, I was smart in my head, but I didn't wanna do the work and I couldn't get away with it there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They made me produce.
Speaker 1: So did you, did you achieve any honors at Dunbar when you were a student there or?
Speaker 2: I didn't get in the honors society, but I did get, I won an [Benevolent and Protective Order of] Elks oratorical contest, and things like that, I'd always go special awards in art and, you know, specific subject matters like that, you know, a piece of paper that said certificate of honor of something and I still have my little pin from the Elks oratorical contest, but.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was always good in creative writing too, so I did, you know, that was a--another natural thing, it didn't, didn't take any effort unless the less effort I used, the better the writing was, if I started thinking too hard, then it started sounding stiff.
Story_ID: 202797
Speaker 1: Now did you, so you knew you wanted to be an artist, did you think of, when you were getting towards your senior year, did you know where you wanted to go to school?
Speaker 2: At that time Pratt [Institute, New York, New York] was arguably as they say, the best art school in the country and maybe the world.  So I always struggled, that was, that was my goal, was to get into Pratt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it turned out well.  If you were a student at Pratt, if you applied for a job in the summer, if it was in the art field, they didn't even bother to look at your portfolio, they knew that you were good if you were at Pratt.  And I wasn't that good, you know, which was fine, it gave me a chance to prove myself once I got in.  I got a government job as a matter of fact, after I had graduated, based purely on the fact that I had gone to Pratt, you had to be, a scholarship student to get in there, about two thirds of all your scholarship--all of your tuition was scholarship money, the other third, my mother's [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] oldest sister, her husband was also my godfather, the two of them--my family was still struggling financially when I was in school, college, a part of my tuition, it was not scholarship, they paid, they also paid for all my art materials--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and for my books.
Speaker 1: Where was Pratt?
Speaker 2: In Brooklyn [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: In Brooklyn, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It's still there, but it's a huge campus now.  They didn't even have dormitories when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went back to New York [New York] for college in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as soon as I could get out of [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], I got back.  I couldn't handle the segregation here in [Washington] D.C., so I went back to Pratt.  I met the man that I married while I was still a student at Pratt, and refused to even go back to Washington, refused to go back to Washington to get married, I made my family come to New York.  I said my friends are here, I don't like Washington, that's not my home, so my family came up to--New York, for me to get married and I stayed up here, I mean stayed up there in New York and--
Speaker 1: So your--
Speaker 2: --I didn't go, come back to Washington until I'd been married and I had a daughter who was then four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't want to come back then.
Story_ID: 202798
Speaker 1: So was your husband an artist too?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or is he--
Speaker 2: He was an engineer.  As a matter of fact we were both in school when we got married and we, let's see he was, when did he go in the [U.S.] Army?  I met him right, right after World War II [WWII] and we moved into public housing that was built just for veterans who were in school and had a family.  I didn't have a family at the time but I was pregnant when we moved in there so--
Speaker 1: Well let me just go back and--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --pick up chronology, you graduated from [Paul Laurence Dunbar] high School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] in 19, was it, was it--
Speaker 2: Forty-four [1944].
Speaker 1: --forty-four [1944], okay.  And then you came out of Pratt [Institute, New York, New York] in--
Speaker 2: I only stayed in there two years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: --All right, okay.  All right and--
Speaker 2: And I dropped out of school--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to get married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or was that?  Yeah, I dropped out of school to get married.
Speaker 1: And fortunately that's right after the war?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That you met your--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, that you got married.  Okay.
Story_ID: 202799
Speaker 1: The reason I moved back to [Washington] D.C. was that my mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas]--I had started to leave my husband at, at a certain point and was, I had literally in my head, I had already moved out and he begged me to stay, he said he'd do anything if I would just stay, so I told him to get me out of New York [New York].  I thought some of the influences that he were un--that he was under would be broken and would give us a chance to get a new start.  So I asked him to move us out of D.C., I mean out of New York, to buy me a house, we didn't have two copper pennies to rub together, saved, but he borrowed the money from his mother for the down payment on a house and he applied to, he was working for RCA [Corporation] then and he asked they transfer him out of New York and they gave him a choice of Washington D.C. or California, I think it was San Francisco [California], I'm not sure, but it was somewhere in California, and at that time, my mother was going into the hospital and I was afraid that if we moved out to California, that if she needed me, that I wouldn't be able to get to her, we just didn't have that much money.  At that particular time we were living in low rent housing and we, we were managing, but he was just getting started and so I, I made the choice of going to D.C. in case she needed me.  I said if she needs me and I'm out there, I'll never be able to, you know, fly back and forth, so I moved to D.C. because of that.  She never knew that, all 'til she died, the moment she died she never knew why I came back to D.C. because she knew I hated it.  (Laughter) But things changed, you know, and the, the last word is always that, where you are does not determine who you are, and that you make your life, where you are, that it's, it's within in you.  It's not that much outside of you, and if the circumstances around you are so difficult, it just means that you have to develop the character muscles and spiritual muscles to deal with the reality.  And I don't, don't think that anything that is bad is really bad as long as you learn something from it.  And I find that negative experiences can strengthen you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, you don't know what hot means until you put your hand on that hot stove, that's one way to learn.  (Laughter) You don't put your hand there 'cause your parents say, "Don't put it there," it's hot but you don't know what hot means until you feel hot, and then you know how to handle it.  It's a weird way to grow, but you do grow from bad experiences.
Speaker 2: Well some people do, some, some burn up (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah for sure.
Speaker 2: You know it's, it's a, I guess you have to kinda choose, I mean, I, I understand what you're saying--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --But, you know?
Speaker 1: But there's a point of trust and there's a point in which you really have to learn for yourself and I do believe strongly that that's the natural normal good way to develop.  I mean if, if it was supposed to be any other way, you know we wouldn't be, be having wars now.  From the beginning of time, man has been having wars, if we were all listening to the generation before us, why would we make the same mistakes?  So, it's--we each have to learn our own cycle of reality (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Don't you believe that?
Speaker 2: Hmm, on, on--
Speaker 1: When you're thinking about the logic of it--
Speaker 2: --a level, yeah, but I, that experiences may not always be the best teacher you know?  Sometimes you can, you can pretty much--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well there's a--
Speaker 2: --Figure it out without having to, to experience it.
Speaker 1: --But do you know, to this day, things happened and I'll say to myself, that's what he was trying to tell me.  I'm thinking about something my father [James Burchett Thomas] said, well that's, this is what she means, she went through something like this and she was trying to save me from it.  You know, it--you know, just--I'm still throwing back to remembering things that were told me, that I had to find out for myself and, and I don't think I have to make mistakes anymore, I think I've probably made enough already to have learned enough to survive.  I'm still an optimist, you know, I'm still--the marriage was really an abusive marriage and I'm still a romantic, I'm still in love with love, I'm still in love with life, I'm still an optimist.  If I met the right guy, I'd marry him tomorrow, (laughter), if he could put up with me.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, that's great.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He's out here someplace.
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: He's out here someplace.
Speaker 1: Yeah maybe, who knows (laughter)?
Story_ID: 202800
Speaker 1: So there's a period of time when you were not, you eventually went back to school right?  At some point and picked up your--
Speaker 2: Actually I taught for many years before I went back to school, I talked them into--Pratt [Institute, New York, New York] was such a fantastic school.  I started teaching in the [Washington] D.C. public schools on the condition that I would go back--I didn't even have my, my bachelor's degree, but I had, I had taught, I'd been teaching in settlement houses in New York [New York], where else had I taught?  I'd, I had, I had, had taught private classes, I had experienced teaching and I knew that I knew what I was doing and I knew that I wasn't in a system that was gonna pay me.  When my husband and I split, I was--he never wanted me to work, he just wanted me to take care of him, keep house and so, I--the only reason I started teaching again, was that when I'd transferred my daughter over to a certain school, they said they did not have enough teachers, was there anybody there who had a certificate to teach and I said, well I didn't have my certificate, but I had all the courses that were necessary.  Pratt was so good, I had had child psychology, educational psychology, group psychology, all the, the--we actually took a six--took six years' worth of credits in four years.  So in those two years, I had just, I had more than enough in art, more than enough in education, so all I had to do was convince somebody that I had what it took to do this teaching and I would get a job, but I didn't have that bachelor's.  When I came to D.C., they said well, well yeah, this really looks great.  I had more courses in education and in art than anything that they required in the public school system, so they gave me the job but they said, we're gonna, we're gonna glue you down here on this particular step until you get that degree.  So I went to school at night to D.C. teachers college [Miner Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], what was in D.C., teachers college, which initially, eventually became the University of the District of Columbia, until I got my degree and then I went--I never stopped going to school all the time I was teaching because I was always curious.  I went--by then I'm ready to get my, I wanted to paint full time so I, I took a sabbatical year so that I could spend the time working my studio and use getting my Masters of Fine Arts [MFA] degree as a easy way to do it without writing out reams and reams of reasons that I thought this would work.  And so I got my MFA, I was a grandmother by then and then I still kept taking a course in print making here or something else there just to keep, continue learning.  I was always going to school, as a matter of fact, I'm going to school in September (laughter) here coming up, at age seventy-seven I'm gonna go over to Maryland Institute of Creative Arts [sic. Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland], college of arts, Maryland Institute College of Arts, because I'm curious about what I can do with the new limitations of my body and still be able to create something three dimensionally.  And so someone talked to me, a guy who lives across the road was a former staff photographer for the New York--for the Washington Post [Washington, D.C.] and he went back to school last year and he told me about some computer program by which I could translate something that I did onto a computer into a three dimensional form.  And I couldn't understand exactly what he was talking about, so I'm gonna go back to school and find out what it is, to see what I, I've got to explore someway to continue to produce, if I'm not producing art, it's like someone's clogged up my airway passages, I've got to be making something.
Story_ID: 202801
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of fine art, I mean when did you start, you know creating works to exhibit?  I know you started a long time ago, doing art but when did you really get serious about fine art?
Speaker 2: When did I turn professional, in other words?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, yeah that's.
Speaker 2: After my husband and I separated, the struggle to get my daughter through school is really all on me, I wasn't making enough money teaching were I was, which was in the parochial school, it was like doing missionary work.  So, I went into the [U.S.] government in--as an exhibit specialist and publication designer and made some really, really good money, but it was doing commercial art basically and it was being the hands for somebody else's ideas and I was always feeling very restrained and those were the years that was in the '60s [1960s], from '64 [1964], to '67 [1967], that's when I started to begin to paint seriously.  I'd stay up half the night and go into work the next morning with my eyes half shut because I'd felt like somebody was just pushing this creative part of me into a box and so that's when I --began to work, and that's when I began to exhibit.  And that was in the mid-'60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I got out of the government as fast as I could.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: As soon as she was comfortably able to keep herself in school, then I went back to teaching art.
Story_ID: 202802
Speaker 1: The students were my patrons, they were the ones that gave me my bread and butter so I could continue to paint and not feel restricted by anything, not feel that I had to make a living at, at making art because that in itself could be a restriction.  That would mean I would have to produce what the market was hot with at that time.  I remember going to a gallery who desperately wanted me to be in their stable, that said, well I, "When you've painted a dozen like this, then come back," I said, maybe when I'm on the next one, it will give me an idea for something else.  I didn't wanna feel a restriction of having to follow what their market demanded.  And so, the, the creating of art is my liberation and not being connected to a gallery, not feeling that I had to conform to somebody's expectation or to, to depend on what I produced for, for making a living, that's what gave me the freedom to go anywhere I wanted to go.  And it was like you can't chain my spirit, it was like, 'cause I'd fought all my life to be able to let it fly and don't put a string around my ankle, you know.  So, I found other ways to sustain myself outside of the work, you know, I was constantly plowing something under to make something else come out it.  The, the thing that my husband left me when we separated was the house that we had bought together, and I started learning about finances.  Now, I couldn't have kept the house if I hadn't remortgaged it, gotten a secondary mortgage on it and I couldn't even keep that up while I was teaching at the parochial school without taking a tenant in and it wasn't a house, it was made for other people to live in.  My daughter and I moved into the basement so that the tenant could have the room upstairs, the larger bedroom upstairs and the two of us slept in a tiny bedroom that we had to walk over each other in order to get to sleep at night, because I had a--I had made a trundle bed.  I started making furniture, always it was something that I didn't have that made this, that allowed me to come up with an idea--most of the furniture in this room, I've made, I, I don't think I've got a thousand dollars' worth of furniture in this entire house.  These chairs that we're sitting on were four of a set that I got at K-Mart that cost thirty-nine dollars and I stripped 'em, recovered the seats, the same guy that carved that table for me, carved these things to make it match things on the table.  These were cou--these sectionals were my mother's [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] covered in velveteen with little spindly legs and I, I made knew legs for it, took a course in re-upholstery, because I couldn't afford to get the upholstery done.  I designed and basically built that couch over there, I started with a mattress, that I made from scratch that piece of furniture over there.  I've been building furniture since my daughter was little because I, we couldn't afford furniture and my husband was spending money on guns and outboard motors and, knowing that whatever he didn't provide for me, I was somehow gonna make it out of nothing--
Speaker 2: How did you--
Speaker 1: But that was my joy and that's what made me continue to, it was part of my breathing, was being able to make something and get all, I wouldn't believe it myself when I knocked out my first wall, you know, and said gee, I did that, even though I had been sitting in a corner crying when I first started and didn't know what to do.  The hardware store people knew me because I would say, "Now what do you do with this?"  And they would--I'd go in the hardware store and everybody would gather around and say there's that woman who's trying to build her own house, you know and it was very exciting to me (laughter).
Story_ID: 202803
Speaker 1: How did you learn how to work with wood?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Because my husband wouldn't (laughter).  There was no furniture in my daughter's room, she had a--when she got out of her youth size bed, the bed, the bedroom was very small and she was at an age where she wanted friends to come and spend the night sometimes, so I went to Salvation Army and bought what was called a flat spring and I built a rectangle of two by fours and took the, the flat springs off of the bars and stapled them into the frame and put that up on hairpin legs, made another one underneath there with castors on so I could roll that out, she basically had a trundle bed.  I bought one chest of drawers and built, I didn't even know how to use tools, I couldn't hammer a nail straight, so I got "L" brackets and screws and--in those days, if you ordered your lumber at a lumber yard and told them exactly where you wanted the cuts, they would cut it.  So basically all I had to do was design the thing and tell 'em, twelve inches, twelve inches, sixteen inches and then I had all the parts. My husband said he would build this stuff after I got all the stuff there, well after it sat there for a year, I decided I'd better try to find out how to put this thing together and that's how everything I've done has come about from not having the answer that was what I wanted, or was the easy answer, then I said, well the only way I'm gonna do it, get it was to find a way to do it, so that's how I started.  And I've been building furniture ever since.  The only real legitimate thing I've done was that chest over there, so I think I'd like to learn how to use shop tools besides those two little hand electric tools.  So, I enrolled in a course at Bethesda Community Center [Bethesda, Maryland] and took a course in cabinetmaking. And it's been fun.  I mean that's where I've got the--I'm never content to just let something be as it is, I'm always saying well, this, I could solve this if I have another little something there and so, if I could find it in a store, it would be more than I could afford, so I'd just make it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's fun.
Story_ID: 202804
Speaker 1: --[I] started off with a very academic approach to art according to the things that I had learned in school, which were very, very important, you know, color theory and two dimensional concepts, three dimensional concepts, blah, blah, blah and my work at first was almost photo realistic.  I always compared what I was painting or drawing to what the thing actually looked like. Then when I got married I hardly did any work at all, I think I took a--little course in the evening in painting just to get back into it, but I basically was just painting pretty pictures and then it was during a period of time, I can't remember just the years that there was a gorilla who won a prize in painting at the Cannes Art Festival, somebody splattered paint on the floor where a canvas lay and this gorilla ran a bicycle back and forth through it, nobody knew how that thing had come about, but he got the prize, and I thought it was hilarious, and this was the same time that, that the action painters were coming in, you know, very abstract, expressionistic, just looked like they just threw paint on canvases and I'm looking down my nose, my very superior academic nose saying, those people don't know what they're doing. And at a point I realized that my snobbery was really ignorance, I didn't know what they were doing because I didn't know what they were doing and I felt that I needed to subject myself to one of these abstract expressionists and I started working in the studio of Benjamin Abramowitz who was--I'd never even seen his work but I heard that he was a phenomenal teacher.  And I remember going into the studio and setting up a very comfortable little still life and setting up my easel with a canvas on it and the, the initial academic approach to doing a still life would be to charcoal your shapes and approximately where they went and then you would do a turpentine wash, a little bit of color in turpentine to sort of block out where your colors would be and then you would start to seriously paint into that.  So, just as I get my still life up and I pick up my charcoal, Ben comes by and says, "What are you doing?  What are you painting?"  I said I'm painting that still life and he took his hand and brushed the still life aside--
Speaker 2: Okay was it?
Speaker 1: --and said, "No, that's what you're painting, that canvas," (laughter), you know I panicked, you know, "what am I gonna put on a canvas?"  He said, "Put some paint on it."  "What color paint?"  And it was like hey, you know, I don't know he just said, "Anything, it doesn't matter," and so I just took the brush and put a little dab of paint on it and I looked at him and saying, said, "now what?"  And he said, "You tell me?"  (Laughter) "You tell me what next."  And he said, "Well, are you satisfied with what you've done?"  And I said, "No, not really, it's a little--it's too bright," and he said, iIf something's bright and you don't want it that bright--how and without changing it, how can you subdue it?"  So I said, "Well I guess you'd put something brighter next to it," he said, "Now you've got it."
Story_ID: 202805
Speaker 1: And I began to build a painting just like a conversation builds. I can say something to you and realize it's not quite clear, I can't take back the words I said but I can modify it, I can explain it further by what follows.  And abstract expressionism works just like that.  You put something down and it's like a conversation, you put, you act and you react and you build and you're really working almost from an unconscious thing because you're just working with form.  Now what was very interesting to me is that I found in many later years that I was painting things because they came out of me.  I didn't know why I was doing them but I was doing them, so that paint was representing something of me, I didn't find out that until years later, when somebody would come up and start telling me what a painting that I had done was.  I didn't know that that's what it was, but I knew that there were things that were true of me.  And this happened after a period in which I had decided--oh, I was dating this guy and he had a grown daughter who was very, very intelligent and very sensitive and she always had an opinion about something and I had this little open house--open studio show at my house and she came over and she looked on the walls, and she had no comment.  I said, "Well what do you think?"  And she said, "I don't know, I don't know anything about art."  I said, "That's a cop out, you have an opinion about everything, I wanna know what you think of my work," and she said "well, it just, everything is on a surface," she said "I think that there's more to you than I see on that canvas." And it was kind of a backhanded compliment, but I made a decision that if there was something more, then maybe I should try to discover what it was.  So I stopped going to galleries, I stopped looking at other people's work.  I just said, I'm gonna just start working from something that's inside of me and see what happens.
Story_ID: 202806
Speaker 1: At that particular time I loved to garden, didn't have much money so I would sometimes take a plant and divide it at the root or maybe I'd cut stems off and let it root and I was very much involved with digging in the soil and as I worked with this it was very relaxing and very therapeutic, I became particularly aware of the evolving cycles of nature, you know, it was like, you know there's a root and from that comes a stem and from that comes a leaf and then from there comes a bud which makes a seed which starts a root again, you know, falls to the ground and everything in nature seemed to be cyclical and I just became completely immersed with that sensitivity.  When I started painting, I started painting a form that I saw in nature, I would just start from this thought, I would just start looking at a plant and not look at it anymore, I wasn't looking at this in a painting, but just, I'd say well this is, and you see most of my early work from that period or from platforms, you know, especially that green period, you know with the leaf and what not.  But I, it was my effort of really getting, you know what--addressing something that came out of me and not anything else on the surface.

Speaker 1: The thing that affected me then was--meanwhile going back to school, I got my M.F.A. at Catholic U [Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.] and America U [American University, Washington, D.C.] and I had retired from teaching in 1980, not more than three or four months after I stopped teaching, my mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas]--my mother was diagnosed with leukemia and the doctor, as old as she was, that's usually something that happens in childhood, but I was told that she only had a few months to live and that--she'd either be in a hospital part of the time or put her into a nursing home, well no, I was gonna bring her home and take care of her.  Well this bothered her because she knew that all my life I'd been working and teaching so I could get to this point where all I needed to do was paint, so she fought me, she didn't want me to bring her home for me to take care of and I had to convince her that if she didn't allow me to take care of her in the last period of her life, that when she died, I would have this tremendous debt, and that she had to allow me this opportunity to, to do for her wh--what she had done for me all her life.  So, I continued to paint, but what happened was--
Speaker 2: Now, I've got it, he's got it (unclear), okay.
Speaker 1: When my mother was ill, when she died I was painting on a painting that, and I continued to work and I really put on a really good show, she--I, I arranged things so that I could roll her up in her hospital bed and she could watch me and see me through--the studio was attached to the back of the house and I had French doors there that could open up and she could see that I was working and I put on a really good act for her, you know, of continuing to work.  But when she died, I ran into this dry spell, I just, I just couldn't work, you know, for a long, long period of time I couldn't work and so after I got her estate settled and everything, I started, I did my first bathroom, that was like therapeutic, I could work with wood without having to solve a problem.  She had a huge mirror in her house and I put it on a wall in this tiny bathroom that I had to make the bathroom look bigger, but it looked very cold, ohh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was working on a piece that, oh the mirror, I put the mirror up in the bathroom and it looked too cold and too rectilinear, so I took some wood and I outlined it and said that's just gonna be a frame, so I just kept on going adding more shapes and more shapes, and more shapes, and I, I completed an entire sculptural bathroom, every inch of the wall is covered with either mirror or wood and it was tremendous feeling.  I hadn't worked like that with wood forever, never had done it before.
Story_ID: 202808
Speaker 1: I was describing this mirror that I had built shapes around with other mirrors 'til I had a, really a sculptural bathroom. When I went back to the painting that I had been working on when mother [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas] died, it was a section of the painting that I couldn't make work.  I tried light it didn't work, dark it didn't work, no matter what I did it didn't work, my natural response was to get rid of it, I'd been cutting wood, right?  So I took an X-Acto knife and cut out the section that didn't work and then of course the canvas collapsed so I had to build a form behind it so that I had really a rectilinear, almost a square painting with a big shape cut out of it and I was very, very tickled with the concept that here was something different that was gonna work.  So, the next painting that I did, I started from the get-go to construct a shape and put canvas over it, and so the work continued to evolve like that.  One day a critic came to my studio, someone whose opinion I respected very highly, who told me that he thought my work was too tight, he said, I was like someone who'd climbed to the top of the mountain and was ready to fly but I wouldn't let go.  So, I took that to mean that I needed to work, if I started working large then I couldn't be picking at shapes and, and being too tender and dear with what I was painting, so the first large painting I did was a six, this six panel piece you see behind me--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was to be just six panels flat on a wall until two relatives who visited the studio one day and started playing in and out of the shapes before I had done anything with them and I said "No, it's to be on a wall, on the floor."
Speaker 2: Now what we can do here, [Edgar] Carey [Lane] if you can pull out a little bit and just show some of that, 'cause we often do this with artist we--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --we don't do it with anybody else but--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --we, we got some room here, so if, if you could pull back and we can see some of the work behind you and--
Speaker 1: Do you want me to move?
Speaker 2: No, no, no that's fine.  So I think the people watching this can see, this is a few panels hooked together and, I mean they're like hinged together and it's three dimensional actually, so we're looking actually through that piece behind you to a painting on the wall behind you.
Story_ID: 202809
Speaker 1: This piece which I've named 'Masai' because my grandson told me that one of the shapes reminds him of the continent of Africa, is made--I cut the shapes out of sugar pine, which is a very soft pine, something like balsam wood, very light weight and soft.  Carved the shapes and I hollow out the backs to some degree so they won't be too heavy, then I stretch canvas over the shapes and then I paint the canvas, and I call it sculptural painting.  But most of my work nowadays or it has been the last few years, this type of work, which is sculptural painting, the retrospective show that I had a Hampton University Museum [Hampton, Virginia] in '97 [1997], showed the progression of my work from that abstract expressionistic period all the way up through this and to the, the work that I do that are complete where I do complete environments of these shapes so that a person could walk into the painting when they walk into the gallery.  The paintings as, or the sculptural pieces are arranged all throughout the gallery so that you can move in and among them and they're floor standing shapes.
Speaker 2: Okay now, about how large is this?  We can't really--
Speaker 1: The one, the one that--
Speaker 2: --tell there's nothing around
Speaker 1: --you're looking at here, I think that the width of it, if you go from the tip of that red shape to the tip of the blue green, is probably about three and a half feet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But now with my physical limitations, if I work in that manner they'll have to be smaller pieces so that I can lift them.  I don't work with a studio assistant.  Every once and a while I'm lucky and I can train someone to stretch the canvas over the shapes, but it's very difficult and you can imagine it's not a rectangle that you're stretching canvas over, it's--it takes a lot of practice to get--
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause they're--
Speaker 1: Too be able to do it.
Speaker 2: --they're really tautly stretched over--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the wood.
Speaker 1: It's a combination of almost sewing skills, if you know how to put a gusset in a, under a sleeve of a dress or something and you know how to clip a piece of fabric to make it bend in shape, there's a combination of skills that allows you to do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And of course if you use linen instead of cotton, there's so much shrinkage, when you put the, the ground on the adjesso [ph.] that there's a certain amount of stretching, shrinkage will occur.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it makes it--
Speaker 1: So it will help it form around. But I don't rely on that because I've been using cotton which doesn't shrink that much.
Story_ID: 202810
Speaker 1: Is this primarily acrylic paint?
Speaker 2: That's oil.
Speaker 1: Oil?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I went from acrylic when I was working with the really large shapes, the floor standing installations, I worked with acrylic, but I find that the oil colors are much richer.  All during the years that I was painting with acrylics, meanwhile the industry advanced enough so that I could mix certain media with the oil paints which would allow them to dry quickly.  The appeal of the acrylic to me was because I worked, I like to work quickly and if I get an idea of what I want some, what to happen, I want to be able to paint right away instead of waiting for oils to dry, but now they're, they have media that you can mix with the oils so that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it dries quickly and I can continue to, if I'm working in the morning on a piece, I can come back to it that same evening without the under color affecting what I'm putting on top.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So for now, the oil is what works for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well that's good information.  So, yeah, these are, you know, it--it's a unique way to work in three dimension, three dimensional painting, I mean it's (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I'm glad that I'm being what?  What is the word I want?
Speaker 1: You're being documented (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm being documented, such a simple word, sometimes things just evade me, words evade me.  I'm being documented so that very often you, you evolve into something that is really your own and unique and then the next thing you know, somebody of greater fame than you starts getting all the credit for this invention and it's really your own.  So now that I'm being documented, then I can be given credit for whatever it is that has come out of me.  There have been times that people have come into my studio and, for instance, have said, don't tell them how you did that, you know, they'll do it too.  I said look, they can take my technique but they cannot take my spirit from me, that, you know was unique, so. And we all learn from each other's experiences, hopefully, at least to some degree, so.
Story_ID: 202811
Speaker 1: Do you have a particular philosophy of art?
Speaker 2: Well I think it's something that I've been expressing as far as myself is concerned all along to you.  But it goes way beyond me, I think that it's extremely important that people address and try to find, find and then address their own unique self.  When I look around and I see the amount of repetition and duplication and, and the derivative way that people use whatever everybody else has done, as long as it's gotten commercial success, they will say, "Oh, I can do that," and they do it instead of searching for their own voice.  I think it is extremely important to search for your own voice, to listen for your own drummers drum beat.  To find what it is about you that is you and not even to make it consciously different from what somebody else is doing but just for it to be you.  I really believe that everybody is creative, they don't use the same medium, but in some way or other there's something about them that they have to contribute that's completely different and you don't even have to feel necessarily that you're contributing, but you do contribute as long as you pursue your own direction, instead of just mimic--you would be bored to death if every time you walked down the street all you saw was your own face.  You'd probably commit suicide at the end of a, a year.
Speaker 1: Sounds like an episode of 'The Twilight Zone.'
Speaker 2: Yes, you know.  The differences in us are the beautiful things that there are about us, or as I said before, I see us all as different facets of the same creation--you see things the way you see them, other people are gonna benefit it--benefit from it.  You know, and you will certainly benefit, because you don't know where you're going.  If you know every step you're gonna take, after a while you wouldn't take 'em, you'd be scared to death.
Story_ID: 202812
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of how your work effects other people, I mean, the people who look at it.  I mean is there a particular thing that you notice?
Speaker 2: I do. I get feedback and that's one of the largest rewards that I get from working, other than just the satisfaction of doing it, knowing that it affects you.  I remember the first large installation piece that I did was at Northern Virginia Community College [Waddell Art] Gallery [Sterling, Virginia] and this little old lady, she was probably the age that I am now, came up to me just smiling and telling me that she'd just had an operation on her eyes, where she had fought with the ophthalmologist for two years, because she was afraid of it and he had finally convinced her, you know to save her sight and to get this operation and she walked up to me in the gallery and she said, "Today, I know why I had the operation."  Well you know, whew, things like that really mean a lot to me.  Another thing, there was a show at Martin Luther King [Jr. Branch] Library [Chicago, Illinois], the galleries were in the basement and so, a lot of the homeless people would sneak in the door when we get--the museum was still open and hide somewhere so that when the cold nights came, they were in a warm place, and I was in an exhibit of Washington [D.C.] sculptures and almost all the pieces were installations, and one of the women that was in the show, went back to the, the early part of the day before the opening of the exhibit to put some little finishing touches on what she had done and she said there was this man that came up to her, a hobo as we used to call them, or--and looking quite disheveled and what not and asked her did she do that piece over there, talking about my work.  And she said, "No," and he said "do you know who did it?"  And she said, "Yes."  And he said, "Do you think that she would mind if I went inside and prayed?"  And she said, "No."  And she said that he very ceremoniously took his coat off and put it on the floor right outside of the piece and disappeared into the piece and she said that she was there for about another hour and he never came out.  And so she, you know, went quietly over there and she said he was on his knees inside of there.  That really affected me, and I said, I must be doing something.
Story_ID: 202813
Speaker 1: Now do you have something that, a message, an intentional message in your work?  Or in certain works, do you have a, in a particular work are you trying to put across a particular message?
Speaker 2: I try--no, I don't have any intention at the beginning, I don't even name the pieces, I don't know what they are, I let them become themselves, especially since I've been working with wood.  Very often the direction, I don't plan things ahead of time, I just take the direction that I feel like going in and that's what you really call freedom.  And I make several shapes and stretch canvas over them and then I'll take several together and say, I'll try this, this way, and this way and it seems to work for me then I say, okay, this is what this will be and then I'll start to paint the individual shapes and put them back together again. But I--and somebody will tell me, like Dorian [Cartwright] told me about that piece, my grandson, that's Africa.  There was a piece and I'll give you a card, I'll put it in packet, it goes in the box that has another piece that's somewhat similar to that, but there were those three shards that you see?  Someone looked at it and said those look like Indian feathers. Well I told you about my ancestor that went back to the [Cheroenhaka] Nottoway Tribe, so I said, well, I'm gonna name this piece Nottoway, that's not the one you see here, but the other one, I'll name it Nottoway in homage to Grace [ph.].  And then I did a second piece with no intention whatsoever, but when I finished it and Dorian told me that that was the continent of Africa, I said, "Well that's the other half of Grace."  And because this document described her as being six feet tall, back in colonial days, I said, you know, she had to be Masai or maybe Igbo, so I just guessed and named the piece 'Masai,' so that's the other half of Grace.  But I'd nev--you know, had, didn't know what I was doing, I had, had no intention when I started out of making it that.  It's--you name a child after it's born, it doesn't change what it is, it's just a name on it, so that's the way I do my work, I don't plan it ahead of time or intend for it to be anything, I just let it become itself, like giving a horse its reins.
Story_ID: 202814
Speaker 1: Okay, now, have you been a part of any of the art collectives that are formed?  I know that in the African American, amongst African American artists they formed the National Conference of Artists [NCA] at one point.
Speaker 2: I belonged to that at one point, National Conference of Artists.  I, and I now belong to a group in New York [New York] called Entitled: Black Women Artists, a couple of groups I started myself when I was in Washington [D.C.] which sort of fell apart after a while.  Washington artists don't seem to have a cooperative sense of things that last very long, I have a friend that I used to teach with, Gail Shaw-Clemons, who went to Settle [Washington], the atmosphere up there was so fantastically conducive to artist groups and into support of sensibility, I don't find it so in Washington, it's there but just to a limited degree.
Speaker 1: What were some of the names of some of the groups that you tried to start in there, that you helped?
Speaker 2: You know I can't, one I'm trying to think of I can't--what did we name that?  Art Smart [ph.] was it?  I think, I--I'm not sure if that was the name of it, but that lasted only a few months, the other group never had a name, I just called people together, as a matter of fact, a couple of times we called groups together and we'd work together on things for a time and then it just sort of dissolved away, we never gave it a name.
Speaker 1: Kay, now what, what is the--
Speaker 2: You thinking of some famous group like the Spiral group in New York and things like that?  I think this in, this group of women artist in, in New York is, it stays together and it stayed together and it does some very important projects periodically, but it's almost too big and too expansive, you never see the same people if you go up for a, a meeting, but they are active and it was a lot, it's a lot things that are getting accomplished by them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a broad range of people who are really neophytes to professionals helping each other out and I think it's a very fine thing.
Story_ID: 202815
Speaker 1: How has the art, the business of art changed in the last--I mean throughout your lifetime, is it bet--are things better now or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know how to answer that because I think that--I just don't know how to answer it.  I've had agents at different times who've, you know, according to what they do for you, or how their orientation changes that ch--I don't have a good basis of, of comparison to say how it's happened through the ages because I, I just wasn't connected at the beginning with anybody.  I wasn't concerned with the business part of it.  At this point I have two or three people, you know, they've sold work for me to some of the large corporations, I've done a commission for a bank in Chicago [Illinois] as a matter of fact, Northern Trust?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's a, you know, they have quite a--you know the, the woman who selected all the work for that, [HistoryMaker] Madeline Murphy Rabb, has represented me and sold some work for me, and I have a huge piece, there five part piece in one of the open stairwells their at, at Northern Trust, you know about that community bank?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: They were (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I've done a lot for that community bank itself.  And, I'm not the person to ask about the business part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well just as an artist, I'm just asking you wh--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --what your per--perception of it was in terms of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--it's been so uneven as far as what happens with black artists.  It's so excluded us in the mainstream, as long as they have two or three tokens, they're happy and they always close the door on everybody else.
Story_ID: 202816
Speaker 1: Do you ever, as an artist that produces big pieces, and we were just talking about the piece at Northern Trust [Chicago, Illinois] and do you ever get--or do you think that--or how do black people stand, black artists stand in terms of public art and percent for art laws and that sort of thing?  Are, are we getting what we need to get from those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We--we're still--black people are still as a whole considered separate.  If we--if they want something by a black person, if it's politically correct then you'll know about it, sometimes you don't even know about.  One of my best friends, one of my collector daughters is Renee Stout and she's nationally well-known so, when, what was it, the people that do gin?
Speaker 1: Seagram's?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was Seagram's.
Speaker 1: Beefeaters?
Speaker 2: I can see it, but I can't think--
Speaker 1: Do--
Speaker 2: --of the name of it.
Speaker 1: --Do it--
Speaker 2: But they have this big contest where they use the, their bottle as a symbol and they have all these artists do an ad that last for a year or something.
Speaker 1: Not Dewar's?
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  Absolut?
Speaker 1: Absolut.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's what it was.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So, you know they called her [HistoryMaker Madeline Murphy Rabb] and invited her to submit something, but I'm sure that in most cases it's somebody that some--somebody has heard of and they will invite them to submit something, so then it's a done deal and then it's very much tokenism, that's my concept of it.  In other cases, if it's an open contest, they do not care or know who you are but it is a contest so people spend a lot of money doing a maquette for a piece of sculpture for example or submitting for a mural and then they've got to be submitted to all these judges who may or may not know much about art, they know maybe there's some representative of community who knows what they would like and maybe there're a couple of art professionals in there and it's tempered to some degree, but there's so much involved in that selection process that, I for one am really not interested in submitting.  There was a contest for art for [Chicago] Midway [International] Airport [Chicago, Illinois] and I spent two months preparing maquettes in a portfolio and, I mean really very involved to submit and I knew that my chances were small because there were emphasis were already decided to be on Chicago [Illinois] artist and I was an outsider so, but I got a notice saying that I missed it by one, you know, I said, you know, it's not worth it to me.  So I don't--to work for a result that depends on somebody else's sensibility is not worth it to me.  I feel that if, that I work for what I, because I have to work, it's like breathing, as I said and for--you can't say that it's just pleasure because it's really painful sometimes and it's expensive.  If it gets the attention, almost in every case that I've gotten any really important exhibits or any really important sales, I didn't go after them, it was some fluke or somebody heard of me or they were familiar with my work or just happened to fall in my lap, so I've gotten to be very non-political and non-competitive about submitting for anything that's chosen by a, a jury. They're who you know, and oh it's just political all the way through, well that's my personal approach to it.  One artist group that I started, we had one big meeting and the whole meeting was a gripe session by highly professional artist who talked about what they went through and what they had to be submitted to, what they had to submit to in order to maybe be selected for something.  And I, you know, I decided no, I am not going to apply for a public art commission, when I've gotten commissions it's been because someone was familiar with my work and said, I know whose work belongs there, like, Madeline Rabb, told the architect who she had worked with him in the design of that building, I know whose work belongs there and she called me on the phone and said, "[HistoryMaker] Lil [Lilian Thomas Burwell], send me a couple of maquettes, we need 'em in two, in two months," I said, "there's no way on earth I can do something in two months," she said, "you've got stuff in your studio you can, you can do it, this is--we need your work here," and so I went and did it and that was it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I don't get involved otherwise, that's--it's very personal.
Story_ID: 202817
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your aunt and you had--your aunt was an artist and--
Speaker 2: Right, I owe everything to her I think, because of the time that--
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Hilda Wilkinson Brown, or Hilda Rue Wilkinson, before she was married.  If it hadn't been for her, I probably would not have certainly gone along this particular route to my art.  At the time, halfway through [Paul Laurence Dunbar] High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] when I informed my parents [Margaret Wilkinson Thomas and James Burchett Thomas] that I wanted to be an artist they thought I had lost my mind, certainly in the '40s [1940s], an African American woman wasn't going to be able to make a living as an artist unless you were in commercial art or design and even then, you know jobs were, did not, you know, did not welcome you in period, you had to sort of you know, burst into doors if you were black.  So my Aunt Hilda said, "Let her teach it," and that was it so, when to Pratt [Institute, New York, New York], I went into art education because of her and she and her husband supported me, they even supplied the part of my tuition that was not scholarship and they paid for my books and they paid for my art materials.  Later in life she told me I was the artist in the family and there was no way on earth that I compared my work with hers, I thought she was just absolutely fantastic, she had been a teacher, but she knew the, how prolific I was, I really devoted a lot of my time and my heart to the art and maybe that's the way in which she looked at it, I don't know, I didn't, I couldn't compare the quality of my work with hers at that time and I never pushed her to ask her why she said that, I just told her that it wasn't so, as far as I could see.  But she did not work a lot, but she worked extremely well, what she did was masterful because I was executor for her, for her estate, I found work behind an old furnace in her basement done on a piece of canvas board and things that she never even signed, she didn't even put her paintings in her will, but she said because I was her executor, she had told me, "Well, I put certain things in my will because I want to be even handed about everything, but anything else you want", you know, "just anything else to say, just ask the people in the family what they want and let 'em have it."  So I, you know, we had that, that personal understanding outside of the written will and I asked, "Did anybody want the paintings?"  Nobody wanted the paintings, nobody wanted the drawings or the prints, it was like, well I don't know where I would put them on my wall, was one of those things.  One cousin wanted a portrait that she had done of her and her sister when they were children, one of them wanted a screen, my uncle asked for a print, other than that nobody spoke up for anything, so I spent a good deal of time promoting her work and she's gotten an awful lot of attention lately.
Story_ID: 202818
Speaker 1: As I said, a couple of years ago I sold a painting of a print [of Burwell's aunt, Hilda Wilkinson Brown], a drawing, rather, a little 12 inch by 18 inch drawing to Chicago Institute of Art [sic. Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] for fifteen thousand dollars.  Everyone who sees her work acknowledges it as being highly professional, she just didn't do a lot of it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but she was really, really strong.
Speaker 2: When did she die?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I've really spent a lot of time trying to get attention for her.
Speaker 2: Hilda Rue--
Speaker 1: I've curated--
Speaker 2: --Yeah.
Speaker 1: --An exhibit of hers.  As a result of the catalogue that I wrote for that exhibit by the way, I got a call from a student at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] asking me who she was, not knowing that I was her niece, apparently the [William E.] Harmon Foundation, when it dissolved, distributed its work among the historically black colleges [HBCU] and someone had found this painting of Hilda's at Hampton and it was their favorite, it was a fantastic piece, but nobody knew anything about her and so somebody had come across this catalogue and said, well this [HistoryMaker] Lilian [Thomas] Burwell knows about her, call her and she, she did a paper on her and what not.  So I have worked through the years getting her some attention.  I've got, you know, several--I've even sold some more work of hers and matter of fact, Harriet Kelly [ph.] is interested in something right now, she's, she's telling me as soon as she gets her money together, she's gonna get this painting and the people at the museum, National Museum of American Art [sic. Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.], have begged me to please leave a piece of her work to them in my will, they, you know, she's really fine, she's really good. And my inspiration in many ways.

Speaker 1: When you look back on your life and work--is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Very often just as I've done something shortly after I've said, well, I should've, could've, would've, but in the full context of it, I'm even grateful for the mistakes I've made because I, I really have learned something from them and have seen that nothing really works against you if you don't look at it that way and, no, there's not anything I would've don--they're things I would've wished that I didn't get, I'm still an Alice in Wonderland, you know, in terms of my sense of reality.  But, I'm content--

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I wish so very much that we would go backwards to the time that we looked out for each other and helped each other move up and I don't mean necessarily in--and probably not at all in material ways, but in terms of helping each other to become our best selves so that no matter where we are on an economic level, that we understand and appreciate the value of ourselves and each other.  I think we've lost that a lot.  I think it probably was more evident in slave time than it is now, that's a sorry, sorry statement.

Speaker 1: And when you think about all the things that you've done, what would you consider to be your legacy today?
Speaker 2: If I could be an example of not giving up, of making that lemonade out of lemons, you know, I would shout it from the rooftops to try to hope that somehow I could let somebody know how they could make something out of very, very little.  Or, really not little, but to understand what is really much and that it's not the things that you have, but the things that you are and what you mean to each other.  I know it probably sounds very ethereal, but I think it's so important and the intellect. We don't do for each other like we used to do for each other.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that, that you want to say that we haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Do you wanna talk (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It was just like put a dime in my mouth and I'll keep going like a machine.  Don't get me started again.  I'll probably think of a hundred things later.

Speaker 1: We have one last question we ask.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's--it's similar to legacy but different--ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: It sounds funny but maybe not to be remembered. If something I've said to you today changes something in the way you think or the way you are for the better, then the next person you touch is a different person, is touched by a different person than they were before I touched you, and if this continues on, and on, and on, I've changed the whole world and nobody has to know where it came from.  But I see it all, the spirit comes through me.  I really see truth as truth and it, we're really just conduits of that.  If I could learn to be humble enough to let that truth come through me, I've got it all.
