That was all of the work they could do there; they're laborers.  I would say, go, just go--just like when I was coming up, that's all I did, was go to somebody's farm and pick cotton.  And I swore if I ever got out of that cotton fields, I never would go back.  And you know what, I didn't go back.

Speaker 1: Now before we go to your father's side, are there any stories from your mother's [Ella Griffin Long] side of the family that the family tells and passes down to--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I know my grandmother [Carrie Griffin] used to whip me all the time, used to have a weeping willow switch.  And I think I have gotten away from her when she got after me, and I go around the building, that thing, shoot, that limb would come around the building and hit me, and I used to holler out, ouch (laughter).  But that's the way it was down--we, I just had a good time coming up because we stayed on a dirt road, red clay.  The county had put rocks on the road for car traction.  That's how I learned how to hit baseball, play baseball, by hitting those rocks away.  My brothers couldn't get me out.  I used to strike out on purpose so my brothers wouldn't quit.  So, that's--
Speaker 1: So you played baseball with the rocks?
Speaker 2: With rocks, rock sticks.  I got a story to tell, and I want you to know about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm, we're gonna get to that.

Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --first, before we go to your father's--
Speaker 2: Only thing, they were good churchgoing people, used to sit in every Wednesday, sit in the house mending a quilt and singing song.  And I got nerve to lead off a song once in my lifetime, and I never will forget, "Swing low, sweet chariot, comin' to carry me home."  It was all about going to church.  We was in church every Sunday.  Grandmother cooked every day.  During the summer I used to take my grandfather [Sam Griffin]--he used to work at Winthrop Training School there in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and I used to take his lunch.  He used to have a horse by the name of Nellie.  And I was some kind of, something proud of that horse.  I just loved that horse.  My granddaddy used to let me go pet the horse but out the--he'd get through eating, he always saved me some food in his pail when I took his lunch to him.  And that was the best food I ever ate in my life, cabbage, cornbread, and we used to have some milk, buttermilk, black-eyed peas.  Talking about some good food, that was some good food, and my grandmother knew how to cook.  But, life coming up in Rock Hill, I would, we were--can I start back when I, when I first remember how things went?
Speaker 1: Now, I'll get you there in a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask a couple more things about--now, did your mother talk about growing up in Rock Hill, what it was like for her when she was coming along?
Speaker 2: Well, only thing I know my mother did, she worked all her life.  She would press clothes all her life.  And the place she pressed clothes, people was crazy about her.  And she was a singer too.  She, everybody knowed her when she start singing.  That's that Ella Long.  Although, my wife is named Ella Long too.  And they said, "That's that Ella Long singing that, singing a song," and everybody would stand and listen when she sung the song.  Well, just about everybody down south could sing because that's what they were known for.  But, I had a good life.

Story_ID: 305182
Speaker 1: Man, I was scared.  I knowed something about I couldn't eat; I couldn't drink water here, you know, water fountain; I couldn't go to this place and that place, and I knowed I couldn't go to school down there, same school, when I was coming up.  And this was back in the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s].  I left in '51 [1951].  I couldn't go to school then, in the same school as whites.  I'm gonna get 'round to Dusty Rhodes.  He was a white ballplayer.  He helped me on the way.  He played for the Rock Hill Chiefs, all-white team, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I heard of him--
Speaker 1: --organization.
Speaker 2: --Dusty.
Speaker 1: I went to pick up a ball and throwed it to him, and I throwed it on line, and Dusty said, told me, said, "Look, can you throw that ball to me like that again? " I said yes.  I said, "I can throw it a little bit harder," and I did.  He told me, "He said man, you need to play, you need to be playing baseball."  He said, "How old are you?"  I said fourteen.  He said, "What?"  He said, "Somebody needs to sign him up."  See, I didn't know nothing about no Negro League until after I talked to, talked to him.  I didn't know nothing about Satchel Paige or Buck O'Neil and Josh Gibson, all these guys.  I didn't know nothing about 'em.
Speaker 2: So they didn't play in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: --in--
Speaker 1: Now, but I knowed about--
Speaker 2: --Rock Hill--
Speaker 1: --Jackie Robinson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I know Jack because '47 [1947] Jackie went to the majors.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And before then, I used to sit back and listen to the radio.  And I want, I wanted to be the white Ted Williams 'cause my daddy loved him.  We said, daddy [William Long] said, "He's the best hitter you ever gonna see."  He said, "If you can learn how to hit like that, you, that's your meal ticket."  I always said, "To where?"  I said, "They're not taking black ballplayers in the majors." I said well--he said well--daddy said, "Yes, they are.  They took, they got Jackie Robinson; they took him to the majors."  I said "Well, that's just, just one person."  Then, here come another ballplayer, Larry Doby, found out he was from down in Camden, South Carolina.  Then they said that he played with the Newark Eagles.  I said, "Who are Newark Eagles?"  I didn't know nothing about the Kansas City Monarchs.  Only thing I know that they was in the majors.  Then, I said I wanted to be a professional baseball player.
Speaker 2: Now, before we go far, I want to take you back to when you were a little kid and how you grew up first.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Now we were, we were starting to talk about that, but--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, well, before we--well, how did your parents meet?  Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 1: In school, from what I gathered.  They all went to a one-room school there in Rock Hill, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's how they met.
Speaker 2: Was there a name for the school that you know of?
Speaker 1: No, I don't remember the name of the school.
Story_ID: 305183
Speaker 1: What was your--you were starting to tell me.  What was your earliest childhood memory?  What's your earliest memory (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, going to West End School [West End Elementary School, Rock Hill, South Carolina].  That's the elementary school there in Rock Hill, and we lived next to the park.  First grade teacher was woman by the name of Ms. Johnson [ph.].  I never will forget it.  She was a nice lady.  I just loved that teacher.  And I know my third grade teacher by the name of Ms. Bassett [ph.] because she was so pretty.  And I just loved that pretty face (laughter).  But we used to play ball at an early age.  We was in the woods now, woods all around.  We played ball at recess in school.  I was a little young fellow now.  I could run.  I could fly.  I can remember that so--bathroom was outside, way on the outside.  And I used to take off running to the bathroom to get the first stall and to do what I had to do in there (laughter).  So couldn't nobody outrun me.  Everybody--when recess come, would come around, I used to take off.  But after school, in the evening, the girls played the boys, softball.  They'd have a softball.  Now we didn't have it; at my house we didn't have no ball, but at school they had the softball.  And I learned how to play ball through by playing softball in school.  On the way up, growing up, I told my brother, I said, "Throw me some rocks, throw me some rocks."  I used to, we used to have a broomstick.  And he'd throw 'em to me.  Three strikes you're out.  I got so I was that good at it, and he couldn't, they, later on they couldn't get me out.  I was so good, I had to stop, strike out on purpose so they wouldn't quit.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they couldn't get a bat unless you, you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --struck out, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  And wear the broomstick out, had pebbles all in the broomstick, wear it out.  We'll go down in the woods and cut a limb off a tree, take it up there and roast it around my grandmother's wash pot and made a bat out of that.  Hit rocks all, hit rocks everywhere, broke out so many windows.  Ain't no point in running.  They knew who did it, knew I hit it down there, and I broke out a window.  So, my daddy, I told my daddy, I said daddy, I said, "Look, can I go out to play baseball?"  He said no.  He said, "You cannot go."  He said, "The reason why you can't go because I want you to stay here and get your education."
Story_ID: 305184
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you first asked your father [William Long] to go play ball?
Speaker 2: Thirteen, thirteen years old.  Then, at fourteen and a half, guy by the name of John William Parker, he was playing baseball with the Nashville Stars.  This was 1950.
Speaker 1: Now was this a black man?
Speaker 2: Black man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good first baseman, couldn't hit too well, but he could pick it (laughter).  He said, "Carl [HistoryMaker Carl Long]," he said, "you need to be going off to play baseball in the Negro League."  I said, "What is a Negro League?"  He said, "That's the same league Jackie Robinson played in."  And I said oh.  He said, "Let me talk to your daddy."  He talked to my daddy.  My daddy said, "No, he gotta stay here and get his education."  He said, "Bill," 'cause that's what, what they called my daddy, Bill; his name is William Long.  He said, "Bill," he said, "look," he said, "the kid is good.  He can throw that ball.  He can run.  He said the hitting, he can learn how to hit."  He said, "Whenever he hit it, he hit it a long way."  So my daddy said, "How he gon' get his education?"  He said, "When season is over with, before the season's over with I'll have him back home."  And that's how my daddy let me go off to play baseball.  When I got to Nashville, Tennessee, in May--
Speaker 1: So you were fourteen and--
Speaker 2: Fourteen and a half, just a little bit over fourteen and a half.  Oscar Charleston was my first manager, Oscar Charleston, greatest first baseman--greatest center fielder that has ever lived that played in the Negro League.
Speaker 1: Now this is 1949 or so?
Speaker 2: No, no, this was 1951.
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], okay.
Speaker 2: He managed the Nashville Stars.  Dr. B. B. Jackson.  He owned the club.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Oscar Charleston taught me everything I needed to know about baseball.
Speaker 1: So your tutor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For the--
Speaker 1: --was the--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Your tutor was the best center fielder that ever played in--

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Oscar Charleston then?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  And now, later on in life, there was some more great center fielders that I know.  There was a guy by the name of Willie Mays.  I learned how to play with him when I was with Birmingham Black Barons (laughter).
Story_ID: 305185
Speaker 1: Oscar Charleston, they sold me to the Birmingham Black Barons in 1951.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, you, you got down there, you were, you say you were fourteen when you went there?
Speaker 1: Fourteen and a half.
Speaker 2: Fourteen and a half?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That would, that'd be about 1950, I guess, right?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 2: Well, no, not yet.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 2: It wouldn't be '51 [1951] yet if you were fourteen.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: It would be '49 [1949] and '50 [1950] or so.  Then they sold you.  You were there how long?  How long were you there?
Speaker 1: In Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I wasn't even there a year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I left there the same year--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and went with the Birmingham Black Barons.  I stayed one month with the Birmingham Black Barons, so I didn't, they'd not--that was the end of the year, 1951.  Ballplayers there named Pepper Bassett, Lloyd "Pepper" Bassett, catcher.
Speaker 2: What's the, what's that last name?
Speaker 1: Bassett.
Speaker 2: Oh, Bassett, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Otha Bailey, called him Little Catch, both of 'em catchers; Doc Dennis [Wesley Dennis], first base; [Eddie] Brooks, second base; Pee Wee Butts, shortstop; O'Harrell [ph.], Harold O'Harrell, third base; guy by the name of Jim Zapp, left field; Henry Kimbro, was in center field when I took it over.  They moved him to right and myself.  Plus they had pitchers on that team; Menske Cartledge; Danny Wright; Searcy Kelly, the one called Jitterbug.  And talk about these guys here, they could throw that ball.  We had a good team down there.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, let me go back a little bit here--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --to Nashville.  Now you get to Nashville and you said John William Parker promised your father [William Long] he'd look after you and everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Then as soon as you get there they sold you to another team.
Speaker 1: No, no, see, when I got there in May, they sold me in August.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, so you were, you did play a season almost?
Speaker 1: Almost.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had one month--I went with the Birmingham Black Barons.
Speaker 2: Was that all right with your father at that point?
Speaker 1: Yes, he knowed about it.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I was back home on time because I had to go back and go back to school.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you started with them the next year, that next year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the reason why I only have two years with the Birmingham Black Barons.
Speaker 2: Okay so you started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But that really--
Speaker 2: --with Birmingham after--
Speaker 1: --altogether I played four years with the Birmingham Black Barons because after they sold me to the Pittsburgh Pirates in '53 [1953], I went with St. John's, Quebec, Canada, Canadian League.  And the, the manager called me and told me, say, in '54 [1954] they called me and told me to come back to Nashville because we're playing against the Campanella All-Stars [Roy Campanella All-Stars], playing against [HistoryMaker] Minnie Minoso, Roy Campanella, Hank Thompson, Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby, Junior Gilliam, Luke Easter, Suitcase Simpson [Harry Simpson], and the first big, big league ball player that I got a hit off was Mudcat Grant.
Speaker 2: Jim "Mudcat" Grant, okay.
Speaker 1: Jim "Mudcat" Grant, and plus they had Bob Trice, they had Don Newcombe.  Now these guys I had to face, and I already--now, in my rookie year I hit twenty home runs up there in Canada.  This is 1954, when I was playing against Campanella All-Stars.  Before the season was over with in 1954, when I come back from going on a barnstorming tour with the Birmingham Black Barons, I hit those guys just like I owned 'em.  Minnie Minoso almost throwed me out going to second base, I hit a ball so hard off the left centerfield wall against Mudcat Grant.
Story_ID: 305186
Speaker 1: Before we pick up your baseball story again, I, something I neglected to ask you.  I want to go back to your childhood a little bit and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --ask you what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  And you were describing some of them as we were--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --in the break here.
Speaker 2: --about the outdoor john, the bathroom toilet we used to have.  We used to dig a hole and put it in the ground and build a building and set it over the hole and put two stalls in there.  And that'd be our toilet.  In other words, when that one would get filled up, we'd go dig another hole, move it over another place.  We had a whole lot of land down there.  And when we had to take a bath, we used to jump in my [maternal] grandmother's [Carrie Griffin], after she washed her clothes, she had three or four tin tubs out there, and we used to go out there and jump in the tin tub and wash off after she washed her clothes.  And we'd go down the woods, although there's a creek down there--call the boys, and we'd go down there and we'd jump in the creek and wash off in the creek, we used to call that the Makari Hill [ph.].  We used to slide down the hill and slide right in the creek, a muddy bank, slide down the--the hill was around about pretty close to twelve stories high.  That's that hill and we slide all the way down.  Sometimes we'll have an old wagon, used to ride down the hill in that wagon, right in the water.  And a lot of times when we go down there and there'll be snakes all over the place.  Some would be hanging on limbs sometimes, and run 'em out of there.  But we'd shoot marbles and stuff like that.  Grandmother used to whip us because we used to have, rub the knee out of our pants.  And she used to warn us about down on our knees shooting marbles.  But at the kitchen table sometimes, we used to have a silver spoon, and everybody used to try to get there first to get that silver spoon.
Speaker 1: It was one silver spoon?
Speaker 2: One silver spoon, but there's a whole lot of other spoons, but that just one silver; everybody trying to get that silver spoon to eat with.  And life was good coming up, had a whole bunch of cousins; plus I had seven brothers.  When I was there, didn't have nothing but four brothers.  Then later on there was three more brothers in life.  But my mother's [Ella Griffin Long] father [Sam Griffin], they took care of us.  My daddy [William Long] was a bootlegger.  He just took care of us.  Three hundred and fifty pounds, whenever he'd tell you to do something, you didn't have no choice but to do it.  That's my childhood coming up.
Story_ID: 305187
Speaker 1: So your father [William Long], that's, he really made most of his money bootlegging, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what he did, plus he had a cafe too.  Big Bill Long, that's what they called him.
Speaker 1: Was his cafe like out in the--did y'all live like out in the country like or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we was in the county, but later on they moved us in the city.  But Saturday night free fries, I'll never forget.  When Louis Jordan  coming out there with a Saturday free fry, that's where we was at, eating fish on a Saturday night, the best fish in the world.  That was the best meal I ever eat.  He fixed hot dogs, hamburgers, and French fries, and hot dogs, hamburgers, and fish, sometimes he'd have chicken.  And partner, so many people be there listening at the jukebox and dancing.  A lot of peoples have gotten killed around there.  And I always said, "Why peoples gotta kill somebody, you having a good time."  I never could understand that.
Speaker 1: A lot of drinking going on--
Speaker 2: A lot of drinking.  And my daddy--I wanted to drink too.  My daddy caught me drinking out of one of his liquor jars, all three of us, William Henry [William Henry Long], Bob [Bob Long], and Seth [ph.].  And my daddy brought us all in there and said, "Sit down and drink."  I'm the youngest one in the bunch.  So, he made us drink out of--put a jar of liquor in front of us and told us to drink.  I got sick as a dog.  Mother [Ella Griffin Long] had a fit 'cause my daddy made us drink that liquor, but I never did, never have drank another drop since.  I can't say that too much about my other two brothers, but I never drank another drop since.  And I got, I think that made a better person.  Now what really made a better person out of me is playing baseball in the Negro League.

Speaker 1: Who did all did your household consist of growing up?  It was, it was your mother and father--
Speaker 2: Mother [Ella Griffin Long], father [William Long], grandmother [Carrie Griffin], grandfather [Sam Griffin], brother Bob [Bob Long], brother Bill [William Henry Long], and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had one, two, three, four, four bed--five bedrooms, a kitchen, and a porch, front porch and a back porch.
Speaker 1: Sounds like that's a big place.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And--
Speaker 1: Is this is this a two-story building or--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --just one--
Speaker 2: --no, no.
Speaker 1: --just one story?
Speaker 2: Had a loft up there.  A lot of times I used to go up in the loft and sleep, 'cause I'm in the bed with two brothers.  And, had a mulberry tree.  I don't know if you know what a mulberry tree is, but a tree with a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, a mulberry--
Speaker 2: --whole lot of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, mulberry, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I used to beat to, beat the squirrels out there, run the squirrels out of there because they eatin' up my mulberry.  Had a big 'simmon [persimmon] tree, had a fig tree, had an apple tree.  And of course, in the woods over there they had more trees that bear fruits.  I used to go over there, and they had chaney-berry [chaneyball; chinaberry] trees--not chaney-berry.  It was cherry trees, wild cherries.  We used to take that and fix, find me an old jar, clean it out real good, and put those cherries in that bottle or jar, whatever, and take a stick, clean it off, peel it, and mash those cherries down in that bottle, add sugar to it, and let it set.  It turns into wine (laughter).  We used to do some of the craziest things.  In the evening, when I got old enough, used go over there and play baseball.  When it got dark we had to quit and go home.  I used to get mad because it got dark, we had to quit.  And just one of my brothers got mad at, got mad and quit playing, I used to get mad then also.  But, partner, I used to do some of the craziest things myself, going to the fairground, having a good time at the fairground, going to see somebody play sandlot, semipro team.  Playing out there, I'm looking at these guys.  I said daddy--my daddy was catching, big man sitting behind the plate that wide.  You can't miss him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father played ball too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: That way you can't miss him.  The guys used to try to steal a base on him, he'd say he was too late starting, and then he'd throw you out, bam.  Couldn't hit worth two cents (laughter), but he could catch and he could throw.
Speaker 1: Now what team did he play for?  Was it just a local (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Blue Jays--
Speaker 1: The Blue Jays.
Speaker 2: --Rock Hill Blue Jays [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're in Rock Hill, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Rock Hill Blue Jays.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 305189
Speaker 1: Now did you enjoy school when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, what are you talking about?  I had a good time in school.  I played football, but I wanted to play basketball, I mean baseball.  Didn't have a baseball team.  My brother was a great football player at Emmett Scott High School [Rock Hill, South Carolina].  But that dude, he could run, he could run, he could run.  He left there and went in, he went in the [U.S.] Navy.  And when he come out of the Navy he went to, went to Detroit [Michigan] and worked at Ford Motor Company almost fifty years.  That's how I got my first car, through by him.  He said he'd got an option to get three cars a year.  He said, "You want a car?"  I told him I wanted a car.  That's how I got my car.  But my daddy [William Long] saw me play in 1954 for the first time, in Charlotte, North Carolina.  You walked in the stadium--
Speaker 1: And that's when you were playing with Birmingham [Birmingham Black Barons]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Say really, I was with the Pirates [Pittsburgh Pirates], but see, and the season was over with up there in Canada, and so I came home and played with the Barons, barnstorming against Campanella All-Stars [Roy Campanella All-Stars].  And this dude walks in the stadium.  I'm out there shagging fly balls.  He looked out there and said, "Hey, that's my son,"--big man, big mouth, deep voice.  So I come to the bat, "Hey, that's my son, that's my son."  So, I hit that double off the left center field wall against Mudcat Grant.  My daddy told 'em, said, "I told you that's my son."  So, come to the bat the next time around, Campy [Roy Campanella] said, "Hey, Carl [HistoryMaker Carl Long], is that your son--that's your daddy?"  I said, "Yeah, Campy, that's my daddy."  He said, "He sure thinks a lot of you."  So Mudcat Grant struck me out.  A guy said, "Hey, Bill, whose son is that?"  My daddy said, "Damned if I know (laughter)."  I tell that everywhere I go.  I said, and he was a bootlegger from way back.  And he'd give you the shirt off--that's how he made his living.  He had five houses built, five houses.  And after he passed away he give each one of, each ballplayer a house a piece, each, each, each, each, each son.  Mother [Ella Griffin Long] had two, one for me, one for brother Bob [Bob Long], and one for Bill [William Henry Long].  I told Bob, I said, "You can have mine," because I never moved back there again, because I got out of the cotton fields, and I tell you that I never will be back, and I never did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how would you describe yourself as a teenager?  I mean what was your personality like and--
Speaker 2: Well, I was good.  Everybody loved me, because I could knew many things, and I wasn't a bad kid.  I knowed right from wrong.  I taught, I was taught right from wrong.  And others, my brother and everybody else goes off different places drinking.  I wouldn't go.  And I stayed around the house, stayed close to home.  But that's a main thing, reason why my daddy didn't want me to go off to play baseball because he knowed that, what kind of person that I was.  He had told me, said, "If somebody try to take advantage of you, you know what, get your hat.  Don't stay there and ask questions."  And I could fly.  I could move.  When I left in 1954 to go to Nashville, Tennessee, John Parker [John William Parker] took me up there.
Speaker 1: That's earlier than that.  It's not '54 [1954].  That's like when you were fourteen, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, this is, this is 1951.
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], yeah.  You said '54 [1954] though.  That's why I stopped (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, fif-
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --fifty-four [1954], when my daddy saw me play with the Birmingham--
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: --Black Barons.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I left there and went back to 1951.
Story_ID: 305190
Speaker 1: When my daddy [William Long] let me go off to play baseball in Nashville, Dr. Jackson [Dr. R.B. Jackson], he paid me, he claimed to pay me two hundred dollars a month, and then he changed it to 150 on the first paycheck.  He said no, I promised--I said, "You promised to pay me two hundred dollars a month."  But I didn't know nothing about them supposed to pay me that, but that's what I signed a contract for.  I never did see the contract, but I saw him writing something on a piece of paper.  That's, but see, when they told me they was gonna pay me, I would have played for nothing.  That's how much I loved the game so.  He just said, "I'm gonna pay you two hundred dollars."  I remember that.  I said, "You gonna pay me two hundred dollars to play baseball?"  He said yes.  They gave me $150 a month, he was gonna pay me a dollar and a half a day to eat on, meal money.  They paid for my room and board and all that stuff.  But when they told me they were gonna pay me two hundred dollars a month, I told 'em, I said, "Look, you gonna pay me that money to play baseball?"  I said, "I'd play baseball for nothing."  See, I didn't know nothing about being paid for playing baseball.  Had a good time, learned a whole lot.  They just took me under their wings.  Never forget, riding down the highway, looking off to the left, there was black guys hanging from a tree.  I experienced this.  Told you I had something to tell you.  It gonna get better.
Speaker 2: Where were you?  Do you remember where you were?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Mississippi, not only--you can see 'em, see 'em in all states.  This is back in 1951 now, all, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi.  It's nothing for 'em to hang a person there.
Speaker 2: 'Cause normally we think that a lot of that, like, started, you know, to--
Speaker 1: No, sir.
Speaker 2: --decline in a certain, you know, in the '40s [1940s] and--
Speaker 1: No, sir.
Speaker 2: But there was still enough going on where you could actually see people hanging from--
Speaker 1: You'd better believe it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I saw someone, one guy hanging, hanging in my hometown, Rock Hill [South Carolina].  They're talking about that he hung himself.  I know he didn't hang himself, much as that guy liked to love, liked to go around and have a good time, right on the river, Catawba River, right off the reservations, in Rock Hill, South Carolina.  I knowed the--I forgot his name now, but I know this guy real well.  But not only that, call us all kind of names, different ballparks we played in.

Speaker 1: Tell us about the transition between the Negro Leagues and the white minor leagues.  Now you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well, that was at--
Speaker 1: When did you make that transition--
Speaker 2: --I made the All-Star game [East-West All-Star Game].  Me and [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks made it also on the same All-Star game together back in 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a Negro League All-Star team?
Speaker 2: The Negro League All-Stars.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Howie Haak, Pittsburgh Pirates, came down and bought my contract to play for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Howie told me, said, look, he said, "You going to the majors."  I knowed I was going to the majors.  Wasn't nothing gonna stop me because I knowed I was good.  I could run; I could throw; and I'd become a good hitter.  Now, I'm gonna run back to the Birmingham Black Barons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Me and Willie Mays, Mays used to come home and want to play center field.  And I told him, I said, "No, you can't play center field now.  You have left it."  And he ended up, ended up playing center field anyway, and I had to go right field.
Speaker 1: Now this is when he was already playing for the Giants [New York Giants; San Francisco Giants]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: --already playing for--as a matter of fact, he was in the [U.S.] Army.  And he and I used to get out there and try to bunt each other down, just see who can throw the hardest.  I was young and strong, and I wasn't giving up a thing.  We'd try to bunt each other down, and until one of us throw the ball away.  He could throw, and I could throw.  Outfield, excuse me, he could run, and I could run.  Mays was a good ballplayer, the best I ever seen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I always say--
Speaker 1: --he's the best that ever played, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I always say, I always said--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --I always told a guy, I say I'm as good as he is.  I always thought that.  I was, I'm just as good as he is.  The balls that Mays went back and picked, against Cleveland [Cleveland Indians], Mays used to catch them balls all the time, and so did I, so did I.
Speaker 1: You're referring to the play where he lost--
Speaker 2: With Vic Wertz.
Speaker 1: --lost his hat in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the World Series [1954 World Series] against Cleveland.
Speaker 1: He runs towards the wall.  He makes the over-the-head catch without--
Speaker 2: Well, Mays used to go back there, and it looked so easy.  And a lot of times when I go back like that, I'm back there a whole--and any, anytime I don't have to have my back to the wall.  I'm back there on the wall.  Oscar Charleston taught me well.  One time I throwed the ball over a river, Catawba River, and that river is a long way across.  And they bet, my father [William Long] bet a guy, said, "My son could throw a ball across that river."  And I won (laughter).  But playing in--sometimes we didn't have no place to take a shower on the bus.  We'd stop the bus alongside the creek, go down there and jump in the creek and wash off and wash the uniforms too.  A lot of places we didn't have no place to eat--
Speaker 1: And that's something.  I mean washing the clothes.  I have never heard that before.  But that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a--
Speaker 1: --but I guess that's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess you'd have to.
Speaker 2: Wash off, wash those big heavy uniforms.  Burlap bags and sacks, that's what it used to be made out of, wool, burlap, and hot.  We didn't mind that.  We played under those conditions.  Sometimes I played two and three ball games, different ballparks.  Played a ball game tonight.  The next night we'll play in Kansas City [Missouri], played in Memphis [Tennessee], played in Kansas City the next night and Nashville [Tennessee], or someplace like that.  And next night, we're in Kansas City playing ball there, in Texas playing there, in New Orleans [Louisiana], or even played here in Comiskey Park, Chicago [Illinois].  A guy by the name of [HistoryMaker] Dennis Biddle was pitching in 1953.  And I almost--Comiskey Park almost tore that fence, tore the--it wasn't a fence it was a--tore that wall down against him.  He was playing for the Chicago American Giants.  I kids him about it all the time.
Story_ID: 305192
Speaker 1: And I can go on and on and on, but I'll tell you what, when in 1954 when I went to, with the Pirates [Pittsburgh Pirates] when I left the Negro League with the Pirates, hit twenty home runs my rookie year up there in Canada, 1954.  Branch Rickey came up there and told me, said, "I never seen anybody hit a changeup so far out of the ballpark in all my life."  I told Branch Rickey, I said, "Look, Branch, I said look, I'm one of the best ballplayers in the organization."  He said, "What about Roberto Clemente?"  I said, "Tell me what Roberto Clemente could do that I can't do?"  And I said--he says, "He's in the majors."  I said, "But I'm going (laughter)."
Speaker 2: So the Pirate organ- Clemente was already up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 2: --in the--
Speaker 1: --he was already up there.
Speaker 2: He was already up there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There are a lot of great players that came through that Pirate--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --organization.
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?  And--
Speaker 2: Who else came through when you were--
Speaker 1: --there was Stargell [Willie Stargell], Bonds [Walter Bonds].  But what it is, we had to stay in rooming houses when we was in spring training down there in 1954, early 1954.
Speaker 2: So all the black players couldn't stay where the white players stayed, right?
Speaker 1: No, we couldn't stay.  And on the way to the ballpark, we had to walk to the ballpark.  But that's all good.  And the only thing I was there for to play baseball, and I wanted to play baseball.  Partner, had a good time.  Then the next year, following year they sent us to Jacksonville Beach [Florida] for spring training.  All the black players stayed in one motel, and all the whites stayed in another motel.  The guys had fights and stuff around there, but I tried to stay away from that.  And--
Speaker 2: You mean with the local people, or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, local peoples.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The little girlfriends and stuff like that.  But--
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is in the black community itself--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, this tension caused by--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: The guys go there and take these guys' girlfriends and stuff like that.  They got, get mad.  A lot of guys got cut up or got shot.  Donn Clendenon went down there.  They sent him home because he wasn't, wasn't good enough.  Donn Clendenon was good enough, but he didn't, just didn't produce.  He went back home to Atlanta [Georgia].  Then they brought him back and said, "He's good enough.  Give him another chance."  And Donn, he ended up going the Pirates, and the Pirates sold him to the New York Mets, and history right there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he's the 1969 most valuable player of the World Series, I believe, for the Mets, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Donn Clendenon.
Speaker 1: You know, I know all of these guys, played against them, did real well against them.
Story_ID: 305193
Speaker 1: But 1955, they sent me out on the reservation out there in Billings, Montana.  You stay up on the reservation all the time, have a good time, and had a real good year up there in Montana, played in Salt Lake City [Utah], Ogden, Utah, Boise [Idaho], Pocatello [Idaho], Magic Valley [Idaho] or something like that, and Billings [Montana], Great Falls, Montana, snow everywhere, had forty-two inches in 1954--1955 in April.  When the plane landed on top of that rock up there, and the airport is sitting on top of the mountain, looked on top of the mountain down, down in the, down in the valley at the ballpark, had forty-two inches of snow.  They cleaned 'em all, cleaned the field away, snow banks piled up some, some kind of high.  We practiced, practiced that Saturday evening.  We got in there Saturday morning, practiced that Saturday evening.  Went out there, the first pitch I hit was out of the ballpark (makes sound).  I took off.  I said Jack, Jack Paepke was our manager, and I told 'em, I said, I was ready.  I went running off.  He said, "No, you gonna have to hit some more.  You gonna have to hit some more," but I know up there was cold, and the bat was stinging, and that's the reason why I hit one pitch out of the ball- first pitch I hit out of the ballpark.  Had a young, young, young, young kid there played center field the year before, he didn't get it back no more.  I had took over.  And there's a guy by the name of Dick Stuart.  Every time he'd get a hit, I get knocked down the next pitch.  I said--never did charge the mound.  I didn't go there to fight.  I went there to play baseball.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dick Stuart was first baseman, right, for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, first baseman--
Speaker 2: --for the Pirates [Pittsburgh Pirates], right?
Speaker 1: And no, he was a left fielder.
Speaker 2: Was he--
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had to go in his--all the way over there where he was standing about ten feet from the ball and catch the ball.  He said, "You catch everything you can catch."  He said, "Because I don't know if I can catch it or not."  I said, "Dick, you gone have to learn how to catch these balls."  And partner, I showed Dick something.  I showed him how to play the outfield, but he never could learn.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, he was a great hitter though--
Speaker 1: Yeah, who are--
Speaker 2: --great, great hitter, (unclear).
Speaker 1: --talking about?  In 19, 1956, I went to Kinston.  I went to Kinston, North Carolina in the Carolina League, first black ballplayer, being the first black ballplayer down there and showed off.
Story_ID: 304989
Speaker 1: We were talking about Dick Stuart and some of the other people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --you played with in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in--
Speaker 1: --Pirate [Pittsburgh Pirates] organization, right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I was up there in Billings, Montana.  And whenever Dick got a hit, I got knocked down.  Whenever I told Jack--Jack Paepke was the manager, and told him, I said, "Jack, let me hit third and let Dick hit fourth."
Speaker 1: So, let's go--for those who are not familiar with it in baseball, so if Dick got a hit, the next batter up would be you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And to make sure you didn't get one, they'd try to knock you down with the ball.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they knocked me--it was--
Speaker 1: It's a game of retaliation a lot of times.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: See, I knowed if I got hit with the ball, I was gonna steal second.  They weren't gonna--I got to try to pay 'em back some kind of way.  And that's my way of showing 'em, you hit me you're gonna be punished.  And that's mainly what happened to me when I was coming up in during that era.  Also, when I told skipper Paepke to move, move me to third, I still got knocked down (laughter).  I would imagine because I was a black ballplayer, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many black players were on your team them?
Speaker 2: Weren't nothing but two.
Speaker 1: Just you and--
Speaker 2: Man, we had a guy by the name of Woody Smallwood [DeWitt "Woody" Smallwood].  And he started a race riot up there in Canada, of all places.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: You know, they had a wrestling team up there one night.  And Woody and I was there at the wrestling team, at the, where they was wrestling at the ballpark.
Speaker 1: So it was like one of these pro wrestling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, pro wrestling.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, where guys are--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --throwing each other around--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that kind of stuff, okay.
Speaker 2: So Woody got--the guy looked at me, and I wasn't saying a word.  But Woody was running his mouth, telling, telling the wrestler what he'll do to 'em and all this and all that.  And the wrestler got mad and went after Woody, and Woody took off (laughter).  Woody took off, and I just sat there because I knowed I hadn't said nothing to the man.  But after Woody got away, Woody come back.  And the man got after him again, and he looked over there at me.  I said, "Man, I haven't said a word to you."  He said you--the man told me, said, "I know you haven't, sir."  He said, "I ain't after you.  I just want to get my hands on him."  And he never did get, get his hands on him, but every time I went to Kansas City [Missouri] I remind Woody of that.  And I told Motley [Don Motley] and Buck [Buck O'Neil] about it.  I said, "He started a riot out there in Montana."  They said, "Woody did?"  See, Woody was a member of the organization out there, the museum--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before he died.  But Buck, Motley and I talked about that all the time.  Woody was something else, Woody Smallwood.
Speaker 1: What did he play?
Speaker 2: Woody played in '52 [1952] and '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Yeah, what position did he play?
Speaker 2: He played left field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He could run, but he wasn't that good of a hitter, but he could run.
Speaker 1: It's a good thing because--
Speaker 2: Yes, sir (laughter).

Speaker 1: Getting back to when I left there in 1955, a hurricane just had blew the next year through the Carolinas in 1955, Hazel [Hurricane Hazel].  And when I was flying in there, got down low enough to see it.  I can see all these trees bent over, telegram poles laying down, which had did a whole lot of damage; in 1955, was still there.  So I said, "What happened there?"  And they told me.  They said, "Hazel come through here and tore up a whole lot of stuff and did a whole lot of damage."  That's when I knowed, that's when I knowed what a hurricane was.  The first time I'd ever heard of a hurricane was when I went to the Carolinas, down there in Kinston, North Carolina.  Went down there, Jack Paepke was my manager there also for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  He--
Speaker 2: Now this is the Kinston Eagles, right?
Speaker 1: The Kinston Eagles.
Speaker 2: And that's a farm team for the--what was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pittsburgh farm team for the Pittsburgh--
Speaker 2: --Triple A, or which one was--
Speaker 1: Single A during that time.
Speaker 2: Single, okay, for Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Look, yep.  And Paepke was managing there.  He got me down in spring training and say I want you to go with me.  See, I thought I was going to the Triple A, and they sent me there.  But I knowed I supposed to have been up to Triple A anyway.  Had a great building sitting over there behind the ballpark in Kinston.  I walked in the stadium and looked around and saw that doggone building sitting back there.  Now, me being the first black there, everybody had eyes on me.  I felt that way.  When they dropped the, first of all, when they dropped the first ballplayers off, they told me to stay on the bus.  All the white players went in there, went in the motel there in Kinston.  They took me to a rooming house.  They said, "This where you be staying at down here."  So, that's all right.  Partner, peoples fell in love with me.  Went to the ballpark [Grainger Stadium, Kinston, North Carolina] that evening.  They come by and picked me up and carried me to the ballpark.  I looked at that beautiful ballpark there.  I run to the outfield checking the field out, checking the fence out and stuff like that to make sure how it's gonna be.  And I noticed a little slope coming from the outfield coming down towards home plate.  And I said, "Then I don't have to play on the wall.  I can play closer in."  I can take a whole lot of hits away from the batters playing close in because that slope is running, running towards home plate.  And I said, "It's gonna be hard for somebody to hit something over my head because it was gonna be, have to be over the wall and gotta hit, be hit mighty hard."  That's from my teachers.  They taught me well.  I always tried to see what the, the way the wind was blowing, which direction, which way it mostly was blowing.  But I always thought about that concrete wall.  That's what it was, a concrete wall.  And on top of the concrete eight-foot wall, they got, they have steel stakes sticking up in the walls.  So, don't go back there and jump on the wall and go put your hand in one of those stakes; thought about that.  All this stuff I learned from down--well, I already had learned about playing outfield by the wall, by different walls and how the slope goes.  But I had to see for myself how the wall was shaped.  The scoreboard was sitting in right center field.  I won't have no problem with that because I pulled everything.
Story_ID: 304991
Speaker 1: So this ballpark, just a second on the ballpark [Grainger Stadium, Kinston, North Carolina], there's a picture of it on the Internet.
Speaker 2: It's 135 [sic. 335 feet] down the left, four hundred [feet] in the center, and 135 [sic. 335 feet] down the right.
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be one of the most beautiful, classic ballparks--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is that.
Speaker 1: --in the country.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's built a long time ago.  I'm not sure exactly when now, but the one in Kinston, North Carolina--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it should be named after me 'cause--
Speaker 1: Long Field?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir, yes, sir.  First time at bat, they got a great big building sitting on the back of the, on, behind, across the street.  And the building is pretty close to, I'd say, seventy-five feet tall or more.  I hit a ball on top of the buildings.  The ball started bouncing on top of that building.  Not too many of us--Cecil Fielder hit one up there; several guys hit one of there, but it was Cecil hit one.
Speaker 1: Cecil Fielder was a big man, and he--
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: --he's--yeah.
Speaker 2: But I knowed that ballpark was meant for me.  Willie McCovey hit one over that scoreboard just as high as that scoreboard.  When he hit it, I looked at it.  I kept looking at it, and I knowed I couldn't get to it.  Didn't, you didn't even have to move hardly.  I knowed I wasn't gonna get that one (laughter).  Leon Wagner, he hit forty-eight home runs down there in Kinston, down there in the Carolina League.  He played for Danville [Danville Leafs].  All through of us, me, Wagner, and Flood [Curt Flood], made the all-star team.  McCovey couldn't make it.  McCovey should have been in there.  I drove in 111 runs in the Carolina League, which stands today.  I led the team in doubles and RBIs.  I should have been most valuable player, but they didn't give it to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were the only all-star from the team when they played the all-star game--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, from, from what I've read, yeah, but they didn't give you the most valuable player.
Speaker 2: No, they didn't give me nothing.  No, see, a guy by the name of Jack Riley [ph.], he was a, he was there, and he owned, he run, owned a radio station, and he runs things there.  But that's all right.  I got a chance to play.  And partner, the black folks used to come in there and see me play ball.  I used to rob guys of base hits and everything, throw guys out, stood on center field wall and throw that ball on top of the screens behind home plate, way up there on top of the screen.  I won the long distance contest; just did everything down there in Kinston, Carolina League, being the first.  Although later on in the, later on, there was "Governor" Frank Washington and Cleo Lewright, he was a pitcher, "Governor" Frank Washington, he was from New Jersey, come in, played left field.  But I already was there then.  And he used to go out to different schools talking to kids.  That's how I met my wife.  Went to Adkin High School [Kinston, North Carolina], looked through the window and saw that girl sitting over there.
Speaker 1: To which high school?
Speaker 2: Adkin.
Speaker 1: Adkin, okay.
Speaker 2: A-N-K-E-N [sic.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or something like that, A-N-K-E-N, I think correct, K-I, K, K, K-E-N or K-I-N, or something like that.  Saw this girl sitting in there.  This guy walked out there with her.  I said, "I'mma marry that girl right there."  I said, "I don't know, but I just got a feeling," and I did.  After the season was over with, I married that girl.  Been married ever since 1956.
Speaker 1: Now her name is Ella [Long] you said too--
Speaker 2: Ella--
Speaker 1: --same as your mother's.
Speaker 2: --same thing as my mother's.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he said, she said you got another Ella, huh?  I got another Ella.
Speaker 1: This is at '55 [1955]?
Speaker 2: In 1956.
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956], okay.
Speaker 2: Made the all-star te--well, you know that.  But, I played against Durham [Durham Bulls], calling us everything but Charlie Gardy [ph.]--"Hit that coon; hit that nigger under the feet; don't hit him upside the head."
Speaker 1: Now this is Durham where they made that movie 'Bull Durham'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the same--yeah.
Speaker 2: Greensboro [North Carolina], where they had that riot--Winston-Salem [North Carolina], "Pond giants"; Fayetteville [North Carolina], Fort Bragg [North Carolina], Wilson [North Carolina], "Cotton farmers"; Danville [North Carolina]; and Kinston.  Eight teams was in the league, and they give me hell.

Speaker 1: So how did, I mean, and were you the only black on the team [Kinston Eagles]?
Speaker 2: I was the only black on the team for a month.
Speaker 1: And did they--
Speaker 2: Then, then another black came.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Frank Washington come out from, come from, Perthon Boyd [ph.], New Jersey.  Cleo Lewright come, he come from St. Louis, East St. Louis [Illinois], so we all stayed down there.  All the ball, all the black ballplayers stayed at the same place.
Speaker 1: The boarding house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Curt Flood, Leon Wagner, Willie McCovey, Tony Taylor.  He's a Cuban, but, Tony Taylor; Jose Pagan, he stayed with the white team, white ballplayers.
Speaker 1: Now, Jose Pagan stayed with the white players, but was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a Puerto Rican.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but was it clear who he was?  I mean did he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did he look black or did--
Speaker 2: He played with--he went up to the majors.
Speaker 1: I know, but did he look black to you?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: I mean did he did he look black?
Speaker 2: --sir (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And let's see, who else was there.  Kurt Holloway [ph.], Kurt Holloway, he played for the Winston-Salem Red Sox [Winston-Salem Dash] team.  But the worst treatment I ever received in my life was in Greensboro [North Carolina] on a Saturday night.  I was showing out.  I was showing out.  I was ready that night.  I come up to the bat, my first time up.  The bases was loaded.  I hit a home run, hit a grand slam.  An old white man sitting right behind the dugout: "Hit that nigger on the feet; hit that coon; don't let him hit that ball no more."  I hit a double off the left center field wall.  Nobody was on base.  Come back up the third time, he right back at it again, had on a white shirt, tobacco juice running down on both side of this white shirt, "Here he is back again; you need to do something with that nigger; you need to don't, don't let him hit that ball like that no more," caught two men on, hit another homerun--one man on, hit another home run.  Anyway, that night I hit two home runs, a double, single, and drove in six runs.  Next night, a little old white lady come down there.  The old man was sitting there again.  She said, "Why don't you shut your mouth?"  She's telling this old man, seemed like he was wearing the same shirt.
Speaker 1: The same juice?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  She said, "Every time you open your mouth that boy hit the ball out of the ballpark."  Why don't you shut your mouth?  Just keep your mouth shut.  Don't nobody appreciate what you doing, out here calling him all those kinda names.  I went 0 for 4.  The guy wouldn't say a word.  I went 0 for 4.
Speaker 1: He was kind of like your muse at the--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --ballpark I guess.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.  We beat, we beat Greensboro eighteen to three.  Other black ballplayers, he drove in five runs.  The pitcher, he pitched the game.  I got clippings of that.  He hit, he drove in two runs.  But they had a big, big, big write-up in there about that one.  Oh, they had a big write-up in there about a whole lot of 'em when I played, when I was coming up.
Story_ID: 304993
Speaker 1: Went down in Mexico City [Mexico] in nineteen fifty- although my wife [Ella Long], we gave--end of the year I got married.  I married the girl I said I was gonna marry.  Went to Mexico City, and she called me and told me she give birth to a baby boy.  He say "What you should name him?"  I told him, I said, "Name him Sotello, S-O-T-E-L-L-O."  He said, "What about your name?"  I said no.  I said name--I said, "I got a good friend down here in Mexico by the name of Sotello, Mike Sotello."  And I said, "I want to name him Sotello."  He said, I said he's a good friend of mine.  He just, Mike just taught me a whole lot of life about Mexico City.  He was Mexican too, and he helped me out a whole lot while I was down there.
Speaker 2: So how do you spell--
Speaker 1: Down in--
Speaker 2: --how do you spell Sotello?
Speaker 1: S-O-T-E-L-L-O--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Sotello.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Had a good year down there.  And he used to take me to the bullfights.  I'll get my balls up in there, lie down, and I used to hit some long shots down there.  One time I was hitting .407, and they couldn't get me out.  Branch Rickey came down there and said, "You can't stay here.  You gon' have to leave here."  He said, "You cannot stay here."  He said, "You just too good for this league."  He said, "Now, in two weeks you going to Beaumont, Texas, the Texas League."  I didn't want to leave Mexico.  My wife called me and told me, said, "I've given birth to your boy by the name of," she said, "what I name, should I name him?"  I said name him Sotello.  She said, "We're coming to Texas."  I said okay.  I said "Now, I want you to take the train."  She didn't like, she didn't know nothing about flying.  I didn't know that much about flying too until I got to the majors, got to the organized baseball in the Pirates [Pittsburgh Pirates] organization.  Went to--when I got there, oh, I had started gettin' sick down there in Mexico because I had a whole lot of bad food, and I just didn't feel like playing.  But, got down there in Beaumont, Texas, played in Yuma [Arizona].  I hit a ball so doggone hard, I didn't even know where it went myself.  I got it up in that thin air down there, it went away from there.  They had guards all over the road down in Mexico City, stopping the bus, making you get out, frisking you.  I said, "What's going on down here?"  He said, Mike Sotello, Mike Sotello said, "They, they don't know what they're doing.  They don't know who you are."  He said, "They're just checking you out just to be checking you out."  I said we're ballplayers, Mike.  He said, "They just want to check for themselves," on dirt roads, Yuma.  You heard of Yuma?  We went to Veracruz [Mexico], went to Monterey [Mexico], Laredo [Nuevo Laredo, Mexico], Yucatan [Mexico], you know Yucatan.  A lot of 'em had, a lot of 'em during that time were dirt roads.  Had two teams there in Mexico, Mexico City Reds, Mexico City Tigers.  And a guy that used to play with the Birming- against the Birmingham Black Barons, I hit two home runs off of him.  He said, he said, "Homie, you gon' have to go down."  I say, "You can't throw hard enough to knock me down."  He did; he knocked me down (laughter).  But I got up, and I looked at him.  I said, "Eh, you learned how to throw a little hard, did you (laughter)?"  He said, "You think I throwed hard then."  He said, "I'mma see if you can get up behind this one here."  He throwed another one under my chin.  I said, "All right, that's enough now."  And he got me out, but that's, that's--I had hit two home runs off of him.  I said, "Well, now I have something to talk about."  There's a guy by the name of Alonzo Perry, joker was big, 6'5"; get down in a crouch, and when he'd come out of that crouch he can hit some shots.  Bob Trice was down there too, was playing with 'em.  He had left the majors and went back down there, trying to get back in the majors because, as an outfielder instead of a pitcher.  And we used to hang out together down there also, going to the bullfights and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so when you played in the Mexican--this is like the Mexican League?

Speaker 1: How did you do that?
Speaker 2: I didn't know at that time.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you do it?
Speaker 2: Ran in, ran in--we had to stop playing.  It started raining.  We had to stop for an hour and a half.  And then they had a runner on second, tried to go to, was going home, and I made a quick throw.  And that thing, I could hear something just, tore it.
Speaker 1: So it was like the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Branch Rickey told me, said--
Speaker 1: --rotator cuff in your shoulder?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He said, he told me, said "Look, you don't wanna be cut?"  I said, "No, I don't wanna be cut."  I said, "Time will tell."  Branch Rickey shook his head, told me, said, "You need to be cut, it's gon' take a long time for that to heal."  So, if you do the operation like it is today, I'd have been out for a week or two, couple of weeks or something like that.  Everything--but they didn't have no way of doing that back during that time.  But anyway, I come back home.  I still gotta find me a job.  I already had met this girl, and we got married and said--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, sir, how did you feel about that?  I mean you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, I didn't know at the time--

Speaker 2: Yes, yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  Used to go home nights.  She'll get the Bengay; that's what she had to put on me during that time, rub me down, made me feel good.  My son kept me going a lot too, playing with him, messing around with him.  Grandma, his, my wife's mother, Carrie, Carrie Smith, was taking care of the family while we went to work, kids while we went to work.  But, went to spring training in 1958, couldn't throw a lick right off.  Branch Rickey told me, said, "Well, you go back home, and whenever you get ready you come on back."  Went back home, got me a job, went to--got me another job driving a truck.  And I told him, I said, "Well, I ain't going back until I get, get real well, get well."  And I never did go back--
Story_ID: 307546
Speaker 1: So you had a career-ending shoulder injury.  But if it was operated on, who would have had to pay the bill?
Speaker 2: Major League Baseball.
Speaker 1: And did they offer to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the team that signed the contract.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did the team offer to operate on it, or, or--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  They just told me, they said either you get operated on, or either it'll take a long time to heal.  And I said, "How long?"  He said, "I can't guarantee you," he said, "but a lot of rest."  He said take care of yourself.  And I said I was gonna rest and take care of myself.  And I worked on it.  And I know I wasn't hurting that bad.  And every day, my wife [Ella Long] was, she would, she would rub me down a lot at night, at night, during the day, run hot water and everything on it.  It felt good.  And I was told not to try to throw, and I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when spring training came in '59 [1959]--was it '59 [1959] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went, we went down to spring training, and I found out I couldn't throw a lick.  And they told me they were gonna send me home because--until my arm got better.  Now I could hit, now.
Speaker 1: So, there wasn't an option of making you a first baseman or anything, was it, or?
Speaker 2: Well, I could play anywhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--
Speaker 1: But with your arm, you know, with having a bad arm though, I mean, it would seem like maybe you could play first, maybe.
Speaker 2: Well, see, when you're an organization like the Pittsburgh Pirates, that makes it different.  Had it been the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers], something like that, the Yankees [New York Yankees], something like that, the guys like that, that'll been a whole lot different.  But with the Pittsburgh Pirates, what are you talking about?  And you being black too (laughter), that does make a difference.
Speaker 1: And they did have like Dick Stuart.  You said they had him, right, already?
Speaker 2: Yes, see--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, see--
Speaker 1: Playing first.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and plus they had Donn Clendenon coming up.  Dick and, and both of, both of 'em left the Pirates and went with the Mets [New York Mets].  The both of 'em were sold.  Plus they had Frank Thompson.  He was a good ballplayer, with the Pirates, although the Pirates had Ralph Kiner down there too one time.  But--
Speaker 1: So when you, when you left that was your last season trying to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --play?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it never did come back, huh?
Speaker 2: Never did come back.  Well, did come back in the '60s [1960s], '63 [1963].  I could throw real good in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: So did you try to play again?  Did you--
Speaker 2: No, I never did go back because I had set in my ways with things that I want to do.  He was, he--the guys, although the Negro League was fading out, but Sou Bridgeforth [William "Sou" Bridgeforth] would call me and tell me, "I want you to come back here."  I said, "For what?"  I said, "I don't want to do a whole lot of traveling, Sou."  I said--he said, "I'm getting ready, I'm getting, I'm selling the team."  He said, "But I want you to come back anyway."  I said, "I'll come see you but not to go on the road and play ball like I used to in the Negro League," that's playing all day, all night, and travel that next night, and go to another, another, another little town, be ready to play the next day.  I said I got a family now to take care of, although in 1959 my second child was born, a young lady.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Teresa Long [Teresa Long Whitfield].  In 1961 my third child was born.  Her name was Cynthia [Cynthia Long Hightower].
Story_ID: 307547

Speaker 2: --we talked.
Speaker 1: --driving a block truck.
Speaker 2: So, so, so what, what happened?  How did you become a deputy sheriff [in Lenoir County, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: The sheriff come to me.  He said, "Look, we've gotta hire some blacks."  And he said, "I talked to everybody about it, and everybody talking about hiring you."  I told the sheriff, Fred Boyd, who was his name, I told Fred, I said, "Look, I don't want to become no deputy sheriff.  I'm all right where I'm at."  He said, "Look, let me tell you something, son."  He said, "You work when you want to work; you'll be clean all the time, and you do what you have to do."  He said, "I will put you through school."  And I thought I had all the schooling I need.  He put me--he said--but I ended up giving, getting you a job when, if you decide you don't want it.  I'll get your job back.  I went there and fell in love with it.  He put me through school, went to the University of North Carolina, took up laws of arrest and search and seizure.  Ended up helping a whole lot of people, helped a whole lot of people.
Story_ID: 307548
Speaker 1: So this is 1968 when you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --joined the sheriff's department [in Lenoir County, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you came in as deputy sheriff?
Speaker 2: A deputy sheriff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got killed.
Speaker 1: This is that same year, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Called me and told me, said, "James Earl Ray's coming this way in the Carolinas."  He said, "We need somebody out on the road."  The captain of that shift told me, he said he was not going out there, he said, told me to go.  I told him, yes, I'll go.  So I went out on the Highway 70, looking for some, suspicious cars going by, which he never did come that way, but I was out there looking for that car.  But the captain of that shift told me he was not going out there.  That told me something right then and there.  They put a curfew out.  All the places would be closed up at 9:00, everybody off the street.  All right, I goes through--then Paul Young, he was a pro, ABC [Alcohol Beverage Control] officer, called and told me they want me to go with him out and look for a liquor still.  He went to the sheriff [Fred Boyd] and got the sheriff to get me to go out.  Now I didn't like to go out and mess with nobody with liquor at a liquor still, out there on the cold ground waiting for somebody to come to a liquor still.  So, happens some dogs come down there and started barking.  It's around about 8:30 now.  We had to leave the woods, although he blowed up the liquor still, was at the liquor still.  Peoples know we was down there, gonna blow the liquor still up.  Went by there and told the peoples that we went down there and blowed the liquor still up.  I just wanted to let 'em know, you make anymore, we gone blow up, blow that still up.  We got the worm and everything and carried it away, left the barrels out, pulled the mash and everything out.  And Paul Young got him a gallon of that liquor was already made, carried it back for the court.  I imagine he probably drank it himself, but that's (laughter), that's what he did.  But we went back to Kinston [North Carolina].  When I was going into Kinston, I heard a whole lot of commotion.  This is around about nine o'clock now.  A bunch of black kids walking down the street breaking out the windows, bam.  I had pulled my car around to the back of the courthouse.  And when I said I'd better go around there and check out what's--I called the desk and told 'em, I said, "I'm going around here to check out all this glass breaking, what's going on."  Went out there and the police car was riding up and down the street weren't doing a thing, while the kids were walking down the street breaking out windows.  And I pulled my patrol car around there, stopped in front of these kids, and I told 'em, I said, "Hey, man, what you, what you guys think y'all doing?"  All of 'em know me.  Mr. Carl Long [HistoryMaker Carl Long], that's what I am, "Mr. Carl Long, they say they killed Martin Luther King."  I said, "Hold it right there."  I said, "I know about that, but it didn't happen here."  I said, "This town, this is our town, fellows."  I said, "What y'all planning on doing?"  They said, "We're gone burn it down."  I said, "No, you're not."  I said, "You're going to jail, that's what you gone do."  And I said, "And I'll tell you what: I want y'all to go home, and I want y'all off the street."  And I said, "If I catch you again out here, you know where you're going."  Then they said, "Okay, we're going home."  One guy I arrested out of the bunch because he had a container of gasoline, milk carton of gasoline.  And I said, "Palmer [ph.]," I said, "what you gone do with that?"  I said, "You're wrong."  I said, "Set it down, Palmer, set it down."  He set it down.
Story_ID: 307549
Speaker 1: Then all the patrol cars, policemen, start coming in there, started grabbing these guys.  I said, "Hold it, fellows."  I said, "Take your hands off 'em."  I said, "I got it under control."  And they started mumbling.  Police department started mumbling.  I said, "I got it under control."  See, I could arrest them.  They couldn't arrest me.  They had to do what I told 'em to do.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the sheriff was above the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --police department.  Okay.
Speaker 1: See, the sheriff's department would protect the city [Kinston, North Carolina].  I told the fellows, I said, "Now don't let me catch you out of here no more."  I said, "Now, catch you out here again, you know where you're going.  I want you off the street."  One kid knowed me real well, Roy White [ph.]. I said, "Roy White, I said now, you know better than this."  He said, "Yes, sir, Mr. Long [HistoryMaker Carl Long], I sure do."  I said, "And I want every one of y'all off the street, and I want, I'm gonna make sure that you see that they off the street," and he said okay.  I carried one guy down there and booked him, Palmer [ph.].  I said, "Palmer, if you hadn't been carrying this gasoline, I said you'd been home too."  Down there booking Palmer, sheriff [Fred Boyd] called me saying, "Carl, when you get through what you doing, I'd like for you to come up here to, in the office a minute."  He said no.  I said, "Dusty [ph.]."  He said, "I can tell you over the phone."  He says, "Fred Bates called me and told me that you weren't working with the officer."  And I said, "Well, no.  You know I just come out of the county," and I said, "I saw what was going on, and I went right in there and stopped everyone; I stopped it.  All the policemen come over there and try to take, take over, and I told 'em, I said leave 'em alone."  The sheriff said, sheriff started cussing, not at me, at Fred Bates about his police officer.  He said, "Look," he said, "I'm sorry."  He said, "I didn't mean to disturb you."  He said, "You go on do what you gotta do, but when you get time, you stop by here."  And I gotta tell you something.  So when I finished booking Palmer I went up to the office.  He said, "Them damn son of bitches over there at the police department," he said, "too scared to get out of the patrol car.  And you had to come in there and do their job, and they talking about that you wasn't helping them."  He said, "Don't worry about a thing."  He said, "I'll straighten it out."  So the press was there.  The press got a hold of it all, also.  The big thing was in the paper about it.  The police department was scared to go out there and do their own job and, and jumped down on Carl Long's throat, because Carl Long was doing their--Carl kept the city from getting burned up and all that stuff.  You know how the press can do it, blow things up.  But that's how that happened.  But--
Speaker 2: James Earl Ray never came through there, did he?
Speaker 1: No, he never did come through there.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's right.

Speaker 1: But later on in life, after being on the sheriff's department [in Lenoir County, North Carolina], my son [Sotello Long] made all-state in basketball.  He's growing now, he's growing.  He played against Michael Jordan.  He kept him, kept him under sixteen points.  And he was good, but his love was basketball.  He went to North Carolina [sic.].  He made all-state in basketball.
Speaker 2: Did he go to the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, he--
Speaker 2: --he went to North Carolina State [North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  NC State, okay.
Speaker 1: NC State as a walk-on.  Majored in electrical engineering.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Only one on the team that made the dean's list.  And how he got there, he had scholars--Pat Dodd [ph.] tried to get him to come to East Carolina [East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina].  He had scholarships to go to all the major colleges.  He wanted to go to North Carolina State because it was an engineer school, the closest one.  He went to North Carolina State.  They didn't have no room for him, so Poole Roshare [ph.], I called Poole Roshare the lawyer.  Poole Roshare called the governor, Jim Hunt.  Jim Hunt called me and told me, said, "Carl [HistoryMaker Carl Long], you go ahead on, send your son to NC State."  I said, "They don't have no room up there for him, governor."  He said, "They do now."  He went to North Carolina State, made the basketball team, won the scholarship, and he was the only one on the team that made the dean's list.  He majored in electrical engineering.  After playing two years with Norm Sloan, he said, "Daddy, would you mind if I get off the basketball team?"  I says, "It's your life.  You do what you gotta do."  He said, "I wanna turn my life over to God."  I said, "That's what you wanna do, you go on and do it."  He stayed at North Carolina State and got his master's [degree] and bachelor's degree.  He left there and went to University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky] and stayed out there three years.  He come--he landed him a job in Memphis, Tennessee, at Mississippi Boulevard [Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church], assistant pastor out there, for membership was four thousand, four thousand.  When he left it was 8,500 after three years.  You (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a pretty big church.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  He went in the main office there in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He stayed out there two years.  And he called me two years ago and said, "Daddy, I'm coming home."  I said, "Coming home to what?"  I said, "There's nothing here in Kinston [North Carolina] for you."  He said, "Your home state, daddy."  He said, "I got forty churches in the State of South Carolina."  He said, "I want you at all of those churches to talk to these kids, let 'em know some of the things that's happened to you in the past."  And that's what I do.  I go all over the country talking to--at the Mormon's Tabernacle [Salt Lake Tabernacle], Salt Lake City [Utah].  I went to the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].  I went to the Hawkeye Building [ph.], I went to--just name it, talking to kids, letting 'em know what I'm all about.
Story_ID: 307551
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Oh, mothers and fathers, not taking care of the kids like they are supposed to be.  The parents got to get involved in raising their own child.  And I know I was raised right, although I had two parents, my mother [Ella Griffin Long] and father [William Long].  And I had more than two families.  I had a village.  I had a, everybody, peoples used to whip kids that did wrong.  And when you go back, when you go home and found out you got somebody else whip your kid, you get another whipping for you to do the right thing.  I left the cotton fields of South Carolina, and I knowed I wasn't going back, and I never did go back.  When I met my wife [Ella Long] in the Carolinas and she said, "Where you wanna stay at?"  I said, "I wanna stay (laughter) here in North Carolina.  And I know what's in South Carolina.  I don't want to go back there."  Although I was taught well, but I didn't want to go back to the tobacco fields, cotton fields, stuff like that.  God has taken care of me, have looked out for me.  See, later on in life, I've become the--already was the first black ballplayer here in Kinston, North Carolina.  Later on in life I would become the first black city detective there, first black baseball player, first black deputy sheriff, and that's what I tell the kids: stay in school, and get your education, play sports.  I was inducted into the Carolina League Hall of Fame.  I was inducted into the Negro League Hall of Fame.  So, I tell the kids, I say, "You can be anything you wanna do, be, but you got to go to school, get your education.  And, but I'll tell you what: play any kind of sports you wanna play."  I wanted to play baseball.  If you want to play baseball, I say you don't have to be that good this time and age to play baseball.  I had to be three times better than the ballplayers to get where I got, especially white ballplayers.  And I can't say enough about myself because I knowed I was good, and I was good.  And ain't no ands and buts about it.  I was good, and I knowed I was good, and I wanted to play.  I wanted to play baseball, and I got a chance to play and I played.

Speaker 1: When you look back on your life, are there any, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'd have took the operation.  I would--and I know even Curt Flood told me, said, "Look, man, he said I've been looking for you to be, come to the majors."  And I said, "Curt, I was coming until I got hurt."  I said, "But you know how that is."  I said, "But I knowed all you guys was there, and I know I was just as good as you guys were, and I knowed I should have been there."  But I said, "I have had a good life."  God has taken care of me.  I have a beautiful family, son [Sotello Long] that's just great, and two daughters [Teresa Long Whitfield and Cynthia Long Hightower], although my daughter, one of my daughters passed away, had lupus around the heart.  She married.  She went to A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], graduated from A&T, came home to work one year, got married, and never did--bought a house and never did move in, I said, although my baby girl gave birth to a young lady [LaToyha Polk Washington], looked just like my daughter, identical.  And she is up there at Winston-Salem State University [Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  She come out this year.  I got a grandson [John Polk].  He's up here in the Great Lakes in the [U.S.] Navy base.  He's just joined the Navy.  He, I got a word that he had talked to some peoples at the house.  He can't call nobody because he's in training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was gone go see him, but not able to do so because he's in training.  I think he told me, told somebody that, told his mother or daddy that he would be gone to Florida after basic training.  So when I leave here, I go back to North Carolina today.  And I'll be going to Orlando, Florida.  I'll be down there with Mickey Mouse signing baseball cards down there.  And on the 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, the 18th, I will be in Hawaii signing baseball there and talking to kids, letting know what I'm all about.  I go all over the country doing this (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so you travel a lot.
Speaker 2: Yes, I travel a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know they had like--
Speaker 2: I was on, I was--
Speaker 1: --Carl Long Day in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, the honor--
Speaker 1: --in, in Kinston [North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: --me with a day.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a day every year for the rest of my life.  And I have all the--
Speaker 1: Now it's been--in what year?  That was--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --just, just--
Speaker 2: --this will be the seventh anniversary.
Speaker 1: So they have it every year?
Speaker 2: Every year.  So, Buck O'Neil, all the guys, "Double Duty" [HistoryMaker Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe] used to come down a lot.  Matter of fact, I'd like for you to come down.  I'll tell you what.  I cook five pigs, four crates of chicken, whole lot of fish.  I live right on the ocean.  Any kind of fish you want, I got it.  And we'll just have a good time, and you don't have to pay for nothing.  They honor me with a day for the rest of my life, was given a key to the city.  And I haven't found a key--door yet that key fits.  The mayor, the mayor, they give me anything I want down there in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you seemed to be very popular in Kinston, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Story_ID: 307553
Speaker 1: And when you look back on everything from this vantage point today, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, helping kids.  That's, I think that's the most important thing of all is helping the kids, although I'm not on no, I'm not a great educator, but I know right from wrong.  And I see something wrong, I always like a talk about it.  And it's wrong the way the kids are doing today.  I need to help those that can't help themselves.  And that, that one special kid that want, wants help, I don't mind helping 'em.  I, when I go to school I tell the kids, I say, "Look, if you want something and I can give it, I say, will you accept it?"  I say, "Now I know a whole lot of these guys at the black colleges [HBCUs], and I know some at the white colleges."  And I said, "Now if you want to go to school, you gonna have to want to play sports.  You gonna have to go to school, get your education, and do the right thing."  I said, "Now, you can be anything you want to be.  You got to want it bad enough."  And I said, "I wanted to play baseball, and I played it."
Story_ID: 307554
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this: here lately it's come to--there's a lot of renewed interest in the Negro Leagues, and people are, have gone back to find memorabilia; they've gone back to find the ballplayers; trying to find the statistics; trying to talk to, find out who the ballplayers were.  And there seemed to be some controversy now about people, some are, some people are claiming that some people are claiming to be ballplayers that never played and that sort of thing.  Do you have any thoughts about that, or?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, there are some like that.  But they lost a whole lot of things on the ballplayers that did play and some--well, see, I knowed I played, and it's no problem there.  But yet, they said, some, some of 'em say to cut it off in 1953--'50 [1950].  Well, if they cut it off at 1950, did [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron play?  Did [HistoryMaker] Charley Pride play?  Did [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks play?  All these guys played.  I know who I played with.  I don't have no problem with that.  I don't let things like that bother me because I know I left at an early age, and I played with a team.  Just where did Pittsburgh Pirates buy my con- who'd Pittsburgh Pirates buy my contract from?  Think about that.  They bought it from the Birmingham Black Barons in 1953.  But it's not that many more of us still living.  And I just don't let--look at me.  I don't let nothing bother me.  When somebody says something like that, I wonder if he know who he's talking about.
Speaker 1: I hear you.
Story_ID: 305004
Speaker 1: --We were talking about opening day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, opening day--
Speaker 1: --when you started, when Kansas City Monarchs played the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Birmingham Black Barons and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --how many people were there.
Speaker 2: Yes, when we got there opening day, I'd never seen so many peoples in all my life back in 1952, Birmingham Black Barons' opening day in Kansas City, Missouri, had fifty-two thousand peoples at the ballpark, and I was scared to death.  I had never seen so many peoples out there in my life.  But I went out there and looked up in the stands right quick and got back down in the, went back down in the dugout.  Doc Dennis [Wesley Dennis] said, "What you hiding, what you hiding for?"  He said, "You gonna have to go out there and play against 'em, you might as well stay on out there (laughter)."  Yes, sir, now we used to play, we played Kansas City Monarchs.  They were one of the best teams there, but, during that time.
Speaker 1: So you were about 18, 17, 18?
Speaker 2: Pretty close to seventeen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: But, during that time, I knowed playing out there in Kansas City at that doggone time what the thing was all about.  But I knowed I had to get out there and play against them peoples, and I got a chance to do so, and I did.  Now we used to beat Kansas City real good, although Kansas won more games than we did.  That's how come they won the pennants.  But we used to give Kansas City a fit.  We had some good ballplayers.  They had my friend, Buck.  We had Buck.  We used to wear Buck O'Neil out.  I used to laugh about it.  But anyway, we never did get mad.  We used to have a good, good time after the ballgame.  Man, we used to have a ball after the ballgame then.
Speaker 1: What would you consider at this juncture to be the legacy of the Negro Leagues, you know, and--
Speaker 2: The leg- well if it hadn't been for the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's the importance of--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna put it this way--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: If it hadn't of been for the Negro League, no telling where I would be at today.  I'd probably be at today, be somebody'll be talk, somebody will be doing, telling me to stay in school, get my education, and play sports.  If it hadn't of been for Major League Base- Negro League Baseball, I don't know where I would be.  None of this would have happened to me, none.  I don't think none of it would've happened to me if it hadn't of been for the Negro League.  They taught me how to carry myself, taught me how to dress.  I didn't, I didn't know how to dress.  Looking at the other guys doing this and doing that, and we had some clean ballplayers (laughter).  We didn't have much, but what we had, it was some kind of clean.  We got paid a dollar and half to eat on a day, $150 a month.  Breakfast cost fifteen cents; dinner cost--lunch cost twenty-five; dinner cost fifty-five.  We had enough money to give the waitress a tip and all that stuff.  But just like I told you before, baseball, I'd have played baseball for nothing.  That's how bad I wanted to play baseball.  And baseball was my life, and I cherished it.
Story_ID: 305005
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question, I guess.  And it's similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Carl Long, to help somebody just like I was helped coming up.  I helped a whole lot of peoples when I was law enforcement.  I helped a whole lot of peoples.  Kids come to me that they--"I'm kind of glad that you made me go to school; you run me out of the ballpark, run me out of the park out there, threaten me.  If I didn't go to school, that you was gonna take me down."  They called me--you gotta excuse me--they called me, today and told me, said if it hadn't of been for you, they said, be making me go to school, they said, no telling what would have happened to me.
Story_ID: 305006
Speaker 1: Lot of times when I was in law enforcement I used to go down and talk to the kids.  They'd be in the park when school was going on.  I used to go there and tell, make 'em leave the park and go back to school.  A lot of 'em tell me they were suspended, and I said, "Well, I got someplace else for you to go then if you're suspended.  You don't have no business being out here at this park."  I'll take 'em back to school, sit down and talk to the principal, which I knew real well.  And I said, "Look, you guys gotta do something with these kids.  You can't let 'em--you know, when you suspend 'em from school they're out on the street.  They get into all kind of trouble."  I said, "We gotta do something with them."  Made these kids go back to school.  They called me and let me know they appreciated what I did for them.  And I know how it is coming up.  I know my daddy [William Long] told me what to do.  No means or buts about it, I know what I had to do what my daddy told me to do because he was the man.
Speaker 2: Now he made you graduate from high school, right--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --he pushed it.  Okay.
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  He was my friend, the best man, and I was scared of him.  Man 6'9", 350 pounds--that man, good gracious alive.  And everybody loved him to death.  But I had, I had God on my side.  He's been on my side all along.  Through all this trials and tribulations God have taken care of me--beautiful family, beautiful family.  I can't say enough good things about 'em.  God have taken care of them, although my daughter [Teresa Long Whitfield] passed away.  But, make it so good about it, my granddaughter [LaToyha Polk Washington] looks just like her, identical.  But, I'm here in Chicago [Illinois], and I'm some kind of glad I had the opportunity to come here and speak before you guys.  But I do this all over the country.  I go everywhere talking to kids, letting them know what I'm all about.  I'm trying to get my story out and let the peoples know all the things that I did in the past.  I--they need to know about it.  That's what I do.
Speaker 2: Now has your, has your story been put in book form yet, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it--
Speaker 2: --or is it--
Speaker 1: --it should be in end of December--
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Can you tell us the name of the book, when it comes out?

Speaker 1: Now are you in any, any of the movies about the Negro League or the documentaries?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I had a chance to be in 'Bingo Long,' ['The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings'] but all that happened down there in Birmingham [Alabama].  Birmingham Sam [Sam "Birmingham" Brison], he was there; he was in it, but I was not.  But they had Leon Wagner in there, and he ain't never been in the Negro League.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, sir.  Richard Pryor was in there, 'Bingo Long.'  He ain't never been in the Negro League, although he's playing as a--
Speaker 1: Playing a player, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Although the movie star, Blair Underwood, 'Soul of the Game,' all of it was just a movie though.  But a lot of fiction (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are those movies true to life?
Speaker 2: Some, some, some--
Speaker 1: Some--
Speaker 2: --things--
Speaker 1: What part did they get wrong, or, or is there, is there a part that they get wrong or, or--
Speaker 2: Well, they, they narrating some of the ballplayers, they did this and did that, but a lot of--that they did what they told 'em to do, they put it in there, what they told 'em to do, although we had a good legacy, a good time, although Bob's Savoy in Birmingham, Alabama, what are you talking about--party time, Nashville [Tennessee], Erie Club [ph.], down in Memphis [Tennessee], down on Beale Street, different places like that, Houston [Texas], New Orleans [Louisiana], Atlanta [Georgia], Louisville [Kentucky], Chicago [Illinois].  I pla- Chicago was something else too.
Speaker 1: Chicago American Giants (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You think maybe Chicago was too much fun, 'cause they never won a championship or anything (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't too much fun, but just they didn't get the players.  Although there was--and as you know, a lot of ballplayers come from out of the South.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Although, the Homestead Grays, most of the ballplayers they had was from out of the South (laughter).
Speaker 1: Even then--
Speaker 2: The Homestead Grays was before my time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Homestead Grays played out of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, out of Pittsburgh.  Buck Leonard, sixty miles from me, used to come and see me play when I was playing in the Carolina League, League.  I told him, he said, "Man, you hit that ball just like I used to hit it," and I really hit neat.
