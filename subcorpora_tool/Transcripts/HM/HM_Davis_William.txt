Each thing must create its kind as it travels over the track to bring you back whatever left out of your mind." I really love that, and it was taught to me by my mother, yes.
Story_ID: 25436

Speaker 2: Her full name was Laura, Laura, Laura Cooper.

Speaker 1: Okay, so she was a Cooper, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth was in Lake City, South Carolina on the Franklin Farm. And it was in July the 10th, 1898.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1898.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And now how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Not too far back because of my age, but here again, it's at--I can trace it back to, talking with her when she became very old. And I talked with her. I found out some of her history.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you know about her side of the family?
Speaker 2: About her side of the family.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: She was from, or she was a child of a Sioux Indian, a Sioux Indian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name, as far as I remember had to do with Jonas Franklin, Jonas Franklin.
Speaker 1: Jonas Franklin.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was his last name Cooper?
Speaker 2: No, no, he--when she had--her mother had him before her mother married Mr. Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, so really, she was reared by her grandmother. She was reared by her grandmother. When her grandmother died, then she came down to Mr. Cooper's house because her mother then--after she had my mother, she left and she, her mother, who was named Viola, Viola, she left, and she came down to Georgia. And she married a Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Mr. Cooper and my mother was, more or less, raised until she was about seven or eight by her grandmother.
Speaker 1: Now, what was her grandmother's name? Do you know?
Speaker 2: Her grandmother's name was Charlotte--no, her grandmother's name was--I do not recall it. I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25437
Speaker 1: Sioux Indians are normally from the Dakotas, They're Lakota, that's a French name for the Lakota's--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which is a long away from South Carolina. Is there a story about how your mother's [Laura Cooper] father got to South Carolina or why he was in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, somehow, they had--they were trying to improve the lot of the black people. So they came down to Hampton [Virginia]. Sioux came to Hampton University, and then they spread out through North Carolina and South Carolina. And in order to improve their lot, what they did was that they had children by multiple black ladies. See, he had a, children by three black ladies. And so this is what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's part of a group of the Sioux that were brought to Hampton Institute--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to go to school, I guess?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was Sioux and lots of the other ones too. There were many different tribes there.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: They were trying to improve our lot, yes.
Speaker 1: Interesting, okay, so--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Go ahead, go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, no. This is what they--that's all, that, you know, they could improve our lot. And so they would just have kids by different black ladies.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say "they", you mean the administration of Hampton or who?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Who do you mean, what do you mean by "they"?
Speaker 2: The Sioux.
Speaker 1: I mean in terms of the whole idea of doing this, who's idea was it?
Speaker 2: I think it was Chief Blackfoot, I believe now. But I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm talking about was it, I mean who brought the Sioux to Hampton, and was it their idea to have them have children with black women?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was the Chief of the Sioux who wanted his son to, you know, a group of them come down to Hampton, quite a few Indians, come to Hampton. And that, I think that they decided to intermarry with the black ladies and have kids, and this was throughout North Carolina and throughout North Carolina, and Virginia and South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is a story for somebody to follow up on, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at some point, to find out what this was all about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right. Exactly, exactly, because it was quite a few of them. It was different tribes, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25438
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Laura Cooper] have a chance to go to school or anything--
Speaker 2: She, her dad, who was Sioux, what he did, is that he educated the girls. Mother, mother didn't want anything more to do with him. So she, when she went to Georgia, she--and her mother died, she was brought, she was taken down to Georgia. And really, she did not know her mother at that time, and her mother had to punish her to let her know that she was her mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she had a really difficult time staying in that particular family, the Cooper family 'cause she was very, you know, fair. And they were dark. So she told me this in later years, and it really was something. And I was very surprised about it, is that she had to, you know, many times, that Mr. Cooper, who was black, he would demand that she leave the house. And she spent a lots of time with Aunt in, not Homerville, but in Allguy (ph.), Georgia, see that, because she couldn't stay with her mother and the Coopers. But all of, now, all of her brothers and sisters are the children of Cooper,--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Mr. Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay, so those are all, basically, her half brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, so they were half brothers and sisters. And so she went to school and she had a very difficult time. The kids would not play with her so much. And so the teacher would really work with her, you know, in grammar school. And so she, she worked and she went to school. But she didn't go to college. She just went to, you know--the school at that time, they just had a school there for black children.
Speaker 1: So how far do you think she went?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: About how far did she go? Did she finish--
Speaker 2: I think she finished the level of a high school, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Do you know the name of her high school by any chance?
Speaker 2: It was--it wasn't like the high schools that we have now. Here was a high school in Sandy Bottom which was black, Sandy Bottom, which was just black. And they had one teacher to teach all different classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a very unique type of educational setting, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, it wasn't like--basically, it wasn't like a, the school system that we have now.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: It was just a school that was made for blacks and one or two teachers would teach all of the--everything there was to be taught.
Story_ID: 25439
Speaker 1: What was your mother [Laura Cooper] interested in? I mean did she have any particular talents or skills or--
Speaker 2: She, her greatest interests in, were in sewing, making clothes and, let me see. The other things that she was very much interested, she was interested in--she was very disappointed about not being able to go on to college. Her mother, when her mother brought her down to South Carolina--no, brought her down to Georgia, okay, then her father did not educate her like the other two girls were educated through college. So she always felt that she had been short changed because she was born, you see what I mean? She, her mother had had her out of wedlock, and she thought that her mother should have let her dad educate her like the other two girls had been educated, okay. So she felt really strongly about that. She felt strongly about education. She loved education. She read, and she did many different things in terms of, you know, reading different things like philosophy and the, you know, the things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where did her sisters go to school?
Speaker 2: Her sister?
Speaker 1: Her sisters, yeah, the two sisters that went to school, where did they go to college?
Speaker 2: She, oh, yes. Her two sisters, I never knew, but I knew that they went to the University of--I think that they went to Howard University in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: And they got their degrees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I--I've been traveling up there, and I have run into one of them and, you know, and they--she held a very high position in one of the government agencies up there.
Story_ID: 25440
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Kince Chapman Davis, K-I-N-C-E, Chapman, C-H-A-P-M-A-N, Kince Chapman Davis.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now is there a story behind the name Kince?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that, let me see, yes, there's a story behind it. When his granddaddy came over--no, when his dad come over, he jumped off the ship and Kinston, North Carolina. And so he was named after that town.
Speaker 1: Kinston.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kinston.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. And that's K-I-N-S-T-O-N?
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kinston, North Carolina, yeah.
Speaker 2: And his dad was named Raiford--you know, that name that you gave me for Ossie, yeah, Raiford Chap--
Speaker 1: Raiford Chapman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Raiford Chapman.
Speaker 1: Okay, so his father's name was Raiford Chapman Davis?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So--
Speaker 2: And he was Jewish.
Speaker 1: Okay, and his was Jewish, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: This is why, for some reason they congregated in North Carolina because, you know, just two or three years ago, you know, they have made an Afro-American lady, you know, one of the leaders of the Jewish congregation there in North Carolina just about two or three years ago. So, for, for some reason--I don't know the reason why, but he jumped ship. He jumped ship.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of ship was this?
Speaker 2: This was, as far as I know, it was a slave ship. But I don't think that he ever was a slave. Now, just as far as I know. We're trying to, tracing the history on it now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: But we know that he was Jewish because when his people would come, his uncle would come from Ethiopia, from Ethiopia and they would cook food a certain way, okay, and this type of thing like this. But he adopted Christianity because he didn't want to have, against the kids, you see, them being Jewish and also being black. So my dad adopted Christianity.
Speaker 1: Okay. So just for the record now, his name is spelled, your grandfather's name is spelled, R-A-I-F-O-R-D?
Speaker 2: R-A-I-F-O-R-D, Raiford Chapman.
Speaker 1: And Chapman is C-H-A--is it "T" or "P"?
Speaker 2: I would say, I would use C-H-A-P-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: "P", Chapman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Chapman.
Speaker 1: Chapman, okay, Davis. Alright, that's interesting. Now, so there's a mystery in there to be, you know, untangled. There's a mystery in there to be untangled too.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So the family is that he was Ethiopian, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was Ethiopian.
Speaker 1: And when would he have come over, you grandfather 'cause you're--
Speaker 2: Oh, some time right after slavery was over, I believe.
Story_ID: 25441
Speaker 1: Now, what is your father's [Kince Chapman Davis] date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Eighteen eighty-seven [1887].
Speaker 1: Eighteen eighty-seven [1887]. And was he born in Kinston?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was your father born in Kinston?
Speaker 2: Yeah, North Carolina--
Speaker 1: --South Carolina--no, North Carolina--
Speaker 2: North Carolina--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that's right.
Speaker 2: It's North Carolina.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay. So, then his father was, okay, so I just wonder--I'm wondering if his father didn't come over on the Merchant Marine or something?
Speaker 2: Sure, I have some doubts it was really a slave ship.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I really have some doubt that it was a slave ship. It was, because slavery wasn't being practiced on the Eastern side of Africa, but it was the Western side of Africa where, more or less, the slave trade was.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir. That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: So, but I know that for some reason he landed in, in Kinston.
Speaker 1: Now, there are stories, we've heard stories from other people about their ancestors coming from Madagascar and a couple from Somaliland, and, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on Merchant boats, you know,--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --coming over.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Madagascar, now, that's a, they could have come over--I mean there's a lot of mysterious, you know, stories I hear--not a lot, maybe less than 10, of ancestors from East Africa.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so, I mean it's something that, you know, researchers need to check out, I would think, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --just to find out.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But this is kind of a mysterious story. But, okay, so the story in the family is that he was Jewish from Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And your father, Kince, was named for Kinston, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did you ever meet your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: As a kid? No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I saw his pictures, you know--you know, on my dad's side. I saw, I saw him, you know, I saw him, but I think I was just too small.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he look like, did he look like a Jewish person. Did he have a long beard or did he wear any, anything--
Speaker 2: He would dress, he would always have on a tie. He would dress, and he was tall and skinny like.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So, now, well what did your father say about growing up?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What did your father say about growing up?
Speaker 2: He said that he, that his dad married a slave lady and that they, there were quite a few problems in terms of them seeing eye to eye. So her dad--his dad walked out on the family or something of this type, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, he married a lady who had been in slavery then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Had been in slavery?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think her name as Charity Davis, no, Charity--before she was, before married dad's dad, her name was Charity, Charity Simmons, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then she married dad, her name becomes Charity Davis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25442
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father [Kince Davis] and the Sessoms?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --yeah. He was a, you know, like his dad [Raiford Davis] was, they was Herbalist, you know, they would make herb tonics and I could show you a picture of a label, okay, a picture of a label.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was an herbalist, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and his dad was too. Well, you see, his dad taught him. They were herbiest and they never, basically would, you know, they were self-contained. Like, for instance, he wouldn't actually, you know, after he left Mr. Sessoms, he kind of like was on his own, you know. He was kind of covering his own, and he would not work for any other Caucasian.
Speaker 1: Now, so--
Speaker 2: And so he would extract herbs and use that for tonic and that he distributed that and sold that throughout Southern Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell, now, we didn't get the part we just discussed on tape. So, I mean we didn't record that. So you have to tell us again who was Alex Sessoms and what his relationship was to your father?
Speaker 2: Alex Sessoms was a Caucasian, very wealthy man, very wealthy. And he owned a lots of land. And for some reason, he hired my dad. He had special respect, for my dad to build a railroad from Waycross to Cogdell [Georgia]. Cogdell is a little town just North of, just North of Homerville [Georgia], okay. And he is so well known that basically, that he was--he--and I guess that made many white people angry that they, that he had hired a black man to make a railroad, okay, to make a railroad.
Speaker 1: So that meant that your father was in charge of the project to get--
Speaker 2: That's right, to--
Speaker 1: --this railroad from--
Speaker 2: --build this railroad.
Speaker 1: From Waycross to Cogdell?
Speaker 2: To Cogdell.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we experienced some, many threats. He experienced many threats because the people thought that he was thinking that he was a white man, and they would say that, this is, this is not a job that you should have. And so even the Ku Klux Klan threatened him many times. And in my brother's book, you can see that many times, they would--the city or the policemen would just take him in. When he was coming from high school in Waycross, they would take him in, and then, you know, whip him. And he wouldn't say anything to dad because he know if dad would go back down there, it would become very, very--you know, it would become--he felt as if dad would be at a disadvantage, at a disadvantage.
Speaker 1: So who would they whip, again? I'm sorry. Who was it that--
Speaker 2: Who, where?
Speaker 1: Who did they--
Speaker 2: Alex Sessoms.
Speaker 1: They would whip Mr. Sessoms, you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were, you see, Sessoms hired dad and a group of men and both white and black to build that railroad. I just found this out when I was down there Labor Day. And Sessoms knew that he was being threatened by many different white groups, but Sessoms would always talk them off as far as the people told me in September, by saying to them that if you bother him, then we will, I will possibly hurt you and no one will never find you because, see, he owned a great deal of land. He owns, oh, he just owned a lots of land. So he figured that he could, he kind of kept 'em off dad and if you read some place in Ossie's book, he would tell you, he was constantly being threatened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Constantly being threatened.
Story_ID: 25443
Speaker 1: We discussed off-camera that your father [Kince Davis] could read Hebrew.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he could not read English. He was, he was not educated at all, and he couldn't read English. And he had to get Ossie to read stuff for him and stuff like that, okay, but he was not educated at all.
Speaker 1: But he could read Hebrew though?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is--so, did his father [Raiford David] teach him how to do that?
Speaker 2: Possibly.
Speaker 1: And he was involved in a Jewish Temple, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Kind of a secret Jewish Temple.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a secret, yes.
Speaker 1: With Mr. Sessoms?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: This is very secret, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know about it when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I knew that there was something odd, but not exactly because he didn't want, you know, he didn't want us to be seen like that because we would have two things to fight, being that, and also is being black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25444
Speaker 1: Now, sir, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad's dad [Raiford David], somehow, suggested to dad that he marry her [Laura Cooper]. Now, this was dad's second marriage. But he had married another girl, and she had died on--and he had had one daughter with her. And the daughter is now also dead. And then his daddy selected mother for him to marry.
Speaker 1: So, was it okay with her (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was it okay with your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was okay, I think, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was okay, and mother thought that he had some very strange ways (unclear) fact that the dad told her, said, you should, you should marry someone who would have, you know, who would have a background that's very similar to yours or something like of that type. And so he would go over to her house unannounced and mother didn't like that because she wasn't dressed or nothing, see. So, but somehow they, they did marry.
Story_ID: 25445
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and their dispositions and their thoughts and their views and their sense of humor, and how they walked and talked, and how they looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I take after my mother [Laura Cooper] more or less. I do. My dad [Kince Davis] was more or less, he was, he was a good salesman. He was a good entrepreneur, you know, like you know how to sell things. And this he enjoyed doing, and--more or less. And he also, I remember, one of the first things I remember is that I was trying to get his attention because he had a, one of my brothers, Kenneth, who was a younger--he was between me and Ossie. See, there's a girl, Kenneth and Essie and Kenneth was older than I was.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, this may be a good time to just--can you name everybody and put 'em order--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --for me?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in order, yes. There was Ossie Davis--
Speaker 1: He's the oldest, right?
Speaker 2: There was, yes--
Speaker 1: And his name now--let's get his name straight. A lot of people (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --they spell his name.
Speaker 2: O-S-S-I-E, and this was due to the lady hurrying--I think mother told them to name him, she wanted to name him R.C. or something like this. But that wasn't really his name, Ossie, Ossie.
Speaker 1: The O-S-S-I-E is not really his name, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right--
Speaker 1: --because he's--
Speaker 2: And you know exactly what his name was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was Raiford Chapman, right, Chapman.
Speaker 2: Right, Raiford Chapman--
Speaker 1: Davis.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Ossie comes from your mother calling him, right, calling him R.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes, R.C., that's right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: And so the lady in Homerville [Georgia], she wrote that down, Ossie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, then they had a daughter, Essie, E-S-S-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had a son, after the daughter, for which dad named after him, okay, named him--his name was Kince Chapman Davis, but he, like I did, changed his name to Kenneth, to Kenneth because, you see, he, more or less, like Ossie says, he went to school to be a pharmacist, and this helped daddy realize his dream, okay.
Story_ID: 25446
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he [his brother] was also almost, you know, like daddy [Kince Davis]. You know, he could sell you or he would talk, you know, he could sell you things. Whereas, when I was a little boy, and at that time, my dad had a drugstore, and when I was a little boy. Then I would go in the drugstore, and I would take candy and just give it to kids the next day. And I would just take candy. So I was just, I wasn't a person who would sell things. I would get things and just give it, give them away. See what I mean? And so he, he was--he had a rule that I could come into the drugstore, see what I mean? And so he assigned me duties around the house and around the place out there. And he also, one time, he planted a cornfield for me to take care of so that I would not be any, have anything to do with coming over to the drugstore, okay. He was a very concerned--and I can see his concerns now, about a dad, a mother and the children. See, my mother [Laura Cooper] could not have a job with anyone else. She had to be a mother to us, you see that?
Speaker 1: So your father didn't want her to work for anybody?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He wanted (unclear), and she didn't. In front of--behind his back, now, we never knew this, but she did, Ossie did bring some clothes down there for her to wash for some white people. But now dad and the children never knew this, okay. They never--we never knew it. The difference between Ossie and mother, he was the oldest. And so basically, I would say that I was like my mother because of the fact of it is, is that my dad seen this, a tendency of me to give and not to be an, you know what I mean, I wasn't like him, more or less. And so what he did was that, he loved me, and he always would say to us that you are my choice, and I selected you and did not select me. But I selected you. So you're going to do what I tell you to do. Also, he always wanted, always to know where we were. We didn't have any free time after school. See that? He had to know where you were. He didn't want you to lollygag like Ossie has in his book where he was out after 10:00 o'clock one night, and dad locked the door and this type of thing like this.
Story_ID: 25447
Speaker 1: See, he [his father, Kince Davis] was very sensitive about us having children out of wedlock and the children winding up with no father or no mother. And that, this would really undo the black race, see. That would really undo it. And this is what is actually happening now. This is what is happening now. That our boys are walking off, having kids and walking off and leaving them, see what I mean. And I thought that was very, being tight on us and being very strict, but now I can see, and I can understand what he saw at that time, what he could see, you know, when he would say that, you know, that you're my choice. And he would assign duties, assign things for us to do, see what I mean. And we didn't have any chance to be free out there to lollygag and to play around. Like I remember just walking home from high school, see, and I played the violin, and he made it possible, see. He made it possible. And I don't know to this date why that I just had to play the violin. (Unclear) I was very young, and he would suggest that he made the arrangements for everything, see. He then hired a classical guitarist who was white to teach me the violin, see that? And so I played the violin, and Ossie played the piano. Essie played the piano and all of us was, you know, we had things to do. Like, for instance, from high school, he would say you have a half hour when class is out to get from high school home. You don't have time to lollygag, and then he saw me one time just talking to a girl. And he told me, he said, son, it's too early, said, okay, said, when class is out, I want you home. Now, you're gonna have this to do, you know. There were always things to be done, never you're free. And he was very, almost, he would select sometimes the kids with whom we could play with, see, because see, he was--he played a very good and commanding part in our lives, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting--
Speaker 1: And he would talk about, you know, things at the table and tell us all different stories and he was a really, a long talker. Mother wouldn't hardly say anything, but then I find out that when she was 98 years of age, I told her, I said, well, you were a kid to him like we were. And then she told me, she said, you know, I didn't say anything, you know, and I wouldn't counter him in front of y'all because she would act just like a kid. But behind closed doors, I kind of like ran everything (laughter). See, that, and she knew how to, how to deal with a man,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a dear man.
Story_ID: 25448
Speaker 1: But then, we have a very--my family, we had a very close relationship. Like he would tell us stories. There were always stories told at the table, and no matter what was going on, he had innocent things to talk about, talked about history, what was going on and this type of thing like this and it was almost like a sermon, (unclear) we just, we just sat and listened to him as he'd say it.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: And as he, he had the same philosophy, you know, to be able to, you know--he wouldn't talk too much about the hatred that was against us. He wouldn't talk a great deal about that. He was, you know, about what the white person could do. He would always say, you know, if a man could outthink you and outdo you, he's automatically your master. So, he felt like Carver [George Washington Carver] that, you know, you must be able to do some things for yourself, see, see. And just, that is true, see. If you're able to do something, you know, you know how to do something, and you do it because even Booker T. Washington said, if you're given the opportunity and don't know how to use it, it is just like you being given nothing; said the thing--and he was very much--dad really loved Carver and Booker T. Washington's philosophy, you know. Become capable of doing it yourself, you know what I mean, work, read, do these things, you know, see. And he was always this, you know, just begging--like, for instance, I've seen this Hispanic guy, and I can't call his name now. But I saw writings, what he says is that he would rather die on his feet than to beg on his knees, or something like that, you know. He wanted to say that it was a capability, you know, your capability, you should be able to do it, and that's what kind of guided me and that's why that he was friendly with Dr. Carver and with Tuskegee Institute and their philosophy.
Story_ID: 25449
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna return to this, but I wanted you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to finish doing your family. You talked about your brother is--Ossie Davis, is the oldest one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Ossie is the oldest. Then Essie, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Kenneth and Curtis.
Speaker 1: Then Kince or Kenneth.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, now--
Speaker 2: And then me, William--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, oh, yes. What did Essie do for a living? What did Essie do?
Speaker 2: Essie?
Speaker 1: Yes, what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a social worker--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, oh, I should have bought some books on her because she was very talented. She finished college. She was a well-known social worker, and she was the first black lady who was over the VA Department in Washington, D.C., over a certain section, you know, over a certain section. She was really very known.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very well know, that's right.
Speaker 1: And what was her last name professionally?
Speaker 2: Essie Davis.
Speaker 1: Essie Davis, okay.
Speaker 2: That's right, Essie Davis Morgan.
Speaker 1: Okay,--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Essie Davis Morgan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can--as a--matter of fact, I can send you some history on her.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I just wanted to know. And everybody knows Ossie Davis was an actor, director and a writer, activist.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a social worker and administrator.
Speaker 1: And you said that Kenneth--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Kenneth--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --was a pharmacist.
Speaker 2: Was a pharmacist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: A pharmacist, yes, that's right a pharmacist.
Speaker 1: And then comes you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, me, William.
Speaker 1: And, okay, and--
Speaker 2: And then after me, there was James.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: James, and what did James do?
Speaker 2: James was, got a major in biology, and he was a teacher of biology.
Speaker 1: Okay, biology teacher. Did he teach at the high school level or the college level?
Speaker 2: He taught at the high school level.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where did he teach? In what city?
Speaker 2: What's the name of the black school, Tuscaloosa.
Speaker 1: Oh, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where he died, yes, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, Tuscaloosa.
Speaker 2: He was very young. Yes.
Speaker 1: And did anyone come after James?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it?
Speaker 2: That was the last one.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay. Alright.
Speaker 2: So really James and I was kind of like similar and we, we were the two that played together. And we were very close together. As a matter of fact, we went to the same college together, you know. And we couldn't sell well, you know, we weren't that type of, we didn't have the mindset, you know, to sell things. We would give things away (laughter).
Story_ID: 25450
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory, the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, the first thing I remember?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, the first thing I remember is that I was making an attempt to get my dad's [Kince Davis] attention because he, as I say, he loved us and everything, but he would pay a lots attention to the kid who was, like him, K.C. was his junior, okay. So I was trying to get his attention. I was a little boy. And so I reported to dad that he had torn up my car that we had gotten for Christmas. We had gotten some little toys, and they were wagons, you know. So I told him, I said, well, Kenneth have torn mine up. And he said, let me see it. And so before he can get around there, I, as a little boy, went around and got a brick and went to the toy and hit it for him--to show it. And for some reason dad knew that I was going, that I did that. And so he told me, he say now, you know, you have now lost your toy for the whole year because of what you have done. But for some reason--and this has been a great part of my thinking and philosophy the years since because I, you know, knowing that you, for some reason we are born knowing right from wrong, you see what I mean, because I could not been over four or five, see. And we knew--I knew this was wrong, and I went and put it down. No one, no, he told me, now, son, that's, that was--that's very much wrong, see. But somehow--he said, and you knew it. And that means that, now, you will not get one automobile or a wagon, I mean or anything else for the rest of the year. And I remember that well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember doing the days when food was very scarce and that, you know, and that during that particular time is that a chicken was a very important animal because people would steal your chickens and this type of thing like this and that they would feed the chickens, some people would keep a certain amount of chickens where people could not steal them. And they would turn, they would use about five or six of them that they don't plan to eat, and they would feed them, and they called at that time, "Blue Gull". And this Blue Gull that they fed the chicken, it wouldn't hurt the chicken. But if you stole that chicken and ate that chicken, you got so sick that you would want someone to hurt you, you know what I mean? And so I remember that as a kid, is that people walking alone and taking up a chicken and putting in there, here or something of this type. I remember that one night a man was in our chicken house, in the house, and then mother [Laura Cooper], being very afraid, she came out and she hollered, "Who is in that chicken house there?" And a voice come out from there, say, "No one except for us chickens", see that. And mother then came back in the house and got a gun, and she, I remember looking at her, and she shot it up in the air. And then this man, okay, whoever he was, he was so frightened that he walked out of the chicken yard, but he was higher than the chicken place was. And when he stood up, the chicken house raised on him, so as he walked, the chicken house walked also, you know, with him, see. And so dad [Kince Davis] wasn't home. See, dad at that time, was very busy traveling, selling his herbs, selling his herbs throughout Alabama, Southern Georgia and Florida, all over.
Story_ID: 25451
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the home you grew up in? Did you grow up in the same home--now, you moved a few times. You went from Waycross [Georgia] to Valdosta [Georgia], right, and then--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And then we, this was--where I remember more was at Valdosta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--I was very small in Waycross. I was very small in Waycross. I did not go to school there, formal school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I started my school in Valdosta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the grammar school was basically, Magnolia Grammar School, and it wasn't too far from us.
Speaker 1: Okay, Magnolia Grammar School?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what kind of house did you live in? What was it--was it a big house in Valdosta or--
Speaker 2: Yes, we got a pretty good house on West Street in Valdosta, Georgia, and it didn't have running water at that time, you know. And you had to use lamps, but it was a pretty good house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1932 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about '32' [1932].
Speaker 1: Okay, about 1932.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're about six years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay, 1932.
Speaker 2: --about six years old.
Speaker 1: So, okay, and, now, was it just your mother [Laura Cooper] and your father [Kince Davis] and the children or were there--did other relatives stay with you?
Speaker 2: It was just more or less, my mother and father, and just us.
Speaker 1: Just the children?
Speaker 2: And just the children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just to start with now, to start with. Later on, some of the kin people came from Ethiopia and my mother's--she didn't have really strong contact with her half sisters, but some of them would come from time to time.
Speaker 1: Now, you say kin folk from Ethiopia. Now, were they really, I mean they came all the way from Ethiopia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, come all the way over, come all the way over here for some--and the only reason why we were, we would get a little concerned when they came that they would eat smelly goat, you know, smelly goat meat.
Speaker 1: Oh, goat meat?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I remember as a little boy, they come and they were eating goat meat and it was smelling.
Speaker 1: Now, were they Jewish?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were they all the way from Ethiopia or were they living in New York or someplace else like that?
Speaker 2: No, I think that his uncle would come from Ethiopia. I think so now. I think--you know, he was a small man, fair. He wasn't black, and he looked like Haile Selassie. He looked similar to Haile Selassie.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And he was--
Speaker 1: --real dark, but he was--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He wasn't really, real dark, but he was--
Speaker 2: Right, right. He wasn't. He wasn't very dark. And he would come to see dad, and they would have a talk and things like this, and we didn't understand it or know it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we lived on West Street is when I started to go to grammar school.
Speaker 1: And you went to--
Speaker 2: James and I started.
Story_ID: 25452
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and smells.
Speaker 1: Sounds too, sounds too, sights, sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, at that particular time, I think it just was, the sights were just the home and the well outside of the home where we had to get water out of, and that type thing. And the horse and wagons and this type thing. And dad [Kince Davis] had a running car then that it wasn't too much, you know.
Speaker 1: So what kind was it? Was it a--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What kind of car was it?
Speaker 2: It was, the car that come before the Cadillac, I think. I think, there's a car that went out, not the Studebaker, but it was another car that they had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I know that when I was such a, so interested in just seeing this thing running, you know, and this type of thing like this and that is, I was gonna try, I wondered why that it didn't run on water. So by myself, I put some water in the tank, and boy, this was upsetting to my dad. And that was a sight that I remember because I was punished for it. Another sight that I remember is that we had a grocery store that was on the corner. And it was run by a lady, and she was very white, but she wasn't, she was half black and half white.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she looked like she was white?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she ran this store. And she had some very fine children who we used to play with. She had one boy and she had three girls. And also, and this what I remember, you know. When things just getting started, you know, you know, when you are very small. Just the automobile and the wells and cleanliness of the wells and this type thing like this, and, and things of that type, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: We had, I don't think that we had a radio at that particular point.
Story_ID: 25453
Speaker 1: Did your father [Kince Davis] own his own home at that point or was he renting from somebody?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would always be buying his house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, did he has a--was his drugstore running then? Did he have his drugstore?
Speaker 2: On West Street, no. We moved to Oak Street. We were closer to town. And that's where that he built a drugstore next to our house.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was then possibly, it was my first or second year in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so you were about--
Speaker 2: See, he was selling--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --then his herbs, and the police would come out because the black doctors and everyone else would report that he was selling these herbs. And the police came out one time, as I remember, and he told dad to pour the, the root extract that dad was extracting--see, he would take the roots and put 'em in an iron pot and on the outside of the house, he would put a fire up under it. And he would take the roots and extract everything out of it. Extract everything out of it. And for some reason, the doctors thought that that was something that was horrible. And the police came and having to pour it out, and daddy refused to pour it out.
Speaker 1: So what happened?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What happened, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --he refused to pour it out. What did they do?
Speaker 2: They, because daddy told 'em, well, dad would, they would take dad to jail then. But he would get out very soon because for some reason the Caucasian people, the white people who was Jewish there, kind of like, would help him to get out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, there was--when we moved on Oak Street, and I learned this afterwards, I learned this afterwards, that the county, more or less, had appointed a black man to kill my dad. And his name was Fonza Curry.
Speaker 1: They had appointed him to kill your father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to kill my dad, oh, yeah. I don't know why that they had that, that--if, from Waycross [Georgia] to, yeah, you see, he would not work for them, see what I mean? He wouldn't work for them, and he wouldn't say, yes, sir, or anything like that to them. He wasn't friendly, and he always liked to be, even though we would almost be starved to death for food, he would stand his ground. You see what I mean? And that's why mother [Laura Cooper], to put some food on the table, what she did as a mother and as a sweet mother, what she would do is that, you know, send clothes--she would take in white people's clothes, and she would wash them, and Ossie was slipping to take 'em down to the people's homes. But James and I and Kenneth was too young to know about this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she had, you know, to put food on the table.
Speaker 1: So he was off--
Speaker 2: He was, he was into those herbs and not working for a Caucasian.
Story_ID: 25454
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about this plot to kill your father [Kince Davis]? What, they, the county hired a man?
Speaker 2: Yes, the county.
Speaker 1: And what was his name, what was the man's name?
Speaker 2: Fonza Curry. How you spell that? Let me see, Fonza, yeah, Fonza. He was a local undertaker, okay. And I found out the reason why that he was an undertaker and they hired him. See, they hired him because of the fact is that, you know, Negroes then were migrating North, okay. And they were hoboing, okay. And in Valdosta [Georgia], the train going East and West, and a train going North and South, they crossed right there in Valdosta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had a very lovely garden right around those railroad tracks. And this would entice the hobos who mostly were black to jump off. When the train stopped to get water, they would jump off and, to get them some fruit or something like this, you know, some peaches and--they had all of that out there. When they jumped off the train and Fonza Curry was hired to put a gun on them and made them work the farms for the Caucasian people in Lowndes County. And if you didn't, he would beat you to death.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the name of the county?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What's the name of that county?
Speaker 2: Lowndes County.
Speaker 1: Lowndes--
Speaker 2: L-O-W-, L-O-W-N--Lowndes, L-O-W-E-N-D-E-L-R, I think, Lowndes, Lowndes County, yes. It's Valdosta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Fonza Curry was well known, but I noticed that he would never go to church, and he wasn't friendly with other people, and people were more or less kind of afraid of him, you know. And he would come down the streets, and sometimes I would smell that he had alcohol on him, you know what I mean? And he would walk right by dad's drugstore and stuff like this, and he was just as nice as he could be. And they lived--our house was here. There's a big church next door, and there was a field, and then he lived right beyond that field. He lived on Oak Street. And what he would do is that if you were not, or you refused to, okay, work the farms, where you were a hobo. You jumped off that train to get something, you know, you know, to just get something to eat, and you gonna jump back on the train. But Fonza Curry and them had planted a garden around where those tracks crossed, okay. And the hobos would jump off. So many people would say to you many times, say, you know what, my son went North, and I never heard from him because, you know, why? He never got up there. They stopped him right there, you know what I mean? He jumped off. Fonza Curry threw a gun on him and then if he refused to work those farms, he would beat him, beat him to death. Yes. So that was, many times. You see Valdosta was so small that, you know, we--there were two sides of town and the morticians were on the other side of town, and we were on this side of town.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Fonza Curry was a mortician.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He was a mortician too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a mortician. He was, he was a--very good, but strangely enough, he had, already his tombstone and his wife's tombstone out at the graveyard. Wasn't that something? He already had it out there because he knew that grown people hated him that much or something. He didn't have any children, didn't have any children. He already had his tombstone out there. And it was later, I found out that he had been hired to kill my dad. I know that in the drugstore my dad had a gun, up under the counter. And when he came in there, my dad would always take care of him and dad would, would go over there and take care of him because I think that dad--see, very seldom--now, we're just talking about history now. See, (unclear) but very seldom would dad be without a gun, very seldom. In other words, one time he forgot and went downtown and mother [Laura Cooper] left my sister, left us with my sister and she took the gun down there to him, okay, because she, you see, they were after him. And many times that he was in jail or one time that he was in jail, and a Caucasian man came to mother and said, "Look, if he would work my fields, I would get him out of jail." And mother took the Caucasian man down there to get him out of jail. And dad wouldn't, he wouldn't. He would stay right there. He would stay right there. And he would tell the Caucasian man and my mother, go home, see.
Story_ID: 25455
Speaker 1: Now, about what time, what year did they, the county hire this man to kill your father?
Speaker 2: About, from about '28' [1928] to '37' [1937]. You mean what year when they--
Speaker 1: What time period, yeah, was that?
Speaker 2: Time period, oh, he--from--Fonza Curry was quite old, so he had done this since probably the '20's [1920s] and the '30's [1930s], '20's [1920s] and the '30's [1930s]. He had done that.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so--
Speaker 2: And you see--
Speaker 1: So he didn't, but he was, but did he--well, what happened with your father? He didn't kill him, did he? I mean he didn't--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I was there when, for some reason, he told dad about it, but dad, the white people had already told dad, see, because--
Speaker 1: So the--
Speaker 2: --dad was a Hebrew.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your dad's Hebrew friends had told him, the Jewish friends had already told him.
Speaker 2: Had told him, had told him that he, or that he was subject to being killed by Fonza Curry, okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they already paid Fonza Curry to do it?
Speaker 2: Right, the county will pay him to do it. The county will pay him to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: But he didn't do it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: He didn't do it, right?
Speaker 2: He didn't do, nor did he try. And dad told him, when I think I was in high school, and he was talking to dad, and he told dad that, and dad say, "That was one mistake that you didn't make because if you had tried, I would have blown your brains out. I always had that gun ready for you." He said, that was one mistake, Fonza, that you didn't make. And that's the reason why he always would have in his car or his pocket, a gun, every, you know, he just wouldn't, he just wouldn't go. And my mother [Laura Curry] was just so afraid for him, you know, and oh, she was afraid.
Story_ID: 25456
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school. Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked school because of the fact is that possibly Ossie and Essie and them, they had gone--they were in school in Waycross [Georgia] when we were just small kids, see. Ossie and Essie started school--no, I think Ossie started school in Waycross, and then he--
Speaker 1: So they had like a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --finished school in Waycross also.
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the school he came out of in--it was a high school, right in Waycross?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, I forgot the name of it, but I know that he--
Speaker 1: I know he told us--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --some years ago.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and he, he--when we moved to Valdosta [Georgia], the teachers came over and told dad [Kince Davis] that it would be good if he could finish in Waycross. So then he went back to Waycross and stayed with one of my mother's sisters and finished school there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you were grade--now, you were in grade school, you started school at Magnolia School, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, we, now, the next generation, Kenneth and I--I think when we moved to Valdosta, Essie was of a high school age. She went to Dasher High School, okay. And she went to Dasher High School. We went to Magnolia School. It was a grammar school for black people. It had all black teachers, see all black teachers there.
Speaker 1: Now, this is at Dasher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dasher was and also--
Speaker 1: And Magnolia.
Speaker 2: --Magnolia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25457
Speaker 1: Essie was going to Dasher High, while we were going to Magnolia [Grammar School]. And she, her job was to, you know, to work with Kenneth and me and James in terms of reading in the evening, you know. She would read with us and this type thing. She was in high school so she was able to do it. Also, she had already been taught piano, and she would, you know, tell us about the piano and things of this type.
Speaker 2: Okay, now--
Speaker 1: Okay, and so basically, Kenneth and James and I went to Magnolia High School, and this high school--no, Magnolia Grammar School, okay, grammar school. And what I remember there is that the teachers were, all of them were actually mixed. They were fair.
Speaker 2: Fair skinned?
Speaker 1: Yeah, only, only one or two of them were dark, okay. They were fair people, okay. And so they taught, and they would have a singing section where they would let us, to sing, you know. And I remember some of the songs so well, you know, after you grow up, you know. And there were ones that I really liked, and it was that, "All Things Come Home in the Evening Time". I used to love that one. "All Things Come Home in the Evening Time--
Speaker 2: How does it go?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any of it?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Can you sing some of it for us?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: [Singing] All things come home at evening time, like birdies weary from their longing and so I [humming]--you know, it's something like this. I can't remember all of the words, but I know I'd just sing it. And they used to sing another song, and I can hear their voices now of the (unclear) singing, [singing] Welcome sweet Springtime we sing thee a song dah, dah, dah, dah--, welcome sweet Springtime--but it had a good, because for some reason, in Valdosta [Georgia], the blacks were very well educated in terms of music because we had, the churches would always have music instruments there. And some people there who had been trained up in Northern states and some of the churches there, some of the churches there, and the churches are fine. I, I used to wonder. I knew that the slaves could not have made 'em. And I've just recently found out, is that there was that was by our house. That was a beautiful, it was red and black brick, red and black brick church. And that was the most wonderful that I've ever seen in my life. I was just overwhelmed by it. And I found out, is that there was a black guy in Birmingham [Alabama], and I don't know his name exactly, but I do have it in the office, is that he had designed all of those churches in Valdosta, and they are very nice. You know, they aren't just little shanties. You understand what I'm saying? Plus, the fact they had people who were well-versed with playing the organ, who was well educated and this type thing. They had gone to Alabama State [University] or Georgia State [University] or Morehouse [College] or somewhere like this, and the churches that were really Pentecostal or holy was just one or two churches. The churches were very, very organized and as a matter of fact, the principal of our high school was the pastor of the First Baptist Church, see that.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: His name was James Lomax. And he's well known and the streets are named--two or three streets there are named after him now. And he was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he knew Valdosta and, and he told us that he helped build Dasher High [School]. Dasher High was a brick high school, brick, made out of brick, nice.
Story_ID: 25458
Speaker 1: In grade school, when you were a little fellow--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --what, were you interested in science?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact, they would talk with us. I wasn't too much interested science. I didn't know what science was. But I, I was very much taken back by how daddy [Kince Davis] was extracting material from the roots and how he would add stuff to it, and put it in a bottle. And I was very much, that very much stayed with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the first thing, extraction, you know, of the roots and the herbs and the different chemicals that he would put in there right in his (unclear). I think he had about seven different preparations, tonics of which he would travel throughout the South and I don't know, just throughout Alabama and Georgia and Florida. And he would make that trip once a month.
Speaker 1: Now, would he go--did he have like a wagon with his, you know, did he travel by horse and wagon? Or how would he go?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, dad--at that time, he had a, you mean, he had a automobile.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the automobile was coming into being then. It was really, really something that, that was very enjoyable for us because, you know, many things were done still with the horse and wagon like the slop man would come and get your slop with a horse and wagon and the toilets were always dealt with. A man would come behind your toilets and take up the material and put it in a horse and wagon, a big ole horse and wagon and take that off and dump it somewhere because our toilets were outdoors.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a lot of things horses were still used for, but he had a car, and he would go away on his trips in his car. And now did he specialize in a particular kind of herbal cure. Did he--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: --concentrate on a certain disease?
Speaker 2: Low-bush myrtle.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Low-bush myrtle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Low-bush, M-Y-R-T-L-E, myrtle, like, like high-bush myrtle is very common. You know, like a myrtle tree, a myrtle tree, you know, that grow flowers, see that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, myrtle, yeah, low-bush myrtle.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was a special kind. It doesn't grow big. And they had to go out there in the fields and they would pick it up and dad and granddad never let anyone knew what it was because they would throw the top of it--they would take the root and take the top of it and throw it in the river. See that? So low-bush myrtle, I don't think--it grows in Texas. So we're gonna try to grow it and see if we can grow it here. There's a young man and I, and he has said to me that he wants to, to study that extract.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what was low-bush myrtle used for?
Speaker 2: Low-myrtle, it was used for high blood pressure and for diabetes and for, if you had a cold of flu or anything like that type, dad had a procedure where he would sweat you. See, he would sweat you. You take it--it was a good sweating tonic. You know, you would sweat, and he would have you to cover up with about two or three quilts, and you would sweat about 10 hours, you know, overnight. Then the next morning, you would get up and you take a bath. And he believed that those ailments could be sweated out of your body.

Speaker 1: When you were in grade school at Magnolia [Grammar School], did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Play with?
Speaker 1: No, did you have a favorite teacher at Magnolia School?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had two or three favorite ones. Mrs. Gilmore who lived on Magnolia Street and I remember her. She needed to wear glasses, and she didn't have any. So she would stop by this store, the Morse's store and borrow a pair of glasses from the Morse's, M-O-R-R-S-E. The Morse's were, they basically, they were half Caucasian, you know. But they had many things. So then she would drop by there to borrow the glasses and come on down to the classroom. And then she would, she would teach. And then once she'd go back home, she would leave the glasses with the Morse's, leave it there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, here, but that type of leadership. But one thing, they were all well trained in music. They were well trained in that, and they were well trained in history, well trained in arithmetic and math. But there was no science, not even in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so no science as such.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you said--now, she was one of your favorites, Mrs. Gilmore. What about the rest? Are there any more?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Are there any more teachers who were your favorites besides Ms. Gilmore?
Speaker 2: I, yeah, Mrs. Gilmore, and I'm sorry, I cannot remember the other one's name, but she--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --taught the upper grades, you know, that school went up to the sixth grade. But she taught the sixth grade, and I know she lived on West Street, but she was a very good teacher.
Story_ID: 25460
Speaker 1: So your brother Kenneth and you and James were all in Magnolia [Grammar School] together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we all went to that school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you said, you were saying that your brother, Kenneth, was sort of following in the footsteps of your father [Kince Davis]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: How much older was he than you?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How much older was Kenneth than you?
Speaker 2: He was two years old.
Speaker 1: Two years older than you, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, mother [Laura Cooper], our mother had kids every two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. See, he was, he was in the--he was always one grade above me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you do in school? Did you make good grades?
Speaker 2: Pretty good. They, the teacher would always, you know, would be impressed with what we could do because we more or less, my sister was teaching us at home, a lots of things, you know. And so, because she was in high school, and then Ossie was there too, and she would kind of teach us to read and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So they were kind of impressed. And then also, they kind of knew dad and mother, you know, in general, it was--on that side of town knew the next, the other family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25461
Speaker 1: So you went on to Dasher High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, went on to Dasher.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Dasher was a four-year high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was there a middle school. If Magnolia stopped at grade six--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --where did you, did you go (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You went from the sixth the seventh. Seventh, eighth, ninth and it went to eleven for--wait a minute. Seventh, let me see, it was four years, okay. So it went to the eleventh. So grammar school probably ended up, let me see, grammar ended up in the sixth. Seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth. So basically, the high school was 11 grades, not 12, not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't go to 12th grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it started at eighth grade and then eighth, ninth, and tenth, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but eighth grade, it started--
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: --and there were no sciences taught, but there were about every other thing, literature. We all, well, a very, very distinguished literature. And that's where I, you know, got my, that Conan name from.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, Conan, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Conan name, yeah, A. Conan Doyle--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Author Conan Doyle (unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she taught Shakespeare and--
Speaker 1: Oh, well, tell me this before we get into the curriculum, I just wanna know now, did the, okay, this is a, Dasher is a black school, right, Colored school, a segregated school?
Speaker 2: Completely black, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright, and it only went to the eleventh grade, right?
Speaker 2: Only went to the 11th grade.
Speaker 1: So did the white schools go to 12th grade?
Speaker 2: I think the white schools went to the 12th grade.
Speaker 1: And why do you think the black schools only went to the 11th grade?
Speaker 2: Because of the fact is that, well, the principal was James Lomax, and he was also the pastor of the church, one of the biggest churches there. And he said there wouldn't have been a school at all, that he had to help build that school. That's what he say. So I think that they just built our school as a favor for us at that time, you know what I mean? But it didn't, it didn't--it just went to the 11th grade.
Speaker 1: The county, you know, it was a county school though, right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: It was a county school, right?
Speaker 2: The county?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 2: No, it was a city school.
Speaker 1: A city school, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it was run by the City of Valdosta?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Valdosta.
Speaker 1: Okay, Valdosta.
Speaker 2: Valdosta's in Lowndes County.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, but they didn't--but I just wonder about that when I hear that, that the white schools go to 12th grade, but the black ones only go to 11th. It would seem like that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure--
Speaker 1: --if you finish high school, you still wouldn't be able to catch up, would you, if you--
Speaker 2: Right, right, you wouldn't--as a matter of fact, you--there wasn't any science taught, you know, or anything like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Plus, you're--
Speaker 2: So you could teach--they would teach you civics, English, reading and math and that was about it.
Story_ID: 25462
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you had a great experience in high school. I understand your--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, your father [Kince Davis] took you to Tuskegee [Institute], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that trip. This is about 1941, you're 15--
Speaker 2: Yeah, about 19--
Speaker 1: --years old?
Speaker 2: No, it was in the '30's [1930s]. We were younger.
Speaker 1: It was in the '30's [1930s], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were younger. In other words, we were, we were--you see at that time, the rubber tire would catch on fire on hot days. See, if you, if you were driving a car at a very fast rate of speed, it would catch on fire, okay. And so Henry Ford came down and--to discuss it with Dr. Carver [George Washington Carver]. He was very impressed with Dr. Carver, okay, and so he came down. And during that time, Carver, in order to influence, you know, blacks, you know, to do some studying of science, then he would invite, you know, some grammar school kids to come. So we were in the grammar school. We were in grammar school, all three of us. I think Kenneth was in the, probably (unclear), he was in seventh, the first year of high school or something like that, and me and James were in grammar school.
Speaker 1: So about how old--you were about, what, 11 or 12?
Speaker 2: About 11 or 12, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: And so we would go there and kids and--and there were some other kids there, so I know that he has, he would invite, (unclear) he invited all the people who he knew to just bring their kids, you know what I mean. And why we were so impressed with it, is that, you see, riding in a car was so much better than riding in a horse and wagon because and all the wagons had those wheels on it that every bump in the road, you could feel it. So we drove over, and so dad say, I'm gonna take her on over there.
Speaker 1: Well, how many were in the car? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were four of us--
Speaker 1: Four, okay.
Speaker 2: Dad and Kenneth, me and James.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now how long a ride was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a overnight, overnight, yes. We pulled alongside the road, and we slept. And so then we kept going. Roads then was not built very well, you know, and the roads were kind of rough, but here, again, riding on rubber tires at that particular time, but dad was the type of person that he would, when things come out like that, like a car for almost as long as I can remember, he had a automobile, automobile. Now, when I was very small, he probably, he would ride on the train. But when the automobile first come out, he, he was very much anxious in getting it, something like that. So we went over and dad, dad wanted to impress us with science, you know, and for us to see what was happening. And just to know that this man had made it possible for us to ride in a car was very influential upon me, you know what I mean? And James and Kenneth, and we would-we and the other kids who were there--and it wasn't many, he would invite probably some other, two or three other families or something like that. Or he might would invite a school class or something like that, and, but everyone, kids in there, you would play on the outside, but when you walked in there where they were talking--and they wouldn't be talking or lecturing. They'd be talking to themselves and they were both quiet people, but we, kids, we were hear just about everything that they say. We were quiet because all of us were very much impressed with just the automobile--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --just the automobile.
Speaker 1: So talking about meeting Henry Ford and--
Speaker 2: And Carver [George Washington Carver].
Speaker 1: And Carver, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So when you came, they would actually be sitting there talking, and you would be listening to them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They would be talking, and then we would, had a chance to see the laboratory and all such things like this and we would then ask dad, you know, why wasn't there any, you know, science being taught or something like this. He would try to explain it to us because he was doing his herbs, see that? He was doing his herbs, and he would put us in there, okay, you will weight this much and put it in there and we, we knew the concept of solutions, okay, and this type of thing like this. And so, especially, Kenneth was impressed, you know, and James was impressed and I was just over impressed with the car, to the point that I say, "Why put that gasoline in there? Imma put some water in there." (Laughter) And my dad almost (laughter), he became very much upset over that.
Speaker 1: So did--
Speaker 2: --because we were driving, now, not to Tuskegee, but he was driving going across town and the car started spitting, you know, that was that water. He said, what on earth happened? So I said, well, the gas tank, there wasn't much gas in there, so I just added some water. He said, what?
Speaker 1: So did the car survive?
Speaker 2: Yes, the car stopped, and we had to walk home.
Speaker 1: Was he able to fix the car?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it didn't ruin--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was just the, yeah, someone drained it and put the other stuff in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's good.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that's good.
Story_ID: 25463
Speaker 1: So, you had a chance to meet Dr. Carver [George Washington Carver], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes. We met him, we met him. You know, he wasn't a very outgoing person. For instance, he was kind of like--he'd be doing research in the laboratory by himself. He wasn't a person who would be off speaking or talking or something like this. And so, so he had, he would talk to people who had the same interests that he had, you see what I mean? The same interests. So since dad [Kince Davis] was into herbs, then they had the same interests, see.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And he was into foods. So dad was--make it a point to just, to get to know him, see. And he wasn't, like, for instance, he made many different things for everybody. He made many things. But, but no one knows it because he said, this belongs to mankind. He didn't get a patent on anything. He led us to believe that, you know, be of service and, you know, this type of things like this. So he didn't run the patent office every time that he did something (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In other words, my dad, when my dad was patenting his herbs, he had to get on the bus, year-to-year, he took a bus from Dallas [Texas] to Washington, D.C. He went up there by himself. So, so we, it was just, just push, you know, a push to be able to do things, to do things to better your life, you know what I mean? He wasn't a guy who was talking about, say, well, we can more money like this or we can do this for money or things like this. But he, but what they were concerned with, saying, you know, a lots of the buildings at Tuskegee [Institute] were built by black people, see. He wants you to know how to use those bricks, and that's stuff and put that stuff together and make that building.
Story_ID: 25464
Speaker 1: We were talking about being at Tuskegee [Institute], and you were, off camera, talking about the importance of the car and you were saying you think your father [Kince Davis] got his cars from Mr. [Alex] Sessoms, right? He made it possible for your father to get his cars?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would have, have to have been, you know, because I think that we were the only black--except the Morse's. Now, the Morse's and Lomax's were very fair. And I'm quite sure they had a relationship with Caucasians, okay. But I know that we always had a car. We always had a car.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. And, okay, at Tuskegee, do you remember hearing what Henry Ford had to say?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, he was talking about what they were planning, they were going to work on and what he--he asked Carver [George Washington Carver] how possibly could you get rubber to not burn on a hot day. And he and Carver was talking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, you know, they were talking about, you know, that people are getting tired--like on a Sunday evening, you may see a group of people out there with their coats or something like this, who will be coming from church and the tire caught on fire because right in that particular area, it's kind of warm, it's kind of warm, okay. And the tire would catch on fire and people would be with their Sunday coats, putting the tire out. And then also, your first cars, they didn't have--as I remember, they didn't have a starter. Dad had to take a long wrench and put it in the front and turn it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, and that type thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they was talking about how, what he was, what he was predicting that is going to occur, you know, that one day we will have different things on a car and that the more they learned about electricity--at that time, see, basically, I think it was, during that time, the light bulb was just coming into being by [Thomas] Edison.
Speaker 1: Well, it was much earlier, but it was becoming popular in the--a lot of, when you were growing up, a lot of people still had gaslights, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or kerosene lamps.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, we had the kerosene lamp. We had kerosene lamps for a long time, and I, the water outside and the toilet was outside. Now, this was, we were just for a (unclear) minute with that. It was nothing for us to be on the road and we had to stop and take out a sheet and sleep on the grass, you know what I mean? That was nothing, see, but we didn't--
Speaker 1: So, now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --we didn't complain about that at all.
Speaker 1: Now, we were discussing off camera that the trip from Valdosta to Tuskegee was like three days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, nah, (ph.) it was just about, about two days.
Speaker 1: Two days, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about two days. It was a good--because you had to go through, now, I can recall, we had to go through Moultrie [Georgia], Albany [Georgia] and then Dawson [Georgia] and the Cufput (ph.) (unclear) before you get to Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See and those were, those were long ways, and, you know, a car then getting 55 to 60, you know, you just wouldn't try it out. You know, you wouldn't be in a rush, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your top speed most of the time in the car?
Speaker 2: Top speed, about 40, 40 miles and that engine would be sounding off. And I recall though, my first experience with a car was that I was out with my granddad, and we were (unclear) prying, okay, we were prying out because during the summer, sometimes we would leave Waycross--you know, and go to, because Ossie was born in Cogdell. Then dad moved to (unclear) Zaiko (ph.) [Georgia], and then he moved to Waycross, okay. So basically, so basically, he, what he would do is that, at that time, the railroad had those little, those cars that you could pump and move, you know. If the, if there wasn't a big train coming, the people get on--I forget what you call those cars, you know, the (unclear), you pump it up--
Speaker 1: Hand cars.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Hand cars, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right. That's, those type of cars. You could go to Homerville [Georgia], to Cogdell [Georgia], like that every day.
Speaker 1: It takes two guys to get on there and pump--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --in those days?
Speaker 2: --one got on one side and one (unclear) over to the right. He pumps it down and pumps it down, and that thing would go on the track, go on the track at that time. So basically, getting around was a marvel to us, see. Like the radio was a marvel and like the light bulb was a marvel, see. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Like these were things that, you know, no one was very used to them.
Story_ID: 25465
Speaker 1: Did you have science at Dasher High School?
Speaker 2: I remember, there was a Mr. Downs, and he would introduce you to what was science. But we didn't have any laboratory experience, you know. He would, I think it was a course, "Introduction to Physical Science" or something like that, you know. And he would just talk about the difference between science and religion or something like that.
Speaker 1: Really, okay, so he would talk about the difference between science and religion?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright. So what did he say about it? What did he say the difference was?
Speaker 2: And the tragedy of it is that I, you know, he died and he was saying that he could show us where that the bible wasn't, wasn't anything, that really, that science and was the proper thing for us to be looking forward to. See, we were then very centrally thinking about the bible, you know what I mean? Like, you know, we had big fine churches and stuff like this and we were just the dead end on, on that. So he's the first instructor, who was black, and he was saying that he could prove to us that the bible just wasn't, wasn't worthy, that he could prove everything in there to be wrong or something like that, okay. And I remember going back to, we had to go to Sunday school. And, and I told dad [Kince Davis] that, what Professor Downs had told us. And he says--and I'll never forget this, you know. You see at that time, a grown up would not talk about another grown up to you as a kid. You understand what I'm saying? See, in front of a kid, two grown-ups talking about another grown up would probably excuse you as a kid, and they'll go into another room and talk about another grown up. So my dad would not talk to me about another, about a teacher, see what I mean? So he didn't say that we were on one side of the hill and that he's on the other side of the hill and basically, that, you know what I mean, that one day we both would be up there where he is and he knows the importance of the bible and what God is, see, because he's on the other side of the hill, and we were still climbing the hill like that, see. And we were blinded by the peak, and he says--and at that time, there were no, when he would tell you something, there was no second, you know, no second discussion. He say, son, you will be in Sunday school Sunday, is that right? I said, yes, sir, see. That was it. So then, so I remember that, but I don't think it was, it wasn't a proper chemistry or science course, no. It was just the introduction to science or something of that type.
Speaker 1: So did he give you the scientific method? Did he discuss the scientific method with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he talked about scientific methods and how that was better than you having faith and stuff like this and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he more or less was contrasting the two.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, did you do any experiments--well, you didn't do any, you didn't have a lab there, but--
Speaker 2: No, no laboratory.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) We didn't know what that was, a laboratory. As a matter of fact, and it seemed like to me that this, that this course was just a, like you had a choice to take it or you didn't have to take it because some time Reverend Lomax would give it, you know. And he would say that a bond between two atoms is like a man walking up to another man and grabbing him or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it wasn't very informative and so that's why I spent the last part of my high school in New York City.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Dwight High School.
Story_ID: 25466
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were able to finish at Dasher [High School], but you still needed another year to be able to go to college, right? You needed to be able to graduate--in order to graduate, you had to go to New York City, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no. I graduated from Dasher.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I marched with the class, and, but I knew I wanted to--because of that trip and my dad [Kince Davis], I wanted to know more about science. And I kind of like, we all--James and me and Kenneth wanted to know more about science, you know, more.
Speaker 1: So Kenneth graduated ahead of you, right--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --from Dasher?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, did he go to New York City too?
Speaker 2: No, he went directly into a black school. He went into, not Spelman [College], but the other one.
Speaker 1: Atlanta U [Atlanta University]?
Speaker 2: I think it was Morehouse [College].
Speaker 1: Morehouse, okay.
Speaker 2: And then he spent one year there. Then he went to Xavier [University] to become a pharmacist, pharmacist. So he went to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Xavier is famous for--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished Xavier, yeah.
Speaker 1: Xavier is famous for pharmacy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so what happened is I went up to New York City, and they taught us a chemistry course. We had a chemistry book.
Speaker 1: Now, just to get it straight. Now, Ossie was in New York City, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you stayed with him, you stayed with him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was--was he involved in theater in New York at that point? Was he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ossie?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had started with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was always, he was always interested in--like for instance, in Valdosta [Georgia], we had to set separate in the theater from the white people. And for some reason, the--the reason the, the only reason why Ossie was out late that night and daddy [Kince Davis], you know, acted against him, is that he, somehow the white people wanted him to do something in that theater. I don't know what it was. Now, I'm too small, but I know that he was out doing some recitation or he doing a play. What is that play that had to do with Louis Pasteur or something like that, "Green Pasture" or something?
Speaker 1: Oh, "Green Pastures"--
Speaker 2: Yeah, "Green Pastures", you know, "Green Pastures". So I know that he was doing it. I don't know whether he was doing it with somebody or he was doing it by himself, but I know that he was, he was doing it in the theater where they would show a movie or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in Valdosta?
Speaker 2: Valdosta, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they kept him down there too long, and then he came home. But he was always--in other words, he was always interested in that type of a life that he had because what happened, what it was, mother [Laura Cooper] would send him to the store. We didn't know anything about a newspaper or we never got one. I don't know how it was. But Ossie would go to the store and some people have thrown out a newspaper or something like this, "Valdosta Times" or something like this. And he would stand there and read it, and mother had to go up there and get him, and say, I told you to get some rice. Did you get it? And he, and he's up there reading the newspaper, see. And so he was always, he was always like that. You know, he was very much a part of it. And--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --you know, acting and being out of it, you know, like that.
Speaker 1: So did you stay with him in Harlem [New York]? Was he living in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was Ossie living in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes. He was staying in the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: In the Bronx, okay.
Speaker 2: In the Bronx, yeah. He lived on Third Street in the Bronx, Third Street in the Bronx. So I stayed with him for a short period of time, and then I stayed with a friend, a friend of mine's mother [Laura Cooper] in Jamaica, Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Long Island?
Speaker 2: Jamaica, New York.
Speaker 1: Queens, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Queens.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were educators, and so from them, they kind of taught me.
Story_ID: 25467
Speaker 1: You went to Dwight High School in New York, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dwight.
Speaker 1: And you got your--that's where you graduated--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's right, it's right behind the Grand Central Station. It was a private high school where you had to pay to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, well, how did--was it hard or was it easy or did--
Speaker 2: No, it was very easy because of, the fact of it is, is that when I went up there, I was introduced to a Jewish man who gave me a job. The name is Jake Fishman, his name was Jake Fishman.
Speaker 1: Now, is this someone that your father knew or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ossie knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you worked for Mr. Fishman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, while I was going to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and well, was this--did you have any science at Dwight High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we had--I took all science courses because they, it wasn't important that I would graduate from there. You know, what I wanted to do, I wanted to become attuned to science. I already had a degree from high school, but the school did not know, that did not include science, you see what I mean. But I wanted to do it for myself, see. And my dad [Kince Davis] wanted us to do it for ourselves, you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he didn't care nothing about, you know, about when we had it, but he said, now, look, you didn't get that here. Now, you're gonna go up there and you're gonna get science and find out what it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went up there, and I took physics, and I took chemistry, okay, and I took biology and those three courses, I took 'em. And then the man where I was working, his bar was right on the same street. His bar was on Fourth Avenue. See, Fourth Avenue runs right into, behind Grand Central Station. So at Fourth Avenue, Jake owned Lawry Bar and Grill, and I believe it's still there, bar--let me see. No, that was a long time ago, but it's not too far from the Grand Central Station.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so then I got, you know, used to going to school--
Speaker 1: Now, I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --with white kids.
Speaker 1: Now, this is your first time going to school with white kids, right?
Speaker 2: Right. See, because before that, the only, the only--we had, see, dad had us, how we were, we had very little contact with white people, see. As a matter of fact, I was thinking in terms of the fact that they wasn't human or something of that type. We had very little, very little contact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very little contact, but, you know, that's just the way that it was. And, but up there, we had contact, and I was able to work with them and work, you know, to work out problems and stuff like this, and--
Speaker 1: Now, what's the highest mathematics that you had at Dasher?
Speaker 2: At Dasher?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Was, I think it was Advanced, Advanced Algebra.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, wait, let me see, because Calculus came about in college, yes. Calculus, it was Advanced Algebra.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you were prepared for the science courses in terms of the mathematics when you got to Dwight?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, and then too, now, I learned about, you know, a lot about Calculus and differential equations. And, let me see, Trigonometry--did they teach Trigonometry at Dasher High? I think they did teach, that they would go up to Trigonometry, I think, Trigonometry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but, now, no Calculus or no--nothing like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25468
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers or mentors at Dwight High School?
Speaker 2: There were special teachers, Mr.--a mentor was Jake, Jake Fishman. He was a Jewish owner of that bar. And he knew that I was there attempting to get science, and he would make sure that I would study it and sometimes he would show me some answers or work out some answers for me. He also like a brother, you know, so he really worked with me, and since it was a bar and grill, we would be down in the downstairs there, and he'd say, now, your primary thing was, I think dad [Kince Davis] and Ossie had told him, the primary thing was me getting science, the primary thing for me getting science. And he was just working, working with just--he had another man to do the basic cleaning up, you understand what I mean? Like preparing things, but, so then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he say, I want you to sit on these jugs, jugs or those bottles of beer and bottles of wine and do your work first, and then I'm gonna have you to do some little small things around the upstairs. So I stayed down in the basement a lot, you know, working on my science.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's a good, that's a good arrangement. So--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, he was nice. He, you know, and then he took me to his home. And I knew his, see, I knew his family and all such things like this. And he knew the Army, and he knew all this type stuff like this. So he kind of like had me to know, you know, exactly what it was, see. And so I, and so, man, I had a wonderful time. So--
Speaker 1: So this is all during World War II?
Speaker 2: And then also, I was learning about philosophy. See, I was learning about phil--you know, I didn't know--I had taken a course, I think "Introductory Philosophy" at Dasher, I think. And, but, you know, I didn't see the relation of that. You had to relate it to me to--because religion was a very important concept. Religion was a very important concept to me, religion, okay. So, so what--I remember thinking, what's the relationship between science, philosophy and religion. And they, they really, you know, just talking with them, they really brought it forth to me, you know, about the difference between them. See, I was kind of like a little kid. I kind of like, I liked really to study that stuff because my uncle in Tampa, Florida, you know, was interested in me become a preacher, okay, becoming a preacher. And he was dad's brother, okay. So I was really interested in knowing, you know, because this man had talked down science so badly, see what I mean?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, and so basically, what happened was, is that he, they just used a simple example up there having a chance at Dwight High School to know (unclear) about, see. You know, they say when you, you do something, and you can take water or you can take two things and put 'em together, and they will catch on fire or do something like this, this is science. Why they catch on fire is philosophy. If that's good for you, it's religion, see that? Is it good for me or is it harmful? That religion, why it actually happened, and science had to do with, that this is the, what happened when I did it, see. And it really kind of like--because I was--at that time, let me tell this. I was kind of perplexed. I really was kind of perplexed because, you know, you're a kid, and you think that man has a greater, that is, religion and that type thing, was a great part of my life, see what I mean? And every kid at that point, well, every kid was at that point, was a great part, part of their lives, you know what I mean?
Story_ID: 25469
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about City College of New York, you going there--this is 1945, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about 1945, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was going to, see I already had my high school diploma, okay. And so I was going to Dwight [High School] and I went to City College. See, I already had my diploma. I didn't have to graduate from Dwight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Dwight, you see.
Speaker 1: Alright, so you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I went there just for science.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so at City College, were there any special teachers at City College that really impressed you?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, there were a Mr., a Dr. Laura--Dr. Roland Lackland (ph.), I think his name was, and he taught a very good course in--you know, it's been so long ago, I'm sorry. You know, I--a good course in, I think it was either science or, yeah, it was Calculus.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Calculus, okay. So is this your first course in Calculus?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Is this your first Calculus course?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Anyone else at City College?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Anyone else at City College that, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a, the president at that time was Dr. Gallagher.
Speaker 1: Gallagher, okay.
Speaker 2: A Dr. Buell (unclear), let me see, Dr. Gallagher. And he had been president of Talladega [College], which is a historically black institution in Alabama, not too far from Tuskegee, okay. And so basically, that was a good combination for me because one day I was walking down the hall and for some reason there was a lots of students there, but he was standing there, and he called me out and asked me to come over there and, you know, that he wanted to talk with me, you know. And he asked how was I doing in math. And I said, well, it's really tough and (unclear) boys down there, and so he said, you know what you might think about [speaking to someone else - um-hum, okay], you might think about going to Talladega.
Speaker 1: So, okay, well, go ahead--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, keep going.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, yeah--which is a course, which is a historically black college, and they would be "pro you", see what I mean, because in general, you know, it was kind of thought that we would not be very capable in math and in science. And the teacher was a high school teacher, teaching part time at the City Colleges. So I kind of felt, and I was the one student that was in there, so it was kind of like, it was kind of like, you know, tough.
Speaker 1: So he wanted you to get more individual attention and he thought it'd be better for you to go to Talladega [College] to get it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it might be better. So then, so then, yeah, so then what we did, we stayed there. And that's my daughter over there--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so basically, you see, it had to do with, you know, Calculus. It had to do with taking, let's see Calculus and really taking some advanced courses in biology, some advanced courses in physics and that type of thing like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then you enrolled in Talladega and went back to, you went to Alabama to go to Talladega in--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this would be 1948, '47' [1947], '48' [1948]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about '48' [1948].
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948], okay.
Story_ID: 25470
Speaker 1: So Talladega in '48' [1948]. Now, who were some of the teachers there that you remember and was it, what was--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, many, many white instructors came to Talladega [College]. Talladega is a private institution, very small and, and some white instructors volunteered to come down there and teach to the historically black institution. So there was a Dr. [Eric] Nussbaum. There was also a Dr. Roberts, and all of those different instructors there, what they would do at--Talladega was more or less like a family unit, you know, a family college. You know, you, you were on campus, okay, and it was just a very good, a very good experience for me, a very good experience for me. Okay?
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so you were there like, how many--now, you got, you were drafted, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For Korean War?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Korea.
Speaker 1: Had you--
Speaker 2: Was just, it was just getting ready to get started. No, no, at that time, it was started very well.
Speaker 1: Oh, the war, you mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the war was started very well.
Speaker 1: How long had you been in school when--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How long had you been in school before you got drafted?
Speaker 2: Oh, about, here about, let me see. So this would have to be in '47' [1947] then probably, because for possibly, possibly a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you drafted in '48' [1948]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Alright, now, had you been taking ROTC or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were? Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, that's right. ROTC from--see, they had a conjoined effort, you know, a conjoined effort between Tuskegee, Talladega and (unclear) Bethune, New Jersey and all such things like this because at that time, peoples of color, you know, wasn't exactly--they didn't know exactly what to do with them, you know what I mean? So I kind of knew ever since I left high school that, when I was New York, I kind of knew that I was set to be drafted. So my mother [Laura Cooper] kind of like called me and told me, and I know that one way that you could actually stay out for a while was that way. So in the meantime, I was working on that, trying to stay out and getting a good, firm ground up in sciences, you see what I mean? And so this is where we really, here was kind of confusing because my sister at that time, Essie, was Director of the V.A. in Tuskegee, okay. And General Davis' son lived right down the street from her, okay. So we worked out a system where we could do that between the schools, you know what I mean, because, you know, it wasn't something that, that we were used to. They were just getting to know that during World War II, we had that Air Force down at Tuskegee there. So I knew a lots about Tuskegee because I had been traveling there and my sister lived there, okay. And after my dad died in Valdosta [Georgia], the family moved to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your father [Kince Davis] pass while you were in New York? When did your father die?
Speaker 2: Yeah, while I was in New York, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he died around 1946 or so, '45' [1945], '46' [1946]?
Speaker 2: I think so, yes. I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so basically, it was a conjoined effort, you know what I mean? And so after that, after that, then, after my stay in the Army, what we did was that we then I decided to just go full time to Talladega.
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us anything about your--can you kind of summarize what happened in the Army?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Can you summarize what happened during the war, sort of us?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, it was--you know, it was, integration was taking place, and that is what, you know, more or less and we went to Korea and that type thing. And, you know, they were trying to find out whether or not black people would fight or something like this.
Speaker 1: Okay, just to say it was not a good experience?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a good experience, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you served as an officer, right, in--
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Okay, so, I know you received a Purple Heart for your service in Korea, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25471
Speaker 1: You met Albert, Dr. Albert Schweitzer in Germany?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no--
Speaker 1: Well, tell us--no?
Speaker 2: No, Ulm, Germany.
Speaker 1: Yes, in Germany, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ulm, Germany, yes. You know, that was his home, okay. That was his home. So I was over there, and so basically, when the other soldiers were doing many other things, I had an interest in music too. See, I was kind of like double, double school. You know, I was, I really loved music, and I loved science. And then I had an uncle who was pushing me to enter into Theology, and all such things like that because I was on the quiet side, you know. I wasn't a, I wasn't a person who would play football, nor did I enjoy looking at it, games or anything like this. Like one of my hardest courses were when we had to do things like that, you know, I mean I just wouldn't--it was just hard for me to participate in those type things. So I was really heavy into music and into science. And so basically, my little time over there that I spent just going, you know, traveling around because I knew about [Johannes] Brahms, and I knew about Schweitzer and all that stuff because my home--basically, people at Talladega [College] was very, were very much aware and, of great organists and great pianists and things like that, and great violinists, (unclear) and all those people like that. So out of extreme interests of seeing 'em, because being in Germany, that's what's gonna happen, see what I mean? This is what are gonna happen. So when other people are doing it. Also, it was kind of like a rough time because, see, we were one black unit within a big white unit. We were the 97th Bridge Battalion. And we were in, I think, with the 67th--if I'm not mistaken now. We were a bridge company. They were a 97th Battalion. It was big. And they kind of like when Truman [President Harry Truman] brought the law down that they were gonna integrate, right, they decided that they wasn't ready. So we had a internal conflict as well as an external one, see what I mean? Okay, and so this is what happened. And so basically, we all, we all were in that together there, and so I, Schweitzer and the other guy, and I went to also, I went--I saw Wagner Theater too, Wagner, the composer Wagner. His theater was up there. And I forget the name, but a town in Germany but I know where Schweitzer was, Ulm. And that was where he lived.
Story_ID: 25472
Speaker 1: And so, we, yeah. I had a chance to, you know, to go and to hear him play the organ.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we were being told that you drove to hear Albert Schweitzer play when you found out he was gonna be playing the organ at Ulm Munster [Germany], right?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay. And you had traveled all over the rest of Germany, trying to hear music--
Speaker 1: Yeah, to see where [Johannes] Brahms lived and Beethoven and that type thing. And just because--Germany is quite small. You know, it's--I don't know if it is as large as our Texas is, I don't think. But here again, when other people had their opportunities of doing other things outside of that, okay, that, that's what actually happened.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And so (unclear) happened. So then when there was integration, a lots of things happened because the 67th was supposed to absorb us, okay, absorb us, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That, you know--
Speaker 2: They were supposed to integrate you into the--
Speaker 1: It was a black company, yes, and here was a Battalion. They were supposed to absorb us. It wouldn't, so, okay, so we wind up, this little company, part of us in Korea, see. And so there is what, you know, yeah. So basically, the experience is that we had to prove and that's what my, my, actually, it has to do (unclear), that being of color, you had to rather prove that you would actually fight. You know what I mean. They thought that you wouldn't.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They thought you wouldn't, being--given that opportunity, okay. But, you know, to prove it, so it was kind of overdone, see. And so that's why I take these pills every day.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so then after, after that, then basically, we come back--because it was a horrible experience. We come back to South Carolina, and there it was when--that we had--basically, South Carolina was really into, you know, was really into, really into integration at that particular point.
Speaker 2: South Carolina was into integration at that point?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: South Carolina, you're saying was into integration?
Speaker 1: They were trying to.
Speaker 2: They were trying to, oh--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, see they were, the law was out, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the people, more or less, you know, it takes a lots of time for them to become accustomed to it, you know--
Speaker 2: You're referring to the military, right--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in South Carolina?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So going back say at Fort--
Speaker 1: No, not the state, (unclear) I'm talking. So what's that big post there?
Speaker 2: Fort Jackson?
Speaker 1: Fort Jackson.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: That's right, Fort Jackson, yeah, Fort Jackson. That was where that I was released at Fort Jackson, okay. And so that, basically, is what--so, but as a, just from my experience, I had grown up some, you know, and being and knowing that life was kind of like rough, see.
Story_ID: 25473
Speaker 1: And so from that experience, I come back to Talladega [College], and when I come to Talladega, then I think I was at Talladega for three years before I graduated. And my brother, James, were also at Talladega at the same time that I was. He had registered about a year earlier. He had registered in biology.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, he was there. And my brother-in-law, my sister's husband, okay, my sister's husband, she, he had gone to Talladega. So there was nothing for me to do except to go there. But they were interested in me resigning up.
Speaker 2: Oh, for the Army?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I went home, and, boy, I'm telling you. I decided for myself, you know, that, you know, this is alright for some people, but it just wasn't my (unclear), see what I mean? It wasn't something that I was good at or something that I probably would have gotten hurt or, I know I probably would have lost my life or something, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so, basically, what we want here is, is the situation was, in trying to get us to activate or to be active in doing this, you know. It was a little bit on the rough side.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, now, you were at Talladega [College] until--were you there until '56' [1956]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright, that's when you earned your Bachelors of Science in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right. Well, what were some of the highlights of your studies at Talladega?
Speaker 1: There are many, there are many. When I walked into the building, basically, you know, I had known about it for many years. I'd gone to visit and things like this, but I didn't know that they had professors there from all over the United States, okay. And so when I arrived there, is that basic--and my brother was going there at that time, and we had the opportunity then to be together. And we studied biology together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was an opportunity to be with my brother and, and also to be in the school where they were really trying to push you into science, rather than saying, you know, don't--why hurt yourself or why will you go into to something that's as difficult as science is, see.
Story_ID: 25474
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, so basically, when I went to Talladega [College] is that there was a sense that I was going to pursue and this was the only time when I made up in my mind that I was gonna go into science, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, just, I just wondered--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And it was due to the science teachers. It was due to the science teachers, the physics and biology and science and chemistry teachers.
Speaker 2: I know I asked you earlier about who some of those teachers were, but I didn't the full--so, tell us again who some of these teachers were at Talladega? Do you remember some of their names?
Speaker 1: One of them that stands out in my mind is Dr. [Eric] Nussbaum. And he was from the University of Pennsylvania, I think it was. And he was a Caucasian, and he was saying, is that, basically, that the world is going to have a great need for people who are in science. And in order for us to increase the number of people in science, is that we want to encourage all races to pursue areas of science, okay. And so he came down from Pennsylvania, and--to Talladega [College] to teach for about, oh, for about five or six years. And he, you know, taught for a low salary. There was three or four other professors there. And right off, I cannot remember their name, but they were white. And one of them taught biology and some aspects of chemistry and we also had some Afro American instructors who were very good. And they were teaching physics and chemistry and all these areas. So it kind of like enabled my hope that I could do that same type of a thing, see that? When you see someone like you are, and you see 'em doing it, then you kind of like enable (unclear). So it was, just kinda like, I kind of like searching in music. I was searching in geology because see, I used to, you know, play the, play the violin, play the organ, all those instruments and stuff like this. And I was kind of like, you know, not knowing exactly which route that you wanted to take, see what I mean? But they kind of like pinned it down for me, pinned it down for me, and said now, you've got to think about. And they had a course in a sign of maturity, you know, a sign of being grown-up. And this actually put a lots and built my confidence in terms of the fact, is that, if anyone could do it, then I could do it also, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so, you know, there's a difference. There's a difference. So, there were only about--the classes were never over 10 kids. So you had a chance to talk with the instructors, to interact with them, okay, and to really ask them, say, you know, I've got a good concept of what is Calculus, you know, what basically--why would you need that? Why, you know, here we are talking about a quantum universe and, and people, you know, well, you would ask the instructor to explain it to you, and they would explain. But here (unclear) terms that, you know, one just were not able to conceive, you see what I mean? But there, there's some very good instructors and there were very inspiring because I think all four kids that were in our class, that we pursued areas of science, okay. And there was, the classes were very small.
Story_ID: 25475
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were the recipient of the George Washington Carver Fellowship at Tuskegee [Institute], right, right after your graduation?
Speaker 2: Yes, and it was three of us. I think that all of us from Talladega [College], we received scholarships to go to different schools. And I received one as a Carver Foundation Fellow. And so I decided to take that one.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you go back to Tuskegee, this is the place you visited as a youth?
Speaker 2: Yes, and this is the place where my sister lived, okay, and at that time, she was over the Department of Social Service at the V.A. Hospital, okay. And so, you know what, and also I knew some of the people there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your sister was there at the V.A. Now, did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at a place (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --stay with your sister?
Speaker 2: --a place like going home, you know.
Speaker 1: So was your mother [Laura Cooper] there too at this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was there at that time because my dad [Kince Davis] had passed. And so she lived not too far, and, you know, Tuskegee Institute is almost larger than the town is, you know what I mean, because Tuskegee Institute involved the V.A. Hospital, one of the largest ones in the United States. And--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, tell us, now you earned your Masters degree from Tuskegee. What did you--and you focused in, on organic chemistry, right?
Speaker 2: Organic and physical chemistry, yeah, organic and the physical, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so--
Speaker 2: There were three, there were three black instructors and one white German, and Dr. Clarence T. Mason was my mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, tell us something about Dr. Mason?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Tell us about Dr. Mason?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Mason, he could, he was very fair--all of them were very fair. And basically, he was very good in organic chemistry synthesis, and he was very good in inspiring in terms of telling what we ought to do, you know what a mean, that you should be scientist and that once you finish here, if you go any other place and flunk, we're gonna put you down or something like that. You know, he would always kid like that. As a matter of fact, I was at his house, he was a very kind doctor. But when I first met him, they, they were not aware is that my sister was at the V.A. Hospital, and my brother was Ossie Davis. So, you know, they kind of like, you know, you know, they--so the president's wife was--my sister was the boss of the president of Tuskegee's wife. She worked in the V.A. Hospital, the president's wife. So she saw Dr. Mason one day, and she told him, she say, you know, you have my boss' brother working for you. He said, who? She say, Davis. And so he came to me the next day, and he said, why didn't you tell me this. I say, would it have made that much difference, you know what I mean, to tell you those things like that. But (laughter), he say, why didn't you tell me you were (unclear). I said, un-un. So, I had a very good experience there. He made us do a lots of traveling to get familiar with the scientific world. And we were able to visit Redstone Arsenal and this type of thing like this. And, where they were just getting started on the space program, and he was doing some research and he had us do some research on the material that they were using to put the rocket up in space. So that was lots of fun. See, you felt as if that you were a part of the whole system then.
Story_ID: 25476
Speaker 1: Did you meet Dr. Wernher von Braun?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: He was the, (unclear) that I was very shocked, very shocked. I didn't think about it at that particular--you know, that wasn't on our mind. People were very much concerned about research grants, okay, research grants. There was little money. The government was kind of tight on it, okay. We had three instructors, and so one student, when we were up there visiting, asked him as he was telling us about what were their goals. And the student asked him, say, you know, we should be dealing with problems on earth and not thinking about the sky and the cosmos and this type thing like this. We have lots of problems down here. And so he says, with the increase in population, he can see that possibly man, okay, will one day have to occupy outer space, planets and other things like this. We're gonna have to occupy those places, moon, because the population of the earth is exponentially increasing. And all of us thought at that time that he was Coo-coo, you know, we said, oh, man, what you talking about? But, you know, that is true, that is true. The population is exponentially increasing. And this is what's causing so much of the trouble, so much trouble, the pollution and other things that happening now. And the earth can only hold "x" amount of people, you know. So that was very inspiring to us because we kind of knew. But we thought that that statement was a little bit, you know, in outer space (laughter). Yeah, we thought that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, man, man would not be living on Mars in that place like that.
Speaker 1: So do you think--did most of your friends feel that that was kind of far out, as too--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, most of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of them. Everybody, when he said that required, and I heard some people whispering, say, he's "coo-coo", up here.
Story_ID: 25477
Speaker 1: So, now, what kind of research were you engaged in at Tuskegee [Institute]?
Speaker 2: Research, yes. What we were doing is studying the hydrolysis of McCaptain's, that's sulfur-containing compounds as these compounds were being considered for use, you know. And so we were studying the hydrolysis rate of some sulfur-containing compounds. And so we were more or less studying the fuel that the, that they would be using to put man up in space, you know what I mean? That this rocket would have to use to take man up into space, okay. So that's why we had really taken the trip up there because we were a part, really, of that program, of studying the fuel, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So fuel--okay. So now, when you finished at Tuskegee--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we finished Tuskegee, and at that time, Tuskegee had on its board, you know, the foundation, had on its board people from other schools, white board of trustees, blacks and they would kind of like guide us in terms of what we should do. And there were three of us. And it was necessary that we continue our study. So we all were offered various, you know, scholarships to go to different schools, but the scholarships more or less had to do with going and getting a degree in education with a concentration in science, see. But to get a degree where you can teach, but not get a degree--like, for instance, they would say, go up and get a degree in education with a concentration in chemistry and come back down and teach your people, you know what I mean, to--in those areas. Well, two of us were not interested in that. We wanted to become chemists. And surprisingly, schools would not accept that, no, not even Carver [George Washington Carver] never got his PhD. And my instructors there at the foundation, they had to get their PhD in chemistry to do research, in foreign countries like Canada or Austria, Germany. One of my instructors was from Austria or Germany. Dr. Mason, he finished his in Canada. As a, matter of fact, I was looking at British, B.C. up in Canada.
Speaker 1: British, Columbia, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, because, you know, you just couldn't get some (unclear). As you know, that Carver, he didn't have one and Dr. Mason, he had to get his overseas. And the other doctor there, Dr. Brown who was over the department, he had to go to Austria to get his, and you just couldn't get those in the United States. So that was why that we had to go way out to Idaho because when we applied there, and we explained to them just what we wanted to do, then the, Dr. Laturner (ph.) read it, and he was able to get back to us and tell us that if we come out and we are successful, then it's gonna be alright, okay, that any company that comes on, you know, that comes on campus, that they would have to interview you also.
Story_ID: 25478
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's the reason why we went to, took a trip from Alabama way up to Idaho.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And people ask me that, say, why do you, why you leave--there were so many schools. Well, then you see, a lots of these Southern schools, now, in Texas and in Mississippi and Alabama, and where my daughter got her degree from, they didn't even exist in our experience. We would pass by those and not even knowing, you know--
Speaker 1: They didn't accept black students, so--
Speaker 2: That's right. They wasn't even in our experience. So we didn't even look for them. And matter of fact, the street, the school Valdosta State University was on Oak Street where I lived. And, really, we would pass right by it sometimes and we would never even look over there. I didn't even know if they had a park or what buildings there were, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that there were there at that time. So, this is what we wanted to do. See, I wanted to become, because of my experience at Talladega [College] and at Tuskegee [University], I wanted to become a chemist, okay. If I--with the choice to teach if I want to, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But a teacher will not be first thing that I want to do.
Speaker 1: And you wanted to engage in research?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 25479
Speaker 1: How did you get out to Idaho? Did you drive or did you take the train?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we drove.
Speaker 1: You drove?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were so happy. We were so happy because we had been turned down. And my wife and I, we got in an old Studebaker, and we drove from Alabama and I think put enough gas in the car to get through Mississippi. I didn't even wanna stop there. And we stopped to get some gas, I think in Louisiana. Then we drove right through Texas and in, right above Dallas [Texas], we pulled over to get some gas. And I got some gas. I asked the man there, I say, is there a place around here where a person of color could sleep? He said, yes, pull your car right upside that train track over there. And man we got in the car, my wife and I, Ms. Ocia Davis, and we got in the car, and we drove, and I drove that car all night long till we got out of the State of Texas. And we drove on up to Springvale, Colorado the next night. See, we drove all night that night. The next night we were in Springvale, Colorado. And I drove up in a motel and asked whether or not did they, you know, accept people of color. And they say, oh, yes, you can sleep here, okay. So we paid, and we obtained a room, but I couldn't sleep because I thought that he might would have been recruiting the Ku Klux Klan or something like that (laughter), see. So I couldn't sleep, man (laughter). So, we did stay till the morning, but as I recall, we didn't eat because, you know, we were just getting used to the travel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we just went and dropped by and probably and got some coffee, where we got gas or some (unclear) and some donuts. And we drove right on up to Colorado.
Speaker 1: What you're describing for people who don't know anything about that time period is a very brave act, driving across the country with just you and your wife--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --in those days. That was like taking your life in your hands.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't--this is paranoia.
Speaker 2: That's the way we felt.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: See, we felt, as a matter of fact, we felt this way because, you see we got on the road in--we got on Highway 20. Okay, Highway 20, okay, we came to Montgomery. Then we turned down to Mobile [Alabama], and we got on Highway 20. And because Highway 20 is a really good one--no, not Mobile, but it was in a town that's above Mobile because Mobile, 10 is the highway to go all the way across there--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --to Florida and stuff like this. So we got on Highway 20 that would cover the Northern part of those Southern states. And because see, had we got on 10, we would have come through San Antonio, but we got on 20, and we came through Dallas, and went up like this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, so we, yeah, we were quite afraid. And I can assure that there wasn't any sleeping at all.
Story_ID: 25480
Speaker 1: Okay, on your way to Idaho.
Speaker 2: And I believe we were on Highway 50, and we went through Gunnison, where they ski, and it was very steep, you know, and we were not, you know, Georgia and those areas are kind of flat. So we went on up, and we went into Utah, Utah. And I was a little bit shocked, y'all, is that I, you know, there was a Dr. Asper--the Mormons had a very great choir, you know, choir and a, Dr. Asper was the organist, okay. So I stopped, and I asked in Utah, because I thought that the church was a place where that anyone could go in there, see what I mean? But I found out that day, that big, the big church that you see is not a place where everybody could go, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: This is Utah, right, this is in--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Was this a Mormon church or--
Speaker 2: Mormon, yes, Mormon. So I was kind of like, I was kind of like surprised. The guy told me, say, well, well, what I was going in to see because I'm always, I'm curious, I wanted to see--I had heard Dr. Asper play with the Mormon Choir, singing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Tabernacle Choir, Mormon Tabernacle--
Speaker 2: And I wanted to see, and to see the organ. And I thought it was this big ole Mormon Cathedral, and a guy told me, naw, that's what where that organ is. It's a little unit that was next to the church over there, and that's where everybody could go, Mormon or not. But only Mormons could go into a certain place. And I was, I was a little bit shocked at that, but here again is that, you know, you live forward. And you look back and you learn your lessons from it. So you don't, you don't, you know, criticize or--but this is just the way that it was at that time. And like Dr. Gallagher say, you know, it's that, you know, "Have your feet pointed straight towards the future and look back to learn from the past, but point your feet and go towards the future".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I like that.
Story_ID: 25481
Speaker 1: So we left from there and I think is that we then went from there to Boise, Idaho and then from Boise, Idaho, we took 95, I think it was 95 [Highway 95] straight up through Idaho. There's only one main road up through Idaho. You understand what I'm saying to you?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: There's a main, a main highway up through Idaho. Now, and I believe it's 95. I think it is now. And this goes over mountains and things like this. And, boy, it was--I was, from a flat country that I was from, boy, that was quite a drive. So I got to Lewiston, Idaho, and I asked a man, are there any more grades--you know, a grade is where, is that a car don't go up the hill, but it goes side of the hill like this, you know. And White Birds--I think the White Bird grade in Idaho. It's one of the most dangerous ones you have ever seen because you could drive about five or, about five or so miles and look down and see the town, you know, and you driving, going around like that. So I asked the guy, I say, are there any more of those grades. He says, there's one more between here and Moscow. And he say--I say, well, I was thinking about turning back. He say, well, if you turn back, you're gonna have to go over all of those grades that you've already gone over. So, why don't you just go over one more grade and you're in Ida--you're in Moscow (laughter). I said, okay, I'll do it. But, man, that's a grade out of Lewiston, Idaho, man, you do something (unclear) right there. See, Idaho is a prim--at that time, it was a primitive area, an area where people didn't live, okay. And many people who loved that type of area, lived in Idaho, see, like there was many places where you got to fly. You had to fly from Boise into that area. There wasn't a road. The main road through Idaho was 95 at that time, 95. And everything outside of that, people had farms and everything (unclear) it is, but if you--you didn't have the choice to get over the road and drive up over there and see 'em. See what I mean, or none of that. See, because it was, hey, you had primitive areas where people never know humans, or being. And so we took that grade, and we arrived in Pullman, Washington and go right on over because, see, there's (unclear), the Washington State University is just about eight miles from Moscow, Idaho.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: See, like (unclear), that is the state school, is on the East of Washington. And Moscow [Idaho] is just a little town below Pullman.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we got there, and we arrived there. And it wasn't at that time, many people of color.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were on your way to Washington State University first?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yes, and then, because see, that's the closest way in there, you see?
Speaker 2: Oh, so--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's very, not the closest way. That is, see, Washington State is a little up and Lewiston, you have to go through Moscow [Idaho] to go through Pullman [Washington]. And it's only about nine miles away, see what I mean?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: About nine miles away, and so that's where my two kids were born, in Moscow. And people lined up to see them. So it was a very--we kind of like, you know, we look back at it, and we kind of enjoyed it because we became familiar with the terrain, see what I mean? I left here driving through the country, rather than flying. You know, you could see, you know, something about how people are living, get a good feel of it, and climb the mountains and this type of thing like this and have a nice time. But here again, is that we were always concerned and afraid. And we were even afraid to look at the U-of Alabama. I ask myself, when I go to Valdosta [Georgia] now--when my mother [Laura Cooper] died, we had her, after the funeral, we met on the Valdosta State campus, and I asked a person who was there, I say, was this always here? He said, yeah, this was always here because the graveyards are right in front of the school. So, man, I'm telling you, see, but when you look back at it, that's the way that it was. You understand what I'm saying? And you don't look back at it and point your feet back and try to live into that, like a lots of people do.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: See.
Story_ID: 25482
Speaker 1: Well, what was your reception like at University of Idaho?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it. It was very good. I still hear from people from there now. They were interested to know, to know something about our history, okay and this type [of] thing like this. And basically, I don't believe that (unclear) there was anything, we become accustomed to them and they became accustomed to us. They were, they were understanding and a doctor wouldn't turn you down if you had to go to him or something like this. You know, all little things like that, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I don't think, y'all, I don't think that there were, in Valdosta [Georgia], how big that town is, I think that the hospital where the blacks could go was a little side, a little side place away from the big hospital, you know what I mean? Like my daughter, she was bought up among all races, you know. And she is kind of like, she's, she's kind of used to that. She was down in Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and they were showing her around when she was going to UAB [University of Alabama at Birmingham]. And so she noticed that there was a little house back of where there were--they were in the hospital. And they were showing her around a little hospital down there. So she noticed a house in back of the hospital. And so she asked the lady, say, what's a little house doing back there? She say, that's where people of color used to go if they were sick.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was common in--
Speaker 2: Valdosta, that was the same thing. Valdosta, you know, you didn't--as a matter of fact, I don't even if know if anybody asked me right now, take me to the hospital in Valdosta, I wouldn't even know where to go because I know that some people told me it was a little side of the big hospital. And all, all of this now was on Oak Street where I, as a little kid--we had a portion down there where we could play around the yard. But, you know, not even--that's not even in our experience.
Story_ID: 25483
Speaker 1: What kind of research were you doing at University of Washington--I mean Washington State University?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. The research at Washington State, a company had reported that the Western, the Western Larch tree that there was a glue coming out of it, and it was gluing up the soils. And they wanted us to, a way to get rid of that glue and to determine what the glue was so that they could use those trees for lumber. So they were extracting--so my first job was, we were extracting the sugar out of trees, and you called it Stractan (ph.), just because you were extracting, see that. We would just take the tree and the tree was all sawed up, and we would put it on the inside, inside of a chamber. And we would just extract the sugar from the tree.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And they later found out that there were many uses for that.
Speaker 1: For the sugar that, the sap--
Speaker 2: For the sugar, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --that came out of the tree.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the pharmacy, see, Washington State [University] had a School of Pharmacy. See, it was a big, a big--industrial research was a big research complex where companies from New Jersey have them doing things. See, companies outside of the school system, okay, would hire them to do certain jobs. And so this was a way that a student could earn money during the summer or it's a way, if a student interested in getting to know about what is industrial research because they had every aspect of research there. They had radioactivity was being studied there. They had, they studied many of the compounds that cause allergies and things like that. So it was just a pleasure and it was an honor for me just to be employed there as a black, see. And so I went in there and Dr. Mark Adams, Dr. Mark Adams, and he really made this place at home. Well, one reason was this. You see, the students in the two schools were not very much interested into getting into research. So not even knowing Mark Adams or no one, they send a representative around to classes and asked, say well, what--who in here would be interested in doing some work at the Division of Industrial Research, you know what I mean, and because a company there is trying to solve a certain problem. So the only person that really held up their hand was me because I, it was, it was a pleasure and honor, you know. So, right. So they have found now that you may use that for many different things, see.
Story_ID: 25484
Speaker 1: But see always now remember this, you know, that in research, a chemist, okay--and this is very important, and I've seen a lots of more publications of this now. See, when you find something or you discover something that is out of a mistake or its serendipity and some people will call it an unintended adventure, a unintended adventure. You don't know what gonna happen. See that? You may put two things together and it'll blow your head off, see what I mean? And therefore, the people say that the chemistry laboratory is so dangerous, you see. It's not--and it's--many people think that great things are discovered by a guy saying, well, I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna discover or do this. No, he's doing something, and he find out that something else happens, see what I mean, okay. See, what we were doing is sloughing potatoes, you know, or something like that. So there was a lots of things to be done. Now, for instance, we isolated the antibody that cause hay fever, and that thing for a company, see, and this type of thing like this. So Dr. Adams had become a very close friend of mine. He's a very close friend of mine, and as a matter of fact, when I was getting my PhD, he wanted to bring me on full time at the Division of Industrial Research. And I did do--worked there for about six months, and then a big clinical laboratory came, who wanted a PhD. And this laboratory at that time, did not have a clinical pathologist. See, in general, a clinical laboratory have to have a clinical pathologist. Well, since the man who was running the laboratory wasn't a doctor, then a clinical pathologist did not see the need of them actually taking a job there. So the owner of the laboratory flew up to Pullman, and someone told him about me. And they, he came into the laboratory, and he invited me to fly down to Oregon to look, to work for him and he had me trained in radio isotopes and everything else so I would be of use. So I took advantage of it, okay, all those things and flew down to, flew down there and found out that he had all of the modern instruments. He had better instruments than they had at the Division of Industrial Research. He had computers, when they were first coming into play, see what I mean? He had computers everywhere, and he had to, oh, modern, it was modern and up to date. But he wasn't himself. He was dedicated. He was just dedicated to bringing down the price of healthcare, okay. So that's the reason why I've been so involved in many different areas, see, 'cause people probably, they come and they wanna do a certain type of a job, and many people will not take it. And so, you see, so I--and then at that time, I would work--see, I love research so much I just work all night, all night, and this type thing, I just-
Story_ID: 25485
Speaker 1: I've heard it said that research is for young men because a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they can stay there all night. They can work all night.
Speaker 2: Exactly. See, you see, the one contrast thing as we end it up here, the one, the one thing that research is about, you see, Sir. Frances Bacon says, "Whatever a man wants to be true, he more readily believes it". "For whatever a man wants to be true, he more readily believe it." A scientist or a researcher walks away from that type of a concept. We go into the laboratory and we let nature dictate to us what is true and what is not, see, whereas, that you see, slaves, slavery, the results of that, a Caucasian needed someone to work, and he wanted us to be inferior so he could do certain things to us, see what I mean? So many things that happen, what you want to be true, the more readily you will believe it. Think about it now. You, oh, you have think about that's a long time, but what you want to be true, you more readily believe it. So, in order to get people over here and to work the farms and the Indians couldn't do it, okay, he got the Africans over here. They were able to do it, and there was a need for them to be inferior. And that is what he did, see.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's not the way of science.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he say--so he thought of us as being descendants of Ham. Many people think that right now.
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true.
Speaker 2: But I'm not saying it to be holy or none of that, but that's just the way it is. Some people think that I'm better than you because I want that to be true. Or I need for that to be true, like they needed people to work their farmlands. The Indians couldn't do it. They needed, yeah, so then they put us in chains and brought us over here.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Observing is Dr. Passty. We--sir, can you please state your full name again for us and--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Can you give us your full name again?
Speaker 2: My name is William Conan Davis.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: My occupation is that I'm a chemist.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at St. Phillip College in San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: And what is the date?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is Friday, the first of February, isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, 2013, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 2013.
Story_ID: 25487
Speaker 1: Alright, and we left off, you had finished your PhD work, but I wanted to go back to a discussion that you and some of your fellow students had with Dr. Wernher von Braun in Alabama.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You had some additional information about that. Can you tell us some more about that 'cause I think at the time, you all were sort of resentful of somebody going to outer space. You couldn't understand why anybody would (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we couldn't understand that the government spending so much money in terms of, you know, going out, in outer space and everything like this. And many research programs were not being funded because of that reason. And so one young man asked Dr. von Braun, say, you know, why are we doing this? Why are we pumping all this money up in space? Okay, and he says that one day we may have to occupy space because the population is exponentially increasing. And this, I think made us all aware of the fact that the population could pose some future concerns.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And we didn't even think about that at that time. But he was looking forward, you know, to a time when the population may would have exceeded the number the earth could really accommodate.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I heard he got his slide rule out to explain the--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --differences.
Speaker 2: --yeah, so he was, he was explaining, and he was explaining say, the year that he would see as being the year that the earth would be so populated, you know what I mean, that we would have problems with food, problems with water and about everything because the earth was only able to accommodate so many humans.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, for those watching this in the future, they probably won't know it, but Dr. Wernher von Braun was a German scientist who expatriated to the United States--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and at the time that you talked to him, he was sort of a, he was probably the most well-known scientist in the United States or one of the most well-known.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was well known, and then because we had been thinking somewhat about space scientists and Russia had put up a satellite in space, and they called it Sputnik, Sputnik. And this really concerned the United States, that Russia was able to do this. So they really, then put some funds into studying space.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But before that time though, before Russia had put Sputnik in space, there was hardly any talk or any programs that had to do with space travel and this type thing.
Speaker 1: Right, so Wernher von--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That I knew of.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wernher von Braun, the rocket scientist from Germany--
Speaker 2: Yeah, rocket scientist--
Speaker 1: --who came over after World War II--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and was working with, yeah, okay, Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25488
Speaker 1: Could you go back a little bit to when you met Albert Schweitzer 'cause you actually played the organ for Albert Schweitzer, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I played the--you know what, he asked me because it was kind of a, like, you know, unique, him kind of like, strange to see a Afro American who was interested in the organ. And so, you know, so I was, I told him how I enjoyed him playing because we came, you know, he was giving a little concert and this type thing. And so then I say that, he asked me, he said, well, do you play? I said, yes, and so I played, just a little small song, you know, not anything--I didn't do anything by, what are the classic organ pieces, you know, but just a little, possibly church song.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and so what did he say about your playing?
Speaker 2: He say that, oh, he was pleased and surprised that, you know, that being a young man as I was, and this type thing, that I had interest in the organ, like he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was very nice and pleasant and asked me to come back and, invited me to come back again, okay.
Story_ID: 25489
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, now, fast forward to 1965, you earned your PhD in Biochemistry, in Organic chemistry--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --at the University of Idaho.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now, you were working on some projects concerning the potato, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, concerning the sloughing of the potato and as you know, that time that you had to do some research that was publishable, that your--that you could publish, and it was something that was new and useful, you know, along that line. So we were looking at, and the sloughing of potatoes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My major professor was Duane Letourno.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Okay, let me see, there you have me a little bit, Duane, let me see, D-U-A-N-E, I think, and Letourno was L-E-T-O-U-R-, something that line.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I apologize for that, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. That's good, that's good enough. That gets us in the ballpark. So, you worked with him on the potato project. Now, were you--I heard you developed a formula by which potatoes could be easily, more easily made into potato chips?
Speaker 2: Yeah, potato chips or what we were trying to do was trying to improve the potato chip. See, many years ago, the potato chip would blister, you know, like, for instance, it would form little gobblers on it, on the surface of the potato chip. And many, many people thought that that was, you know, kind of like, that would make the potato a little bit unpleasant. So the company more or less was interested in a non-blistering potato.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, a potato they could use to fry something with, you know, a thin potato. You could put it in the oil and fry it and it wouldn't form blisters, blisters on the surface.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And also the company that makes potato soup and make different soups, that they put potatoes in, they had an interest. And Idaho, you know, is where you have a culture more or less of potatoes, you know. People grow potatoes in all ways. So there was a company at that time, and they're still in existence today, that had a great interest in dicing a potato and put it into a soup. And they did not want it to disintegrate, you know, dice it make little pieces of it, put it into soup and this thing would stay in a can until some uses it and that it would not disintegrate--
Speaker 1: Or dissolve in the water?
Speaker 2: Yeah, or dissolved in water.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we had all of those interests. But you know, always in doing research, it is a unintended adventure, as you know that. And as some people say, that it is either, you know, the--you go in there and you're gonna let nature, what, show you what is the answer.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was the outcome of the potato research?
Speaker 2: Outcome of the potato research. The outcome was that many companies started sloughing, breaking down the potato, as a way to make instant potatoes, instant potatoes, whereas you could just pour a liquid into a powder, and you would have a potato, you know, a--potatoes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so am I hearing you say that you came up with a formula for instant mashed potatoes? Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: For, you know, for a formula and how would you go about doing it?
Story_ID: 25490
Speaker 1: Now, you were working on a study with Dr. Roy M. Chatters, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, in other words, I--when I went to work for Mr. Mitchell, he was very exciting to me because he had all of the automatic instruments that one would see in a clinical laboratory. And it was, his aim was to reduce the cost of doing assays. So people could do a profile of tests rather than just do just one test, would do a profile of tests and he wrote and had a clinical pathologist to, you know, to design a profile and things like this. And so what he needed was that he wanted to have any assay that would make doing a test easier, okay, easier. And he knew that radio activity and tagging things with isotopes, that it was a method that was being developed, you know, in certain areas of the United States where people were dealing with radio isotopes, and these would serve as, you know, if something is radioactive, it serves as a little radio station. It goes into the body or the blood, and you can kind of follow where it is. Up to that point, you couldn't, see. We were not able to see anything that small or to follow it after I inject it into you. But if I had a detector, and I inject some radioisotopes up under your skin, I could follow exactly where they're going 'cause they're gonna send back to me a wave. So he was very much interested. He was interested in any, any procedure that, no matter how complicated it was, he wanted to bring it to his laboratory. You see, his laboratory was one of the first airmail laboratories whereas that he would get blood from all over the United States, you see. Doctors would send blood to him to run clinical assays on. And he had quite a volume, quite a volume. Many doctors were using him, were using him. And this is why Walter Cronkite came on the radio and he was, asked people, and I remember in about 1966 or '65' [1965] and in that way, to ask people that, did they know that their blood was being sent out of the state or out of town. See that, see. People didn't know it. They thought that their blood was being drawn and the assay was being conducted in the laboratory, in town. See, where the blood was drawn, they thought the assay was being, you know, actually, it might would go over to another building, to another laboratory, but they didn't know that it was going, being flown from town to another town.
Speaker 1: To Idaho, actually, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or was it Idaho or Washington?
Speaker 2: No, it was in Oregon--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Portland, Oregon, okay, Portland.
Speaker 2: And so it was a huge laboratory, it was a huge laboratory. I was very impressed because he had all of the modern instruments, and he did not make this laboratory, and he would tell you this, to make himself rich. But he wanted to make it so that you could run a whole profile of tests on one sample of blood, rather than just doing this one assay. And this would bring down the cost to run the assays. So he was very much interested in doing things easily, you know, automatically.
Story_ID: 25491
Speaker 1: You see at that particular time, we could not really determine things like insulin. Insulin was too small, it was too low in the blood, the parts per million it was in the blood was just so low that our machines would not detect them. We could not quantitate 'em. So we would go about determining what insulin act upon, glucose, and we would use the words, a glucose tolerance test. Well, what you are really trying to determine is that the, was your body producing insulin, you see? If your body was producing insulin, then they knew that the glucose over a period of time, if they gave you some, that it would be used up, see what I mean? So but everybody was getting a glucose tolerance test, probably you had one (unclear) anyone have one, a glucose tolerance. Well, there were many people like Yalow and Dr. Berson in New York City, who really wanted to determine things at a lower level than the machines were actually capable of doing at that time without radioisotopes, without something being radioactive, see that. So radio amino assay, he was really interested in that procedure and Dr. Yalow and Dr. Berson were doing this in New York City, and he knew it. So in order to get a procedure, he would call 'em and--call the people who were doing it, and see if there was a charge that, and he would send us up there or send one person to that laboratory to get that procedure or to learn that procedure, okay, to do it. So, and then also, is that since it was radioactive and Oregon was very sensitive, for even then to environmental contamination, okay, even then. Now, Oregon was one state that always had an environmental sensitivity. Now, Washington State [University] was not. They had a big, you know, a big isotope plant in--radioisotope plant in Oregon and also they--no, in Washington State. But in Oregon state, they didn't have any of that, and everyone was concerned about radiation. So then he knew that if he was going to be bringing some of those isotopes into Oregon state, that someone would have to be qualified to use them and the people would have to know that someone is there qualified to use them. Because when we use them, we have to get them out of the state within x amount of days. Take 'em back to Washington where they were actually deposited and stored. Okay? And so, what he did was that when he hired me, then he hired Washington State- because a department, one department in the division of industry research was radiation. Okay, where I was working. And a Dr. Chatters were over this. So then what Mr. Mitchell did was he arranged with the school that I could go to a training program up under the mentoring-ship of Dr. Chatters, so that I would be able to, and I be qualified, to bring radioisotopes into Oregon and to use them. Radio isotopes, right? So he paid, he really paid and as a result of that I was made a nuclear chemist, okay. And also, I become a health physicist because we wanted to make sure that everyone knew that I was aware as to how to control 'em and how to keep that material from spreading over the city and doing something like that, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. And that's what, a health physicist is someone who understands the safety-
Speaker 1: Yes. The safety. Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: --precautions necessary.
Speaker 1: That's your main concern. So he (unclear)- that was a period of approximately three months, you know? And he paid the school. He paid the school, and so I was able to become certified.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25492
Speaker 1: Also, I was not a MT, a medical technologist. So then, he also, right after that, he sponsored my training in medical technology. You see because, now, people ask that, well didn't he have over a thousand employees? Yes! He had a lot of employees, but he didn't have any on the doctoral level, at that particular time. Because, you see, the clinical pathologist were more or less, at that time, over the clinical laboratory. He wasn't a clinical pathologist or anything like this. So people at a doctoral level would have to really be dedicated to join them. And so he just couldn't find anyone at a doctoral level to work. He had one man there before I come and he had quit. He had quit. So then, he had me trained and I was really interested in training because, you know, anything that was in, had to do with science or this type of thing, just I was interested in.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so both that, that I got licensed in and also I received, as you see over there on the table, I have my MT certificate. And-
Speaker 2: So medical technologist
Speaker 1: Yeah, medical technologist.
Speaker 2: Now you wrote in the-
Speaker 1: MT.
Speaker 2: -yes. In '67 [1967], you wrote an article for the Journal Of Medical Technology called "A Comparison of the T4 and PBI test."
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And tell us, what are those tests? Are those the blood tests?
Speaker 1: Yes. They are thyroid tests. That one of those active tests, that's one of the most used tests that a doctor use, okay. He can kind of predict what is your cholesterol level, and it has to do with the metabolic rate of your body. And he kinda know that if the thyroid level was low, that possibly something was wrong with your thyroid gland, and he knew that at a certain age that if you have this that once you get about ten to twelve years later that you were gonna have certain other ailments. So that, that was a very popular test. T-3 and T-4. One of them is, the T- the numbers stand for, these are organic compounds. If it's a T-4, it has four iodine attached to it. If a T-3 it has three iodine's. And also, the thyroid gland is controlled by the thyroid's stimulating hormone. So if the thyroid gland was inactive, then they knew that the TSH was also inactive. See what I mean? So this is a very popular test.
Story_ID: 25493
Speaker 1: Just for clarification, it wasn't Dr. Chatters that had you working on the, in the medical--in the United Medical Labs. It's Dr. Mitchell. You, he pronounced his name, Michael?
Speaker 2: He was a doctor--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Reverend, I'm sorry, Reverend.
Speaker 2: A Seventh Day Adventist pastor--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't, we can't hear you over there, so--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: He was a Seven Day Adventist preacher.
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah. Yes, he was a Seventh Day Adventist minister.
Speaker 2: Preacher, yeah. And that's why that the clinical pathologist more or less were on his case because, you know, what was a preacher doing running a clinical laboratory?
Speaker 1: Okay, was that one of the criticisms that Walter Cronkite had?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, we--
Speaker 2: There was gonna be a Congressional investigation--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in, okay, so you were with--now, his lab had over a thousand employees, you said? Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had from 700 to about a thousand employees.
Speaker 1: And he treated you very nice is what--
Speaker 2: Very nice. In other words, see, he was almost kind of like a father, and, you know, he would make sure that he would--he was very protective of me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now, tell us about the Congressional investigation?
Speaker 2: Yes, because of this reason, they set out to have a Con--this announcement that your blood was being sent by the mail, you know, that's, that's just--people just didn't like that. You know, my blood is being mail orders and stuff like this and being sent a long ways away, and the--you know, since he had automatic instruments, you know, he could do it and get the results back to you before a company in town could do it, okay. And so people were, he was really concerned about this because he would, when the blood would come, boy, he would just get it and have it run and run the profiles for really cheap money, really cheap. And the doctors were using him from all over the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Reverend Michael or Michael of United Medical Labs, now, he's the one that sent you to New York City to work with--
Speaker 2: Yes, because he wanted me--
Speaker 1: Dr. [Rosalyn] Yalow--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, you see, any, any procedure, anything that we could do to better to understand the clinical tests, then he would sponsor it because he would always tell you that he's--he was not in there for the money. He was in there for, to improve laboratory testing and also to bring down the cost of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And many, many, the clinical pathologists, you know--there's only one or two of those, you know, in a town, five or six of them. There're not many. They control their numbers very well, as you know. The clinical pathologist is a doctor, doctor, see what I mean? He doesn't see patients. He--until you're dead, okay. So they were really on his case. You know, they wanted to close him up. They said that he was pouring blood down the drain and writing up some results and all this type thing like that. So, I just read about people at a doctorial level, but when we got started with our program, and we were radio amino assays and things of this type. A clinical pathologist who belongs to his church, to, you know, the same type church that he was a pastor--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Seventh Day Adventist.
Speaker 2: --came, yeah, the Seventh Day Adventist. And they was picketing, I think--no, no, no picketing was somewhere else. But he came.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in New York, with [Rosalyn] Yalow and Dr. [Solomon] Berson--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but they major, the major thing that they received the Nobel Prize for is that a procedure that we call radio amino assay. And this was new at that time, but it made it possible for us to see things that at a very low level. Like for instance, you know, today, we can see things at a lower level and they call it nanotechnology, see that? Nanotechnology--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --you probably have heard of it. And a scientist was able to, you know, see and determine things at one part per trillion parts of blood.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a radio isotope tracing technique?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, because you see isotopes are very active, and they serve as a, more or less as a little radio station. We could detect it, we could see where it was and it was (unclear) easy to determine its activity and from the activity we knew its concentration.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this work that you did with Dr. Yalow and Solomon Berson resulted in a Noble Prize for Dr. Yalow who headed up the project in 1977.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --that's like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --they got the prize in 1977--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --eight years later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there at a very early time. I was there at about sixty--let me see '69' [1969] or something.
Story_ID: 25494
Speaker 1: I became very interested in healthcare, and so, basically, I was involved with the Black Panthers in setting up, not the Albina Healthcare Center, but another center to check for sickle cell anemia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sickle cell anemia, and I have a picture of that here, you know, a picture of that if you wanna see it.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I'm just trying to keep 'em straight here, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, yeah, please.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us first, did you first--which one did you do first, the Albina or the one with the Black Panthers?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, well, a hospital in the area out there, they hired me to do some research, and this is all--you, you know, when I was working with Mr. Michael and things like this here. So the hospital hired me to do some things, and so what we saw was that the emergency room was overcrowded. So it came to us, myself and about four other people in the community that a center where people who had emergencies should come to and they would not have to go to the hospital. So we hired some doctors and nurses and this type thing, and the Albina Healthcare Center, which was located in a area where there wasn't too much healthcare. There wasn't too many doctors, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did the Black Panthers have something to do with this or--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I mean what did the Black Panthers have to do with this? I mean did they--
Speaker 1: Oh, the Black Panthers, now, came in later on, and they had something to do with the sickle cell, just a clinic to check for sickle cell anemia--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because it was in very much prevalent in blacks.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so they came to me, so we--they had the funds and everything like this, so we set up a clinic that was just for sickle cell anemia.
Speaker 2: Okay, were you testing people to see if they had it or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly. And, you know, how I met them was that at, this was during the time when they were, you know, active, you know, and things of this type. And this sickle cell anemia I think had come into being and everyone, especially if you were Afro-American, were concerned about it, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so they set up, with the help of some MDs, doctors, you know, they set up a little clinic. And this wasn't the same clinic as the Albina Healthcare Center. This was--Albina Healthcare Center is a clinic that was sponsored by the government and also the community.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the Albina Healthcare Center was established in 1972--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and, now, was the Black Panther sickle cell anemia clinic established about the same time?
Speaker 1: About the, about 19--yeah, about a year before or something like that.
Speaker 2: A year before, okay--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so about 1973. Okay, alright. Do you remember the names of some of the Black Panthers that worked with you on that?
Speaker 1: I don't, but I--yes, the chief was Ken Ford, K-E-N, Ford, F-O-R-D. Now, I have his picture here in this newspaper item.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we'll get a shot of that later.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there were many people who had interest, especially, you know, if there were a chance that they could get that particular ailment.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, the Albina Healthcare Center, medical clinic in Portland, now, you're the founder and the first director of it, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, founder and about four people besides me, people from the community and also the government, you know what I mean? And we found that, and I was, you know, I always had two or three different jobs (laughter) or activities, see.
Story_ID: 25495
Speaker 1: Now, you were the head of a department of biochemistry and, at--this is Physicians Medical Laboratories at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is a--now, that's a pathology laboratory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, they recruited me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, they were trying to close up Mr. Michael and they recruited me, and so I was director of the assay section of it and this type thing.
Speaker 1: Now, did Mr. Michael close down?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did they close him down?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they were hoping that by luring you away from him, it would close him down or what?
Speaker 2: No, he says, he--it's my understanding--I'm not too sure because I have not been up there in quite a while, but I think that a, some other bigger company took the laboratory over when Mr. Michael died or something of this type.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, we were, when I first come to San Antonio [Texas], we were working on trying to establish a laboratory like that in Dallas [Texas]. So I was at three places. I was U-T SA, St. Phillips, and I was up there (laughter). So I was very busy, and throughout my career. You know, I was doing, you know--people say they can't believe it that you're being active in so many different things. See, just like I was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, tell us--
Speaker 2: --you know, like the chiropractor college, the naturopathy school, and all of these were important.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, well, I'm--we're gonna try to do them one at a time so we can get 'em all together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In '74' [1974], now you spent two years as post-doctoral researcher at the George Hyman Research Institute in Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes, this was another program that we wanted to study to bring the procedure back to United Medical Laboratory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and it was sponsored by the United Medical Laboratory and the George Hyman Research Institute which is with the Washington Hospital in Washington, D.C. And it's not too far from Howard [University].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not too far from Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '75' [1975], you're appointed associate professor of chemistry and director of clinical laboratories in the Western--at the Western States Chiropractic College in Portland, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the same time that I was at, I was over the clinical laboratory at Emmanuel Hospital. But, that's alright though. Just keep it like you got it.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then the, in '76' [1976], you were appointed academic dean of the College of Naturopathy--
Speaker 2: Naturopathy. See, naturopathy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Naturopathy, right, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --at that time was a part of chiropractor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, naturopathy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, what they did was that they broke off from the chiropractor school because that was one school. See, Western States [College] is like the school where the founder of chiropractor came. You see, D, let me see, D. D. Palmer, I think was the founder. D.S. Palmer was his son, I think. But when they, they were in the, I think it was the state it was founded in, they had their central system or central laboratory in Indiana, okay. And the dad and the son got into a little hassle because the dad felt one way and the son felt another. So old man, D. D. Palmer, went out to Oregon and he started Western State Chiropractor College.
Speaker 1: Now, did the work at the college and the naturopathy or naturopathy, did it remind you of the work that--or was it similar to the work your father [Kince Davis] was doing with herbs and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, similar to that work. So that was my interests. That was my interests and so when they broke off from the Chiropractor college, then just for part time, I would serve with them. And they were in Portland [Oregon]also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, and many states do not allow them in, you know, like Texas State [University], an N.D. is not a doctor.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right. There's a controversy about, around who can be really be one?
Speaker 2: They can own, I think a special food store or something like this, but you wouldn't--you wouldn't call 'em doctor. But in many states though, they, they practice as primary healthcare providers. But at that time, when I was up there, not even a chiropractor was a primary, a primary medical system.
Story_ID: 25496
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any opinion about whether they're legitimate or not or what the difference is between a medical doctor and a ND and a, osteopath even?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I think that they are definitely--as a matter fact, when I first come to Texas, it was trying to--the government was, in consideration of them as primary healthcare providers. So down in Houston [Texas], the Franklin family had a chiropractor school down in Houston, Texas. So I came down because what they wanted to do was to make chiropractor a primary healthcare provider. And at that time, the doctors and the dentists and everyone else fought against it, fought against them becoming primary healthcare providers. See, the only primary healthcare providers at that time was MD, you had to have an MD or you were a dentist, okay. Now, they were the major primary healthcare providers. And they give in and let the DODs or the DDs, something like that--
Speaker 1: Doctors of Osteopathic--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's right, DDs, they let them in to be primary healthcare providers. And they have a school in Dallas and one, all over the United States. And so we were trying to get then a chiropractor to consider them as primary healthcare providers, you know, because they, if you're a primary healthcare provider, you have quite a bit of power, you know, like what you call a hospital, if you have a patient sick and you need a bed, then you could call up a hospital and assign them to a bed, you know, or something like that, primary healthcare providers. But they always, they--and I think to this day, if they see them as a chiropractor and MD as a port of entry into the healthcare system, you know, a port of entry, you know, that you, that you are getting into the healthcare area, but you're gonna have to have, go through a MD eventually, see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A port of entry.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, you were there until I guess about 1979, is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 25497
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: And I had, and then I was also director of laboratory at the Physicians Medical Laboratories too.
Speaker 1: Oh, the Physicians Medical Laboratories.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was one that was controlled by pathologists. See, they, they, boy, they hired a lawyer and everybody to recruit me away from United Medical Laboratories. Number one, there were some clinical pathologists from his church had joined them, okay. And I don't know if there were any PhDs who had joined him at that time, but they were very important. So they would, so they say, well, will you join us? Then you have the chance to work at any hospital in town or anything like this, and you have this chance and the opportunity, see. And so then what I would do, I didn't the United at that time, but I would just say, okay, you know, (laughter). So I think that St. Phillips here is the only place where I just had one job.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, in '79' [1979], you came to the University of Texas Health Center--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --Health Science Center.
Speaker 2: That's right. And I come down. I come down, and a clinical pathologist, okay, was able to give me a--no, a--see, they work very closely together. They know each other and all, just things of this type, right?
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: Was it a clinical pathologist in Oregon that, that helped you get this job at the University of Texas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25498
Speaker 1: Alright, give me your Dr. Lehman stories. There're two of those about Dr. Lehman who was with the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Dr. Lehman was a pathologist of the, he was the major pathologist of really Portland and of Oregon, very well known, and he had two or three different laboratories around town, okay. And whereas that when my name would be listed, it would always be listed with the three pathologists that he had on his staff. But my listed was listed below them. And they, they could sign it, but I couldn't sign it, you know what I mean. If a procedure, if I did a procedure in the laboratory, you know, they could sign, but I couldn't. You know, I could not sign it. So many times I would forget and sign it and they would really say, hell (unclear), this is not in your area of signing things of this type. But then it was, I didn't really understand their power until the Emmanuel Hospital, one of the biggest hospitals in Portland, okay, they asked me to consider a position, director of research at this hospital. And so I went, and so the board agreed that I would, okay. And they hired me, okay. And that's where the picture, I've got some pictures up there--this is one here, where I'm at Emmanuel Hospital. And I didn't know what power that the pathologists had over the hospital. So, you know, I was hired by the board, and so I was telling some people, some of my laboratory techs some things to do in the laboratory. And a pathologist came to me, said, naw, we won't do that. We will do something else, and I said, "Oh, I was hired by the board of the hospital. I'm chief here". He said, oh, no, you're not chief, not in this hospital, okay. I said, well, let's go down and let's talk about this with the president of the hospital. He said, let's go, let's go, we will talk about it. But let me suggest that you take off your pants before you go because when I, when you come out, you will have lost your pants because I'm gonna take your pants off you. I'm the boss here. So I said, let's go, and I was very much upset. And we were talking loud then and the laboratory techs were looking. And I said, let's go, man. So, man, we went on down there, and we talked to the president of the hospital. And he told me, say, yeah, Dr. Davis, say, you know, we need him more than we need you. And so it was such a surprise to me, and when I was walking out, I was holding my pants like this, I said, "Look, don't (laughter)--" so we walked back down the hall, and I say, "Man", and so I knew then that they had power. And believe me, you know, that is, that is still true. That's still true, yes.
Story_ID: 25499
Speaker 1: Now, what's the story about Dr. Lehman and, cutting the body open or something. There's a question, you asked him about how he--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted to, you know, basically, my interests in working in the, in the clinical area, okay, and because when I come to San Antonio [Texas], more or less I was working with different drugs, track license and stuff, but my interest was that what the pathologists were doing when a person died, you know. And, in general, when a person is dying in the hospital what they do is that they call everybody, you know, they call all doctors present in the hospital that, you know, to come and, if there's anything to do or anything like that, you know what I mean. So my interests was in, is that, you know, how could he basically cut a person open to see what he had died of and the family was upstairs crying about this person? See what I mean? I said, how could you, you know, and what we did--see, the laboratory tech and me, what we would do is to just take the body out of the room and take it down to the autopsy room, see what I mean, just to take the body out. So I asked him, I say, how can you dare cut this loved one and family upstairs is crying and stuff like this? And he told me something and he didn't use the word soul or anything like this, he say, I can do it because I know what was there upstairs, when he was alive is not in him anymore, see. And so I looked at him, and he say, um-hum, that's the only way I could do it, see, that, you know, I could do it because--and then, you know, if you're dead (unclear), they're not terms of that, you know, this and that and having many people present. But you see when a doctor does the operation, many people, I know that the people standing in that room with him is another doctor and, in general, a clinical and anatomical pathologist is present, okay, and they're there. So if the doctor become too nervous, you know, they're there to tell him to step aside and let this other doctor take over or something like this because, you know, working with life is very, you know, precautious, you know. It's, it's very, something that has always as a young man interests me, you know, right. How can you dare to do certain things to him after he stopped breathing or something like this, and the people upstairs was just crying, okay.
Story_ID: 25500
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of your activities at the University of Texas Health Science Center?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I came down here, I wanted to--I had promised my dad [Kince Davis] that I was going to come back South, you know, in some time, and I was going to spend some time teaching, you know, teaching. I wanted to do a little more teaching and my dad wanted that, you know. And so, so I decided when I talked with Dr. Lehman and he knew the pathologist here, right. So I came down to San Antonio [Texas] with his recommendation, so I got a job at the Health Science Center, okay. The first job I got when I arrived in town was at the National Pathology Laboratory that's on Louis Pasteur Drive, okay. And I just got that for one or two days, and then I was hired by the medical school up here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what we were doing that running assays upon drugs, you know, valium and this type thing like this. What would make it be more effective and things of that type. You understand what I mean? Yes, and so I, I became very much heavy into research, but then, you know, I wanted to do a little teaching. And so Dr. Byrd and, from St. Philips [College]--I kind of knew about St. Philips because, number one, my sister knew Mrs. Bowden because my sister was over the social work department at the V.A. Hospital in Tuskegee. And Ms. Bowden's brother worked there as a Chaplin, okay. And my sister was a social worker like Ms. Bowden was.
Speaker 1: Now, who is Ms. Bowden, explain?
Speaker 2: She found, she was, she was really the person who Bishop Steptoe hired to run the school, and I think that's (unclear) is, Bishop Steptoe hired her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, and she--
Speaker 1: She was basically the president of St. Philips?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25501
Speaker 1: You worked with a gentleman named M.K. Ticku, T-I-C-K-U, Ticku or Ticku.
Speaker 2: Ticku.
Speaker 1: Ticku, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was an East Indian. And so we worked, and we worked on tranquilizers and things like this and drugs and trying to determine how, the procedure or how they had the influence, which they do have.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there're quite a few articles. I'm looking at about 20 articles you all published together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is about valium, you know, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, valium, yeah, valium, picrotoxin and this type thing like that. We wanted to get a good picture of it because the drug company was really interested in that particular tranquilizer.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you develop anything new from the research that you conducted?
Speaker 2: Well, we just, just the things that we published, you know, just the binding size and what would activate it and this type thing like this, you know.
Speaker 1: What's, what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: At the same time now, I was working here--no, I came here just part time, and I was doing research up there. I come here part time, and I was teaching one or two classes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is benzodiazepine the major--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --the active ingredient in valium or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Benzodiazepine.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how does it work? Can you kind of explain how valium works?
Speaker 2: How valium works is that basically, it is a tranquilizer, and it--valium works not only the mechanism of it has a lots to do with lowering the heart rate and this type thing, you know what I mean, the binding sites. And that's about all that I can come up with right because, you know, you have to go into technical type material. But valium, which is a very important drug.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it makes you, basically, we were looking at what, you know, where it bound when it gets into, when it leaves the blood system.
Story_ID: 25502
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1983, you were age 57 years old, that you came to St. Philips College.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: Full time.
Speaker 1: Full time, alright, and you began as an instructor in the Department of Chemistry, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us what you--now, did you have a chance to do research as well as teach, when you were here?
Speaker 2: Here?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No, what I was doing is that I was teaching until the water project come into being--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --see what I mean? In other words, I was teaching. I was really, for that period of time when I first come here, I was at, doing something here. I was doing something up in Dallas [Texas], because United Medical Laboratory, Mr. Michael's son wanted to start a little clinical laboratory up in Dallas, okay. But it didn't get too far. And so he asked me to be involved, so I was up there, and I was doing research at UTSA [University of Texas, San Antonio], and I was teaching here. See, I was--I'd had to be three places many times in one day, see what I mean? One day, I had to be three places, and so the chemistry instructor here, Professor Stephenson and Dr. Byrd and Mr. Bowden's brothers, she came over, as a matter of fact, when they first got started, he used to teach here, okay. And I kind of like knew him, you know, through my sister, okay. And so I came and I taught, and I would just do this probably, one class here and get on the airlines and get up to Dallas for the evening, and we were trying to set up some procedures. And we set up some procedures. We wanted to set up a laboratory in Dallas that was very similar to United Medical Laboratory. But something happened with the director there. He, his plan was not the plan that they had up in Oregon. He had another plan. So there was a disagreement. So then they asked me to come up and direct it, but I wanted to do a little teaching, and I turned it down. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and so that's the way that it happened at, that I came to--you know, I was at, just at UT [University of Texas] and here. And then when a full-time position opened up here, I just left UT and came here.
Story_ID: 25503
Speaker 1: Now, tell us a little bit about St. Philips College. A lot of people don't know a lot about it, but it's a college in San Antonio [Texas], and it was founded--tell us about how it was founded and who it was for?
Speaker 2: Yes, a Episcopal, I think, Bishop, I think, Steptoe, saw that there was a need for a college to teach minorities in this area, okay. And so then he hired Ms. Bowden who was known in Georgia. She had done lots of things in Georgia, you know. She was over some programs over there, and she was a good social worker. And she was in the same field as my sister. And so, basically, she started, I think it was a RN training program, wasn't it? No, it was--I got the pictures downstairs. I think it was a, just a school for nurses, I think. Now, I'm not too sure of it. I should have gotten that history for you, but I'm not too sure, since I've, since I came, you know, a long time after that. But I know most of the students were dressed as nurses in this picture. And from that, she then moved out here. She was, she was located then downtown in a little house downtown, she was located. Then she moved out here and they made it into a college, okay. And she has on the staff, her brother from Tuskegee. He was here because where the police station was, he say that his house was right there, you know. So it was very small then. Where we are here now, there was, you know, nothing, and--
Speaker 1: Was--
Speaker 2: This was a street that come right by us right here, to go out to Walters. So it was just a building, the building that they have named after her was really one of the original building son this particular campus. And it's on the other side of the campus. When I came aboard, this was the science building, and they call it now, the Bowden's Building, okay. And so, that's about all I knew. I think that she did a, many things so she really pushed this school. And she's the one who pushed it and it grew and to the extent and--I don't know how it became a part of the public system. I don't know, that was before--
Speaker 1: So it's now part of the state (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I--see, when I came in now--
Speaker 1: No, it's not.
Speaker 2: --the major Alamo college was the one downtown, the college downtown. And this was just a outpost of that college because the president of that college downtown was the president of this school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, is this like a county college, I mean college, associated with the college--no, no.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was only one community two-year college, and that was the one that was downtown for whites and Hispanics and for blacks also. And when the Alamo Colleges were started--because when I came now, the apartment of--everything was downtown, the president of this college was at the college downtown. And a dean was over this college, and so Ms. Bowden, I think she was, she--before she joined the community college district, I think, she was president of this college. But after she joined it, since she, she would have had to come, become a dean or something of this type because when I come here, the person that you see over there now, is the person who was in that position. He was a dean, see, okay. And you had to almost to, go to the college downtown, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, now, you know, there are five different colleges, but at that time, when I came there were only two.
Speaker 1: So St. Philips is part of the Alamo colleges, system.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Alamo College School District.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in the early '40's [1940s], from my understanding, they joined the Alamo, this college joined the Alamo Community College.
Story_ID: 25504
Speaker 1: You were teaching here, and now, most of the students here--are most of the student African American and, or Hispanic here?
Speaker 2: They were, when I first, my first class was white, three or four kids were white and mostly Hispanic, and about four or five kids were black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The classes were very small, and at that time, I think they were thinking about taking the science department downtown, I think so, because it was very small, you know. Like, for instance, Professor Stephenson, who was here with Ms. Bowden, he was over the chemistry department. Dr. Linear Byrd, he was over the biology department. After Professor Stephenson had to retire, okay, because of his age. At that time, it was before President Reagan, you know, before him. Reagan is the one that say, you can work as long as you're able. But at that time, you had retire at a certain age. So he had to retire. Now, he wanted to come back as an emeritus professor, but for some reason, the board did not vote him back to become. And so Dr. Byrd, who was over biology, then become the chairman of biology, chemistry and physics. When I come, he was over all three of those areas.
Speaker 1: So, okay--
Speaker 2: So then I come and Professor Stephenson, I think when I was here part time now, he was full time. But after he retired, then they offered me a full-time position.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25505
Speaker 1: Alright, now tell us about the, I think one of the big, the major projects you worked on here was the water project with Clifford Ashbrook, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So he brought, but the project was brought to you by another professor here, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, who was white.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us--Dr. Byrd brought you the project, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --Dr. Byrd who was over me, okay, and he was the chairman of the department of Natural Sciences, and he brought the water and he asked me, say, you know, you have been doing research all your life. You know, possibly you'd like to do something. I thought he was kidding when he was first talking, say, do something, do some research on water.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was special about this water?
Speaker 2: This, Ms. Ashbrook had a company.
Speaker 1: This is Clifford Ashbrook, and--
Speaker 2: Clifford Ashbrook had a--
Speaker 1: And he was a munitions inventor, right. He invented some guns, the M--he had the patent for the M-2, is that, M-2 rifle?
Speaker 2: He had a little company on the West side of town, and he produced this processed water.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just before, now, you have all of the different type waters now, okay. And he had a little company, and he would sell this water to different people, you know, different people. And what happened is that he wanted to know something about the properties of it, the physical properties, okay, the chemical properties. And so he wanted to establish it, you know. He knew the physical properties, but he wanted to know the chemical properties. So he brought it here to us, and what we did was that we studied the chemical properties, okay. And he knew that he could use that water and, around swimming pools because the water was anti-bacterial, you know, it would kill bacteria and this type thing like this. And so, and the water was rather, you know--and so we decide to do some research in terms of the physical properties and the chemical properties, see what I mean? He say, I know the physical properties, but I want to just, some way to explain the chemical properties. But for some reason he was in contact with a company in, in Boston [Massachusetts] and also a company in California, and they are now selling Penta water, you know, Penta water. You probably haven't seen it, but it's a special type water, Penta, Penta water. So what he would do is that he, somehow, foresaw the importance of water. So when I started doing research on it, you know, they gave us a little grant. And we used the grant to employ three or four students, you know what I mean, to do some research. Now, our interests were in the boiling point, okay, the pH, the--those are type things that we were interested in. See, the boiling point. We wanted to bring the boiling point, and Mr. Ashbrook wanted to make a water that was more wettable, okay, and you say how can we make this thing more wettable. He knew that this water was more wettable, but he didn't know why it was so readable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25506
Speaker 1: Okay, kind of explain the molecular theory behind this water, the molecular composition of it.
Speaker 2: Yes, what he did was that he colloidal grind it, okay. He had a machine, and he actually gave me one, and we had one here. And what it was, the water would go up into a, you know, he has to, it was turning like this, and the water would go up in here, and it would hit the top of this chamber that he'd run out into the water. See, he had a arm to go out into the water. The end of this, you may call it a piece of metal. On the end of it, he had a rotating rod, see, doing something like this. And he would stir that water till the temperature would raise to a hundred. And then he would let it cool down. Then he would stir it again, and it took, you know, something like a day for the temperature to go up. And then he would name, when the temperature go up and the temperature come down, he would call that one cycle. He, and so he wanted us to look at the 12-cycle water because the water--you know, and find out some of the uses of it because he found, you know, I'm sure that they knew that the surface tension was decreased, and he knew that this water was more wettable, but he didn't have the chemistry background to, exactly to know why it was (unclear) wettable, and that it did not--
Speaker 1: Now, now--
Speaker 2: --form globules when you put it on a smooth surface.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, now, what you were explaining to me earlier that regular water, if you put it on a smooth, solid surface, it forms globules of water--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because of the molecular structure of ordinary water.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The molecules are big.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Go on.
Speaker 2: So we, this is what we looked at. We looked, we looked at the clearing rate. We looked at the polarity of it, and the pH, the surface tension and the boiling point.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, back to the molecular structure though, the process he has of colloidal grinding--
Speaker 2: Yes, that broke the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules. See, water molecules is based up of two atoms, hydrogen and oxygen, okay. One molecule will have two hydrogen and one oxygen. But then the molecules associate with each other and they are attracted to each other because the oxygen is very, what, negative. The hydrogen are positive, so they form a bond and about 12 water molecules associate in a, you know, and they are bonded together. That's what make water boil at such a high temperature, see. So his aim is to, was to try to see if he could not lower the temperature. And then this would just save many companies who were in water science or water activity and who had to heat water up. If you can get water and get it to boiling at a low temperature, then that would save a lots of energy. So then he figured out a way, and he kind of like patent a little system, and the little system was, looked like that a little arm sticking out from a container. And as I told you that, on the end of this arm was a turning rod, and it would turn something like this, okay. And the water more or less was colloidal grind, you know. For instance, he would take the water up against another surface, you know, and grind it, you know, just grind the water. And so he, he knew a lots of that when it came. So we had to determine that the hydrogen bonding was decreased, see. What he was doing, that he was decreasing the hydrogen bonding. Like he was making the water system, rather than 12 molecules bond together, then he would break it down where there was only part three molecules, you know, that were associated together.
Story_ID: 25507
Speaker 1: Now, when we were discussing this earlier, you said such a water is wetter in that it disperse easier. So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --plants, I guess in a dry arid region, if they're trying to water plants to get them to absorb more water, they can actually absorb this water faster, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and, you see the water would defuse a little faster. Like, for instance, as I told you that it's a fusion into the roots of onion will make the onion grow faster, okay. As long as you don't run it through too many cycles. See, he just had the water up to 12 cycles, but you could take it up to as many cycles as you wanted to. But it took him seven days to get those 12 cycles because he thought that when you heat the water up, then you see, okay, the hydrogen bond is broken, okay, and he knew that when water changed from a liquid to a gas, that the water molecules were separate, see that? See like when you boil water, you get steam. But now the steam is, the molecules are separate. They're moving. They're not cluster together, see what I mean?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he says that if he could de-cluster them and that the boiling point should decrease, and that was true--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and that also the surface tension will decrease, you see, because when you pour water out over a smooth surface, the water is attracted to other water molecules. So rather than expand out, it's attracted to other water molecules and it forms a, you know, a little bead, or little lump of water, like that. So he was really trying to get after that. And then that would also make the water more wettable, okay, like you could use less water to clean your car than you have to use now. And that's what he was trying to do. Even before now, the shortage of water that we have seen now, even before the water revolution that we have had, now, you see even "Home Depot" sell water. Everybody sell water, you know what I mean. You got all grades of water, you know, you got just water everywhere. And when we started doing it, you know, that--there was no water, you know, except his water. And so we gave it the name kinetic water because the molecules were not bunched together, and they were moving fast, okay. But we named kinetic water. And we, then we did some research on it, and there were quite a few people interested in it. We gave a little workshop one time, and then after that we gave a big conference, and people come from all over the United States to it.
Story_ID: 25508
Speaker 1: We gave that symposium about '88' [1988] or '89' [1989], something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And people came from all over, you know what I mean? And they had a interest in water. And so I, Dr. Byrd and I, we wanted to make the presentation over at Sykes. Now, Sykes is the school that's downtown, that's mostly white at that time, right. So we gave it downtown, and you had a Afro-American Chancellor. As a matter of fact, he was the second chancellor that the school system had. When I come, there was no chancellor. There was just a president of Sykes, and he's president of this school, okay. And so, but as the schools and the students grow, then they saw the need of a chancellor and they changed the deans around to presidents. And (unclear) they promoted them to get rid of them, you know what I mean, like the dean here was Dean Murphy, okay. And when they decide that schools were gonna have presidents, you know, he was black, okay. But he was very fair, okay, they decided that they--I think he was president here for about six months. Then they promoted him up to the, you know, something like a vice chancellor or something like that. But for some reason I saw him, and he say that, you know, he didn't know what his job was, so he retired, he retired.
Speaker 2: I wanna go back to the water, the properties of the water. And the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, no, so then the second chancellor they got now, the first chancellor, no. The second chancellor was a Afro-American, and his name was something, but this was when we were showing the water and we were doing the water research, okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so basically, when we made the presentation, he told me, says, Davis, I don't think you should be wasting your time doing research on water. And so then the--
Speaker 2: He didn't see the significance of it?
Speaker 1: That's right. Then at that time, there was a white president of this college, okay. He was white. And so he told me, he say, well, go ahead with it, and I will use some money from my office to fund you, okay. And so we kept doing it, but he was really interested in it.
Story_ID: 25509
Speaker 1: Now, one of the things you told me before we started was that this water has properties that, say if you soaked a cucumber in it, it would make the cucumber explode because of osmosis, it would be--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --be too much pressure inside the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --cucumber because it would suck in too much of the water, I mean too much of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --water would (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, osmosis, you know, is a very high-pressure. Like, for instance, a person could do many things with osmosis, like they purify water by osmosis. See, what you do, now, you make a semi-permeable membrane, okay, and the whole concept now of osmosis is this, you make a semi-permeable membrane. Large molecules can't go through it. Only small molecules can go through it, right, or certain type molecules can't go through. But some can, okay, some can. And when you put this membrane and you have, let's say, some large particles in one chamber, and you put that membrane between that chamber and another chamber that have small molecules in it, right? Then you see the small molecules would rush into where the--they could get through the membrane into where the other chamber and the amount of water that's in that particular chamber would increase. And this is what we call osmosis or osmotic pressure. And the pressure that this water, as it raise up like this, that's osmotic pressure, see there. Now, this, this water being very small, see, it would go through a membrane, and what happen is that when something is as--you know, the, a system has a different concentration. See, this is the reason why that they have to, when they inject a drug into your blood stream--system, it has to be isotonic with the blood. What we mean that they have to have the ionic strength as the blood. See what I mean? They cannot, they cannot--that's why you use saline--you've heard of saline? That's right, and now if they gonna, to put something directly in your blood artery or a vein, it has to be in saline unless it, if it's not isotonic, it's gonna rupture your red blood cells. And many people think that this is the way that many folks are actually hurt, you know. But you have to have it--
Speaker 1: So you can kill a person by--
Speaker 2: --at a certain pH--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --injecting them with something that's (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, easily, easily. And some people, you know, that take drugs with a needle, sometimes, not knowing about saline, they, through a mistake, they go into an artery or vein and they put that water and the drug there. And see that water is not isotonic with the blood. You have to put something in there, and they use table salt to make saline to help--see, the same ionic strength that the blood is, see. Now, you put that drug in there, then you see, then, water will not leave the red blood cells or the red blood cells will not absorb the water that you put. See, if you put, if you put some water in that, it doesn't have the same ionic strength that your red blood cells has, you see what I mean? Is that then the water is gonna go in and try to dilute, you know, whatever there's there. In other words, it's like that. A concentrated system will naturally be diluted, see what I mean? A concentrated system, would naturally be diluted if you put something in there that is not as concentrated as it is, then the water, see, it goes in there trying to dilute what's in the red blood cells.
Speaker 1: So, this kinetic water can be dangerous if it's not handled properly if it's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly. So, and this is what we always preach, you know, that, you know, that--and this is why in a water like Dasani, they gonna add some salts to it to make it isotonic. And you, you'll find out that, now, this water here was made another way. But you see, look at your water and you're gonna see that they have added something to it to make it isotonic with the water that's already in your blood, okay, you know, with the system that's already, makes up your blood, it has to be isotonic, same ionic strength. Okay.
Story_ID: 25510
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, from what I understand, am I correct in saying that you developed a technique to balance the kinetic water so that it can be ingested by human beings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so before you can really drink the water and the water, basically, one time we were drinking the water, and I would not drink it and the students wouldn't drink it, but Dr. Byrd tasted it. And he said, you know, this taste like well water, you know, well water. You know, we used to have to get water out of a well, yes. Well, when the water was in the well, see, it had a low surface tension, see. And he said, oh, it's, but this water has no taste at all. That's what he says. And, and so, you know, he, himself, he was curious to just know, did the water have a taste. So he just took some of the water, like this, and just tasted it.
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: But not enough to hurt himself.
Speaker 1: Okay, but well water is similar, is it?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I mean is well water similar to kinetic water?
Speaker 2: Yes, similar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: Is it because it's been down in the ground--
Speaker 2: Because you see we, once you make it, then you have to make it, especially, Dasani water now. Look at the Dasani water, and you'll find out that they're making it isotonic. They add material back to it because it's, if not, it would (unclear) the red blood cells--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and split 'em.
Speaker 1: Well, Dasani water, which is a brand name of kinetic water now. Will kinetic water hydrate you faster than regular water if it's balanced right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it will hydrate you much faster because, you see, it's, it, you know, it tries to dilute. So if there's a tissue have ions in it than it has, it will go in and try to dilute it. That's a natural tendency. That is what we call entropy, you know, entropy, that nature, that really nature favors entropy, you know. Like when a storm come through, it doesn't blow things into a organization. It blows them apart, you see what I mean, see, what I mean? Like, for, like the guy say, nature is not that friendly thing that you wanna think it is, you know, that our relationship with it is like a seesaw, see. And sometimes entropy--see, nature favors entropy. Like, what we mean by entropy is that things become disorganized, you know, disorganized. In other words, there was a man during the storm, and he had just built a, I think it was a 400 or $500,000 house. And nature not knowing anything about the price of a house, it blows it apart.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you, see it blows it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Just one correction that James Steptoe Johnston was the founder of St. Phillips College, that's all. I just wanted to say that.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's what--you were searching for the name.
Speaker 2: Nature, nature favors disorganization, but man favors--see, you and I, we favor organization. See, we want to organize. We want to organize our yards, organize it, but nature--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a guy say, you know, there's a guy who was talking--that's not on, is it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's on. We're starting.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's on. Yes, okay. Yeah, he say, you know, if only during that storm, that hit the East Coast, not too long ago--
Speaker 1: Hurricane Sandy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if this storm had just the churches intact, that would be a good proof that there's a God, and he likes what the people are teaching to you that He is, see what I mean, because what he did was that, this guy was talking about that, he said, what he did is that he, they told him to get out the church and go to a safe place. And he say, well, where I am is a safe place, the church, you know. The storm is not gonna bother us. But, you see, when the wind came in and the water, it took everything. And he was very disappointed, he was very disappointed. As a matter of fact, he was young, you know, and he was just getting started with his ministerial, his theology program--
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --and he say, it would have been nice if just the churches would have been spared. Wouldn't that have been nice? That would have been proof, you see, that what we were doing is important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25512
Speaker 1: Now, you were--you taught here at St. Philips full time until two thousand and--
Speaker 2: Nine [2009].
Speaker 1: And nine [2009].
Speaker 2: I retired, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and there's currently a building named after you, I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is this the science building?
Speaker 2: The Science II building, right over there.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: That's the, they built that building since I was on campus. See, the science building was the Bowden's Building way over on the other side of the campus. But they just built that new science building--that's one of the new buildings that the, that has been built since I've been here. This is one.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about having a building named after you?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How did you feel about having a building named after you?
Speaker 2: Oh, if it does, if it does influence the kids, knowing that, you know, a human being could, could be of service to mankind whereas that they think, you know, that he's important enough to put his name up there, then, you know, if this is a enticement to get kids to go to college or get 'em to take science and this type thing like this, then it's very good.
Story_ID: 25513
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yes, my hopes for them is the same hopes that Carver [George Washington Carver] had, you know, and Booker T. Washington had, is that, you know, that we will go to college and learn about our environment and be able to participate in changing it and improving it and this type thing, okay. And this is my hope. We need them, we need everybody to become concerned because water is becoming so scarce, especially in some countries. And also in many countries people are starving to death, and [what] I'm saying is that if there were people there who knew how to rotate things and get that soil back where they could start growing things again, you see. See, it was Carver who rotated the crops down South and that's why that even the South gave him a lots of respect, white and everybody else because it was--it was Dr. Carver who say, you know, you don't grow the same crop on this land over and over and over it again, see. You must, at some points along the way. And I have a picture in my office and it really, I think about this, you know, is that, it say, "Pains amid plenty", and they show the African standing up in a green terrain, but not knowing how to do things, you see what I mean? See, there are--one thing that we're kind of like short of is that the physical or knowing how to do things. You understand what I'm saying to you? In other words, knowing how to use that particular area to produce for him some food, see.
Story_ID: 25514
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point in life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: What you say? I think it's the, it's the, I think that I would consider to be my top thing, is that what you're saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah, your legacy, the things that you've accomplished? What do you think are the top things that you've accomplished?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, I would say making, making potatoes more useable, you know, okay, and this has helped mankind, okay, and also making ice cream a little easier to make. See, years ago, we had to churn it, as you know. And this I think--in other words, what you have done to improvements and to help others, that's the most important thing that, to me, see, okay. It's not necessarily the particular thing, but what you have done, but this have done to create jobs, okay, and this type thing because we were working with the fuel cell, and we were trying to work out a way where we can get a source of energy that would be cheap and, but it would be useable and people wouldn't be short of energy, see. So we was, looking at the fuel cell, and this hasn't gotten too far yet, but I think that one day it will. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So we were always interested in trying to find something that, how can we help, you know, or how can mankind use this? You know, how could we use it, and then you feel good, okay.
Story_ID: 25515
Speaker 1: Tell us how you met your wife and tell us about your--I know you have a daughter. Do you have other children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I met, I have two kids. I have a son and a daughter, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about them?
Speaker 2: Okay, my daughter, she is a dentist, and she finished UAB, and my son is in nuclear medicine, and he is practicing up in a little town just North of Austin [Texas]. So I'm proud of them, you know, that they can be of service, you know, to the community--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and also it makes them feel good that they are of service.
Speaker 1: And your wife has a name that's very similar to your brother, doesn't she or it sounds similar. What was your wife's name?
Speaker 2: She is a writer, and she is a, and she has training in business administration, and she went with me to, from Alabama up to Idaho, okay. And a lots of things that she did, made it possible for me to get my PhD because she was able to type, okay, and this type thing like this.
Speaker 1: And what's her name?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Ocia, O-C-I-A. And my daughter's named Cheryl, C-H-E-R-Y-L, and my son is named Mark, and I named him after Dr. Mark Adams.
Speaker 1: Okay, one of your mentors, right?
Speaker 2: Because, yes, that's right. He was the most impressive instructor and mentor that I had.
Story_ID: 25516
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: That I would do differently?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Than what I did?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would not do anything differently. I, I think about that a lots now. That's a very deep question, would I have done something differently? No. I think that this was kind of like a part of my, you know, my makeup, and that I think that I would have just done about the same thing because, you see, I'm, I just, you know, it just, it takes a lots of things, you know, like, you know, I have played the organ for many years and I played the violin as a kid and all of, stuff like this. And it's just like, you know, it's just, it's just--sometimes I wonder about myself (laughter). You know, one might say slightly coo-coo, you know, but I don't know, that my--that it was something that was very important to me. And we were living in a town that didn't even have a classical violinist, and I don't know that I had to, you know, had to, and I wanted it, and my dad [Kince Davis] made it possible to get a teacher who was a classical guitarist to teach me.
Speaker 1: Now, do you still play anything?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you still play an instrument today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can still play. I can still play. I don't, there's, I've not lost that interest yet, but I'm not as good as I was now, you know, I'm not as fast. But I can still read and play.

Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as one who, you know, gave of himself to help others.
