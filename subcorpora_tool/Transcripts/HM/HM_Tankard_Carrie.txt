Speaker 1: So that we have a background and some context for looking at your social development as a teenager and as you moved into your adult life and your career and raising your family we wanna go back and take a look at your family history and, and family background.  And so we're gonna start by asking you to tell us a little bit about your mother, what was her name, where was she born, where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was Maggie Isabell Kornegay, that was her maiden name and she was born and raised in Virginia, I don't know when the family moved to New York. But that's where she landed.

Speaker 1: What do you know about her growing up years in Virginia?  Did she share stories with you and tales about her life as a child in Virginia?
Speaker 2: No, unfortunately we tend to wait too long to search for this information.  I, as you know, I like history--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but I didn't think about it or ask about it when I was little to find out all the good information.  So I actually know more about some other people that I have investigated through the Heritage Trail [Martha's Vineyard African-American Heritage Trail] that I'm involved in. Then I do about my own family.
Speaker 1: I see, so she never volunteered?
Speaker 2: She didn't volunteer. Any, any great information about her childhood that is.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  How do you remember your mother?  She passed in what, 1985?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How do you remember her as a person?  What was her personality like?
Speaker 2: She was strong, independent. She was involved in the community, always involved in whatever we were doing, we as her children. I remember she was president of the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] in our elementary school [Miller Street Elementary School, Newark, New Jersey]. She was an air raid warden during the war [World War II, WWII] and she was always there, even though she worked some, she was always there when we needed her. Yeah.

Speaker 1: --did she work?
Speaker 2: She worked. Yeah, but I don't know h- what work she did.

Story_ID: 275851
Speaker 1: What do you know about her [Tankard's mother, Maggie Kornegay Camillo] parents, your grandparents, her mother [Carrie Kornegay] and father, did you know them or?
Speaker 2: I didn't know her mother but I did know her dad for a little while. I believe I was like six years old when he died. He was a security guard in a private school in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And what was he like as a person.  How do you remember him?
Speaker 2: Strong and powerful.  I remember we had an incident 'cause he had, he was allowed to have this gun to guard this private school and we were visiting one time and I went in his room which I wasn't supposed to do and I got this gun and came back and just pointed it at my sister.  My mother is very resilient and smart. She didn't scream or say anything, she just kindly stepped over--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And she just calmly took it out of my hand. And of course I had to get the lecture and the scolding after that one. It was a scary incident.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and where were you living when this happen?  This was in Newark?
Speaker 2: This was Newark.  We were living on Brunswick Street, there were sections, three sections of, of Newark that I know of and it was the neck, the valley and the hill.  And Brunswick Street was in the valley.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: And they were separated by specific streets.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  Why did your grandfather and your mother move from, if I have this right, from New York [New York] to Newark?  Do you know why they, they made that move?
Speaker 2: No, perhaps they had relatives there, but we did have some of relatives that were already in Newark but, other than that, no.
Speaker 1: Who were these relatives, do you--
Speaker 2: Well they were distant aunts and, and relatives that were married to other relatives of ours.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Had they come from the South?
Speaker 2: They had come--
Speaker 1: Before?
Speaker 2: --from the South also--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where was your grandfather born?  You know much about his background?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay, and his name?  Did we get his name?
Speaker 2: George Franklin Kornegay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They used to call him GFK.
Story_ID: 275852
Speaker 1: (Cough).
Speaker 2: Tell me about your father.  What was his name, where was he born?  Where did he grow up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My father was Felipe Camillo.
Speaker 2: Could you spell his first name?
Speaker 1: F-E-L-I-P-E.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He was born in Chihuahua, Mexico.  I don't know very much about him either, specifically because we believe he was illegal because when we started school I remember we used to get confused, my mother [Maggie Kornegay Camillo] would say, say he came from Oklahoma and then at one point I believe she said he--to tell that he came from Texas.  So sometimes we'd say he was from Texas, sometimes we'd say he was from Oklahoma and we, we never could get it quite straight but it, it didn't seem to matter.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Do you know when he left Mexico and why?
Speaker 1: No I don't.  My sister seems to think he came as a street waif, and friends used to tease us that he came on a banana boat. But we never really knew.
Speaker 2: Where did he first settle and how did he meet your mother here?
Speaker 1: They met in New York [New York].  He settled in New York and that's where they met and were married.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  What was he doing for work at that point?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: Well, he did all sorts of odd jobs. He was very frustrated because they would say he was Puerto Rican, and they would al- he didn't like that and he would be offered all sorts of menial jobs, dishwashers and sweepers and things like that. Eventually, when, after they moved to Newark [New Jersey] though, he did get a decent job in the steel mill and, Phelps Dodge [Corporation] he worked for.
Speaker 2: For who?
Speaker 1: Phelps Dodge.
Speaker 2: Could you spell that?
Speaker 1: P-H-E-L-P-S, D-O-D-G-E, (unclear).
Speaker 2: He, according to your information, he was born in 1898.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Do you know how old he was when he came to New York from Mexico?
Speaker 1: No I don't.  But we were always pleased that we knew somebody that was born before the 1900s. 'Cause he was the only one that we knew.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Now did he share with you anything about his growing up in Mexico?
Speaker 1: No we, and actually he was the one we used to try to get more information from and he wouldn't--he was funny.  He would just--we'd say, "Dad?  Do you have any sisters or brothers?"  He'd say, "Of course I did.  I had lots of 'em."  And say, "Well, what were their names" and he'd start off "Rosita, Conchita, oh Jesus Christ, I don't know," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And that would be as far as he would go with it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So you never met any relatives?
Speaker 1: Never met any relatives.
Speaker 2: Did he ever go back?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: He didn't.  Did he ever tell you why he left?
Speaker 1: Nope. I knew he was a boxer.  Maybe that's how he got to New York.
Speaker 2: Did he box--
Speaker 1: He used to box--
Speaker 2: --in New York?
Speaker 1: Yes he did.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: For amateur or what?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, was he good?
Speaker 1: He said he wasn't. But we never knew.
Speaker 2: How big was he?  Was he a lightweight? Featherweight, or was he bigger than that?
Speaker 1: No, he would be a lightweight.  He was a small man.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, okay.  He didn't talk about his parents?
Speaker 1: Nope.
Speaker 2: How do you remember him as a person, his personality, what was he like?
Speaker 1: He was, he was a gentle soul with us, he was, I think he was loved by his children and adored by his grandchildren.  I know one nephew used to invite him to come spend the night and insist that he sleep in the same bed with him.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He was a hard worker. He worked, he had a shoeshine stand one time and my brothers weren't much interested in it so he took me along which turned out to be a good deal because I was, at that time, being little and cute and a girl. We--he had a sit--concession at the local bowling alley and the leagues would come and they'd all bring their shoes over while they were bowling and he'd shine them up and then I'd deliver them and get big, big tips.

Speaker 1: You were born in what year again?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-five [1935].
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings?  How many siblings did you have, brothers and sisters--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --their names and their birth order?
Speaker 2: Okay if I can remember.  I had two sisters and four brothers. And my oldest sister was Carmen [Camillo].
Speaker 1: And she was born?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the, the dates.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, the next sibling.
Speaker 2: The next one was Felipe [Camillo] and, I believe, let's see, Carmen might have born, might have been born in 1931.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because she's, I'm four years younger than she is so that meant that Felipe had to be born in '33 [1933], and I was next in '35 [1935]. Then there was Marvin [Camillo], and he was born in '36 [1936], and then there was Norman [Camillo], and Alvin [Camillo] and Rosita [Camillo Holiday]. That was the youngest one.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I'm not gonna tell you her date of birth because she never tells anyone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: She's still living right?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's the baby of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alvin and Rosita are still living.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where is Alvin today?  What's he doing?
Speaker 2: Alvin lives in Maplewood [New Jersey], he's a skycap at--
Speaker 1: Maplewood?
Speaker 2: New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He's a skycap at Newark [Liberty] International Airport [Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay, and the youngest Rosita?
Speaker 2: Rosita is in Morristown [New Jersey] and she's a retired educator. I say educator because she was a teacher and advisor and a principal. So she ran the gambit.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Your brother Marvin was an actor, director?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Say a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: He founded a troop called La Familia, and, and he used to do performances throughout New York [New York], he also went into the prison systems to put on programs and he did a production of 'Short Eyes.' With Miguel Pinero, before he died and he was quite active in that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Were all of your siblings born in, in Newark [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: All of them were born in Newark.
Story_ID: 275854
Speaker 1: So where did you and your parents [Maggie Kornegay Camillo and Felipe Camillo] and your brothers and sisters live in Newark [New Jersey]?  Where was your first location?
Speaker 2: Our first location was on Somerset Street in Newark and that was where I believe three of us were born, the first three and the middle, one of us Felipe [Camillo], had an accident there which is where he died.  We had a, a bathroom that was out on the porch and he was about four years old and he went out, locked the door and was playing with matches and that's what happened to him, so he died as a very youngster, very young child.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about?
Speaker 2: And we--
Speaker 1: Go 'head.
Speaker 2: We moved from there to Brunswick Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we remained on Brunswick Street forever.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Let me go back to was it Somerset or summer?
Speaker 2: Somerset.
Speaker 1: Somerset.  What was that neighborhood like, how do you view the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I don't really remember the neighborhood because I was only two years old.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So how old were you when you moved to Brunswick then?  You were still quite young?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was still quite young. Yeah.
Speaker 1: What part of Newark was Brunswick located in?
Speaker 2: In the valley, remember I told you there was three sections that I was familiar with and that was in the valley.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  How did the valley--
Speaker 2: And that--
Speaker 1: --differ from the other neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: I think they was kind of segregated into ethnicities.  There were mostly African Americans in, on the hill ar- area, where Somerset Street was. And there were mixed people, African Americans in, like on the block that we lived on in Brunswick Street there was all sorts of people. And then in the neck there were Portuguese and Cape Verdeans and people like that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, tell me--
Speaker 2: And Polish people.
Speaker 1: --tell me about your house.  Tell me about your house on Brunswick, was it?
Speaker 2: My house on Brunswick Street was three stories and it was a brick building and six families lived there and most of the families that were there when we moved there, remained there.  As a matter of fact, I have a brick from that building once they tore it down then I went back to New Jersey long after I had left there I found a brick. And I brought it home to--
Speaker 1: Was it a free standing building?
Speaker 2: It was a free standing building.
Speaker 1: And so your family occupied one of the floors?
Speaker 2: One of th- one floor.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then there were five other families that lived there.
Speaker 1: In the same building?
Speaker 2: In the same building.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, tell me about the surrounding neighborhood?  Around the, this home on Brunswick, what was the neighborhood like, how do you remember it?
Speaker 2: It was all encompassing.  It--well we had, of course, the local grocery store and our elementary school [Miller Street Elementary School, Newark, New Jersey] was in walking distance and as in a lot of the neighborhoods in the city there was a bar on the corner. And, there were two churches, there was a Catholic church [St. Columba's Church, Newark, New Jersey] and there was a small Baptist church around the corner from us. I thought it was a wonderful neighborhood, I had a, my husband [George V. Tankard, Jr.] used to say, I had a charmed childhood. 'Cause we had a real neighborhood because anywhere in the circumference of our area, you could go in any house and get whatever it was you need, whether you needed hug, something to eat, to get warm, especially if your parents weren't home at the time, you could just go and get what you needed. And--but it was also a problem for us as little kids because you could hardly do anything wrong without somebody seeing you.  And so, you were also chastised along the way by the person that saw you, then they would call your parents when they got home and you got it again.  But, still if you, like I said, if you scraped your knee you could go get a Band-Aid from anybody and not have to worry about whose house you were going in--it was, I thought it was a wonderful neighborhood.
Story_ID: 275855
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you and your brothers and sisters do together in the house, out of the house as, as family?  Just the children, what kind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just the children--
Speaker 1: --of things did you guys do together?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have a lot of traffic it seemed and we could get in the middle of the street, we used to play this game, we'd get--we'd draw a big circle in the middle of the street and section it off like a pie and you had a safe circle in the middle and we called it war, amazingly.
Speaker 1: War?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And it was, "I declare war on," each one of us had a country and (laughter) and you di- would declare war on it and you had to get out of your square fast enough so that you didn't get tagged.  So, of course, we always had Japan and Germany and China and, it was a good game though so.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The traffic would stop us from time to time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Being in the city, we didn't have lawns and things, so we would have orange crates and things that we would sit on outside too. And we would play, we played jacks, we played school, if somebody had steps, you would have something in your hand, and they would have to pick, if you chose the right hand with the marble or whatever it was in it, then you moved up in grade.  And so, you moved up on the step, and we played red light, we played marbles, 'cause there was little patches of dirt where we could shoot marbles, we played. That's why my husband [George V. Tankard, Jr.] used to say it was charming, 'cause he had to get out and work early and, and we played as long as we could, we played hide and go seek, and the favorite for boys and girls, mostly the girls though was double-dutch.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  You mentioned the church in your neighborhood, tell me about the religious life of your family and church going.  Were you taken to church as a child?  Was your family in church a lot?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother [Maggie Kornegay Camillo] used to take us to Methodist church which was quite a fa- a distance away from the house, but there was always someone that was driving, we never had a car, there was always someone that was driving so we could get to go.  And when, after, some reason church always fascinated me and when I couldn't get to go there I would just walk around the corner to--there was a Greek Orthodox church also, I forgot about that one, and just, I couldn't understand a thing in, that they were saying, but I would go anyway 'cause it, I just felt comfortable in church.
Speaker 1: Did you go alone or with your brothers--
Speaker 2: I would go--
Speaker 1: --and sisters?
Speaker 2: --Alone sometimes. And as I got older I would go up to Saint James A.M.E. Church on High Street [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard] in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And,--
Speaker 1: Well did--
Speaker 2: --that was an all-day affair.  Because we would go to, I forgot what they, Sunday school, then the, the old ladies would have something to eat for you, then you'd go to choir rehearsal. And then you'd go to regular service and, so.
Speaker 1: Was this a family affair when you went to the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church?  Did all of you go?
Speaker 2: No.  That--I was older then and my sister and my older sister [Carmen Camillo] and I would go.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Just, so your parents were in regular church?
Speaker 2: No they weren't.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Did your parents belong to any other community clubs or programs or agencies?  You've been so involved as we're going to learn as we talk to you.
Speaker 2: My father [Felipe Camillo] wasn't involved in a lot of different things but my, like I said, my mother was involved in whatever was going on in the school system and eventually became a president of the PTA [Parent Teacher Association]. And, she was in the civic organizations in, within the area.  That's how she became an air raid warden.

Speaker 1: What are some of your favorite memories of your family life together in your home?  Were there special times of the year that you especially remember, holiday traditions that your family kind of honored every year?
Speaker 2: Well, Thanksgiving was certainly special and we would always have my [maternal] aunt [Estelle Kornegay] over then. And all of us would be there no matter where we were at the time, we would all be home for Thanksgiving. Christmas was kinda special even though we didn't get a lot of stuff for Christmas because we didn't have much so, one year I'd get a doll and the next year my sister would get a doll or, you know, we'd share a pair of skates and, and we got coloring books and crayons and things like that, but it was still special because we were all there and we had good food to eat.
Speaker 1: Did you and your family make any day trips or do any traveling?  I know you didn't have a car but, were there any places that you used to travel outside of Newark [New Jersey] for day events or weekend events or?
Speaker 2: Well not so much outside of Newark, but my parents [Maggie Kornegay Camillo and Felipe Camillo] had friends that would take us places and we'd go to, there was a park in Newark, Weequahic [Park, Newark, New Jersey], and they had the, the usual barbeque areas and swings and things like that and they would sometimes have little dog races or events that was going on.  They also would take us to down south Jersey to the beach, things like that.
Speaker 1: Wh- what was the name of the beach?
Speaker 2: We would go to Asbury Park [New Jersey], and I think that one of the beaches was Freeport [Hempstead, New York], I can't remember the names of some of them. But there were different areas that we would go to.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now how did you travel around Newark then?  You didn't have a car, how did you move?  Did you walk these places or?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we were all good walkers.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And like I said, sometimes friends would come by and, and take us places, but, our schools, both the high school [South Side High School; Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey] and the elementary school [Miller Street Elementary School, Newark, New Jersey] was in walking distance so that wasn't a problem.  We also had the Cameo Movie Theater [Cameo Theatre, Newark, New Jersey] which was, and the Rialto [Theatre, Newark, New Jersey] which was in walking distance and the neighborhood was quite contained because they--we had lots of stores so, it wasn't much for us to venture out to, to do.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My mother didn't have a big family so, there weren't many relatives to visit.
Speaker 1: Your father didn't have?
Speaker 2: And he didn't have any that we know of.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, just to recapitulate, as we wind down this part of the interview, during this time now, your early childhood, your father was employed where again?
Speaker 2: At Phelps Dodge [Corporation].
Speaker 1: And what did he do there?
Speaker 2: I don't know, he was a laborer.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  This was an automobile factory?  What was this?
Speaker 2: No.  It was a steel factory.
Speaker 1: Steel factory.  Okay, and your mother was doing what kind of work?
Speaker 2: She did some housework for a while.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And she also worked for the [U.S.] Army Air Corps.

Speaker 2: I have a--I think I have a memory, but I don't really think it's my memory.  I think I've heard other people talk about how my brother Felipe [Camillo] taught me to walk and we started--
Speaker 1: How did you, how did he--
Speaker 2: We started on, well we started on the bed and we would plop down and laugh and, and eventually I got the hang of it so that I could finally get to the floor.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But, I don't think I really remember that.  I think I remember them talking about it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Anything else you may remember before kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Nope.

Speaker 1: During the break you said you had a thought about something, what was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there was one other special place that we used to go to as a family, and it was South Orange Mountains Reservation [sic. South Mountain Reservation, Essex County, New Jersey] and that was a real family thing and family and friends would come and, and there would always be a softball game and the men would cook the barbeque and the, you know.
Speaker 1: Was this, this was a family event or not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a family event.
Speaker 1: Or church or anything?
Speaker 2: A family event, but we would do that--
Speaker 1: How did you get there?
Speaker 2: --like on the Fourth of July or--it was--
Speaker 1: Where was this place?  How far?
Speaker 2: --special.  It's in South Orange, New Jersey [sic.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was quite a ways away, but there was always someone like I said with a vehicle that we'd all pile in and, that was also a Tankard and a Camillo venture.
Story_ID: 278250
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up in, in Newark [New Jersey]?  What sights, sounds (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I have a second bathroom and in it there were shelves, lots of shelves and they're open and I have my linens and some dolls and all sorts of things in there and we had a bathroom like that in, on Newark, on Bruns- on Brunswick Street.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, that bathroom reminds me of home.  Also my sister when she comes, she goes in, and she says yep, this seems like home.  Sweet potato pie is the best smell on earth, my mother [Maggie Kornegay Camillo] made great sweet potato pies and so every time I make them, I think of home. I can't think of any specific sounds though, nope.
Speaker 1: Your mother liked to cook?  Or she, she had six children so I guess she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, she liked to cook. She wasn't the great, greatest cook, but she, she could cook.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  There were some things that she was better at then others like me.
Speaker 1: Any other memories of growing up that you haven't shared so far?
Speaker 2: Well there were lots and lots and lots of kids in the neighborhood and some of them we still maintain a friendship right now. My very best friend, Mary Lewis [ph.], I met in kindergarten and I just got a letter from her the other day when we're in (unclear).  And when we, I go back to my high school reunions, we always meet up and it's, it's funny how that happens when we, we all fall back into the same little group that we were in in high school [South Side High School; Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey] at the reunion. Just seems to happen that way.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  You mentioned in connection with the South Orange [New Jersey], East Orange [New Jersey] events, family event--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The Tankard family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were they neighbors of yours or?
Speaker 2: Yes they were, they lived right around the corner from us.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Tell me about the Tankard family then, as you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't know them as I was growing up, I met George [V. Tankard, Jr.] as a, when he just came out of the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Some of my brothers and sisters knew them but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was older and I was working at the time, I had graduated high school and was working.
Speaker 1: I see.  But they did attend the East Orange?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.  My brother Alvin [Camillo] went to school with a couple of the Tankard girls and he would go around on their porch and George would come out and say, "Boy, you're cute, if you have a sister as cute as you, bring her around here to meet me."  (Laughter) You know, Alvin never would tell me that though, I le--I learned about that much, much later. We all went to Miller Street [Elementary] School [Newark, New Jersey] and that's where--
Speaker 1: Well did you know George's your husband's mother, Mrs. [Audria Thomas] Tankard?  Did you know her when you?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  I didn't know, I hadn't even seen her or his dad [George V. Tankard, Sr.].
Story_ID: 278251
Speaker 1: When did you start your formal education?  What grade and what school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well, I started kindergarten at the age of five and it was Miller Street [Elementary] School in Newark [New Jersey] and I graduated from there in 1949, and I went to South Side High School [Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey], and I graduated there in 1953.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Who was your kindergarten teacher?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mrs. Townley and she was--
Speaker 1: What do you remember about her?
Speaker 2: I remember that she was stern but fair.
Speaker 1: And tell me more about elementary school, how many grades were there?  If the--
Speaker 2: There were eight grades. And we had teachers from everywhere, our teachers didn't live in the area.  They seemed to live out in the suburbs and things and we had a variety of teachers, a lot of them were Jewish so we got the Jewish holidays which were fun.  There was one teacher that I used to like for a long time when I had her, I believed that she was my fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Finkelstein [ph.] and my mom [Maggie Kornegay Camillo] used to do a lot of sewing and she would make most of my clothes and Mrs. Finkelstein hired my mom to sew for her daughter and I didn't like that too much because I thought that was special for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: But your mother was getting paid.
Speaker 2: That's right, she was getting paid so I couldn't argue with that too much.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, tell me more about your memories of elementary school at the, it's at the Miller School right?
Speaker 2: Miller Street.
Speaker 1: Mill--oh, Mill Street.
Speaker 2: Miller Street.
Speaker 1: Miller Street, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: M-I-L-L-E-R.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What other memories do you have of being at the Miller Street School?
Speaker 2: Well I remember we had an elocution class that I should have really paid attention to because I'm not the world's greatest talker, I don't like to do it and I remember we had to go in the auditorium and we had to learn different poems and how to speak and how to carry yourself and you have to go up on stage and do the Gettysburg Address and all sorts of things and I hated that class.  But I really should have paid attention to it because it would be beneficial to me now.
Story_ID: 278252
Speaker 1: And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Any particular teacher that was especially influential during your elementary school?  Anybody stands out as being particularly influential?
Speaker 1: None that I can think of.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  What kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 1: Huh, quiet, bashful.  If you wanted me to write a paper I could do that, you want five pages?  I'll give you ten, I'll give you pictures, I'll have a nice cover for it, the whole works, but raising my hand in class was a problem for me.  I was a good student, I got decent grades.
Speaker 2: What did you like about school?
Speaker 1: I loved school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of it?
Speaker 1: I loved all of it. As a matter of fact, I got a certificate for having perfect attendance.  They made a special one because they had (laughter), I hated to miss school, I just wouldn't miss it and luckily I was healthy enough so that that I didn't have to miss it in that way.
Speaker 2: Now your mother [Maggie Kornegay Camillo] was involved in the school was that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she--
Speaker 2: Tell me about her involvement in the school.
Speaker 1: Well, she would involve, she would volunteer, classroom monitors and things like that and she would, she became, like I said, president of the PT- Parent Teacher Association--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: And what were her activities?  Do you remember if she had meetings, you know, how or what, what they did as parents there?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, they had meetings at the, at the school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the parents were invited and, and like they do now at the schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now what was the racial ethnic makeup of the Miller Street [Elementary] School [Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 1: Oh boy, I'm trying to think, there weren't many blacks in the school system, certainly not in the administrative part of it and there weren't many as students either, they were, it was predominately a Jewish neighborhood.
Speaker 2: This is Brunswick Street now?
Speaker 1: This is, yes. Predominately a Jewish neighborhood.  Actually when we start--when the African Americans started moving in, shall we say, they started moving out of course, but many of them stayed. Many of them stayed.
Speaker 2: Well this would happen when, before World War II [WWII] or after?  You were born in '35 [1935]?
Speaker 1: Thiryt-five [1935].
Speaker 2: All right, and so you're in the Miller Street School, kindergarten, roughly 1940.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We're into World War I--
Speaker 1: One--
Speaker 2: --World War II--
Speaker 1: --two.
Speaker 2: Now when did this transition take place in the neighborhood, do you recall?
Speaker 1: The transition of?
Speaker 2: Well, from predominately Jewish to more people--
Speaker 1: More people of--
Speaker 2: --Of color?
Speaker 1: --color? In the late '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But it never went completely to the people of color. Because m- many of the shop owners of course were white and they remained. And many of our neighbors did too. I don't know whether they didn't wanna move or they couldn't move but they were there still.
Story_ID: 278253
Speaker 1: So, you graduated from the Miller Street [Elementary] School [Newark, New Jersey] at what grade level?
Speaker 2: Eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Eighth grade?  And where did you go next?  What was the next step?
Speaker 2: I went to South Side High School [Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And where was that located in the city?
Speaker 2: That was still in the valley, I can't think of what's, I don't remember the street it was on.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  As you entered high school, you were what thirteen, fourteen roughly, did you have any ideas about your dreams about what you wanted to be later on?  Did you have any career goals or things you thought you wanted to prepare for at that young age?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  Before that, I wanted to be a nurse and that was before my brother Marvin [Camillo] got scarlet fever and came home from the hospital all peeling and, I didn't like that.  But going into high school I didn't have any specific ideas as to what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Well, tell me about high school.  What was it like for you?  What do you remember there as (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I had lots of good teachers there.  And I liked high school as well as I liked elementary school.  I didn't do too much in extracurricular activities because I was the second oldest at the time and I had to get home from school and help out.  I would, you know, get dinner started before my mom [Maggie Kornegay Camillo] got home from work and, and things like that.  But, my fondest memories was when I decided that I wanted to take a shop class, and that was a big idea and I--the only problem with it, shop classes were down in the basement and of course there was mostly boys down there so that was a little fearful, but I stuck it out.  And then I wanted to try printing.
Speaker 1: So that was your first shop class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my first shop class and I made a little--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --bookends.
Speaker 1: --were you an exception then?
Speaker 2: I was an exception then.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and they didn't give you any grief over?
Speaker 2: No they didn't. They didn't, I was surprised.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the printing, what did you do?  What was the first thing you printed?
Speaker 2: What did I print?  I--it was mostly practice, so it was just--I did a letter once. A--and I did this paper, I don't remember what the paper was about and I was so proud of it because after I set it all up and I looked at it and it just looked so perfect and after I printed it, way in the middle of it, was an upside down B, just one (laughter).
Speaker 1: This was printing when you would take each character?--
Speaker 2: Take each character--
Speaker 1: --and place it into, I forgot what they call it, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but place it--
Speaker 2: They were--
Speaker 1: --one by--
Speaker 2: --little silver things and we'd place each one by one by one.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  That was my experience too.  Did you take any other shop classes besides printing?
Speaker 2: (Pause) The other shop class that I took was in wood working and I made bookends.
Story_ID: 278254
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school [South Side High School; Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey]?  Or did you have a favorite subject, something that you really was especially fond of?
Speaker 2: I liked art. I liked my art class and my art teacher. I liked gym.  I didn't like home economics, I still don't like home economics. I liked my steno class, my hardest subject was math though.
Speaker 1: Mathematics?
Speaker 2: Mathematics, and I always needed extra help. And I would search out that help because I knew it was important and I have come to know even help, much more it is important, your whole life is numbers, you got social security numbers and telephone numbers and so.
Speaker 1: Did you have a second language to deal with, were there foreign languages or?
Speaker 2: No, that was another mistake of mine, I really should have gotten a second language.  Couple of my brothers and sisters did, but I never did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So, high school was fine, it was uneventful?  Or were there any special events that you remember about high school?
Speaker 2: We used to have lots of 'em, like school dances and football games and things like that, I attended those things, although I wasn't like I said, a big part of them, I would attend all of them. And I went to my fiftieth high school reunion two years ago, no, last year and that was fun.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I have one coming up next month and some of us have been on the phone, and I guess, they're only three of us.
Speaker 2: Oh really?  There was--
Speaker 1: Of the class yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: I can, actually it was four or five, so I think the four of us are going, we went twenty-five years ago.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we said we're not gonna go again but--
Speaker 2: Well there were more blacks in our high school then there was in our elementary school--
Speaker 1: There was?
Speaker 2: --because we had the group from the other part of the city that I knew, the hill, which was predominately black.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Did you walk to high school or did you--?
Speaker 2: I walked.  I certainly did.
Speaker 1: How long did it take, how long, how far away was it?
Speaker 2: About twenty minutes.
Speaker 1: Twenty minutes?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a good walk.
Speaker 2: It's a good walk, but it, it wasn't so bad.
Story_ID: 278255
Speaker 1: When you graduated, when you were a senior, and about to graduate [from South Side High School; Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey] what were your aspirations at that point?  What were your plans?
Speaker 2: To go get a job, just to get a job.  I unfortunately, our guidance counselors weren't that great.  I didn't know how to get into college, I didn't know that you went and visited schools and that you could get scholarships and things, nobody told me that.  I thought that someone, some representative from the colleges came to each high school and would look at records and see well this student is an A student or this student has this potential and so on and then they would ask you, (laughter), so, college wasn't one of my thoughts.  It was just going to work and making some money.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Had you worked during high school?  I know you said you would go home after school to prepare the meals for your parents [Maggie Kornegay Camillo and Felipe Camillo] and your brothers and sisters but did you have any jobs during school or during the summer?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  The only jobs I did was babysitting.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that was it 'cause most of the shops and stores in the neighborhood were family owned and run and so they, they didn't have the kind of jobs that we have here for the children.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, I told you about the job I had with my job dad at the bowling alley and so that was about it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, no you didn't tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I told you my father had a shoe shine concession at--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay,
Speaker 2: --the local bowling alley.
Speaker 1: All right, yeah, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was your first job after high school?  What did you do that summer?
Speaker 2: Well I tried to get into GE [General Electric] where everyone was, was getting hired it seemed like because there was lots of money to be made there and I didn't know at the time, I wasn't quite eighteen so, I didn't get hired at any of those kind of jobs but I did get a job with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in Newark [New Jersey].  And, I really kind of challenged them because they wanted everywhere, they also wanted experience and I just became so very frustrated.  So in my interview I said, "Well how do you get experience if you don't give me a chance?"
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the woman liked that and she hired me and that was my first job, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: And what was the position?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: I was a clerk typist and I learned lots of--
Speaker 1: Had you taken typing in high school?
Speaker 2: I took typing in high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you got that--
Speaker 2: I took a business course in high school so I had that preparatory stuff already.
Speaker 1: Your high school course was a business course?
Speaker 2: Was a business course. So I already knew how to do lots of things and, and that was the other, my other explanation to her, I said I know how to do all of that stuff because I've done it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you take shorthand in high school?
Speaker 2: I took shorthand in high school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Did you find that useful at Liberty?
Speaker 2: I did find it useful at Liberty.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  What department did you work in?  Any special department at Liberty or home insurance or car insurance or is it?
Speaker 2: I was mostly car insurance.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  How long did you stay at Liberty?
Speaker 2: I was at Liberty for two years.
Story_ID: 278256
Speaker 1: At what point did you first meet George [V.] Tankard [Jr.] who was your husband?  Did it happen during high school, after high school [South Side High School; Malcolm X Shabazz High School, Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: After high school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Tell me about meeting him, going with George and marrying George, when did all this happen?
Speaker 2: Well, my brother [Alvin Camillo] was invited to a party at the house, at George's house and he remembered what George had said to him so he asked me if I wanted to go and reluctantly I did go and that's where I met George. At his own, very own house at his own party that he had given for his brother who had just come home from the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Oh I see.  And what was his brother's name?
Speaker 2: Reggie [Reginald Tankard].
Speaker 1: Reggie?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What happened at the party between the two of you?
Speaker 2: Well I knew almost everybody there but him and another young man that was interested in me, (laughter) introduced us, Harold. And George said to Harold, "Well now how interested are you?  (Laughter) Because if you're not gonna talk to her, I am," and so he, Harold introduced us and we just began talking and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What year was George Tankard born?

Speaker 2: He was not in the service that long either.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I believe he was working in a grocery store.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And so you--how long was your courtship and when were you married?
Speaker 2: The courtship wasn't very long.  The courtship lasted about ten months and we were married (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what year were you married?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Story_ID: 278257
Speaker 1: You said you stayed at Liberty Mutual [Insurance Company] for two years.  What was your next work?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a space in between there because a year after we were married my oldest daughter was born. And then after that I went to Internal Revenue [Service (IRS)], and that was supposed to be a temporary position.  I went during the tax season and I was there for three years and then I didn't, I had a little temporary office positions from time to time and that was--I didn't work that much until I came here.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now what was George [Tankard's husband, George V. Tankard, Jr.] doing for an occupation during this time?
Speaker 2: George worked at various places trying to find his way.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And finally he went to work for General Motors [GM] in Linden, New Jersey, and he was there for a long time before we moved here.

Speaker 2: Um-hm, Hayes Home?  Would you spell that?
Speaker 1: H-A-Y-E-S.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, okay.  And who was living with you when you lived at his home?  Who else, was anybody else there?
Speaker 1: At his parents' house?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: His parents and some of his siblings.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, okay.  So you're with Internal Revenue and you said you went to work where?  Oh, in Linden?
Speaker 1: In Linden, New Jersey--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to General Motors. And he was on the assembly line and his job was to get in the back of the car on his knees and put a rubber strip around the window before the window went in and then he'd have to jump off and get to the next one and he worked nights.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  Did he have another job during the day or?
Speaker 1: Not at that time. But he has had various jobs.  He also took a class in cosmetology and he did hair for a while.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so he was quite enterprising.
Speaker 1: Yes he was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: --and where they are now?  What are they doing now?
Speaker 2: Well Carmen [Amadeo] is my oldest daughter and she was born in 1955, and right now she's here with me since her dad died last year, and she's working for the steamship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you your second child was born when?
Speaker 2: The second child is Linda [Gonsalves] and she was born in 1956 and I don't know the name of the company [Benthos, Inc.] that she works for but she work for a company in Falmouth [Massachusetts] and she describes her job as she makes the ping that goes in the black box when there's an airplane accident and they hunt for the black box, and they have this ping, that sound, that's what she makes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then there's Stephanie [Earl] and she was born in '58 [1958], and she lives in Kansas and she's a school teacher and she teaches special ed [special education].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then there's George [V. Tankard, III] and he's in Louisiana, he was born in '59 [1959], and he's a merchant marine.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.--
Speaker 2: And there's Craig [Tankard], and he's with me at the moment, he was born in 1960 and he's a house painter and an entertainer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All but Felipe and Craig. They, they started school here.
Story_ID: 278259
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the move from Newark [New Jersey] to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  Why did you come here and what prompted that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was in 1967, when they had the riots in Newark and we realized then that it just wasn't a place to bring up children.  The, the day before the riot, it--that was in August of '67 [1967], it just seemed eerily quiet in the neighborhood and it was usually a very busy and very noisy neighborhood and we didn't know what was going on, what was happening.  It turns out, that something was going on at the police station near our house and the next day, the riot broke out. That was scary.  The girls were h- here on the Vineyard visiting their grandmother, Mrs. [Audria Thomas] Tankard and the boys were home with us because many times it was just aggravating for me to pack all of the children up and send them here.  So I would keep the little ones home and let the older ones come and visit.
Story_ID: 277957
Speaker 1: We were talking about the, the urban riot in Newark [New Jersey], 1967.  What was going on in the City of Newark the year before or right around that time in terms of racial relations?  What was life like for you and other black families in Newark before the riot?
Speaker 2: I don't know, it seems to me there were problems, well of course there was th- the local government was corrupt as in most places, but seems to me there were problems with the industry moving out of the city.  Like there used to be Ronson [Consumer Products Corporation; Ronson International Limited] from, from the lighter people and GE [General Electric] and, they were just all moving and no one seemed to know why and that created a lot of job loss which always creates a problem and--
Speaker 1: Were there problems in the schools?  Do you remember much about the school system?  Was that?
Speaker 2: Not in my, in particular school that my children were going to. It seemed to be pretty good, but in some of the other t- schools there was a lot of racial problems.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, so there were some school of racial problems, there was increasing unemployment (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unemp- oh unemployment was--
Speaker 1: Unemployment and--
Speaker 2: --terrible.
Speaker 1: --and the government---
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that was perhaps not providing city services too?
Speaker 2: Exactly--
Speaker 1: To people?
Speaker 2: --they weren't, they weren't, there were houses across the street from the projects that we lived in that were just falling apart. And, it was always blamed on the people that lived there, but they never thought about the landlords that stopped providing the services and repairing these properties and things that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, well where you and your family were living, who owned the property that you were in at the time?
Speaker 2: This was government housing.
Speaker 1: You were at Hayes Home project [Reverend William P. Hayes Homes, Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Hayes Home projects.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Which is was government housing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How close were you to the police station where the--
Speaker 2: One block away, exactly one--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --block away.
Speaker 1: So when things erupted you were right in the center of it?
Speaker 2: Right in the center of it--
Speaker 1: What was--
Speaker 2: --and one, my oldest son [George V. Tankard, III] was out as he always was, he was a wanderer and--
Speaker 1: --tell me about--
Speaker 2: --I walked around looking for him and someone had, oh I just saw him a little while ago, or someone saw him an hour ago.  But, and then I stopped worrying because he always came home before dark and he did that day. So I was grateful and just when it turned dark is when the trouble started, we hard all this loud noise and someone overturned the car and, and it was just terrible.
Speaker 1: How'd you feel at that moment?  Do you remember how you felt--
Speaker 2: Frightened.
Speaker 1: --at that moment when things started to erupt and how'd you feel?
Speaker 2: I wished we were all here on the vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was just so frightened and--
Speaker 1: What did you?
Speaker 2: I began--
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: --I didn't know what was gonna happen, so I began gathering all of my important papers together and things like that and keeping the kids quiet and as the night went on it really got very bad. Fires were set and you could hear the glass breaking where they were breaking into st--
Speaker 1: What floor were you on in?
Speaker 2: I was on the third floor, which is actually the fourth floor in the, in the building because they would say ground floor and then one, two, three and we could hear shooting, so we gathered the children and kept them away from the windows and I ha- one of my friends was unfortunate, she reached up to grab one of her children, ch- and she lived on the thirteenth floor and was shot through the neck because by then the, the troopers and everybody had come into the city. And I still continued, I packed a big bag, a big duffel bag, packed up my children and my important papers and we all left early that morning and went to Roselle [New Jersey] to George's brother's [Reginald Tankard] house.
Speaker 1: The following morning?
Speaker 2: The following morning 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, where wa- wher--
Speaker 2: --we couldn't get out that night--
Speaker 1: --where was George [V. Tankard, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: --it was just--
Speaker 1: --at this point?
Speaker 2: --too dangerous.
Speaker 1: While you were gathering things together where was Ge--
Speaker 2: He was, he was there with me--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and the children, and between the two of us, we just kept them down away from the windows and we talked and we--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now how did you get to his brother's house?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: In the morning it was a little bit calm and so we were able to get out.  We had a, George had a vehicle so that wasn't a problem. And we just slipped out early, early, bright and early that morning. And just left town and left it all behind.
Story_ID: 277958
Speaker 1: So how far (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we kept--
Speaker 1: --away did you go to Roselle?
Speaker 2: We went to Roselle, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: How far away was that [from Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Oh, Ro- Roselle may be a hundred miles away [sic.].
Speaker 1: Oh, so it was a little trip then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a little trip.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But it was well worth it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How wide--
Speaker 2: And we--
Speaker 1: --spread in the hill neighborhood was the, was the riot?  I mean, you were right in the center or it.
Speaker 2: Right in the center of it.
Speaker 1: But how--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how big a area are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Actually they didn't, it didn't spread around the great area which was so annoying because they were tearing up their own neighborhood. But it was in maybe six blocks. Didn't go out of the area at all.
Speaker 1: Do you know what the incident was at the police station that?
Speaker 2: Well, they said some man [John Weerd Smith] had been beaten by the police. But I don't know, we don't know that might have been just an excuse.
Speaker 1: How long did this last?
Speaker 2: It lasted three days.
Speaker 1: Three days?
Speaker 2: Three days.
Speaker 1: Who was the mayor then?  You recall?
Speaker 2: I believe it was [Hugh] Addonizio, I think his name was Addonizio.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  Well, then what?  After three days things I guess settled down a bit?
Speaker 2: They settled down a bit.
Speaker 1: Wh- what did you and your family do--
Speaker 2: And they started cleaning--
Speaker 1: --at that point?
Speaker 2: --up the streets and things like that.  Well, we came back home and stayed in contact by phone with the girls [Tankard's daughters] and Mrs. [Audria Thomas] Tankard took that they were, you could see it on the news, they wanted to know if we were okay and everything.  And the p- where we went in Roselle, was George's brother's [Reginald Tankard] house so, that was quite comforting.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, we just came back home, cleaned up and, I guess George [V. Tankard, Jr.] started thinking that, we had to get out of there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] was the only other place that we knew because--
Speaker 1: Now what month is this again where?
Speaker 2: This is in August.
Speaker 1: August.
Speaker 2: When the riot--
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 2: And by October, George decided, we're outta here. And it was a little sad for me because Ge- at least--George's family was already here with the exception of his brother. All of my family was still in [New] Jersey, all of my lifelong friendships, all of the things that I was involved in, so I wasn't really quite ready to move.  But he moved and took his children, so I followed along.  (Laughter) And--
Speaker 1: Now how long had his mother, Mrs. Tankard and was Mr. Tankard here too or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how long had they been living on the island, your in-laws?
Speaker 2: My--they moved here in 1959.
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what brought them to the island?
Speaker 2: There was a song, 'Ole' Cape Cod' ['Old Cape Cod'] by Patti Page that my mother-in-law loved and she used to s- sing it all the time and listen to it on the radio and some friends of hers had come to the Vineyard and told her about it and I had been to Cape Cod [Massachusetts] with the family I worked as a mothers helper one year, so I knew a little bit about Cape Cod, and I talked about it.  And finally, she came on vacation with one of her daughters and then she said she wanted to move here and eventually they did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, so you had some family roots here?
Speaker 2: So I did have some family roots here. Although, by the time we got here, her children were mostly grown, many of them had moved from the island and she even moved for a short time after we came for a little while, she moved to Hyannis [Massachusetts].  So, but we did have a little bit of family roots here when we came.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What occupations did your in-laws have before you came?  What were they doing on the island?
Speaker 2: My father-in-law [George V. Tankard, Sr.] was a truck driver. So he didn't live here permanently.  He would come on weekends, but my mother-in-law wasn't working at the time when she first moved here, but she did do some house cleaning and things like that for a while.
Speaker 1: What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chambermaid-ing.
Story_ID: 277959
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about the move in October.  You arrive here [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] and what happened?  Where did you stay?  What, what did, what did you and George [V. Tankard, Jr.] do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We arrived here with six children, a couple of pieces of furniture and we met Mrs. Caves [ph.].  George had come ahead of time, and found a place for us to stay down here on New York Avenue, and he hadn't quite found work yet though. And this was in October, and in November it started getting quite cold and my children started getting very disappointed because they had only been here summers.  They thought they were coming to the tropics I guess, and they were disappointed when it started to get so cold here.  And we lived there until the end of May and Mrs. Caves announced that we would either pay triple rent, or we would have to move because as you know in the summer, people get summer rentals and they, they can make a lot of money. In the meantime, I had met Mrs. Lambert [ph.].  She discovered that I liked to sew too, so she was getting on in age and she would, she made slip covers and they were quite heavy and drapes and so she would ask me to help her to hang them. And I did some sewing for her and all, and--
Speaker 1: Well, going back to Mrs. Caves residence on New York Ave.  Where you the only family in there?  Was she around during the winter too?
Speaker 2: It was a one family house.  She was a--she was around during the winter but not in that house--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --she had several houses including this one.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Including where you are now?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right so, you met Mrs. Lambert and then you were forced to move so, go head.
Speaker 2: So she offered a couple of rooms at her house for us to stay and, that was quite, quite heroic of her because to take on six children and--
Speaker 1: Was she alone at the time?
Speaker 2: She was alone at the time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And who was Mrs. Lambert?  Just so we all know that.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Lambert is just a woman that I met. That I was introduced to and she made what she called removable slip covers for people and I don't know very much about Mrs. Lambert, except that--
Speaker 1: But she certainly was instrumental in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But she was--
Speaker 1: --help--in helping you too acclimate to this place and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I understand there was, there's some history at her house.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had visited there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --from time to time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Martin Luther King?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think he summered here in '63 [1963] for a week or so. And that's where they stayed.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He and Coretta [Scott King] and the children.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he was planning to come back I think in '64 [1964], but the civil rights activities caught--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --him up.  And I don't think he did come back.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 277960
Speaker 1: So Mrs. Cave [ph.] had property here where you are now [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that move.
Speaker 2: And as it turned out some workmen were here.  She was trying to get this place also ready for the summer and somehow they say the plumber left a spark somewhere and the house caught on fire and so she offered it to us and we paid twelve hundred dollars for this house which we didn't have at that time either. But we were able to borrow a few hundred dollars from my mother [Maggie Kornegay Camillo] and a few people and put a deposit on it so that we could get it and--
Speaker 1: How big was the house at the time?
Speaker 2: The house was quite small it was the living room, the kitchen, two small bedrooms and the reason they blamed it on the plumber, the fire on the plumber I believe is because the bathroom was quite burned so, we didn't really have a bathroom.  And while we were at Mrs. Caves house, George [V. Tankard, Jr.] would come home every day and come here and work and on the weekends we'd all come and clean and do what we could do.  And that was an adventure because at the time George had no tools except for some antiquated things, a saw, and a hammer and whatever and there was no electricity so even if he had fancy tools, he wouldn't be able to use them, there was no water.  And after two months though we had gotten it cleaned up enough so that we could move in, we still didn't have electricity and we had water that came in from the street, but not to the toilet yet so we had to use various potties and things for a while.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now this is the summer of, I guess, 1968?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968]. And the children were funny, no electricity, we had kerosene lamps and things so, they were so close to each other and they never would go upstairs by themselves, they'd go up two by twos when it was time for bed and in the morning, many times I'd find them all piled into one bed, (laughter) one bed and they were quite good until the electric, we finally got electricity put in and then the fighting started about the TV and whose watching what and s- children are the same everywhere I guess.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now George, in terms of employment, well what did your husband do at that point to, since--
Speaker 2: George would--
Speaker 1: --he was working on the house but what was his first--
Speaker 2: He worked from pillar to post, fighting his way. He worked on a cesspool truck once, he did masonry, he did masonry with, I believe Mr. [Carlos] Pena's in your book ['African-Americans on Martha's Vineyard & Nantucket: A history of people, places, and events,' Robert C. Hayden]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He worked for him for a while and he worked with various painting companies until the--that went on for about eight to ten years and he decided, I think I can do this on my own and I think he found a ladder from somewhere and he had had a couple of paint brushes because he had been using them here and he bought another one and finally started his own business out of his car.
Speaker 1: And so he had a painting contracting business for a number of years?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: --he did, for about twenty-eight, twenty-nine years I believe.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Before he retired.  But through that, that was a little hard getting started because he had to start with friend, friends and family and you don't make much money on them.  But eventually a friend turned him onto a big job and I believe the cottages was his biggest j- was his first big job and from there he got recommended for other jobs and things.
Speaker 1: Is the present headquarters of The Cottagers [Inc.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The present--yeah, The Cottagers--
Speaker 1: --over in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah that's part of, part of the history that I've seen too.
Story_ID: 277961
Speaker 1: You started your career, your professional working career here [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Soon after you got here?
Speaker 2: Soon after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What, where did--
Speaker 2: --I got here.
Speaker 1: --you find employment?
Speaker 2: Well I had a friend that was working for Doctor Moses Strock who is Peter Strock's father, who I worked for, for most of the time.
Speaker 1: Could--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --you spell the last name Strock?
Speaker 2: --S- S-T-R-O-C-K.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And Eleanor [ph.] was about to have a baby and she was trying to find a replacement and she called one day and said, "You know how to type and st--." I said, "Sure," and she said, "Well, I need a replacement for Doctor Strock's office," so I went and got interviewed and got hired and first year, it was basically reception work and typing and things like that.  And then one day, Doctor Strock's father got very busy and he asked me to come into the operatory and he would show me how to do things and I started suctioning and all, I learned on the job. And years later when Doctor Moses died, his son Peter took over and I started working for him and he then would send me to take different classes with special things and thirty-three years later (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You did what?
Speaker 2: I retired (laughter).
Speaker 1: Retired, all right.  So you were a dental?
Speaker 2: I was a dental assistant.
Speaker 1: Dental assistant?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where did you take classes?  You had said you'd studied, where did you go to classes?
Speaker 2: I had radiology classes at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], I had periodontal disease class at, I think, Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], I went to Tufts University [Medford, Massachusetts] for a few classes and root canal therapy and.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So did this certify you as a dental technician or assistant or it just gave you the skills and knowledge?
Speaker 2: Just gave me the skills and knowledge--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --it didn't certify me.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so you did that full time for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did that full time for thirty-three years.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  What did you like about that work?
Speaker 2: I liked the people that came, I liked the people that I worked with and for, especially in the summer, 'cause you would find people with emergencies from anywhere in the world that we might have to tend to, we sometimes had stars and superstars come.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: Ted Danson and his wife had to bring her nephew once with an emergency.  We had one of the Roosevelts, Rose Styron, Art Buchwald, they just lived up the street from the, the dentist office anyway and I think they were kind of friendly with Doctor Strock also through the yacht club and things like that.  He was a sailor.  He is a sailor.
Story_ID: 277962
Speaker 1: Now all the time that you worked as a dental technician assistant, thirty plus years, you were involved in a wide range of civic and community organizations and activities, I hardly know were, were to start.  But this is an important part of your life and you've made some tremendous contributions to the entire island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts], a whole range of fronts. So, we wanna, we wanna take a look at those.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You were, what I call, a community developer.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Not, not building buildings and bridges--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but, building people and (unclear) people together.
Speaker 2: I've never been described as that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 2: --but that's okay.
Speaker 1: --that's how I see it.  But, tell me about, you have your family here, you've got them in school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you have a full time job in the healthcare area.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your husband is in the painting business.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was your very first community involvement or activity?  Do you recall how you stepped out and what you, what you did outside the home and your work, your paid work?
Speaker 2: I somehow got involved in this welfare rights group.  I met, what was her name?  Betty [ph.], can't remember her last name, through George [V. Tankard, Jr.] and his work and she was a welfare care advocate and they had a demonstration downtown at the welfare office.
Speaker 1: This was downtown where?
Speaker 2: Downtown Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Oak Bluffs.
Speaker 2: It used to be down there, yeah.  Advocating for people that, that needed welfare and was not getting it.
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: And I sat--
Speaker 1: --was your--
Speaker 2: --in with that group (laughter).  I didn't have any specific job but I was just--she wanted bodies there and so I was one of the bodies that volunteered.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the results of the sit-ins or the protest, or whatever it was?
Speaker 2: It was a protest and they got what they wanted.
Speaker 1: And what role did you play?
Speaker 2: Like I said, I was just one of the bodies on, in the group that, that sat there. Until they were heard.
Speaker 1: I see.  What were some of the other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was always involved in, in the school when my children went there, I was always in and out to find out what was going on and what wasn't going on and what was needed and what wasn't needed. At the bottom of our hill here, was a, was a deep hole and every time it rained it would fill up and my children would come home from lunch and I'd have to change all of their clothing and stuff because they were sopping wet. And I went to the school one day to find out if they had a lunchroom and they said, "Well no we don't have a lunchroom."  I said, "You have any kind of a setup that, you know, for children to that--to eat their lunch at school even though you don't have a cafeteria" and they said, "No."  And then, I went looking through some ordinances and trying to find out, 'cause it seemed to me that they w- should have someplace for children.  And I did find out that they did have a room within the school that some of the children who lived further away, that did take a little bus into the elementary school [Oak Bluffs School, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts], that they had their lunch and I found out through the records that they were in non-compliance with the law.  The law said that you had to make a place and so, I presented this at school committee meeting, Doctor Rappaport was the chairman at the time and his remarks to me were, "How dare you come from Newark [New Jersey] with your attitudes and try to tell us what to do."  And I'd say, "Well you're not in compliance with the laws," and, he said, "Well take it up next year, I won't even be here, my wife will be on the board."  In the meantime, someone at the school committee or at the school must have discovered what I discovered and realized that they had to do something.  So, the next year, it was put in and so, if I wanted to, I could send my children to school with a sandwich or something, so on rainy days I did--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so that they wouldn't have to make that trek because some days I wasn't here.
Story_ID: 277963
Speaker 1: Where was the Oak Bluffs Elementary School [Oak Bluffs School, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] at that point?
Speaker 2: On, it's where the town hall is now.
Speaker 1: Oh, on School Street?
Speaker 2: On School Street.
Speaker 1: That's where the elementary?
Speaker 2: That's where the ele- yeah they had two buildings.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: One, the first building went to the seventh, sixth grade and then you would go across the street to the seventh and eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And your children and others would walk from this area too, they'd walk to school and back?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so, welfare activities and--and school deficiencies and activism, did you continue working with the schools anyway?  Did you hold any positions or?
Speaker 2: No I didn't hold any positions at the Oak Bluffs School. But, if they needed classroom monitors or volunteers to go on school trips and things like that, I would do that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Well were you ever active in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] here?
Speaker 2: Not in the PTA here.  They did--the PTA didn't come along on, in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] for many years later and all of my children were out of the school by then.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  But what, you weren't you a PTA president a little later on?
Speaker 2: I was a PTA president in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Oh, in Newark?
Speaker 2: In Newark.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: At their elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about your early activities again here in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  You just mentioned two.  What other things did you get involved with early on?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a den mother for the Cub Scouts. That didn't last very long. It was when my two youngest boys [Craig Tankard and Felipe Tankard] were involved in the scouts and, what else did I do?
Speaker 1: Well tell me about when you first got involved with the Martha's Vineyard branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, because right now you hold the position of vice president--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and you've had that position for thirty plus years.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So tell us about the early NAACP work.
Speaker 2: Well, when I first came, I did--was just a card carrying member, I didn't really get involved because my children were so little and I didn't--when I came home from work I was home from work, I wasn't going out to meetings and things at night.  So, then my first position there was secretary, assistant secretary because the secretary had just left so I, I did that for a little bit and then I, I became vice president and--
Speaker 1: In what year?
Speaker 2: I believe it was '68 [1968], or '69 [1969]? And I've been vice president ever since. There were several times when I've had to be acting president when the president was away or one moved away and many times they would go away on vacation and things like that so.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Were--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --you involved with the NAACP in Newark?
Speaker 2: No I wasn't.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, just, you were just a member?
Speaker 2: Just a paid--
Speaker 1: Paid member?
Speaker 2: --member, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now, you are also a historian of the, with the NAACP and, and other things on the island--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In the late '60s [1960s], of course [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, was the branch just being formed then?  Or had it been around?  Or what was the status of the branch here at that time?
Speaker 2: During the early '60s [1960s], they were trying to form a branch here and it just wasn't working and they, with, with a part of the Cape Cod [Massachusetts] branch, and it wasn't until the assassination of Dr. King that it really got going.
Story_ID: 275876
Speaker 1: Could you give us a brief accounting of the development of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] in the early '60s [1960s], as you read about it and then heard about it before you got here?
Speaker 2: Well, the branch really took off in '63 [1963], just after the assassination of President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy, there was a young Episcopal minister from Williston, who had done some work in Williston, North Carolina, and he told his parishioners about the problems that they were having there, they were having all kinds of problems that, in jobs and all sorts of discriminations at that time and the people of his parish started taking up collections for food and money and clothing and things to send to Williston, North Carolina.  And a group of them called the Vineyard Five, there was five women on the Vineyard who decided that they weren't gonna just send this stuff, they were gonna take it to make sure it got to the right people and they went to Williston and were actually jailed because they sat in on a demonstration at a Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] store who would not hire blacks and they were all arrested and put in jail.  And their husbands went to Williston to get them and after that they started, they would meet in churches and different places and decided they really do need the NAACP and it was formed with Toby Dorsey, as interim president. And, from there on we started having a NAACP.  It w--
Speaker 1: So when you arrived here in '67 [1967], in '68 [1968], the branch was--
Speaker 2: The branch was--
Speaker 1: --up and running?
Speaker 2: --up and running.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And they had lots of memberships.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Even life memberships because they had a, an entrepreneur, Kippy--Kivi Kaplan was his name and at the time he was very much involved with the national and he went around the island to all of his friends and relatives and got memberships--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: I wo--
Speaker 2: --it was fully formed when I arrived so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you arrive and was that one of your most immediate affiliations?  Did you get involved with--
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Who pulled you in?  And why did you get involved?
Speaker 2: Jackie Hunt [E. Jacqueline Hunt] who was a friend of mine, and I believe Harold Johnson was the president at the time and it was just the place to be involved.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that the branch was doing in those very early years, late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], as you became a new young member?
Speaker 2: Well whatever was going on in the country was part of their agenda and on the island there wasn't much going on, they would take part in different events that would happen on the island like the Fourth of July parade and things like that. But there wasn't.
Speaker 1: There weren't a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)There weren't--
Speaker 1: --discrimin--
Speaker 2: --a lot of--
Speaker 1: --discriminate, discrimination complaints or--
Speaker 2: No, they--
Speaker 1: --civil rights violations of people or?
Speaker 2: Well the, the civil rights violations that I remember were in the way of housing and, but it just wasn't so overt that you could really place your finger on it.  The realtors, if they took your business were smart enough to only show you in specific areas that they thought you should buy and there were other areas that they just wouldn't even take you to see.  Whether you had the money--they didn't know whether you had the money or not, they didn't care, they just wouldn't take you to see those places. And I, that's probably how most of us got to Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] because they've always called it the honky tonk part of the island.  I disagree because I feel everything of value is in Oak Bluffs, the hospital, the airport, you know, everything is here.
Story_ID: 275877
Speaker 1: When were you first elected vice president of the branch [of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I believe it's 1969.
Speaker 1: And the, as vice president, what were your responsibilities at that time?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well I have always been the kind of person that just got involved in everything and m- my responsibilities then, as now is just do whatever needs to be done.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: At that time, that was before the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] assassination and we didn't have the holiday, so now that's a part of my position as vice president.
Speaker 1: What is?
Speaker 2: I do the Martin Luther King memorial dinner, but then it wasn't, I would--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Martin Luther King dinner here, January, is an institution on this island.  Did you help to start that or who?
Speaker 2: I certainly did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Tell me about--
Speaker 2: I formed it. I framed it.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you did this and tell me about that development, it's--?
Speaker 2: I had gone to a conference in New Hampshire, not in New Hampshire, in Maine, 'cause they don't even have a branch in New Hampshire.  And they were talking about whether or not there was even gonna be a Martin Luther King holiday, they were still thrashing it out and I said to myself, there is gonna be one.  There is gonna be one.  And we needed to plan something around this holiday when it comes and so I just made an outline and Jackie Hunt [E. Jacqueline Hunt] and I, Jackie was the president at the time, put it together and sure enough, there was a Martin Luther King holiday.  And the first time we did, we did it at the Sacred Heart [Church] hall in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts], it's a Catholic hall and Jackie and Shelly Graves [ph.] and several others, we put the meal together and we cooked it, presented it and we had a program, we had children from the school come and speak.  And there was standing room only, people were outside the door and this was a cold, cold, winter night.
Speaker 1: This is the very first one?
Speaker 2: The very first one.  It was so successful, we knew we couldn't stay there 'cause we ran out of room, the next year, we had it in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts, at the St. Augustine's Church, who had a much bigger hall and we were still cooking the dinner ourselves.  (Laughter)  And, the good thing about it is that we had people of all colors, all ages, from various backgrounds, to the president of the bank to the plumber that, you know, that lives down the street and people bring good feelings with them when they come.  And it's an ongoing affair that, it's almost twenty years later and we're still doing it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: But te--
Speaker 2: --but now we've moved to--
Speaker 1: --go ahead.
Speaker 2: We've upgraded it and I'm kinda sad about that because Dr. King was a minister and he wasn't, he was a very humble man and I liked the idea of having it at the church and things like that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now where is this annual event held now?
Speaker 2: Right now it's held at Lola's [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts].  We have had it at the harbor site, Harbor View [Hotel] in Edgartown [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: That's so, what is that now?
Speaker 2: That's a local restaurant.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what is Lola's?
Speaker 2: Lola's is also a restaurant.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So, it's on a grander scale now?
Speaker 2: It's on a much grander scale now. And we have--
Speaker 1: Now what's the nature of these events?  What happens at?
Speaker 2: Well we have a well-known speaker come and we tend to allow them to speak on what they're interested in. And with a little bit of Dr. King thrown in and, we've had several speakers now on different levels.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the speakers that you mostly remember in recent years, who are some of the people that you've had?
Speaker 2: Well, we've had [HistoryMaker] Charles Ogletree, Professor Ogletree, we've had [HistoryMaker] Dr. James Comer, we've had, had [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young once.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So, you've drawn some, some main people here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We have drawn some main people, and we have drawn some that were unknown to many people but just as--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --vibrant a speaker.
Story_ID: 275878
Speaker 1: Tell me some more of your deep involvements and things that you have initiated and been a strong part of as a VP of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?  There are a lot of other things I think that have gone on here.  What are some of the other major activities that you've shepherded and nurtured with other members over the years as the VP?
Speaker 2: Well, I took on the history of the NAACP as much as I could because I recognized that nobody was doing it.  That there were boxes in this one's cellar and a rack in someone else's house and a little bit of this somewhere else.  And I said that doesn't make any sense for it to be scattered all over, we've never had an office so that we could keep these things.  So I started scrapbooks and albums and things to try and keep a lot of it together.  And, I was a part of the first youth group that we had.  We didn't do very much because they were basically toddlers, but we did, we had holiday parties for them and trying to get them involved in the NAACP.  But the problem with our youth groups that we have, even when we started to get the high schoolers and all, they eventually graduate, go on to high school, go on to college and universities and you don't see them anymore. So, we--it's been quite a struggle to keep a youth group going here.
Speaker 1: There're a number of other things that I understand the branch is currently involved with, programs and things that you've helped to start.  What are some of the other activities of the branch that stand out in your memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to also do--I noticed that the school systems were not quite up to par on black history and my children used to come home from school and say, "We didn't do anything for black history this, this week or, you know, this month or whatever."  So, I began doing exhibits of different kinds and providing the schools, some of the schools with information for Black History Month.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Tell me about some of--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --these exhibits now?
Speaker 2: Well, I visited my daughter [Stephanie Earl] in Kansas once and she took me to Fort Leavenworth [Kansas], and they had an exhibit on Buffalo Soldiers and it was quite interesting and I wanted to learn more and we went to, she's a school teacher, and she took me to a teacher's store, because she wanted to get some information and stuff because they live in a predominately white neighborhood and their school is predominately white.  And so, she took on the job of, doing black history in her school and while I was there I discovered this book on black cowboys and so--
Speaker 1: I noticed you had a copy on the sofa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of my--
Speaker 2: I bought the book--
Speaker 1: --favorite books, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and I went through it and it was quite interesting.  I came upon Bill Pickett and I remember as a child going to the movie and he was depicted by a white man, (laughter), I said--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --so, and also, I was a collector of dolls and I hunted down, I didn't have too many masculine dolls, but I found some and I dressed them in outfits that I saw in this book and gave them their names and that was one of my exhibits.  Another year, I undressed the cowboys and put baseball uniforms on 'em for the Black Negro League [Negro Leagues] which also, there's a museum in Kansas [sic. Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, Kansas City, Missouri].  And, that was a, a success too, I--that, they had that at the high school and they had one at the library and anywhere I went with my exhibits or information, it was readily accepted. So that was good.
Speaker 1: How many of those have you done over the years?
Speaker 2: Oh gee, I've never counted them because for several years, when Jackie Hunt [E. Jacqueline Hunt] was president, we would do exhibits in The Corner Store which is a store downtown, Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts].  And one year we made a game board, like Monopoly. And showed how the blacks traveled the country as they came and another year we celebrated our own heroes and we had photographs of our brothers and sons and fathers who were in the wars and--
Speaker 1: Have you kept all these materials and the artifacts?  Do you still have all this stuff?
Speaker 2: I have my dolls and I think right now they're still in their baseball outfits. But, no.  Another year we did women against the odds and that was my female dolls that I dressed.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: With the, you know, Mary McLeod Bethune and, and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So this was a, this, you organized and created these exhibits?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: But, was this sponsored by the NAACP or?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you were the--kind of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was.  If I needed art materials--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see.
Speaker 2: --and things, I could, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was the creator of them--
Story_ID: 275879
Speaker 1: The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here is known for its annual giving of, of scholarships to, to high school graduates?  Tell me about your involvement with that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--we've come a long way with that.  When I first started with the NAACP, the scholarship was something like two hundred dollars and they, we would have a tea or some sort of small event and, to raise this money and I watched it grow from two hundred to this year we gave twenty-five hundred.  So, my daughter called me not long ago and she said the NAACP owes me money, they only gave me seven hundred when I graduated.  But, we've had students go on to do bigger and better and better things and, and--
Speaker 1: How have you, wh- what have you been involved in to raise the money?  What kind of activities have you been involved in to raise the money for the scholarships?
Speaker 2: Well, we've done high (unclear) and that was successful for a while and it raised money, we've had fashion shows, we've had dances, we once had raffled a cruise for two and we sold tickets at the different street fairs that we have on the Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] and we once raffled off Elsie [E.] Nunes' house for a weekend.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  What else have we done?
Speaker 1: What else have you done with and for the NAACP?  You've mentioned a number of things, but are there other things that, that major activities of yours as VP, vice president?
Speaker 2: Well, for many years I was able to attend the national conventions and that was through help from a very generous employer who allowed me the time. He would help me schedule so that I could--
Speaker 1: Doctor [Peter] Strock?
Speaker 2: Doctor Strock would help me schedule so that I could go to the conventions. There you get a lot of information, a lot of energy. Yeah, quite interesting.
Speaker 1: What are the major concerns of the Martha's Vineyard branch of the NAACP today?  What, what's ongoing?
Speaker 2: Well, the latest things that we've been wait, wait, working on was some of the building projects that are not in compliance with the, with the laws of minorities working.  We've had other employment problems, most of which we try to mediate between the parties and settle it out of the public if we can and much of the time we can.
Speaker 1: Excuse me.
Speaker 2: We've had a case that went to mediation with MCAD for--
Speaker 1: With who?
Speaker 2: --MCAD.
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: Martha's Vin- Martha's Vineyard, Mass--
Speaker 1: Commission?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mass [Massachusetts] Commission Against Discrimination in, in Boston [Massachusetts].  And that was for a young man who was fired from the steamship, who was not working at the time, but they still tested him. And they didn't test him with a union rep or anything for, for drugs and he was not clean, but still they had no right to do that and we settled that case and the young man is back to work and so on.  We had another case against the police chief in Vineyard Haven [Massachusetts] and that was the biggest case that we've had to date and had to be settled in the public eye which was not good.
Speaker 1: Did you work on some of these--
Speaker 2: I cert--
Speaker 1: --mediations and cases?
Speaker 2: --I certainly did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I certainly did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What was your role?
Speaker 2: I was part mediator.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  As part of one--
Speaker 2: As part of one of the mediators--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is housing still an issue here?  You mentioned the early years in the '60s [1960s], and '70s [1970s], that the NAACP was involved in, you know, housing discrimination and where people could buy, is that still an issue today?
Speaker 2: Well, housing is a general informa- issue for everyone.  There are those who keep talking about affordable housing but no one ever does anything about it, there's a few affordable houses that have gone up but not nearly enough.  But the discrimination part is not like it used to be because they will accept your money now.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There are blacks who live all over the island so it's not, it's not like it used to be.
Story_ID: 275880
Speaker 1: So how have you felt, how do you feel now, as you look back at your NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] life, I mean, what has it meant to you being involved (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I have been involved in several other organizations and, NAACP has always been number one for me.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about the other major organization that you helped to found and--
Speaker 2: Well, I (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --here of, of--
Speaker 2: I co-founded the African-American Heritage Trail of Martha's Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] with a friend of mine, Elaine Weintraub.
Speaker 1: Elaine?
Speaker 2: Weintraub.
Speaker 1: Okay would you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: W-E-I-N-T-R-A-U-B.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you happen to get involved in the heritage trail with Doctor Weintraub?
Speaker 2: Well, actually a mutual friend of ours, Elaine is a school teacher, and she was working at the sch- Oak Bluffs School [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] at the time and a young lady that I knew from childhood, at, she was a child, Corrine Dorsey, she was Dorsey at the time, was also a teacher at the school and I used to give her a lot of my posters and things for Black History Month and Elaine was very much interested in the history of African Americans on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] and, I forgot her name already.  Corrine introduced us and that's how we got started.  At the time, Elaine had had a young class that, and she asked them for some history, some of their family history and they said, well we don't have any history on the island and she said, well, where there are white people there are black people, so you gotta have some history.  So, she set about hunting for some and as in researchers, you know, every now and then you hit a blank wall and you can't go too much further.  In the meantime, I was still at Doctor [Peter] Strock's office and this gentleman came and gave me this document and said, "I know, I see the, your exhibits and things in the paper all the time, maybe you'd be interested in this."  Well, I read it and d- at the time it didn't mean very much to me and I took it to Elaine and it turned out to be a census from 1841 or something like that and on it were some of the names that she was hunting for like Captain William [A.] Martin, who is a whaling captain and he had sailed out of and lived in Edgartown [Massachusetts].  And as they say the rest is history.  We began searching and--
Speaker 1: Researching?
Speaker 2: Researching and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) African Americans?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: History?
Speaker 2: We were in and out of the [Vineyard] Gazette office and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Dukes County Historical Society [Martha's Vineyard Museum, Edgartown, Massachusetts] and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So, how did you go about establishing--
Speaker 2: --the courthouse.
Speaker 1: --the trail then, this African American heritage trail?  And when did you really get that signed officially?
Speaker 2: Well, it was official in 1997, before that we had gone to, we had been invited to Nantucket [Massachusetts] to speak on the history of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and I, that's what I spoke on and, and Elaine spoke on the whaling captain, and at the [Nantucket] Atheneum [Nantucket, Massachusetts]? And they were building a black history trail 'cause they had an African meeting house there and they had other places where Frederick Douglass had been and things like that.  And, their trail was so spread out that we thought, well, wait a minute, some of our, the things that we have discovered are a little bit closer, maybe we can do a trail and so we came home and put our heads together and started marking all the areas and, that we could build a trail.  And so now, we have, I believe there's nine trails, nine areas in, just in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] alone. A lot of ours is spread out too. Because there's two areas in Chappaquiddick [Island, Edgartown, Massachusetts] and there's an area in Aquinnah [Massachusetts] and Chilmark [Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 275881
Speaker 1: How have you designated these sites [on the African-American Heritage Trail of Martha's Vineyard, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts]?  I mean wh- what did you, what has the program done?  What do you do to build a trail?
Speaker 2: Well, we're dedicating plaques on these sites and the first one was the Shearer Cottage [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] and we chose that one because that was one of the first things, earliest things that we dis- discovered and there were people, ancestors of these people that still were alive.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: You said Shearer Cottage?
Speaker 2: Shearer Cottage.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-H-E-A-R-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is that?
Speaker 2: Well, right now it's a guest house and they have small areas where people can stay.  But in the beginning it was a place, actually the only place owned by blacks, that blacks could vacation at.
Speaker 1: Vacation here?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because the ones that came were generally in, in service, working service for, for other white people.  But the Shearers were a family, Charles Shearer, was born in Appomattox [County], Virginia, I believe and after he went to, let's see, I can't remember the story.  It just went off, can you stop it a minute?
Speaker 1: I think he went to Hampton [Normal and Agricultural] Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went to Hampton Institute.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then he came to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Then he came to Boston--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then he came to the Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] and he, the area that he chose was near a church a Methodist church which he was a minister. He brought his family here, his wife Henrietta [Merchant Shearer] and the kind of world that they were accustomed to, some of them were politicians and entertainers and things.  So, it's not surprising that they were able to do what they did because they had people come like Ethel Waters and Harry T. Burleigh and, and I believe the Powells, Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] came before--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He bought his own home here and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So, Shearer Cottage started by the Shearers that was the first place that you put a plaque up?
Speaker 2: That was the first--
Speaker 1: That was the first stop--
Speaker 2: --place that we--
Speaker 1: --on the trail?
Speaker 2: --put a plaque up.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How many plaques do you have now around the island?
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen plaques?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  And where, what are some of the other places and people that you've honored with these plaques?  Very quickly, what are some of them?
Speaker 2: Well, we haven't put a plaque on Dorothy West's house, but she's another one and she, Dorothy West came out of the Harlem Renaissance.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Down the street from Dorothy West is, we put a plaque on [HistoryMaker] Isabelle Powell's house who is Adam Clayton Powell's first wife. And we have a plaque on [HistoryMaker] Senator [Edward] Brooke's, Senator Ed Brooke's house.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And Joe Overton [Joseph Overton] who was involved in unions.  We have a plaque on, down at the end of Circuit Avenue on Ora McFarlane's house and that was in honor of women innkeepers at the time, in that area around Hiawath--Hiawatha Park [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts], there were several.  And Ora's house in particular was one in where, what we call the Thursday girls.  The maids used to get off on Thursdays and they had, really had no place to go--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that was one place that they could go.  It was owned by two sisters.
Story_ID: 278206
Speaker 1: So I'm a co-founder of the Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] African American heritage trail [African-American Heritage Trail of Martha's Vineyard, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] and it's been quite a rewarding experience.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And what are the future plans for the trail?
Speaker 1: Well, in the summer we try to take people on tours to get money too, so we can finish putting our plaques out. And--
Speaker 2: The future plaques might go where?  Where are some of the places you think that you might put a--
Speaker 1: Well we--
Speaker 2: --plaque.
Speaker 1: --Plan to put one for The Cottagers [Inc., Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].  They're having an anniversary next year, so we want to do a plaque for them.
Speaker 2: Who are The Cottagers?
Speaker 1: They are a group of a hundred women, s- most of them were professional women who, are kind of a benevolent group and they have different fund raising events during the season too.  And they provide scholarships and money for different other organizations on the island like the hospital, and hospice, the, they've given the heritage trail money, they, and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. It's is an ongoing group.
Speaker 2: Okay, so The Cottagers are, it's a hundred black women?  What other places are you thinking about placing a plaque?
Speaker 1: I haven't--
Speaker 2: Is there one on the Dorothy West house?
Speaker 1: There's not, no there's not one on the Dorothy West house, we plan to do that one and there's other professional people around the island that deserve a plaque, that deserves mention like, Ms. Jones, Mailou Jones--
Speaker 2: Lois Mailou Jones?
Speaker 1: Lois Mailou Jones and the painter and we don't have a plaque of the Episcopal church for Reverend Burgess [HistoryMaker Bishop John Burgess], but there's a beautiful mural there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we may put a plaque there as well.
Speaker 2: Who is Reverend Burgess?
Speaker 1: He was the first black bishop of an Episcopal church in Massachusetts and I believe he passed away last year too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he is--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Spent years, his retirement years here.
Speaker 1: Yes, he spent his retirement years on the vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts], he and his wife, Esther [Taylor Burgess].
Story_ID: 278207
Speaker 1: You know, let me back up on the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] because you, we, something that I did overlook, in terms of raising money for scholarships. Your late husband George [V. Tankard, Jr.] was very active in the NAACP along with you. And he created something very special, what, what was that, what?  He had an idea and what happened?
Speaker 2: He had an idea to do a road race and at first his idea was really not welcomed because oh, they said, "Everybody else does a road race, hospice does a road race, Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] has their own road race," but he was persistent.  And they said, "Well, if you want a road race, y- you do it." And that's exactly what he did.  He armed himself with friends and contacted the right people and he got it done and we are now in its fourth year and George died last year and they named the (unclear)--road race after him, which it shall now ever be named and--
Speaker 1: So it's called the?
Speaker 2: George V. Tankard, Jr. Memorial (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And that is to raise money for?
Speaker 2: That is to raise money for the general membership because the scholarship has their own fundraisers.
Story_ID: 278208
Speaker 1: You've been recognized here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] by a number of groups and organizations for your work, a number of awards.  Are there any special awards that mean a lot to you?  That, you have a lot with any of them that really stand out?  Recognitions that you've gotten, that are especially meaningful to you?
Speaker 2: Well I got the Gosnold Award from the Dukes County Historical Society [Martha's Vineyard Museum, Edgartown, Massachusetts] and I didn't quite understand it, but they seemed to think that I deserved this award and the reason it's special is because at this point, it's the one and only.  It was the first time they had done it.  So, I don't know if they planned to do it again but--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: --I was the first in the group.
Speaker 1: When did you get that?  When did you receive the?
Speaker 2: Three years ago [2002].
Speaker 1: Three years ago?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, congratulations.  And I think Gosnold was one of the early dis- discoverers of--
Speaker 2: Of the Vineyard.
Speaker 1: --of the Vineyard--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Of the island.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Okay.
Speaker 1: What other, are there any other awards that you've received that you were surprised to get?
Speaker 2: I got an award from the high school [Martha's Vineyard Regional High School, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] for helping them become a blue ribbon school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Another one that I didn't quite understand what I did to deserve it. Because at, I just do volunteer work whenever I can, whenever I'm asked and usually around.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  The African Meeting House in Boston [Massachusetts], the Museum of African American History based at the African American Meeting House in Boston, did they recognize you?
Speaker 2: They did, they did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, for what?
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: Probably for the trail (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Probably for the trail [African-American Heritage Trail of Martha's Vineyard, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, your work on, on the trail. And the Martha's Vineyard Preservation Trust [Edgartown, Massachusetts], you received award, award from them also?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that was for my work on the trail as well.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 1: You continue to amaze me because you are so diverse and interested in so many different things.  You got a certificate in 1975, for what?  You remember?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Well, it says here, automobile maintenance certificate.
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Automobile maintenance, tell me about that certificate.
Speaker 2: Well (laughter).
Speaker 1: Which I saw in your scrapbook.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you happen to get that?
Speaker 2: I actually had just learned to drive.  When I lived in the city [Newark, New Jersey] there was so much public transportation that I didn't bother and everything was close to where I lived and then I moved here [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] and as the kids grew up they started going off to cheering practice and this one had to go to football practice and that one had to go to somewhere else.  So I said, gee, I better learn how to drive.  So, after I learned how to drive, I decided well, now if I'm gonna drive this car, I better know how to--know something about it.  At least if I get a flat tire I need to know how to do that.  So I--in the newspaper they had this course on automobile maintenance, so I took it and I did very well in it 'cause I would come home and George [V. Tankard, Jr.] would try to test me.  He said, "Now, if you open the carburetor and take all the plugs out, what?" I said, "Oh you better not do that."  (Laughter)  And so he couldn't trick me but, yeah I got a certificate in that.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Have you had to use that knowledge and skill, any emergencies that you've been able to get yourself out of?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  But you still have the?--
Speaker 2: I st- yeah.
Speaker 1: --ability.
Speaker 2: I still have the knowledge.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  With all your community involvements here, volunteer work, your full time work in, in the field of dentistry, what other things did you do to relax?  I mean, what, how did you relax and, and?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked to do lots of things with my hands, I sew, I knit, I crochet, I used to have a great garden, I can't do that much anymore. But I, I used to garden a lot.  I would come home from work and get my dinner and then go out in the garden and work for hours. That was relaxing. I used to bowl when they had a bowling alley here that was fun.
Speaker 1: And how long did you bowl?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Three years.  And I, I use, I would take ceramic classes and--lots of things.

Speaker 1: You have been an archivist, a historian.  You've given us so many, so many examples of your involvement in, in historical activity.  Why is history important?
Speaker 2: You have to know who you are, where you come from before you can figure out what you're gonna do, where you're gonna go.  When I was in school, we didn't get very much, we got George Washington Carver, I can't think of any, I can't even think of anybody else then, there wasn't much.  Also, I got annoyed with movies and things.  When I would find myself rooting for Tarzan, against the Africans?  As I, as I got older it didn't make any sense to me.  When I was little, you know, everybody was rooting for Tarzan, (laughter).  So, I said, I have to find out something about my own people, they couldn't have been all that bad that I would root against them and I just felt I needed to know. And my children needed to know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Any other reasons why you--history is important?  I think what you've shared with me is certainly significant. Any other reasons why you feel it's important?
Speaker 2: Well, we are a part of history.  How did we get here? Why?  You know, what did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How--
Speaker 2: --we do and--
Speaker 1: --how--
Speaker 2: --what did we do after we came?
Speaker 1: How did we get here on this island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Are there any things that you'd like to add to this [The] HistoryMakers interview, somethings perhaps that I haven't asked you?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No, you've asked me a lot (laughter).
Story_ID: 278211
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: I feel I've done the best I could with what I had to work with. I--and I'm surprised that people find that I have something to offer because I've always been so inside of myself.  I, I do things from within my heart and my head and sometimes they have no rhyme or reason, they, they're just things that need to be done, so I do them. I've always--the role that I prefer is to be in the chorus line, I don't want to be in the upfront, in the star position, I, I like the chorus line.
Speaker 1: What suggestions do you have for particularly young people who want to be in the chorus line?  Who want to contribute and maybe operate in the way that you have.  What suggestion do you have for young people?  Some, you know are born leaders we say, some put themselves out there in front but, you know, what's your advice to young people today about how to contribute to their community as you have.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess to do it the way that I did is to go through organizations and sit at the feet of the people that came before them. And, actually my grandchildren do that to me.  They think that I know stuff and several of them had to write papers in college and different places and I, that's when I first heard that I was an activist, it was from my granddaughter.  My children have always rooted me on, I did--I never had a problem coming and going wherever I needed to be or wherever I wanted to be because they were always one hundred percent behind me. And my grandchildren are behind me now and they have consequently joined different groups in their schools and all.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, would you have chosen in hind sight a, a different career path?  When I say career, I'm talking about your thirty plus years in the field of dentistry.  Would you have chosen a different path?
Speaker 2: I like some form of medicine so it would have been in medicine, if it wasn't in dentistry, it would have been in some form of medicine. I've always liked that. I watch forensic shows and things (laughter) on TV now. I would have gone further in my education had I known better.
Story_ID: 278212
Speaker 1: What do you still wanna do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, I wanted to do a little bit more travel because I haven't done too much travel in my life and I have recently been able to go to Ireland.
Speaker 1: To Ireland?
Speaker 2: To Ireland with the high school [Martha's Vineyard Regional High School, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts].  So that was quite interesting.
Speaker 1: Now when did you do that?
Speaker 2: I did that last month with--
Speaker 1: Oh recently?
Speaker 2: --again with my friend Elaine [Weintraub] and being with her, she being from Ireland, we were able to get to different places that the ordinary tourists didn't go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Elaine is the co-founder--
Speaker 2: --and like--
Speaker 1: --of the--
Speaker 2: [African-American] Heritage Trail [of Martha's Vineyard, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: --heritage trail with you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And her sophomore class.
Speaker 1: Oh, and tell me about that trip for?
Speaker 2: Oh it was a little bit of an adventure because it was kinda hard for me to live out of a suitcase because we had to travel from different places.  We went to several places in Ireland, we went on an archeological dig and again, with my age, I watched the children climb up the, the area, but I, I couldn't do that.  We had an Atlantic Ocean salt water seaweed bath which was quite fun and refreshing, we went, where else did we go?  We went to several religious sites where there were, like Knock [Ireland], there was a vision there of Mary and it was quite interesting.
Speaker 1: Well where would you like to travel next?  You--you're interested in traveling, where would you like to--
Speaker 2: Well I have always wanted to go to Chihuahua, Mexico, where my father [Felipe Camillo] was born and I've never been able to get there. And I don't know if I could find anybody if I did get there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  You have some information though that would prepare you for this or at least take you to the right place there or?
Speaker 2: No I don't. I just, things I've read about Chihuahua, at itself, but not anything--
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's that would be fantastic if you could get that accomplished.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, you get that accomplished, a second place that you're thinking about trying to get to?
Speaker 2: Africa.
Speaker 1: Africa?
Speaker 2: Any part of Africa (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, well I'm sure that you're going to accomplish both given your perseverance and strong work ethic.
Story_ID: 278213
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  Off the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts], you know, you think about your growing up in Newark [New Jersey] and why you left Newark and you've been involved in civil rights here and there.  But what are your hopes for the African American world today?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, that's, there's so many things that needs to be done 'cause we still have so much discrimination in jobs and housing.  I would just hope that they would get it all straight.
Story_ID: 278214
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you look back at your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 1: That I have successfully raised six children that have been able to go and be active and youthful members of their communities and live their, their lives independent of me.
Story_ID: 278215
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That I did the best that I could, that I, I was a caring understanding person.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, anything else that you want to add as we close out this part of the interview?
Speaker 2: No.  My daughter asked me not long ago, when we visited George's [Tankard's husband, George V. Tankard, Jr.] grave what did I want on my gravestone?  And I said, well, either a hat or an angel, they're both special to me. As you know I wear hats all the time.

Speaker 1: Well, that's my grandfather and his name was George Franklin Kornegay and that was just a picture that I found among my mother's things after she passed away.  I don't know the age of it.
Speaker 2: That's my father.  His name is Felipe, Felipe Camillo and he's doing what he loved a lot, training dogs and that picture had to be taken in the 1940's.

Speaker 1: That's my husband George [V. Tankard, Jr.] who died last year of lung cancer.  This picture was done by Verna May Hawke [ph.], my daughter Stephanie's [Stephanie Earl] mother-in-law and she had a good time doing this she said, she felt George's presence in the room with her.  I like it a lot because s- she even caught the little wrinkles in the top of his forehead that you can barely see, but they're there.
Speaker 2: This is George and I.  One day I looked in the mirror and I saw, a little wrinkle forming in the top of my forehead and I said, we better get this done before we have too many wrinkles and this was a been about 1985.  So, we went downtown to a photographer and had this done.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.
