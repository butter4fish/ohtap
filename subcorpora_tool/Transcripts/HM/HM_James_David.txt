Story_ID: 34951
Speaker 1: And I'm going to ask you, before we get into your family history and your history, ask you five questions--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --just to get you comfortable in the setting.  The first one is what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I would imagine blue.  Some--light blue would be--
Speaker 1: Thank you.  And what about your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I would imagine something like calamari, fried calamari, and fried--you know how the Japanese make the batter?
Speaker 1: Tempura?
Speaker 2: Tempura would be something I eat.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  And do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Usually the fall.  I try to be in this location during the fall.  I think it's something about it that is not only endearing, but it is, it resonates in something in me.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--
Speaker 2: It shows, it closes out a--usually we've had a good summer and spring.  And it all comes to an end with--.  And growing up in Chicago [Illinois], you're facing usually a harsh winter, you know.  You sort of--there's a song, "September," you know--.  "These few precious days."  (laughter).  And for that reason, I regard them as being precious, the autumn.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Do you have a favorite vacation location, a place that you like to go?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it's right there on the lake.  It's a small glacier lake outside of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, where my wife was born.
Speaker 1: Very nice, thank you.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have a quoting from--I guess Satchel Paige gave me two phrases that I use very often.  One is "Don't look back, something may be gaining on you."  And my favorite phrase by Satchel was "It isn't what you don't know that hurts you, it's what you know that ain't so."  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Thank you, thank you.
Story_ID: 34952
Speaker 1: Next, we're going to talk about your family background a bit.  And first, I'd like to know about your mother.  What was your mother's name, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in St. Louis [Missouri].  Her name is Ada Foster.
Speaker 1: And is that where she grew up?
Speaker 2: It's where she grew up, uh huh, and married.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about--well, what do you know--if she told you about, growing up in St. Louis?  Did she ever tell you stories or how life was?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  She had plenty, you know.  She recalls the Fair in 19--in '99 [1899], the St. Louis Fair.  And she had the--St. Louis was kind of a mixed bag.  There were a lot of Germans in St. Louis.  So, they had a great public school system which they shared with the African American community.
Speaker 1: And so, this was when your mother was growing up, they had German (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) in St. Louis.  And they bragged--and they had a right to claim that: one of the best--the best, public school system in the country.  And even though it was segregated, they made sure the equal distribution of resources--which included the African American community.
Speaker 1: So your mother, she taught you about the schools, or when she went to the public school?
Speaker 2: She went through, all through the--she went first to the parochial schools.  And then the Sumner High School--at that time the Catholic school system didn't have secondary education.  So, she graduated from the Sumner [High School].  And at that time, what passed for teacher training was a kind of a post-high school--Normal [school], they used to call it.  And that was, and she graduated from Normal and taught in the St. Louis public schools--
Speaker 1: So she--
Speaker 2: --until she married.  Of course in that day, they had a restriction against women being married.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: What subjects did she teach?
Speaker 2: She was in the grade schools.
Speaker 1: Alright.  English, just every subject.
Speaker 2: The regular curriculum for--I thought she, probably around the fifth or sixth grade, that intermediary.
Story_ID: 34953
Speaker 1: And how would you, how would you describe your mother [Ada Foster]?  What type of person was she?  What was she like?
Speaker 2: Well, she was part of the--.  Can I, I want to show you a picture of her.
Speaker 1: Well, we can take, we'll look at the pictures a little bit later.  But in terms of--
Speaker 2: I think it gives you a sense of--Do you mind if I--?  There are two pictures that--
Speaker 1: Well, Mr. James--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, no, no.  But her father [John Foster] was part of the privileged elite in St. Louis [Missouri].  He had, he operated a--the little market was kind of, what would be a mall now.  But he operated two stands.  And he was known for grating horse radish which he bought from the Germans across--in Belleville, and I think Belleville or one of the others.  It used to be the horse radish capitol of the world.  I don't know whether you've ever been around horse radish when it's being grated.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Yes, I have.
Speaker 2: You know, but, and he sold his--most of his customers lived in south St. Louis, which was a predominantly German enclave.  And he spoke German and Yiddish fluently.
Speaker 1: And back to your mom, if we could do that.  (Unclear) describe her.  As a person, what was she like around you?  If you have--we'll talk about siblings--But as a person, what was she like?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a very cultured woman, very--refinement was a required norm, in her book.  My father [William James] was, kind of surrounded her with a protective cloak.  (laughter)  People didn't--she had a certain standard--standards--where she expected everyone to adhere to.  And people deferred.
Story_ID: 34954
Speaker 1: She [James' mother, Ada Foster] was, there were--in the Catholic tradition there is--I guess the best way to describe it is a, an heir of the Drexel fortune:  Mother Katharine Drexel, who used her inheritance to educate African Americans and Indians [Native Americans].  And she established a lot of educational institutions including one in St. Louis [Missouri], St. Elizabeth.  And there was a close-knit Creole community in, around the Catholic Church in St. Louis, St. Elizabeth [church].  And most of those people originated from New Orleans [Louisiana].  And my great-grandfather took his six kids--Right after the [American] Civil War, there was a yellow fever epidemic--and from New Orleans to St. Louis.  And the two oldest girls stayed in St. Louis, never left.
Speaker 2: So, it sounds like--
Speaker 1: But the Jesuits had a big thing going on.  And they staffed the St. Elizabeth--I was baptized by a Jesuit priest there in 1923.
Story_ID: 34955
Speaker 1: Back to your mom [Ada Foster], did she have siblings--brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: One brother and one sister, yeah.
Speaker 1: And who was the oldest?
Speaker 2: She was the younger sister.  And the youngest was a boy.
Speaker 1: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Genevieve and Aloysius, after Saint Aloysius.
Speaker 1: It sounds like--because her father [John Foster], your grandfather, was a well-to-do businessman in some ways.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: And that she almost led a charmed life.
Speaker 2: She was privileged, yes, certainly accustomed to certain comforts.  And people deferred to her because of who she was, yeah.
Speaker 1: And maybe you mentioned it, but which part of St. Louis did she grow up in?
Speaker 2: In Deville.
Speaker 1: Could you say that again?  I just want to make sure I get it.
Speaker 2: In Deville.
Speaker 1: In Deville?
Speaker 2: Deville.
Speaker 1: Deville, okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: It was a section of, a little enclave.
Speaker 1: And which part of St. Louis was that?  North, south, east?
Speaker 2: In the west end of--you know, St. Louis is built around--.  And Deville would be straight out of the center of town, but a little, around Grand Boulevard.
Speaker 1: So, you've got the Mississippi River running to the east, and then the plains and other things going to the west.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And St. Louis is on the west bend, I believe, the Mississippi, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she ever give you any great stories, or just good stories, about growing up in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Not only her, but her friends, yeah.  And most had to do with--their social life was centered around St. Elizabeth Church, where all those French-speaking Creoles gathered and spoke to each other in French.  They were nurtured by a group of about a fraction of nuns who were part of, victims of the persecution in France, when they suppressed all the religious orders.  Most of them are named after a--Mother St. David was of Scotch origin, but she couldn't profess.  She couldn't be a nun in Scotland, so she immigrated to France and joined that congregation of nuns that eventually ended up in St. Louis and in Chicago [Illinois].  They had a convent at 1300 South St. Louis where I did, I learned my catechism in the French, the French sisters [unclear].
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 34956
Speaker 1: I might add that my [maternal] grandmother's first language was French.  And her surname was Guyol.  And Guyol was a very extensive (laughter), far-fetched clan.
Speaker 2: Now, we talked about your mother for a little bit, and then your--her father.  What about her mother [Lavinia Guyol]?
Speaker 1: You mean Guyol?
Speaker 2: Your grandmother, yeah, on--
Speaker 1: Miss--. They originated, the clan, originated in what is now Haiti.  And they were kicked off the island in 1804.  They went to Cuba first.  And then the French got in a fight with Spain, and they all ended up in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And in that picture there, most of the people in that early named [unclear] picture were from, you know, that part of New Orleans or along the coast, places like Bay Saint Louis [Mississippi] and Pass Christian [Mississippi].
Story_ID: 34957
Speaker 1: So, somewhere along the way your grandmother [Lavinia Guyol] and grandfather [John Foster] meet and married in St. Louis [Missouri], or New Orleans [Louisiana].  How did that connection take place?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was married in St. Louis.  And she grew up in St. Louis.  And her husband was from Nashville [Tennessee].  And I know a little bit--.  I know his mother's name was, she was a Craig, was Julia.  And he was born in--my grandmother was born in St. Louis--in New Orleans--on May 3, 1859.  And her husband was born in Nashville in 1860.  He was a year younger.  And they both were fleeing from their--.  Both of them grew up in St. Louis.  And probably married around 1890, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Those time periods take you way back in your family ancestry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My grandmother--another, I remember the day she died.  It was July, 1943--July 31st, 1943.  And it's the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola.  And when they--St. Elizabeth [Church] was dedicated when she was a child.  And it was a little mission dedicated to basically French speaking New Orleans type.  And she remembers being in the, as a young lady, being in the, they had a little dedication ceremony.  And she can remember marching in that.  And that had to be around 1868.  And the last ceremony was her funeral, sometime in early part of August of 1943.  And they closed the mission.  And she was, had the irony (laughter) of being in the dedication of the St. Elizabeth and the closing of it.  And her life was around St. Elizabeth.  She was on her way to mass, and a truck ran over her.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: Around the Feast of St. Elizabeth.  You know, the--as I used to tell my friends, the Catholic church and the Catholic religion that I knew, was about 95 percent superstition (laughter) and 5 percenr religion.  (laughter)  There was a lot of superstition around the--
Story_ID: 34958
Speaker 1: Well, the time period you're talking about that they [James' maternal grandparents, Lavinia Guyol and John Foster] were born, 1859 and 1860 or so--In the South--this is Louisiana?
Speaker 2: In, or in--well, yeah, sure.  They were part of the Vieux Carre [French Quarter, New Orleans], and they had all kinds of books written about them.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: New Orleans and the Creole community.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Creole community, yeah.  But slavery was going on still.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  They weren't part of, they were not part of that.
Speaker 1: Because of their Creole, I guess?
Speaker 2: They were free.
Speaker 1: Freed blacks.  That's--
Speaker 2: Uh huh, and very proud of it.
Speaker 1: And they told--I'm sure they told you many stories about growing up, as you just described.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So, let me get back a bit.  Thank you very much for the history.  Is there anybody else before your grandparents, your great-grandparents, that you can go--.  How far back does your family history go?
Speaker 2: It originates in Haiti on my mother's [Ada Foster] side.  And they had, you know, the French had a different attitude towards slavery than--.  If you had--for some reason, English blood contaminated the person mixed with black.  And the French had the opposite (laughter).  I'm reading a book about the Dumas, and it was a very fascinating book.
Speaker 1: So, if you had one-eighth English in you, then you're considered to be--
Speaker 2: No, no, the English--
Speaker 1: In Haiti--
Speaker 2: For some reason they didn't-apparently--.  Do you know the one drop theory?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's an English aberration.  The French had just the opposite.  If you had any French blood in you, they--
Speaker 1: Considered you to be French.
Speaker 2: They--yeah.  Then you were French, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36595
Speaker 1: So, Mr. James, could you tell me--looking at your mother [Ada Foster] and yourself--what things, what characteristics did you get from her?  What--good, bad, whatever.  What did you get from your--
Speaker 2: They're all good.  She was, she had ten children, and I was the fourth child.  And she lavished affection on all of them unconditionally.  And even though we grew up during the [Great] Depression, she provided--well, that cushion, you know, between all the harsh reality (laughter) that we had to face on a day to day basis.  And--
Speaker 1: So, she was a very loving and--
Speaker 2: Very reserved, but very--I talked about Mother Katharine Drexel.  She had a school in Virginia, Rock Falls.
Speaker 1: Right.  But back to your mom and you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, she's a very loving and affectionate person to all your--
Speaker 2: Indeed.  But educated--And well, she didn't have the, she was very relaxed about achievement.
Speaker 1: How so?  How would you describe that?
Speaker 2: My father [William Henry James] was driven by the need to achieve.  And achievement was number one in his book.  There was no alternative as far as he was concerned.  And my father--and I would say the men in her family and her generation that she was in contact with were--they spent a lot of time shielding them from the harsh, you know, realities of racism.  And they provided a, it's kind of--what I would call a, they lived in the mink-lined ghetto and--
Speaker 1: So, they felt a little bit sheltered?
Speaker 2: They were sheltered, very sheltered.  And not only from the larger community, but people in our own race they thought were beneath them.  And she very--would have very little contact with people not of her class.
Story_ID: 36596
Speaker 1: Could we shift gears a little bit to your dad? Because you mentioned your dad a few minutes ago, and his need to achieve.  What was your dad's name?
Speaker 2: William Henry James.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Evansville, Indiana.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned that he had a need to achieve.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me more about him and where he, growing up Evansville, if he talked about that?
Speaker 2: And he left there as soon as he could.  But he spent his life on the railroad as a cook, chef cook.  And the kind of exposure he had was, you know, to people who could afford to ride first class.  And usually--and I think some of that rubbed off on him, you know.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: So he was, while he was working as a chef cook, he would see these people riding first class and he said, that's the life I'd like to have?
Speaker 2: That never entered--.  But why should I be denied that?  Yeah, absolutely.  He vicariously lived--.  My mother's [Ada Foster] brother, you know, the order within the dining car--.  And incidentally, my father helped organize the Dining Car Waiters.
Speaker 1: The union?  A union?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  He was very active in the union, until the day he died, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: And his motto was, "If you can't sign your paycheck, you'd better belong to a union."  (laughter)
Speaker 1: So, what was--what was he like as a person?
Speaker 2: Ooh.  Stern, task master, no-nonsense.  He had eight children--ten children.  He moved me and my other siblings out of St. Louis [Missouri] when I was five years old, because it was, the schools were segregated.  The schools of higher learning were segregated.
Speaker 1: And you end up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: In the shadow of the University of Chicago, right.
Speaker 1: We'll get to that in a few minutes--about your siblings, too.  But when he was being--is it task master and stern and such things?  How did that show up in the family?  How did it show up, at least for you?
Speaker 2: As I said, I had--you know, they grew up, they were always preparing us for the harsh realities that we would have to face in life.  And he was determined that the key to any kind of success was education.  And so, he wouldn't--if I brought anything--.  It was important for him to get our priorities straight, you know, so that all the no-nonsense I left at the door when I walked in.  And--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: He was--provided.  I thought he was always pointing, and holding up sometimes unrealistic goals for us. (laughter)
Story_ID: 36597
Speaker 1: But he [James' father, William Henry James] set, so for school, he set high expectations when you were all in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I got--but he made sure that they were within reach.  And my oldest sister graduated from the University of Chicago in 1938.  She was the first one in our family to graduate from--.  I have a picture of her, I'll show you.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: And my mother [Ada Foster]--and her friend taken in Rockefeller Chapel, in her cap and gown.  And she was the first one in our family.  My second brother went to Armour Institute, which is now the Illinois Institute of Technology.  And my brother went to Northwestern [University], and I went to Loyola [University] here, of course.
Speaker 1: Can you hold that, because I'm going to get to that in just a minute.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, between your mom--between your mom and your mother and your father, what did you take from them?  Who would you say you're more like in some ways, between them?
Speaker 2: I have a lot of my mother, and I have a tender streak.  (laughter)  But I also have that purposefulness that my father had.  But he was not very--.  You know, the best--there's nothing too good for my children, was my attitude.  And it still is, and for my grandchildren, sure.
Speaker 1: Very good, very good.
Story_ID: 36598
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk a little bit more about--
Speaker 2: My grand--.  My mother's, my father's [William Henry James] mother was born in Shantytown, Illinois.  And she was part of the Cherokee, the Wabash Tribe of the Cherokees.
Speaker 1: So, you have a little bit of a mix.  You've got the Creole--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But my father and--but my father, I didn't know much about his--except the, I know the part of the Trail of Tears and all that.  And--
Speaker 1: Did he talk about--
Speaker 2: My father, my father was almost scornful about the--.  You know what, I shouldn't have said that.  But I had some Indian [Native American] relatives on his side that used to drop by.  And they were on a different wavelength than he was, and kind of felt that--
Speaker 1: The word you used I think was scornful?
Speaker 2: Not scornful, but "They let it all go.  They lost it, so why worry about them.  They're not going to get it back."  But--.
Speaker 1: So, he had a different attitude about his relatives and cousins about how they had done, not done as much as they should have?
Speaker 2: He had the same kind of self-criticism that we usually apply to our own folks being lazy, that sort of thing.  And it was to him a capital sin.
Speaker 1: So, he was a bit critical of what they were, how they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the reservation life, and that sort of thing.  There was nothing on the reservation for him.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 36599
Speaker 1: Well, let me move forward a little bit and talk about you growing up in St. Louis [Missouri], and eventually to Chicago [Illinois], I think when you were age five.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: What was your earliest childhood memory, how far back do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I left St. Louis when I was five.  And I think I spent a semester in kindergarten.  But mostly I had a lot of, my mother [Ada Foster] had a lot of friends.  And they were from the, you know, part of the gentry, you know.  They were very--
Speaker 1: The well-to-do side of town.
Speaker 2: They were well-to-do.  And they had--my grandmother married a guy who was really an entrepreneur.  He started the West End Waiters Club in St. Louis.  And he supplied all the waiters with a big--it was like the biggest social events in St. Louis.  He would--something like--.  The Lamberts were the Listerine people.  And Anheuser Buschs and--
Speaker 1: Is this when you were little you saw these things?  So, I'm going back to when you were little.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I knew that he, he had a livery.  And what I, the impression that I had was that this "post toasty" crowd (laughter) in St. Louis--  (laughter).  I had this feeling, that presence--.  I went to, the first day of school, I went to kindergarten.  And my mother knew all the teachers and the principal and that sort of thing, on a first name basis, you know.  They were all part of that upper crust in St. Louis.  And--
Speaker 1: So, you go back to--back to when you were in kindergarten and--
Speaker 2: And I had an extended family in St. Louis, so they were always dropping in.  And of course when my father [William Henry James], being his stubborn self, decided to move his family from St. Louis to Chicago, eight kids, they thought he was crazy.  And they thought my mother was stupid to leave all the advantages they felt they had in St. Louis.
Story_ID: 36600
Speaker 1: Speaking about the kids, how many brothers and sisters did you--
Speaker 2: I was one of ten children.
Speaker 1: Ten children.  Could you name them?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Especially the oldest.
Speaker 2: Genevieve, she's the one that graduated from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And then could you go down the line and, oldest to youngest first?
Speaker 2: Genevieve, well, she's still alive in Los Angeles [California];   Bernard, still alive in La Mirada, California; William T. James, he's deceased, and grew up in Chicago and had, bought the first in Dearborn Park.  And he was the principal of the school on the west side.  I'm trying to think of the name of it-Suder [school];  And then my sister Doris, she just, she just passed; and my sister Marianne, she's the fifth; and my brother Johnnie [John James]; and (unclear) was third;  I'm fourth; Doris fifth; Marianne sixth; Johnnie--and I forget (unclear) was left-handed--the seventh. (laughter).  And Andrew is still living; and my sister Julia was the ninth; and George is the youngest.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: He had, he was a high achiever, too.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: They all were.
Story_ID: 36601
Speaker 1: So you move from, you were about five [years old] when you moved from St. Louis [Missouri] to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Chicago.
Speaker 1: What, and that was on the south side of Chicago?
Speaker 2: West Woodlawn.
Speaker 1: West Woodlawn, thank you.
Speaker 2: And that was an enclave of high achievers.
Speaker 1: Now, I know something about the south side, a little bit.  I know Hyde Park and--
Speaker 2: Well, West Woodlawn was an enclave surrounded by all white growing up, community.  McCosh School, I have--
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk a little bit about, just right there, that enclave.  Then we'll--.  What was the school again?
Speaker 2: McCosh.
Speaker 1: McCosh.
Speaker 2: James McCosh School.
Speaker 1: At, in West Woodlawn, could you just describe, well, let's talk about the home life itself a little bit.  Ten kids, what was your house like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was up for grabs most of the time.  We had a lot of friends.  And my parents [Ada Foster and William Henry James] were very welcoming.  And we had a lot of interesting friends.  And a lot of high achievers.  The--I'll show you my, the picture of my graduating class.
Speaker 1: We'll take a look at that.  So, West Woodlawn was predominantly African American, or--
Speaker 2: At that time, yeah.  It gradually became African American.  There was always a few white hold-outs.
Speaker 1: And the neighborhood itself, could you kind of describe--was it multi--just homes or businesses around that area?  Was there a church?
Speaker 2: It was part of a mixed housing spot.  But most of them were intact families.  People like, on the high end scale, would be the Langstons.  You know about the Langstons?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Carroll, who I knew, is the great-great grandfather--he's the first generation that graduated from Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio].  And his--the first Langston graduated from, was the first African American to graduate from Oberlin in 1847.  And Carroll was the fourth generation.  He graduated from Oberlin and then the University of Michigan Law School.  And he was shot down--well, he didn't make it back.  He was a Tuskegee Airman.  On July 1, of 1943--'44 [1944], rather--he was killed in action.  And his body was fished out of the Adriatic [Sea] in about ten days by an Italian fisherman.  But Carroll was my model.  My best friend was Robert Brown, who was the first African American to get a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago.  And a very good friend, James Wilkins, who got his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago at age nineteen and became a very--.  And then I could go on.  Bob Steptoe, whose grandson just wrote this, I'm reading his book.  It's a lot, it's all about Woodlawn.
Story_ID: 36602
Speaker 1: So, you have a lot of high achievers [in James' neighborhood of West Woodlawn, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Very high achievers, right.
Speaker 1: A lot of--
Speaker 2: Bobby Brown [Robert Brown] went on to be the financing--finance advisor to Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia.  Like, you know, it--
Speaker 1: So it sounds like, sounds like a very, very positive environment.
Speaker 2: The whole community, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: During the first two wars between the--my recollection of it begins probably in 1929.
Speaker 1: And this is still during, that's at the beginning of the [Great] Depression.
Speaker 2: It has unfortunately fell apart right after the Second World War.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it was a very tightly knit community.  Everybody knew each other.  It had all the advantages of a small town.  And of course, they had the--.  Bob Steptoe delivered David, and his son was the head of the English department at Yale [University].
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Speaker 2: The Steptoe, the one that graduated from medical school at Howard [University]--but he was the first one allowed to have a residency in gynecology at the University of Chicago.  And he delivered my oldest son at Provident [Hospital], which was exclusively--and Cook County--was the only hospital we could go to.
Speaker 1: So, you had, sounds like a very closely knit community--families supporting each other and kids going on to school--
Speaker 2: And a kind of healthy rivalry, based on achievement.
Story_ID: 36603
Speaker 1: Now, kind of thinking about growing up in that area [Chicago, Illinois]--what sights, sounds and smells do you remember?
Speaker 2: Of course we were down wind--down wind, downward.  We were southeast of the stockyards.  (laughter)  Down wind--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) certainly the smell--
Speaker 2: The stench, yes.  I'll never forget when I, I remember breathing my first breath of fresh air.  And I thought somebody was trying to poison, to poison me. (laughter)
Speaker 1: From the fresh air?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And of course, I grew up on the Lake Michigan strait where they went and had the filtration plants.  And it just drew the water out of the lake and chlorinated it.  And I used to tell people, "If you examine my lungs, they're full of chlorine."  (laughter)
Story_ID: 34968
Speaker 1: Mr. James, you just mentioned some of the smells of growing up there [West Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois].  What other sights and sounds?
Speaker 2: The, there was a lake [Lake Michigan] breeze which was always welcome, competing with the stench from the stockyards.  And all the public buildings in Illinois were required to burn that soft coal from lands in southern Illinois.  And the result was the highest sulfur content, smoke, coming out of the chimneys.  And the soot--you know, the soot and that sulfur--high content saturated with sulfur, when the smokestack of industries were a reality.  And we got the winds from the steel mills from the southeast, the odors from the stockyards from the northwest, and the refreshing lake breeze.   And in the winter, of course, we had the snow from the northwest.  But they were always competing.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: That's kind of why you like the fall, with the--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  I loved it, right, exactly.  And the--
Speaker 1: Well, can I--I'm sorry, interrupt?
Speaker 2: No, I was just saying I can still see the green smoke coming out of this chimney at McCosh School.  And the soot, you know, saturating everything.  You couldn't--a white shirt would turn ashen grey by the middle of the day.
Speaker 1: Let me shift this just a little bit.  In terms of smells--in your family with your brothers and your sisters, your mom [Ada Foster] and your dad [William Henry James], what was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was--you know, her best friend, Miss Butler used to drop by everyday.  And she was a public health nurse.  And she, of course at that time, tuberculosis was a great--a bit more.  And sanitation, you know--cleaning, washing your hands.  Sanitation was a high priority.  And we had hot water, which was a luxury at that time.  And all the buildings were heated by coal.  And you had to deal with that.
Story_ID: 34969
Speaker 1: What about family times together, dinner--?
Speaker 2: My father made sure that, you know, that we had, we all had--my father presided over the meals.  And there was nothing casual about it.  There was a blessing before, a blessing after the meal.  And we didn't dress for it, except for Sunday meal.
Speaker 1: And what was that like?
Speaker 2: Oh.  My father was a chef.  And it usually would be some kind of exotic--usually fish or fowl.  And his, he would--the children would be fed first, and then the adults afterwards.  And we always had company--and a lot of conversation after that.  So we had, that was the time when children were not to be heard from, but seen only.  (laughter)  And they weren't--the children, you know, are to be seen and not heard from.  So--
Speaker 1: What about--
Speaker 2: You didn't disturb the conversation.  At that time, you know, people--  And there was no television.  And it was impolite if you had the radio on--you turn it on when people are engaged in conversation.  And there were great--.  Conversations are lost, a hard art.  And people don't know how to talk to each other.  And at that time, it was a high art.
Speaker 1: So, in terms of--you have this nice Sunday dinner.  Did you go to church on a regular basis?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Which church did you go to?
Speaker 2: We had, we were part of an Irish-Catholic.  It was called Holy Cross at 55th and Maryland [Chicago, Illinois].  And Monsignor Dunn was the pastor.  And his uncle was Governor of the State at one time.
Speaker 1: So, just wondering--your mom [Ada Foster], who was the Catholic--.  Both mom and dad [William Henry James] were raised Catholic?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Oh, very good.
Story_ID: 34970
Speaker 1: Let me get to McCosh [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: McCosh Elementary.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You've got these high achieving kids.  What was McCosh like as a school?
Speaker 2: It was, we had a principal, Miss Pullman.  I would say all but two of the faculty were white.  Miss Campbell--and I forgot--there were two African American teachers.  They were expected to adhere to the highest standard that Miss Pullman--particularly Miss Golden--she was the vice-principal of the second and--.  And our graduates typically went to Englewood High School, where the computation was poor whites, working-class whites.  It was half white and half African American.  And the African Americans were on a different track, because they were expected to go to college.
Speaker 1: But at McCosh, what kind of--did you have the classic education?
Speaker 2: Great stress was on the, you know, the basic reading and writing and arithmetic.  But because a lot of--but you're expected to speak standard English.  And the rest of the African Americans were accused of trying to sound like rich white folks.  But that was, I made no bones about standards.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite subjects that you studied when you were at McCosh?
Speaker 2: No.  It was, you know, there was a--my favorite subjects were elocution.  But I learned that at the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Congregational Church.  They had an after-school run by Rev. Scott's wife.  And she taught us to--two things she expected of us:  To memorize the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's second Inaugural Address.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All 706 words of the second Inaugural Address, and the 274 words in the Gettysburg Address.  And recently, I could recite them.  I have a video of my reciting the Lincoln's second Inaugural Address at the--
Speaker 1: At some program at Loyola [University]?
Speaker 2: No, no.  At a cafe, you know--what's the name of it?  What was I doing?
Speaker 1: Well, it'll come back to you.
Story_ID: 34971
Speaker 1: Anything, any other--were you doing sports [at McCosh Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Either--?
Speaker 2: We had a playground run by Mr. Oman and Mr. Rayfield.
Speaker 1: Like the gym teachers?  Just one of the teachers?
Speaker 2: More of a--they were, they were, they were not gym teachers.  They were caretakers.  They ran the athletic program.  But more than that, they had a sand pile and a little--it was attached to the McCosh School.  But it was part of, a separate jurisdiction within the city.  And Mr. Oman was the head usher at Belgian Athletic City.  And Mr. Rayfield was the other--he was in charge of the, we had a softball team.  And it was part of a group of playgrounds in the general area, all white.
Speaker 1: How was the interaction of the, how was the mixture at McCosh?  You mentioned African Americans and white students.
Speaker 2: It was all African American.
Speaker 1: It was all African-American, okay, okay.  That's good to know.  What else do you remember about McCosh? Anything that stands out?  Any particular teachers that you were inspired by, anything like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Miss Stetson, she was the eighth grade--and she made sure that everyone--.  Miss Golden and Miss Pullman of course were the--and then later, Mr. Pearson.  But they were determined that we would be the best, and they had high expectations for us.  And we proved that.  And they bragged about the kids, and it was a source of gratitude for them.
Speaker 1: Was anything that came out of that specific?  I know that aviation later on was something big.  But when you were in elementary school--?
Speaker 2: The, Miss Pullman--Miss Golden, was better rated by all of us.  She had adopted an African American.
Speaker 1: Well, maybe I'm saying more specifically, for you, was there something that came out of that, that inspired you to be an engineer, a scientist when you were that age?
Speaker 2: No, I think that came later on.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good.  Now, so, McCosh was primary.  And to what grade was that, up to eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Eighth [grade].
Speaker 1: Eighth grade.  So, there was no junior high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 34972
Speaker 1: Well, let's get to high school, because I know eventually you end up at Lane Tech [Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Uh huh, uh huh.
Speaker 1: How did you get--did you spend any time at, I think it was Englewood High School [Chicago]?
Speaker 2: Uh uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: My older sister did.  And my oldest brother was the first to go to Lane Tech.  It was a brand new high school when he enrolled in 1938--thirty-- yeah.  He graduated in '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: Who decided, or what kind of family conversation was there about you going to Lane Tech?  How did that come up?  Or how was that decided?
Speaker 2: I had a great uncle who lived in the area.  You had to live north of North Avenue to go to Lane Tech.  And he had a house on Clybourn, around what is now Diversey, yeah.  And we used his address to go to Lane.  And--
Speaker 1: Because you were on the south side?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had to take the "El" [train] from Cottage Grove to Addison and Paulina, and walk all the way from Paulina to Western and Addison.
Speaker 1: Back to that decision.  Was that--your dad [William Henry James] and your mom [Ada Foster] said, "We don't want you going--"
Speaker 2: I think Uncle Eddie had a lot to do with it.  There were two, three--two, predominantly at that time--I think Wendell and DuSable were the two African American high schools.  And Englewood was half African American.  And the rest of the schools, thirty-nine at that time, were all white.
Story_ID: 34973
Speaker 1: Now, Lane Tech [Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois] is not just a school where you just put your name in and you're in.  It's a, from what I understand, it was a magnet school.
Speaker 2: You had to be part of the--
Speaker 1: So, what was--what kind of tests or exams did you--?
Speaker 2: Just walked in.
Speaker 1: Just walked in?  Why, because of your uncle's address?
Speaker 2: Right.  And at that time, Smith-Hughes was a two-year terminal education program.  And half of the guys that I went to Lane with were in the Smith-Hughes program.  And after four years--after two years--we were eligible for an apprenticeship in one of the trades, which were of course, not available to us.
Speaker 1: So, you're at Lane Tech on the--now, you're living on the north side of Chicago versus the south side.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: How was that?  Well, first of all, how were the classes?  Was it very competitive, very challenging?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, it had high standards, and expected us to adhere to it.  At that time--I entered in February-- in January--of 1937, and the enrollment was I would say 50 percent German.  It was in the middle of a German enclave.  And it was Germans, you know.  Education was very important to them.  And they made sure that they offered--Lane Tech met their standards.
Speaker 1: What was the percentage of the number of African Americans at Lane Tech?
Speaker 2: It was hard to calculate.
Speaker 1: What's the ballpark number?
Speaker 2: I was one of 727.
Speaker 1: African Americans?
Speaker 2: No.  One of--
Speaker 1: Oh, in the whole class.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were the only African American?
Speaker 2: (nods head, yes.)
Speaker 1: How many other African-Americans do you think were in the other classes?
Speaker 2: There were six in the building.
Speaker 1: Six, total.
Speaker 2: Including my oldest brother, yeah.  There were ten thousand [students] in the school.
Speaker 1: Did you feel a bit intimidated at all?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.  You know, I just got lost in the--and yeah, I made friends.  You know, I had a lot of good friends that I still meet with.
Speaker 1: These are African American?  White?
Speaker 2: No.  There weren't any African Americans around.
Speaker 1: Just yourself, in that class.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what were the classes like?
Speaker 2: A lot of emphasis on the manual skills.  And since I was college bound, a lot of math and English.
Speaker 1: Did you have to take Latin or--
Speaker 2: I had a minor in eight--seven years--eight semesters of Latin, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was at Lane Tech or--?
Speaker 2: Lane Tech.
Speaker 1: Lane Tech, okay.  Thank you.
Story_ID: 34974
Speaker 1: Back to your commute.  As we would describe it today, as a commute.  You live on the south side.  So, did you stay on the south side with your family, or did you--?
Speaker 2: Just stayed, I stayed with my family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that a dangerous ride in any way?
Speaker 2: No.  I had to walk until I got on the "El" [train] at 63rd, and had to transfer either--somewhere along--and you get the old Ravenswood.  And usually I could study, because it was an hour and half trip both ways.
Speaker 1: Both ways.  So at Lane Tech, besides your classes, were you doing extra-curriculars, or sports?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was in the intramural basketball.  And they had a, I was in the student council two years.  And the Latin Club and forensics.
Story_ID: 34975
Speaker 1: What about your social life?  Did you, at school [Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois] did you have a lot of good friends, as time went on?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Was that through sports, or the clubs?
Speaker 2: Usually the guys that I pal around with.  Jim Onitas was from northern Ireland.  He was Catholic-Irish, not Catholic.  But he was from that area.  He was an Orangeman, and made a big fuss out of that.  He and I were great pals.  He was enrolled in the Smith-Hughes [program].  He was aiming for a--to get into one of the trades, you know, as an apprentice.  And at the end of that two years when he was finished he said, "Goodbye, James, I'm looking for an opening in one of the apprentices, one of the apprenticeships."  And I pleaded with him to finish his high school and get a diploma.  "No, James, I'm getting the hell out of here, I need to start earning money."  And I felt, you know, I might run into him.  But the first day of our third year, junior year, Onitas came walking up: "James, you talked me into finishing."
Speaker 1: So, he continued on?
Speaker 2: He did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Speaker 2: And I lost track of him.  One day I answered the phone, you know.  He says, "This James?"  I said, "Yeah, who in the hell are you?"  He said, "I'm Jim Onitas."  And he had moved to Arizona, and had a very successful living.  (unintelligible).
Speaker 1: So, you're on a college preparation track.  Were you thinking about any particular schools or colleges at that time?
Speaker 2: The, you know, I wanted--I didn't want to go to either of the schools that my kids--my older brothers--were in.  Genevieve graduated from University of Chicago, and Bernard was at Armour [Institute; now Illinois Institute of Technology].  And Bill was at Northwestern [University].  So, I chose Loyola [University].
Speaker 1: That was where you were thinking you were going to go?
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, I enrolled in the fall of 1941.
Story_ID: 34976
Speaker 1: So, Mr. James, we were just talking, and you were getting ready to talk about going to Loyola [University], which is here in Chicago [Illinois].  But I read somewhere that you started becoming excited about aviation, I think, in high school [Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago].  Could you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was interested in--Lane had their first courses in aviation.  And that was, at that time at a very primitive stage.  Lane had the first driver education program, the first aeronautics-aerodynamics--
Speaker 1: --dynamics?
Speaker 2: Yeah, aviation program, aerodynamics.  And they had the other traditional trades--electricity, linotype operators.  All of these were good for the industries in Chicago.  Then there were meat cutters, and--.  But they did--all of the crafts had apprenticeship programs:  Sheet metal workers--in the steel mills of course; the forge electricity and electricians; the carpenters--.  All of them had their own special--.  You could, they would take you right up to the point where you could be eligible for an apprenticeship.  So, the Smith-Hughes [program] was a very big attraction for Lane Tech [Technical College Prep High School].  But the rest of us who were on the college bound track, we had to take some of the regular--and they did too, but just a sampling of it, the regular courses in the liberal arts.
Speaker 1: Right.  But somewhere you got attracted to aerodynamics--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --aeronautics--
Speaker 2: Right, that was the attraction.  And they had a kind of, aviation was very primitive in stage at that time.  So, we ended up talking about the engines and the frame, framework.  And there was a big industry in repairing fuselages with fabrics at that time.  And that it was--you know, I'm talking about 1938, '39 [1939], '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: But what was it about aviation that captured--had you ever been in a plane yet?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Been near a plane?
Speaker 2: I don't--I lived on 63rd Street and Cottage Grove.  And at the end of the 63rd Street streetcar was an airfield called Midway, and that was the commercial area.  And as a kid, me and some of my friends, we would get on the 63rd Street bus and go out to Midway and watch the few flights that there were take off and land and take off.  And we'd have to wait sometimes awhile, an hour, for, you know--.   And it was a big thrill to see them, all of them propeller driven and--.
Speaker 1: So, it was a little bit of fascination with--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --with the idea of flying and--
Speaker 2: Then there was the Harlem Airport.  And if we could get a ride out there--that's where the African Americans trained.
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: The Harlem Airport.
Speaker 1: Was it here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: On the--that's where Bessie learned to fly.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And the guy [Alfred "Chief" Anderson] who taught me at Tuskegee to fly, also got his training.
Speaker 1: So, here you are in Chicago.  It sounds like a sophomore, maybe a junior.  And you're getting excited about aviation.
Story_ID: 34977
Speaker 1: And then you're thinking about Loyola University to go to college.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was sort of, because of the Jesuits.  And I, we had friends who were Jesuits.  And one of them got me a scholarship.  My father [William Henry James] and uncle I guess, one of them.
Speaker 1: So you started, I think you said in 1941?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: At Loyola.  Just for historical context, I wanted to get your thoughts.  That's the same year, of course, as "D-Day" [Attack at Pearl Harbor; World War II], December 7, 1941.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that day?
Speaker 2: Everybody does, yeah--.  "Where were you on December 7, 1941?"
Speaker 1: Where were you?  And what was that day like?
Speaker 2: I had a part-time job as a shipping clerk in a table pad company.  And we were getting ready for the Christmas rush.  And I was working on a Sunday, and we were listening to the [Chicago] Bears [football] game.  And there was an interruption.  And we thought it was Star Wars, with Orson B. Welles.
Speaker 1: Orson Welles radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had this thing on Star Wars.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Nobody paid attention to it.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then we found out it was the real thing, you know.  The Japs [Japanese] had--we always had the blues, you know--celebrate anything.  And the blues for the--Pearl Harbor Blues, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
[singing]:  "So, it was December the seventh, nineteen hundred and forty one.  The Japs flew over Pearl Harbor dropping the bombs by the ton.  There's a war raging in Europe.  Hitler must be running all around.  (laughter).  Whoever started this war, really started a mess.  I'm going to the sand for our man, because he's one of the best.  And I'll be so glad when my man come home."  (laughter)  Pearl Harbor Blues, yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Thank you for that.  That's excellent.  I'd never heard that.
Story_ID: 34978
Speaker 1: So, something else, too was--I know obviously many Americans just decided, okay, the Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbor [December, 1941; during World War II], and we've got to just go over and do what we've got to do.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was that like in the African American community?  I mean, you're 17, 18 years old (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, the draft had already been instituted with compulsory education, military.  And a lot of our friends had, older friends, had already been called up to Camp Custer [Michigan].  One of the--and some of us were concerned about, you know, what their fate was going to be.  And then out of it came the 93rd and 92nd Division, trained at Fort Huachuca, Arizona in the desert.
Speaker 1: Were these African American spots?
Speaker 2: Divisions.
Speaker 1: Divisions, thank you.
Speaker 2: Divisions.  The 92nd and the 93rd divisions were all black, African Americans.  And the 92nd Division ended up in Italy in the Alps.  They were trained in the desert to fight the Germans in the Alps. (laughter)  And--
Speaker 1: So, the black community already--
Speaker 2: They were invested in it.
Speaker 1: Invested in it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  So--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) African American soldiers.
Story_ID: 34979
Speaker 1: So, you're in your first year at Loyola [University].  What classes were you taking at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, they had a standard curriculum with a study of (unclear) Russian and sensitive philosophy (unclear), Latin, and the usual liberal art--history and sociology, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Standard classes for freshmen, right?
Speaker 2: (Nodding, yes)
Speaker 1: And if I understand it correctly--so springtime, 1942 is when you decided to join the--
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was subject to the draft.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I happened to be, I used to study at the University of Chicago Public Library.  And one day in June of 1942, I happened to be studying for finals.  And I noticed walking out of the building, there's a big gathering in one of the lecture halls, which holds about 150 people.  And I walked into the back of it, and there was a guy from the Army Air Corps.  It turned out to be he was a recruiter, and talking about the opportunities in the Army Air Corps.  And I sat in the back of the room.  I was the only person of color in the room.  And after he finished, I approached him about a question.  And I waited my turn.  And I asked him, you know, "Is anything in this for me?"  And he looked at me and took the measure of me.  And he said, "Yes, we have this wonderful program for you colored lads at Tuskegee [Alabama]."  And then he went on to (laughter) paint a glowing picture about the opportunities.
Speaker 1: Did you tell him that you wanted to fly?  Did you say to him, "Am I--?"
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, after he finished his pitch.  Yeah, I said I've got to get in on this anyway I can.  And--
Speaker 1: And then what were the, what were the next steps?
Speaker 2: I had to take a test.
Speaker 1: Take a test.
Speaker 2: And then a physical.  And I was put on a waiting list to be called up.
Speaker 1: And what kind of test?  Written test?  I'm sure there was a physical examination.
Speaker 2: It was a stiff examination.  And a good thing I had taken the courses that I had taken.
Speaker 1: How did you do on that test, the written one?
Speaker 2: He said I did very well.
Speaker 1: Excellent, excellent.  And then, so you were put on the waiting list.  And when did you get the news that you were accepted?
Speaker 2: Probably the early part of--October 7, 1942.  And I was called up on October 16, 1942.
Speaker 1: And when you got called up, did you get a letter--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --saying report to someone?
Speaker 2: "Greetings," yeah.
Speaker 1: Greetings, this is Uncle Sam?
Speaker 2: Uncle Sam, right; to report to Tuskegee Airfield, right.
Story_ID: 34980
Speaker 1: And where did you--what--I assume train station, bus station--that you had to go to--.  Was it here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I had to get on the Chicago Eastern Illinois Railroad at the Dearborn Station with--.  There were about three or four guys--one from Wisconsin, Alford Graham, who had, was the first time he had any association with colored lads. (laughter)  And he grew up in Waukesha [Wisconsin].  And on the way down, we had to--the Chicago Eastern ran along the border between Indiana and Illinois, and ended up in Evansville [Indiana].  And my father [William Henry James; hometown] had notified one of my aunts that I was going to have a layover in Evansville, and she met me.  It was the first time I'd laid eyes on her.  And I remember the guys were--the guys were sort of loitering.  And this woman approached us, and one of the guys said, "Who's that squaw looking at you?" (laughter).  It turned out to be my aunt.
Speaker 1: An interesting story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I read somewhere that on the train as you were crossing, I think into Tennessee, you end up having these--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --before you get to Alabama, there was something that happened.  A deputy, a sheriff, had to pronounce about, you know--before you get to Alabama--if you remember that, so I can kind of--.  One of your daughters had something that she provided to us.  Something about "Before you take a single step into Alabama's red clay--"  Do you remember that story?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't want to tell the story, unless--
Speaker 2: It was when the, you know, the depot that you--to Tuskegee, Alabama; Tuskegee Institute; and Tuskegee Air Field--was called Cheaha, Alabama.  That's where the depot was, with the usual classical "Colored" and "White" entrance.  And we were greeted by a redneck lieutenant, who read the great statutes of the State of Alabama.  And right before he--(laughter)--"You might as well know the rules."
Speaker 1: Right.  So, it was a lieutenant from the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: Right.  A lieutenant I never saw again.
Speaker 1: How did you, what was your reaction at the time?
Speaker 2: Not my reaction, all the guys with us, you know.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: So, like welcome to the South.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 34981
Speaker 1: A question about that:  Actually, had you been down, out of Chicago?  You were born in St. Louis [Missouri]--which Missouri was the South, for some people.
Speaker 2: I'd never been, never crossed the Mason-Dixon line, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  We'll talk about that a little further.  So, you're at the depot.  Then it's directly to Tuskegee [Alabama] from there?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So, what was, what was that--?
Speaker 2: There's a little--as we crossed the, got on the LN, which is the Louisville National Railroad, we were Jim Crowed out of Evansville [Indiana] directly to the Jim Crow car.  And I remember crossing the Ohio River.  And I had quoted a famed, a quotation from 'Dante's Inferno', that I learned at Loyola [University], and had a course on, in early Italian and Latin.  "The entrance to hell had been signed over it.  All of you who enter, abandon hope."  (laughter)
Speaker 1: And so, that was your 'Dante's Inferno'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --similar experience--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --in crossing into the Jim Crow environment.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Was there a sign or anything up?  Anything comparable, or you just--?
Speaker 2: And there were signs in Evansville.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But we had a layover, and I think it was Nashville [Tennessee], where there were plenty of signs there, you know.
Speaker 1: Signs pointing for "Colored Only Here"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and all that.  That's the first time you'd ever seen anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Story_ID: 34982
Speaker 1: So, you get down to Tuskegee [Airfield, Alabama].  What was basic training like?  Just first--
Speaker 2: Exactly what it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what was it like?
Speaker 2: All hell broke loose, and we were (unclear) pre-flight missions.  And we were, well, civilians that had to be introduced to the, you know, the [U.S.] Army ways.  So, we--
Speaker 1: So, were the drill sergeants white or black?
Speaker 2: No, no, they were upperclassmen.
Speaker 1: The officers?
Speaker 2: Who greeted us.
Speaker 1: Okay, the upperclassmen.
Speaker 2: And they introduced us to the regimen.  You know, learning dodo verses.  The first one I had to learn was--I'm going to have to list them when I have time--
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: --was about a dodo.
Speaker 1: And what's a dodo?
Speaker 2: I'm just about to tell you.
Speaker 1: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 2: A dodo, that was a pre-flight mission, designation for them.  A dodo is an amoeba of Army pilot.  "A dodo is an amoeba [unclear] of an Army pilot to be properly chastened and subdued by an entry course of predetermined, idealistic, integrated formula for the purpose of impressing upon the unused convolutions of his cerebellum the correct, proper duties and other assimilations previously initiated intelligence in direct control of his movements."  And that's a dodo.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  I appreciate what you--So, it's something you had to memorize as a raw--
Speaker 2: The dodo verses, yeah.  That's part of the training.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had to--
Speaker 2: That's part of the training, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  It's comparable to maybe being--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The academy's [United States Military Academy, West Point] is a plebe.  You've got to--
Speaker 2: And that was brought from the academies, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's what I, it sounded like that.  So, your first few weeks there, you're in--
Speaker 2: Just, it was basically basic training--the veneer of etiquette proper to a cadet, you know, kind of the West Point regimen.
Speaker 1: Because you're on a track not to be a ground soldier.  You're on a track to be a pilot.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At some point and time.  And so, they have to treat you with a certain degree--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Of--
Speaker 1: Perfection.
Speaker 2: Right.  And to impress upon us, as you said, the fact that we are in a specialized form of indoctrination, right.
Speaker 1: And at some point and time, you're going to be an officer.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: And they have to treat you with respect.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, how long was basic training?  And--
Speaker 2: Twelve years--twelve weeks.
Speaker 1: Twelve weeks.  And then after basic training, you move into some sort of advanced training?
Speaker 2: No, I went to primary.
Speaker 1: Primary.
Speaker 2: And that was a mobile field at Tuskegee Institute.
Speaker 1: And so, exactly where was basic training?  What--?
Speaker 2: The basic training was at the Tuskegee Army Airfield.  Then we were moved from the base to the dormitories in the Tuskegee Institute, Sage Hall.
Story_ID: 34983
Speaker 1: And were you assigned, I know you were assigned eventually to the 332nd Fighter Group.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So, when you come to camp, what--?
Speaker 2: That was the norm.  And then after primary, that's when I learned to fly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In a Stearman [airplane].
Speaker 1: And a Stearman is a two-seater, one-seater?
Speaker 2: Two-seater, open cockpit.  No ignition, had to--
Speaker 1: Take the propeller and--
Speaker 2: --the propeller, right.
Speaker 1: So, you take the propeller--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Like someone comes out there and then they pull it down and--
Speaker 2: Contact--.  And it had an open cockpit, only three instruments.
Speaker 1: You're learning to be a pilot, so you're in the back seat, I assume?
Speaker 2: Right.  There was an instructor in the front until you're solo.  And then after that you had to, went through the basic--detecting stalls, landing, and taking off and landing.
Speaker 1: And you have to learn a lot of the science of aeronautics.
Speaker 2: Exactly, right.
Speaker 1: Pitch roll, and all that.
Speaker 2: Torque.
Speaker 1: Torque.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  And the, you know, basically it's all by contact flying.  There's no instruments to guide you.  The only instrument we had was an altimeter, a tachometer, and a compass--magnetic compass.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first instructor?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: For the Stearman?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Anderson.  Chief [Alfred] Anderson, he's the one that was trained at Harlem Airport [Chicago, Illinois].  He was very famous.  "Chief," we used to call him.
Story_ID: 34984
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mr. James, you were just talking about [Alfred] "Chief" Anderson before our break.  I asked you what you thought about him, you know, as a person and an instructor of, whatever he was.
Speaker 2: He was partly responsible for the fact that the Tuskegee Airmen--.  He was a guy--there was a--Tuskegee had a civil, civilian aide program.  And he taught there.  And a very distinguished white lady visited Tuskegee.  Her name was Eleanor Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: President [Franklin D.] Roosevelt's wife, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And she had heard the legend that African Americans weren't intelligent enough to fly.  And she heard about this experiment that Tuskegee.  No, wait a minute.  The general was telling me that.  She asked somebody, "Why aren't there African American pilots?"  "Oh, no, they can't.  They're too dumb.  They're not, they don't have any intelligence to fly."  But she had read about this civilian air program at Tuskegee.  She was a contributor.  "This doesn't make sense."  So, being Eleanor, she arranged to go to Tuskegee Air and see what this program was all about.  And though--she asked Chief Anderson, "Would you take me up?"  (laughter)  And she did, and he did.  And the rest, of course, is history.  You know, she told Franklin, you know, (laughter) of all the tricks these guys are trying to tell me--of all the myths I had to--I just--you know--(laughter).  And it became (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, thanks for telling me that story and confirming it, because sometimes people think those are just legends.
Speaker 2: No, this is a fact.  That's Eleanor.
Speaker 1: And I think during the pause you also said that Chief Anderson trained more pilots--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: Than any other person, yeah, responsible for it.
Story_ID: 34985
Speaker 1: So, as part of that [pilot] training, you're in the Stearman [airplane], I think you mentioned.  When did you first go solo?  Well, yeah, when did you first go solo?  How did that--?
Speaker 2: After seven--eight or ten hours of instruction.
Speaker 1: And how did that feel, to go solo?
Speaker 2: (laughter)  It was interesting.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't remember--I probably don't remember the takeoff, but I remember the landing.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how was the landing?
Speaker 2: The landing was smooth, and I was grateful for that.
Speaker 1: And part of that initiation, when you step off that plane, what happens?  Do a few fellow pilots or cadets come up to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  There's applause all the way around.  And you know, "Join the club."  And then after that, of course, it was a progression all the way to, as we said, the most sophisticated aircraft they already had at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think we'll get to that story in a little bit.  Unfortunately, as part of flight training, even today, there's bad experiences.  People--in terms of just training.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so people washing out; crashing.  Do you remember any of those--that side of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  And we had a lot of mid-air accidents.  And one of my--and one of the guys I slept next to, had a mid-air collision.  And then you don't talk about it, but, and it's part of the--as they say, you know, stuff happens.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, maybe in some ways that's obviously the most tragic.  But next to that is washing out, that someone doesn't make it.  I mean you're, here you are coming in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, then you just suck it up and keep going.  Keep going, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--. I think, you know, knowing the pride that a person would have--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure--
Speaker 1: And if they're going to be an officer, and they're going to fly--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --they should fly the best planes in the world--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, so, I'm sure that was a tough experience for some of the guys that you knew there.
Story_ID: 34986
Speaker 1: You're part of the 332nd fighter group.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What, what was that transition like?  You go from your Stearman [airplane] as a trainer--Stearman as a trainer, and then into--what's the--?
Speaker 2: There were two things that were significant.  One is learning instrument flying.  You learn quickly that you can't rely on your own senses, and you have to rely on your instruments.  And that, that's against your instincts.  You have that little ball on the back of your head, telling you about balancing and that sort of thing.  And that all is--there's no reference for that in a cloud, or at night, or direction.  But the instruments are very, very important.  There's a horizon--an artificial horizon, a bank and turn indicator, and the--all these instruments are--
Speaker 1: And the plane itself probably is more sophisticated.  Besides, I think you said it was an altimeter and one other instrument.  So, the next plane--
Speaker 2: For instance, the Stearman did not have the capacity of turmanship--no vertical or horizontal stabilizer.  That's very important.
Story_ID: 34987
Speaker 1: Oh, before I forget.  At one of the breaks, you mentioned a couple of high achievers you wanted me to talk about--Albert and Charles Stewart.  What was--?
Speaker 2: Albert Stewart [also a HistoryMaker] was the first African American admitted to the [U.S.] Navy's Officer Training Program.  At [University of] Notre Dame, he was the first African American admitted to Notre Dame in the Navy's Officer Training Program.
Speaker 1: Was he at Tuskegee [Alabama] with you, or was that later?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: That was later.
Speaker 2: He was in the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: The Navy didn't have any African American pilots.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  Just wondering, here you are in Tuskegee, Alabama.  And occasionally, I suspect you have to go off base.
Speaker 2: And he was also the first African American admitted to a graduate program in St. Louis University, and got his Ph.D. in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Speaker 2: And headed the--you've heard of Reverse, that chemical company [Union Carbide Company?] in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34988
Speaker 1: I was getting ready to say, there are times which you get a chance to go off base, I suspect, or maybe not, at Tuskegee [Alabama].  Did you ever have that opportunity?
Speaker 2: Go up to Atlanta [Georgia], yes.  A couple, most of the social life was at Tuskegee Institute.
Speaker 1: What was the off-campus life like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, usually--.  Tuskegee was between forty miles from Montgomery [Alabama] and forty miles from Columbus, Georgia, right in the middle.  And the West Point Railroad went from Montgomery to Atlanta.  But you had to get over to Cheaha [Alabama] and get on the West Point Railroad to go to Atlanta, which is what--if you get a three-day pass, that's where you would go.
Speaker 1: But, my, where I'm going with this is--here you are from Chicago [Illinois], which is basically in some ways, the North.  And you're down South.  What was it like in terms of race relations?  Anything?  Good, bad?
Speaker 2: No, we had very little contact with people outside of our training.
Speaker 1: And on the base, what was, did you have--not necessarily you, but maybe someone else--have any encounters with the black, I'm sorry, the white officers?  Any problems that you ever--?
Speaker 2: I had all kinds of problems.  (laughter)  But they weren't--they had to be internalized, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there any that you encountered?
Speaker 2: You know, it, they just rolled right off my shoulder.  But--
Speaker 1: Just more of a sense--
Speaker 2: That's part of the--
Speaker 1: It's part of it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were a lot of the officers maybe also from the South?  That's what I keep hearing, a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the, but it was a very professional relationship.  We were, and you know, they would haze you occasionally.  But--
Speaker 1: But maybe a lot of that was countered with the bond--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that was developing--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --by the cadets, and by--. Yeah.
Story_ID: 34989
Speaker 1: And so, when you're getting ready to go to Europe, I think, 1944--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh huh.
Speaker 1: --1944.  What was your rank before you, just--
Speaker 2: Well, they had--lieutenant, second lieutenant, I think.  They had--you know, the [U.S.] Army, the regular Army grudgingly allowed us to be commissioned officers.  And they had invented a rank called a flight officer, which would be comparable to a warrant officer, not any ranking.  Usually, it was a specialty sort of thing in order to--in other words, be--
Speaker 1: So, how did that feel, to be commissioned as an officer and a gentleman and have that silver bar on your shoulder?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, you know, it was--again, it was a hurdle you had to cross.  And you had a certain gratification of having gotten that far, yeah.
Speaker 1: Thanks, excellent.  Okay, so you're then shipped over to England, I believe.
Speaker 2: To--
Speaker 1: No, I mean--correct me.
Speaker 2: North Africa.
Speaker 1: North Africa, okay.  North Africa.
Speaker 2: Sicily.
Speaker 1: Sicily.
Speaker 2: And then the West Coast of Italy.
Speaker 1: And you're part of a fighter group?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what was--?
Speaker 2: 15th Air Force.
Speaker 1: 15th Air Force, thank you.
Speaker 2: Based in Bari, Italy, right at the hill of the boot.
Speaker 1: And this is, you know, part of an all-black squadron?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: The 15th Air Force was comparable to the 8th Air Force, which was a (unclear) group from England, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, what was--what was your first combat encounter?  What did you--?
Speaker 2: Usually, the Ploesti oil fields in Romania.
Speaker 1: Romania.  And you were escorting bombers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and doing a lot of strafing, in leading the move, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the--in Germany.  And we had a getting (unclear), across the Alps.  Then the missions were generally targeted installations that they wanted knocked out.
Story_ID: 34990
Speaker 1: And what fighter plane were you flying at that time [15th Air Force, Europe, World War II]?
Speaker 2: Well, we started with the--there were two kinds of engines--the radial engine, which is air cooled.  And, you know, there were the pistons, arranged around the dial-over clock.  That's a radial engine.  And then the carrier part in driving is an inline engine with the pistons, you know, arranged, liquid cool.  And the--.  So, the aircraft that we flew were inline engines, single seated for pilot apprenticeships.  The first one was a Curtiss Warhawk P-40.  And the first one I flew had tiger insignias on it.  The tiger, those were used in the China Burma Flying Tigers.  Did you hear about them?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The first planes ever delivered to us still had the Flying Tiger insignia on them.
Speaker 1: And so, you're flying P-40s--
Speaker 2: That was the first one.
Speaker 1: Against--
Speaker 2: It was a beautiful ship.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Built by Curtiss.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: I know a little bit about military aircraft--
Speaker 2: And some of us were trained in the P-47.
Speaker 1: Right, Thunderbolt.
Speaker 2: Right, the Republic.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was a high altitude, super-charged.
Speaker 1: So you're flying the P-40, the P-47, which you know, are--
Speaker 2: And the P-38.
Speaker 1: P-38.
Speaker 2: Bell Aircraft.
Speaker 1: Twin engine, the Lightning.
Speaker 2: No. (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll let you speak.
Speaker 2: The Bell Carrier Airacobra.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you know about that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That is a distinctive feature of it.
Speaker 1: It's a relatively small plane that I saw.  The single engine, after that I don't remember.
Speaker 2: The first Volkswagen had the engine in back.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the P-40, P-38 had the engine in back, too.
Speaker 1: Oh, very good.  I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Well, not only that, it throws off the--you know, an aircraft is in, flies in four-dimensions.  And the center of gravity is always in front, usually.  But with the engine in back, guess what?  The center of gravity is--
Speaker 1: In the back.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And guess what?  An airplane has to guard against first of all, stalls.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So the engine in front, the nose goes down, because the center of gravity is in front.  If you have the center of gravity in back, how do you stall?  Not nose front, but tail back, and you don't get out of it.  So, we gave them all to the Russians, and that started the Cold War.
Speaker 1: Thank you for that background on that.
Story_ID: 34991
Speaker 1: Because where I was going was, you're flying, you know, P-40s--the P-47 Thunderbolt and P-38 [15th Air Force, Europe, World War II].  And eventually you get to, I think, one of the best fighter planes in World War II, which is the P-51 Mustang.
Speaker 2: In every respect, except--
Speaker 1: And you could tell me about--not so much about the machine, but it's what it's like to fly in combat situations, how much better a plane that you had against the German planes?
Speaker 2: Well, the Germans, you know, they bragged about German engineering.  And I--the guy who built the best engine we flew, didn't have an American engine in it.
Speaker 1: The P-51?
Speaker 2: It started off with the Allison engine, then made by Packard.  And then the Germans had Daimler.  They built the engines for the Messerschmitt [German aircraft manufacturing corporation].  Daimler is, it's been around during--
Speaker 1: Mercedes Benz.
Speaker 2: Right.  (unintelligible)--something about--
Speaker 1: But you were getting ready to say that the Germans had acquired--
Speaker 2: They were manufactured by either, by Daimler, or by BMW.  And the 440 (unclear) had the BMW ball bearings and engine in them.  And both of them were very good.  The Germans know how to put together--.  And so do Japanese.
Speaker 1: But which was--
Speaker 2: Mitsubishi (unintelligible).  And had all my folks in Detroit [Michigan] looking for jobs.
Speaker 1: Right.  But you had the P-51.  Once you had the P-51, did you feel you could out-fly anybody, that is, in terms of the Germans?
Speaker 2: Of course, you know, Daimler also invented the jet toward the end of the war.
Speaker 1: The Me 262, and another jet, if I remember correctly.
Speaker 2: And Messerschmitt 262, right.  And they pioneered jet aviation, right.  I think the best plane I flew in was a North American built engine fuselage, and all these instruments.  Everything was built except the engine.  And that was built by Maryland, or Rolls Royce.  And the best we flew had a Rolls Royce engine, right.
Speaker 1: So, the P-51 was an American part?
Speaker 2: The 51, yeah.
Speaker 1: But the engine was from the British.
Speaker 2: British, right.  They knew how to build engines, right.
Speaker 1: Right, thank you.
Speaker 2: A Rolls Royce, right.
Story_ID: 34992
Speaker 1: So, going up to 1945--1944, 1945--you're flying combat missions, strafing missions, bomber escort.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The war ends in Europe in May.  I think 1945, if I remember correctly.  Where were you in May of 1945?
Speaker 2: In Italy, waiting to go, to be deployed in an advanced contingent.  The war was still going on in the Pacific.
Speaker 1: So, you're in Italy, and still have maybe possible orders to go to the Pacific?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Between May and August, 1945, you're in Italy.
Speaker 2: Kind of floating around.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Floating around.  How did it feel when they, when the war was officially over--August, I forget the exact date, 1945.
Speaker 2: You know, I couldn't wait to get back into civilian life, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'd gotten hold of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act.  The Service--hold on a second.
Speaker 1: Take your time.
Speaker 2: The Servicemen's Readjustment Act [of 1944], that's the G.I. Bill of Rights.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And everybody looked at all those goodies.  I couldn't wait to get back to civilian life.
Speaker 1: And you end up ending your tour in 1946, right?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Story_ID: 34993
Speaker 1: And you return to Chicago [Illinois; in 1946; after World War II ends]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and go to, back to Loyola [University].
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So, how was that?
Speaker 2: It was an adjustment, you know, sort of.  I was in a hurry to make up time, to recover--you know, to get my life back in order.  And I finally graduated from Loyola in '49 [1949], June 1st--June 10th of 1949 in a theater there on Sheridan [Avenue].
Speaker 1: What did you get your degree in?
Speaker 2: Just the liberal arts.
Speaker 1: Bachelor of Arts?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  And then I had, I wanted--you know, I had a chance to go into the coffee business right after college.  I was going to be a coffee millionaire.  I didn't have sense enough to do what Starbucks did, but-- (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you were going to make tons of money selling coffee?
Speaker 2: At that time the migration was in full-fledge, and the folks coming up from--usually Mississippi and Tennessee, Alabama and Texas, Arkansas.  There's--the main line of the railroads, Illinois Central, had two trains--Powerball Limited, which was a long Pullman accommodation.  That was the white folks, for rich white folks.  And it left the old Fort Southern--Roosevelt and 12th Street station, and ended up in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And coming back, there was another train called the City of New Orleans, which had twenty-four coaches--two for the white folks, and well, eventually we got a diner.  And the other twenty coaches, for us.
Story_ID: 34994
Speaker 1: Mr. James, in 1949, you finished at Loyola [University].  But also that same year, you became married to your wife Mary.
Speaker 2: Mary Gallaway.
Speaker 1: Mary Gallaway.  When did you first meet?
Speaker 2: In '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: And where did you meet, just was wondering?
Speaker 2: We met at the Friendship House.
Speaker 1: Was that here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 41st under the "El" [train] was an outreach center sponsored by concerned Catholics to provide an opportunity for the races to meet under not stressful--without stress, you know, in a natural way, so that we could become familiar with each other's problems.  And what we did, some of them would get together to advance the--
Speaker 1: So, was it--
Speaker 2: --equality.
Speaker 1: --love at first sight, or what--?
Speaker 2: For me, yeah, for me.  I'm sure she was very busy, you know, getting adjusted.  But--
Speaker 1: What was she doing at the time?  Was she in school?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a lawyer.  And she was educated at a Catholic women's college, Marymount [College], in Tarrytown [New York] on the Hudson where the, an order of French nuns taught--which were comfortable or privileged white girls, preparing them, you know, to marry a rich, comfortable white man.  And they were teaching all the social graces--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --with education on the side.
Speaker 1: Where was she originally from--back East, or here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, she was from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  And she became radicalized, I guess.  She had to take the Northwestern from Fond du Lac to Chicago to get on another train going to New York.  And at that time in 1937, she had to pass through the worst of the slums on the south side.  And she never knew that Americans lived in that kind of squalor.  And she had their heads (unclear) and couldn't, you know--just house to house, squalor to squalor--and little kids being neglected, and all that sort of thing.  And she started asking questions, you know, when she got there.  And they would start giving her stupid answers, you know. "They like to live like that, and there's nothing you can do about them, they're lazy," and all.
Speaker 1: Like you said, she got radicalized--a kind of eye-opening experience, for her to see that side of the world. Fond du Lac is up in Central Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: It's right on the tip of--the name Fond du Lac--bottom of the lake, right on the edge of Lake Winnebago.
Speaker 1: Thank you, thank you.  And so, you end up meeting in 1946.  A courtship for a couple of years?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't, never, we worked together.  And she had, she was in charge of the children's program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34995
Speaker 1: And I volunteered in that program [children's program] at the school.  And we were, it was a gathering for Catholic intellectuals.  And there was a lot of discussion, a lot of debating about the future of the church and the African American.  And we were involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  She [James' future wife at the time, Mary Gallaway] was a founding member of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  And one of the experiences I had with her--and it was kind of a date--was the sitting in on the Walgreen's on Randolph and State, that luncheon counter.  They didn't serve blacks.
Speaker 2: This is here in Chicago?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, Chicago and State.  And there were a lot of places like that.  And we sat in, demanding service, and nothing happened.  And CAPS [Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy], well, they knew that we were part of a group that sponsored, that had connections with the Mayor's Office.
Speaker 2: And when was that, about?
Speaker 1: 1946.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.
Story_ID: 34996
Speaker 1: I'm going to just jump forward just a little bit.  It's 1950, and you've been married a year or so.  And you joined Burroughs [Corporation]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Company as a salesperson?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, you know, this was--computers hadn't been discovered then.  And they had a full line of business machines that were operated--posting machines, billing machines, and calculators.  And but the, it was an initiation of--they had a very primitive data processing machine.  And at that time, things like magnetic ink codes were just being discovered.  And I saw that as the future of the world, you know.  There were going to be people who were familiar with data processing, and our firm had a future with that.
Speaker 1: And you were a salesperson?  I'm trying to understand--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you the first African American salesperson?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  Hired by them. It's kind of interesting.  Burroughs was headquartered in Detroit [Michigan].  But the president, Kent Brement (ph), was from Montreal [Canada].  And Montreal had a baseball team.  And a guy by the name of Jackie Robinson [first African American to play in Major League Baseball] played on that team, and eventually came to the--broke the line.  And Kent Brement (ph) bought-it's time at Burroughs--had hired a Jackie Robinson.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Also, that was in some ways an offshoot of Jackie Robinson's--
Speaker 2: Legacy.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) his job to Kent Brement (ph).  Kent Berment (ph) was a Montreal fan, and followed Jackie's career, and decided that Burroughs ought to have a--(laughter).
Speaker 1: That's an amazing story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is. It really is.  And he told me that story when I first--I had to go up to for a little, for full-line training at the factory in Detroit.  I stayed in a fancy athletic club, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: How about the other salesmen that you worked with [at Burroughs Corporation]?
Speaker 2: From all over the world.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: How did they accept you as an individual, generally speaking?
Speaker 2: And of course, you know, Jackie Robinson, of course, was a big item.  And I'm just another experiment, you know.  Jackie Robinson wasn't--the [Chicago] Cubs were way away from hiring one.  And the White Sox were no better, either.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No better off, either.
Story_ID: 34997
Speaker 1: Now, down the road a few years later, I took note that you worked at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  But I didn't have much information.  What did you do at the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: At the French House, there was a guy by the name of Emil Sotogo (ph).  He happened to be the president of the Talman Savings and Loan Association, a very devout Catholic.  And he was the chairman of the Metropolitan Housing and Development Committee.  And the neighborhood committee decided the future of the city--slum clearing, clearance, and all that--.  And they asked me to serve on it.  And I did.  And one day, and I was in the middle of--I had a territory with--very close to the Loop, with a lot of light manufacturing.  But I knew that whole area, and I knew a lot of people who ran the businesses.  And they were discussing something, and they were way off, you know.  And finally I intervened, and I said, "You know, I know this area, and I think some of the assumptions you're making are not based on fact."  So, I lectured them on that.  And Maurice F. Donahue was the dean of the University College.  At that time, Chicago had a University College.  And it was started by William Rainey Harper, who was brought out from Yale [University] to establish the University of Chicago, with Rockefeller [Foundation] money.  They were good, devout Baptists.  And he took a Baptist college and moved it to the Midway, and started the University of Chicago, and started training.  At that time, all the state colleges, state universities, were cow colleges.  They were started by [President] Abraham Lincoln under the Land Grant Program.  And they were called land grant colleges--University of Illinois--all of the Big Ten schools were land grant colleges.  My father-in-law bought his prized cow from the University of Michigan Agricultural College in Lansing [Michigan].  It later became Michigan State University.  But when Rainey came here in 1895, he was appalled at the--he did a study of the Chicago Public Schools.  And he was appalled at the--
Speaker 1: The conditions that students were--?
Speaker 2: --the lack of credentials of the public school teachers, which were basically appointed by the--.  You know, they had no discernible credentials.  And he established the University College to give them after-school training in, you know, teacher training.  And then he had the commerce schools, there was a big, you know, that was a cash cow.  And the university, in the middle of my tenure, decided that they had already trained the professors for the grant land colleges, and not in the institutions of instruction.  And they're going to become an institution of emphasis on research.  And the first thing they did was to close the University College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34998
Speaker 1: Jumping, moving forward a bit, 'cause you've got some other interesting experiences obviously later on.  In 1961, you become, you become employed with the State of Illinois as a Deputy Director.  Which department was that?
Speaker 2: I was called the Minority Representative, appointed by Otto Kerner [33rd Governor of Illinois from 1961 to 1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And according to the questionnaire, your job, you were involved in the War on Poverty.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, can you tell us more about that, please?
Speaker 2: Of course, one of the first jobs I did for Kerner was to do--the candidates got in office, they got very interested in Appalachia.  And one of the first demonstration projects was the Appalachian Project.  And it was an effort to raise the quality of life in Appalachia.  And it included the five most southern counties of Illinois.  That was part of the Appalachian project.  And I was assigned to that.
Speaker 1: You were working on the War in Poverty, not in Chicago [Illinois], but in Southern Illinois?
Speaker 2: When I got the job, you know, with Kerner, there were 102 counties in Illinois.  Kerner said that we're operating, we can operate in 101 counties and Cook County outside of Chicago, but we cannot operate in Chicago.
Speaker 1: And that's the governor of the State of Illinois saying that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I had to get an appointment to see the Mayor of Chicago, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, working in the War on Poverty and all these other counties in Illinois, did you travel a great deal, or?
Speaker 2: A great deal.  I had to set up committee action programs all across the state, right.
Speaker 1: Southern Illinois in some ways was pretty much the South, if I remember.
Speaker 2: It still had segregated schools.  And I had to bring the word that--
Speaker 1: So, you had to deal with the county officials?
Speaker 2: Superintendent of Schools.
Speaker 1: Was that, how was that experience overall?
Speaker 2: It was very, you know, they knew it was coming.  This was before the Civil Rights Acts were--Kerner had named-[President John F.] Kennedy had promulgated an executive order, 10925, which prohibited any discrimination in hiring or advancement in federal establishments.  And that applied to contractors.  So that was a big--.  And this before the Civil Rights Act.  Of course, Kennedy had died.  And LBJ [President Lyndon B. Johnson], who knew what he was doing--.
Story_ID: 34999
Speaker 1: Speaking of President [John F.] Kennedy, in 1963 you graduated from DePaul University College of Law [Chicago, Illinois], which is outstanding.  But a lot of things took place that year.  J.F. Kennedy was assassinated, Dr. [Martin Luther] King made his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, and his March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Was that a pivotal year for you in some ways?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: You graduating, and all these other things going on?
Speaker 1: I was in the fortunate--and I guess the interesting--trying to catch up, you know.  Events were moving so vastly that the--Al Raby--is that a name that means--?
Speaker 2: I've heard of it, but maybe you can tell us.
Speaker 1: Al Raby was, had gotten, he was a former teacher in the public schools.  He had a civil acts rights organization under another umbrella that he headed, called CCCO [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations].  And it was an organization, a civil rights organization, "coco"--a coordinating committee of a civil rights organization.  And we invited a guy by the name of Martin Luther King, who had his Southern Christian Leadership Council [SCLC].  The problem was that we were very cozy in our own relationships--the Urban League, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And suddenly all these guys from the South, you know, were kind of (laughter) teaching us a lesson or two.  (laughter).  So, we invited them up and then we got a relationship between himself, (unclear) and the rest of us.
Speaker 2: So, when was that, that Dr. King--was that when he came to Chicago?
Speaker 1: Right.  Just about, just before the, during that time--'64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: During the time that--
Speaker 2: Did you get a chance to meet Dr. King?
Speaker 1: Oh, a lot.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Speaker 1: And he's the one that, he spoke on the Village Green in Winnetka.  And before that, every time he appeared before a predominantly white audience, a riot ensued.  And I was accompanying him to the speech on the Village Green.  We have a memorial now to that event.
Story_ID: 35000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember--I'm from back east in Connecticut.  I remember when he went through Chicago and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all the rocks being thrown.  He said he'd never seen such racism.
Speaker 2: Exactly, he's right.  And so, and we're dealing with that.  What impressed me about--.  There were five thousand on the Village Green listening to him.  You could hear a pin drop.  And this was not Marquette Park and Craigin [unclear] and all those places that threw rocks at him.  And the, I belonged to the North Shore Council trying to attract non-whites, you know, to--
Speaker 1: Well, we'll get to that.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.  But just, I'm trying not to go too far with this question.  But you met Dr. King, associated face to face with him--
Speaker 2: Jesse Jackson--
Speaker 1: But back to Dr. King, since he's such a monumental person in history.  What did you think about him as a person, just meeting him?  Not so much as public--
Speaker 2: First time?
Speaker 1: First time.
Speaker 2: Baptist preacher.  He was the only one who appeared with us, you know, that's the only thing.  It was, it was Al Raby's idea.  We didn't need them.  We were doing fine, you know.  I was the minority representative, and I know black folks, what they need. (laughter)
Speaker 1: So he's this southern minister.  He's gotten a name--
Speaker 2: A Baptist preacher.
Speaker 1: Baptist preacher.  He's getting popular in 'Jet' and 'Ebony' and people are saying we've got to get this Dr. King up to Chicago.  But--
Speaker 2: That was Al Raby's idea, not David James' idea.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Thank you, okay.  I just was wondering.  Okay, thank you.  Later on--
Speaker 2: When I got up there--
Speaker 1: Yeah, later on, you--
Speaker 2: Turn me on my, you know--
Speaker 1: You became a convert.
Speaker 2: It made me realize how far, you know, how irrelevant our efforts were.  We were not just not gradualist but, you know, the best way I can describe it--one of my good friends told me, he said, "You guys outside of CCCO are carbuncles on the ass of progress." (laughter)
Speaker 1: But like you say, there's a lot going on at that point and time.  There's Dr. King, the Nation of Islam, riots taking place later on in Detroit [Michigan].  So, in hindsight, everyone says well, Dr. King was the man.  But at that time, he was still upon his rise.
Speaker 2: Well, oh yeah, definitely.  And of course, he didn't just, he did not get a--you know, the welcome sign was not open, you know, waved in his direction.  And official Chicago was very skeptical of--you know, they had problems in the South, and they're dealing with them.  And that's great, you know, but keep it down there.  It was a territorial thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A turf battle.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Story_ID: 35001
Speaker 1: Moving forward a bit, in 19--a little bit later.  It's 1967, I believe, you became hired by the American Bar Association [ABA]?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And also--well, we'll talk a little bit about moving to Winnetka [Illinois].  I want to make sure I get the timeframes right.  But you become the first African American attorney, I believe, to work at the ABA.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: That's outstanding.  What did you do?  What were your responsibilities there?
Speaker 2: I was in the public service activity division, and eventually became the director of it.  And I set up, I helped initiate the CLEO Program, Council of Legal Education and Opportunity.
Speaker 1: I was trying to remember, because I became a, I was a member before law school, CLEO.  I couldn't remember what it stood for.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: Well, I started that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then in 1967, if I understand the dates--is that when you moved to Winnetka?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And became the first African American homeowner in Winnetka.  Tell me about that.  I'm sure it was a great deal of resistance to--
Speaker 2: We had a support group that--some of them from the Jewish community--Glencoe and Highland Park are not predominantly, but there's a--Glencoe particularly has a large contingent of Jewish--and Highland Park.  And we had a large support group from Glencoe and Highland Park.  And I think--and the kids are kind of interesting.  They talk about the difference between moving from the south side to Winnetka.  And it has to do with expectation, and the things that the privileged--and what people take for granted.  For instance, every household in Winnetka that had children had a children's phone.  And all you had to do--It was in the '445'.  All you had to do in the children's phone was dial the last four numbers, and you could reach your other children's phone. (laughter)  And they noticed that, you know, just the--much had to do with what they could have aspired to, you know.  New Trier [High School] wasn't, was not, wasn't--you know, where 95, 98 percent of the student body goes on to a four-year college.
Story_ID: 36604
Speaker 1: So, Mr. James, you move, end up in Winnetka [Illinois] on the South Shore, or south side.  Why Winnetka versus Evanston [Illinois], or some other community which may have been integrating at the same time?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the--one of the great reformers in public education was the superintendent of Winnetka's schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in any event, I knew about his reputation and about his schools.  And I had, my oldest son was already in college, at Shimer [College, Chicago, Illinois].  And the other five were in the elementary schools--.  And one in college, just entering high school.  And the educational offerings were, you know, for me was the lure.  And Chicago Public Schools were in a steep decline at that time.  And I had the problem of either sending them to private schools or some other alternative.  And when the opportunity to move to Winnetka presented itself, that solved that problem.
Speaker 1: You and your wife [Mary Gallaway] were in agreement it's going to be Winnetka, or Evanston or--?
Speaker 2: Any school that, any district that had a decent public school system.
Speaker 1: And I know a little bit about the history of Evanston.  Just some--was Evanston more integrated at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, it's always had a sizeable black minority population.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we used to always regard the black people when I was growing up in Evanston--the blacks in Evanston were similarly situated as the blacks that lived in Woodlawn.  They had a great high school to go to, and prospects.
Story_ID: 36605
Speaker 1: I want to talk about your family, and the impact of making that move.  And I don't think I did this.  You had six children?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: What were their names?  And if you could give the oldest to the youngest and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  David, and he was at Shimer at the time.  He never really lived in Winnetka.  But Tom was entering high school.  Mary was entering eighth grade.  Peter, about the fourth grade.  And Ann was second grade.  And Cathy was, I think, in kindergarten.  She went all the way through the public school system in Winnetka.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you've got five children in Winnetka.  Your oldest--
Speaker 2: Public school.
Speaker 1: Public school-
Speaker 2: And they integrated--
Speaker 1: So, what was--I'm not going too far with this, hopefully.  What was their attitude overall, especially when they're just starting there, at New Trier [High School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think in the beginning with Tom and Mary--compared to what they had--you know, all the goodies (laughter), they used to call them.  Tom just got back from the wedding of Carl Robinson.  His daughter just was married up in Michigan, in that area just below the peninsula, whom he met--the day he was enrolled at New Trier, Carl Robinson.  And he's going to attend the wedding of Rob and his daughter, who we met that same day.  And they had been life-long friends, and Andy Cohen.  And all three of them have been inseparable.
Speaker 1: These are friends of Tom?
Speaker 2: Tom, yeah.  And Mary had a similar experience, and certainly did Peter, of course.  Carl Washburn was an innovator.  He was the president of his class there at New Trier.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He had always been a big man on campus.
Speaker 1: So maybe transitioning, their experience at the beginning was maybe challenging for them.  But by the time, a couple of years later, they all adjusted to the--
Speaker 2: They just melted right into the scenery.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Speaker 2: And Mary Ann had a little problem.  One of the, one of her classmates called her a nigger.  And this poor kid--until he left out of the community--they used to call him "Billy Bigot."  (laughter)
Speaker 1: But overall, the experience for them was positive?
Speaker 2: Very positive, very positive.  They had a lot of friends.  We lived on Spruce.  And the Spruce Street gang lived in my house.  And she's in touch with all of them just about.  All of us are still--
Story_ID: 36606
Speaker 1: And your wife [Mary Gallaway], both of you apparently became very active, maybe in part because she was radicalized before, in North Shore community activities.  One in particular was TWIG, "Together We Influence Growth."  And I'll talk about another one in a little bit.  But what was that about, TWIG?  Was it a day camp or?
Speaker 2: It was a day camp.  But more than that, my kids were--having been dropped among all of this privilege, wondered about, "What about my kid?  What about my friends back on Indiana Avenue?  What about them?  You know, they don't have, you know, this."  And so, we invited--we got together a group of kids through the public school system in Winnetka [Illinois], using their facilities.  Eventually, I began a summer camp where we invited children from the south side to a day camp--an eight week day camp where they--and it has its own history.  But it has survived.
Speaker 1: It still exists today?
Speaker 2: Oh, we have a--we had a problem getting suburban campers initially when we started out.  This year we had 125 campers, probably 75 white, and the rest of them from the city.  Unfortunately, it's become--fortunately--we used to draw from the various public housing projects.  And now, the base is in the Jackson Park Highlands. (laughter)  It's become a middle class thing, just about.
Speaker 1: And I think you were talking about Dr. [Martin Luther] King before, speaking at the Village Green.  Was that Winnetka's?  Where was the Village Green when he spoke?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, in Winnetka, right.
Speaker 1: It was back in the mid-60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there was another organization that you helped found, the North Shore Inter-Faith Housing Council.  What was that?
Speaker 2: Well, the whole purpose was to attract, open up, the communities on the North Shore to people of color.  And it's still going.  And I got into all kinds of activities that--making housing opportunities available to people who would not otherwise have that opportunity.
Speaker 1: And that's in the North Shore?
Speaker 2: It's based in Winnetka.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But in terms of sort of trying to help African American or other folks of diverse backgrounds--you're talking about the North Shore--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and integration?
Speaker 2: Right.  Opening up the communities and making them welcoming.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 36607
Speaker 1: And somewhere in the late '80s [1980s], you become an administrative law judge for the Department of Labor?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that was in the Unemployment Compensation Program, right.
Speaker 1: So, you handled a lot of administrative--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --cases?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy that work?  Did you enjoy it?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah, and particularly after I retired from the American Bar [Association; ABA], right.
Speaker 1: That's something I was also going to ask you.
Speaker 2: I didn't--well, I worked for the American Bar Association four out of five weekends.  I was in another city with another bar association, one of the sections dealing with lawyer problems.
Speaker 1: Very good.  Then later on, about 1990 or so, you went back, you went into private practice.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where was your--where were you based?  Up in the suburbs or in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, in Chicago, 25 North Clark.
Speaker 1: What kind of legal work did you specialize in?
Speaker 2: You know, I just, a lot of my friends had--I had started getting calls from old friends whose husband just died, lifelong friends of mine saying that--usually they had accumulated sizeable assets.  And the wife would typically say, "David, John didn't leave a Will, and I haven't the foggiest notion--" And suddenly I realized I had a probate practice.  And that's when I realized I almost specialized in it.
Speaker 1: You did that for about ten years or so?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  And then the kids decided--yeah, it was about that time.  But it was a very relaxed practice.  I did what I wanted to do.  So--
Speaker 1: So, you had a nice clientele?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: You didn't have to be a rainmaker, or chasing--.
Speaker 2: None of that, no.
Speaker 1: Good for you.  That's outstanding.  So, you enjoyed the practice?
Speaker 2: I did, right.  So, I got involved with some other things, right.
Speaker 1: That's good, that's good.
Story_ID: 36608
Speaker 1: Then in 2008, this young man, Barack Obama, becomes President of the United States.  And in 2009, his inauguration takes place.  And he invites all Tuskegee Airmen who are able and willing and choose to go, to go.
Speaker 2: I did.  And one of the happy memories--a lot of happy memories--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What was that like?  Give us a couple of those memories, if you could.
Speaker 2: Well, we were given the red carpet treatment.  We had to, we all were asked to meet at the base right outside of Washington [District of Columbia] where the [U.S.] Army, I mean the [U.S.] Air Force, gave us a delightful breakfast and furnished the buses to the Inauguration and to the [U.S.] Capitol, where we had an area roped off for us.  And there were a couple of events afterwards that we appeared to, we appeared.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to shake his hand or?
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.  (laughter)  And he was, he was really on the move, you know.  He had a million folks out there waiting to see him.
Speaker 1: About how many Tuskegee Airmen do you think showed up, a ballpark number?
Speaker 2: Oh around, less than a hundred.  But you know, we had--you know, I'm ninety [years old] and I was one of the younger ones.  But it was, it was--you know, it was a memorable occasion.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you get a chance to see other Tuskegee Airmen periodically as a group?
Speaker 2: Well, we had an organization here, the "Dodo Club."  And the, you know, the vicissitudes of oh, just arranging something like that.  I belong to an alumni group of my high school [Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And we meet in one of the restaurants on the northwest side.  And we meet at two o'clock, because that's when the senior discount goes into effect.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: That's good.
Speaker 2: But we had an informal chairman of our group.  And in the last two months, the first one died.  And the second one died, who took his place.  And we decided not to have a chairman anymore.  (laughter)
Story_ID: 36609
Speaker 1: Well, we're going to be, I'm going to be going to some legacy questions in a few minutes.  But one area I wanted to touch on, I think, was your children.  Because you, I know you're very proud of your children.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Did you want to say something about them a little bit.  Because I, I occasionally would say, so-and-so went to college.  Did you have anything you wanted to add about them?
Speaker 2: Well, my oldest [David James] teaches at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].  He's the co-chairman of the math department.  He has a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in math.  My number two son, Tom [Thomas James], lives about a mile from here, in Rogers Park [Illinois].  He's the only one who lives in Chicago. He's an assistant attorney general, and he went to the University of California Law School in Berkeley [California].  My number three daughter graduated from Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] with a Ph.D. in physics.  And she now teaches, and has been teaching, at Reed College [Oregon].  Her two best friends graduated at the same time she graduated, and got their Ph.D.s at the same time.  Melissa Franklin is the chairman of the physics department at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and the first woman tenured in the physics department.  And the other one is the head of the physics department at Stanford.  And both of them are very close, they're very close to Mary.  Then my fourth child, Peter Francis James, teaches at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He's an actor.  And he graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London [England].  And my baby, she's the one in the picture there with Nancy, she has a, runs a--she graduated from Harvard and--
Speaker 1: And what's, I'm sorry, what's her name again?
Speaker 2: Catherine.
Speaker 1: Catherine, thank you.
Speaker 2: And she's the head of the Maxine Walker Clinic in San Francisco [California].  She's the medical director.
Speaker 1: And I'm getting a little ahead of my subject.  Did we get Ann in there?  Ann?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And she teaches at, she directs a recreational center in Cincinnati [Ohio], yeah.
Speaker 1: That covers the children, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: I know you are very proud of them, and I wanted to give you an opportunity--I appreciate it.

Speaker 1: Well, I have a couple of kind of closing questions that are legacy questions, and I just wanted to get your thoughts.  When you look back at your life--you've done a number of great things--what stands out the most for you?
Speaker 2: In--?
Speaker 1: In whatever way you see it--career, family, whatever.
Speaker 2: You know, I have eight grandchildren, and seven of them are girls.  One just graduated from, graduated from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And she's in Ghana.  And the other graduated from the University of Wisconsin--ah, Illinois.  And she still is hovering between--she wants to be a psychologist, and she's probably debating which graduate school she's going to go to.  The third one just graduated from Macalester [College] in St. Paul [Minnesota], and she's on her way to Turkey doing a graduate program there.  And the others are--one at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], one at Brown [University, providence, Rhode Island], and one at the girls' school in upstate--in Poughkeepsie, New York.  And the others are, you know, still in either graduate school--I only have one boy.  He's a junior in high school.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean the--
Speaker 1: What do you want folks to say about you, you know, fifty years or twenty years, or whatever, from now?
Speaker 2: You know, my children I think are the focal point of my aspirations--the despair that they have to deal with, in an atmosphere--.  The winds are blowing against them than behind them.   And the thing that--as I told you, my father [William Henry James] was very involved in the organizing--in organized labor.  And I guess the best way I can explain it--to me is, I had a very good friend of mine in Gary, Indiana.  He was a lawyer.  And when Bobby Kennedy was the attorney for the Kefauver Committee, and they were investigating organized crime, they had a hearing in Gary.  Gary had been a victim of some of the gambling, and that sort of thing.  And this friend of mine, you know, he said, "I'm sorry that the Kefauver Committee met there."  And he said, "You know, you see those smoke stacks?  They're not--no smoke is coming out of them."  He says, "When I see there's smoking coming out of it, I know that everybody has a job.  And when that smoke stack has no smoke coming out of it, everybody is laid off.  And the only guys that are making any money are the gamblers and the pimps and the whores."  And he said, "I don't want to live in an environment like that."  And you know--a robust economy that supplies jobs for everybody.  That to me is absolutely essential.  And the other thing that I lament is the dumping on the teachers, you know, which are the key of our opening the minds of young people.  We should be bettering them, rather than trying to figure out how to cut their pay and all that shit, you know.  Pardon me.  And I have nothing but--the kind of thing that went on in Detroit [Michigan], in Wisconsin--I went up to Madison [Wisconsin] to protest that bastard, and what he's doing, you know, trying to cut up the unions and deprive these women of a livelihood.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That we left no child behind, and that we invested in things that were conducive to their advancement.  The most, one of the tragedies that I remiss--You know, when Harold Washington was the mayor--he was a good friend of mine.  We all came out of the, graduated from DuSable [high school, Chicago, Illinois], and I graduated from Lane [Technical College Prep High School, Chicago] the same year.  And we were at Roosevelt [University?] together and helped start the National Student Association.  Harold, I was a dollar a year man [unclear] for Harold.  And he had great plans for the future of Chicago, and suddenly died prematurely.  But we were both agonizing over the deterioration of the Chicago public schools.  And just, you know, the bottom had--.  And when we went to the public school--we were part of the public school at that time--it was impossible to come out of that school not literate, not prepared for whatever the challenges life offered.  And then to see the school system, you know, just going--being trashed by all kinds of dumb things--and not having the investment, you know, in the future of young people.  Well, that really--that gets in my craw.  I just--anybody that, as I said, is a carbuncle on the ass of progress, I don't--nothing good to say about that.

Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to add to this?
Speaker 2: No, that's it, you know. Of course I still have--I remember I had a--talking about teachers.  I was the unintended beneficiary of a lot of teachers who had been kicked out of Germany by Hitler.  And one of them ended up, Dr. Walner [ph.], ended up in Lane Tech [Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois] teaching me history.  And he had been invested in this German notion of progress.  And that the human race is an intellectual road towards progress, and we had to be part of that.  And I'll never forget, he says--you know, I was sixteen [years old] at the time.  And it's the kind of vision he had for the future.  He said--and he had, we had just seen--they had just opened up the Cook County jail.  And Warden Sane was very proud of his new jail.  And he had a documentary that he (unclear) on public schools, high schools.  And we had an assembly to watch this.  And the next day, Mr. Walner had us--and I could see that seriousness about him.  He asked us all to sit down.  And he said, "Now, that movie you saw, that documentary--." He called it a documentary at that time.  He said, "That's one of the things we want to get rid of, are jails."  And he said--pointed to all of us, and he said, "The human race is like an electrical (unclear) path to progress.  And by the time you're grown up, there'll be no need for jails.  And (laughter) the human race has progressed to that point where nobody would think about--(laughter), There will be no crime."  And I often think about what Dr. Walner said, you know.  It was just--he was a fantastic guy.  And I thought, you know, here's a guy that Germany had cultivated, and you talk about Hitler being a carbuncle on the ass of progress.  He certainly was promulgating all sort of stuff.  But I can hear it now.
Speaker 1: Well, that's an amazing story about--
