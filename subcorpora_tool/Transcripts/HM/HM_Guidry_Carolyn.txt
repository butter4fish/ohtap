Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions we always ask.  They are light (simultaneous)--

Story_ID: 227613
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Your mother's side and your father's [James Jackson] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's name was Mary, M-A-R-Y, Katherine, K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, Wheaton, W-H-E-A-T-O-N, it's her maiden name.  Her married name, Phillips, P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 26, 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Laurel, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: All right.  All these names in Mississippi sound so familiar when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, actually Newton County [sic. Jones County, Mississippi] I guess it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: These names sound familiar because of the Civil Rights Movement, and you read (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --about Laurel--
Speaker 2: --you heard them--exactly, right.
Speaker 1: --and all those names, Greenwood [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back, first of all, can you trace (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Okay.
Speaker 1: --your ancestors?
Speaker 2: I know my mother's side of the family to my great-grandparents, I suppose.  My great-grandmother according to my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] was a full blooded Choctaw Indian [Native American].  I'm not sure about my great-grandfather but they originated, at least that part of the family in Newton County, Mississippi where my grandmother was born.  Her maiden name was Cole, C-O-L-E.  And, and so my grandmother and her siblings I knew for the most part, a sister, two sisters, a brother, who had not died before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories that go back to slavery or the Civil War or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: Not that I can really remember.  I remember more stories about my mother--my grandmother's sister and her family.  The kinds of, funny kinds of things that my great aunt would do with her family and that kind of thing, more than the, the great-grandparents, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there are no stories about the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --condition of the community in those days or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.  And, and, you know, I think, now that I'm older and I get asked this question and I think back and I think how much we've missed of our history because traditionally we don't ask questions.  And we kind of take for granted the people around us that we know, and I realize that that's, that's what happened.  When you ask me about my life beginning with my grandmother and that generation, then that's for me where my life began.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there's no stories of ancestors or anything like that?
Speaker 2: There probably are some that I don't recall except maybe if something triggers that.
Story_ID: 227614
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips] talk about growing up or?
Speaker 2: My mother and her siblings talked about growing up, yes, uh-huh.  And they grew up, as I said in Newton County, Mississippi until most of them were, there were six siblings, my mother had three brothers and two sisters.  And when they reached probably high school age, my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] moved then into Jackson, into the city, and they finished high school in Jackson, Mississippi.  And the interesting thing is, that my mother and all of her siblings finished high school, which was as I understand it, starting to be something that would happen, but it was kind of unusual in black families and at that time, even in that, that late time, you know.  But they talked about when, when they used to have to work, you know, in the fields, and I'm not sure what crops were grown in that area probably cotton and potatoes and that kind of thing, you know, and so she had stories about those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did they live out in a rural area or were they in the city or town (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  No, they lived in the rural area.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did they own land or sharecroppers, or?
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather, according to my grandmother, did own land.  A good number of blacks in that area of Mississippi owned land.  And I suppose for that time that was kind of unusual.  I remember that my great aunt and her husband had acres and acres of land when we'd go to visit them, you know, they had their own land.  His family was, their family was a large family and they worked their own land, worked for themselves, they did, I remember that they did logging, they--in that area.  And I think that's kind of unique to the Newton County area that there was a lot of logging, and that was what my uncle and his family did.
Story_ID: 227615
Speaker 1: You said your grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] told stories.  Do you remember some of those stories?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if I do or not (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or can you tell us a story or about sometime--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember my great aunt had these daughters, and at that time people were very strict with their daughters, you know.  And one of the stories that they told was my aunt would, would really keep a tight rein on them.  So when the girls reached the age where they were dating, one daughter was in a car, the boyfriend had a car, and so she was in the car with her boyfriend and some friends and they were going off, and then the other daughter was in a second car, and my aunt was trying to figure out how she could go in both cars, and so what she was doing was she'd say, "Hold that car!"  She wouldn't let either car go because she couldn't decide which one she wanted to go in until finally I think that the story goes that they wound up not going at all where ever it was they were gonna go because my aunt couldn't decide which car to ride in (laughter) with the girls so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So aunt--now, did your mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips] stay in--I mean did she eventually move to Jackson [Mississippi], did she?
Speaker 2: My mother moved her family to Jackson.  My grandmother and my grandfather, Isom Wheaton, who was the father of her children, lived in Newton County [Mississippi].  I don't know what happened to that marriage.  In the time when I grew up as a child, families didn't talk about what they considered the bad things around children.  And so I never really knew why my grandmother and my grandfather divorced but they did.  And my grandmother moved with her six children, teenagers, most of them, to Jackson, Mississippi where, as I said my mother and the younger siblings were in high school, finished high school in Jackson, Mississippi, so.  My grandmother was later remarried to a man named Dave Johnson [ph.] who was my step-grandfather.
Story_ID: 227616
Speaker 1: Now your mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips], now, well, can you tell us what your mother's personality was like and, you know, how she earned a living?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, the older I get the more I'm like my mother, I think, you know.  And there was a time growing up when I thought I'm never gonna be like my mother, and I guess I really am.  My mother was essentially a strong, self-sufficient kind of person.  However in my own life I think my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] was more influential.  And because I think I have to tell you something about the events of my own birth.  First of all, my mother was seventeen years old when I was born.  I was born out of wedlock at a time when it was not popular.  At a time when not only a young girl was ostracized by the community but her own family.  And my mother was seventeen, I was born, she was not married to my father [James Jackson].  And my, because I was the first grandchild in the family, my grandmother took me and, and raised me principally as her, as her own.  And so my mother was like a big sister to me for many years.  I knew she was my mother, I called her Madea, but my grandmother was Mama.  And my mother's influence in my life was greater after I was a teenager when my grandmother became ill and after my mother was married and I went to live with her.  But in the early years, she was like a big sister who did not live in our home by the time I was three or four years old.  And so, but my mother always worked.  During the war [World War II, WWII] she worked at what was a box company, a box factory where they made containers for ammunition.  And I can remember her coming to our house and sitting down and talking about the job and, and how much money they were making during the war years.  And my step-grandfather [Dave Johnson (ph.)], who could not read or write but was excellent with, with numbers and she would say to him, you know, "I make forty-five cents an hour," as an example, and I'm--and, "I've worked fifty-two hours this week, what should I expect?"  And within minutes, you know, he could just look up at the ceiling and, and tell her almost to the penny with deductions, how much her paycheck would be.  So I remember that my mother always had a job and that even though I grew up in Mississippi, in a black family during Jim Crow years, I can never, can never ever remember being in want and maybe I didn't know, I didn't know what to want for, but I always remember having a safe place, what felt like a safe place, a loving place, I always had whatever it was I needed.  I can remember at Easter time, in the black community Easter is important, you go to church, you go to Sunrise Service, you go to the eleven o'clock service, and then you go back in the afternoon for the children's Easter program.  And I can remember growing up those years because I had three uncles, two of them for the most part who were still living at home, my mother's youngest sister and my mother, my grandmother all around me.  And I can remember that on Easter Sunday I could wear one shirt, one dress to church in the, in the morning, and then I could come back and change in the afternoon and I'd have a whole new outfit.  It didn't seem important at the time, but now as I, as I'm older, and I, and I know what the times were like, that was significant.  That was important.  And it was important to my family.
Story_ID: 227617
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was James Edward Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his, do you know his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't.  And unfortunately, I know very little about my father's side of the family 'cause as I said I was born out of wedlock.  My father essentially was passing through town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't really know, did you know where he was from or where he was living (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I know that he was, he was from an area called Benton, Mississippi which is in Yazoo County, Mississippi.  And, and I know you've heard that one because they make jokes about it on the, on the late night shows.
Speaker 1: Yazoo City [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yazoo City.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I have a friend in Chicago [Illinois] from Yazoo City too.
Speaker 2: It's actually pronounced Yazoo.
Speaker 1: Yazoo.
Speaker 2: Yazoo (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I think the first black Congressional Medal of Honor winner was out of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  From Yazoo City.
Speaker 1: The Battle of Yazoo City.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I guess I'm pronouncing it right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, yeah, but that--yeah, okay.  But so you don't know much about, he was passing through and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know very little about him.
Speaker 1: So have you met any of the relatives on his side?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he has a sister who did live in, in Jackson [Mississippi] 'cause I'm not sure if she's still alive.  She had children that during high school I was friendly with because we knew we were related.
Story_ID: 227618
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the sights and sounds and the smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I think the sights were the people, the area [in Jackson, Mississippi].  We lived in quote the city but right in back of our house, one neighbor grew sweet potatoes during the year.  And I can remember when it was time to harvest that they would be plowing up the potatoes and, and then you'd go and pick them up and, and take the, the green top leaves off and the root, of course, then is, is the, is the, is the fruit, and that's thrown in the middle and somebody else would come along and throw them up in the big wagon.  And I can remember the smell of the dirt when it was plowed up and the potatoes were being harvested.  I remember how the dirt smelled on a rainy day when it had been dry for, for a long time.  And, and I remember outside in the yard, even on the street, playing barefoot so that the mud would come up between your toes, and my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] would say, "Girl get out of that mud!"  But those are the sights.  I remember playing with my friends along the street where the yards were connected, no fences, and, and we would, anybody who had a fence was somebody you didn't mess with because didn't want you on their property.  But for the most part there were no fences and so we played from one yard to the other from almost sun up to sun down, from breakfast time until dinner time as children, until we were old enough to work.  But I, and, and one of the sounds I remember is when it starts to get dark my grandmother would say, "[HistoryMaker Bishop] Carolyn [Tyler Guidry]!"  And she'd call my name and the last syllable would just hang in the air, that meant it was time to come home.
Story_ID: 227619
Speaker 1: Now your household consisted of your grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson], in those days, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  My grandmother--
Speaker 1: --who else?
Speaker 2: --her husband [Guidry's step-grandfather, Dave Johnson (ph.)], my mother's [Mary Wheaton Phillips] youngest sister, who is twelve years older, who was twelve years older than I am, and until the war [World War II, WWII], two uncles who didn't leave home until they were drafted.  And then, of course, when they came back they'd come on furlough and been married and so were out of the house after the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, mostly adults in your family.  Everybody was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I was the only, in fact, I was the only grandchild until four years later when my sister [Ruby Lott] was born and my first cousin, my uncle's son.  And I'm four years older than both my sister and my, and my, and my oldest cousin.
Speaker 1: And did they live with you too?
Speaker 2: No, they did not.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So you had grandma, and grandpa to yourself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I was grandma's baby.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 227620
Speaker 1: Now how would you describe yourself as a little girl, you know, what kind of little girl were you and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Curious.  And I guess because I grew up with adults, thought probably far beyond my number, my biological age most of my life.  When I was four years old one of the uncles who lived in our household taught me to read and I can remember he'd use comic books.  And, and he would allow me to, to read by looking at the pictures and saying, okay he's, he's jumping, the man is jumping over the wall or he's, you know, most of them I think were Superman and Spiderman comic books (laughter) and stuff like that.  And, and then he would cover the pictures and teach me to read the words.  So by the time I went to first grade at age six, 'cause then we didn't have kindergarten and preschool and, you know, and that, at age six I went to first grade, I had already learned to read.  And, and, and so I think that I was probably older than my chronological age all my life, except now I'm trying to backtrack (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you kinda were ahead of some of the other children in terms of then having all the adult role models?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think so.  I think so.  And, and the, there are some incidents that I think about.  I remember when, when I was about twelve and the boys started to get interesting to me at that point, I--this one boy I remembered who I liked and I think he liked me.  One day he came up and he kissed me on the cheek and ran away.  And I went like, boy he's stupid, if you're gonna kiss a girl you don't run away, (laughter) you know.  And I discovered then that I didn't like boys my own age.  So, of course, I wasn't old enough to date, my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] would have killed me (laughter) you know, but by the time I was old enough to date I realized I didn't like boys my age, I liked older boys.  And so subsequently I was married very young and my husband was actually eleven years older than me, which he didn't know until just before we got married, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well we have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  He thought I was older (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 227621
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school now.  What was the name of the grade school you attended?
Speaker 2: The actually, I think I put on there Mary C. Jones [Elementary School, Jackson, Mississippi].  Actually the first school, at first grade was St. Matthew, it was in a church, a Baptist church, St. Matthew [Missionary] Baptist Church [Flowood, Mississippi].  And the teacher, we had one teacher for eight grades.  And it was interesting because that one teacher controlled a whole room full of people.  And the eighth grades were housed in the single room of that church, one room church.  I mean no classrooms, just one big sanctuary.  And they would be divided, sometimes she have, would have partitions, and sometimes not.  But the kids who were in the eighth grade would help her with the younger ones when she was, for instance if she was doing third, fourth grade class, 'cause usually she could combine the first and second grades, and if she was doing a third and fourth grades, then the eighth graders would help her with the, with the first graders to keep them quiet and still, coloring or something like that.  And, and but it was a, it was a learning atmosphere.  And it's amazing that with all those grades and with one teacher, with no assistant teacher, no teacher's helper, just her, and when she spoke, everybody listened.  There was not a, I can remember that the quiet, the, the room would be quiet.  And, and today you go into a classroom with just one class, a teacher, and a couple of teachers assistants and, and you can hardly get anything done but it was not like that.
Speaker 1: Let me ask this question about that.  Now Jackson [Mississippi] at that time, probably still is the largest town in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The largest city in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Mississippi has, is the state (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well, Jackson is the capitol of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Yeah, is the capitol, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Mississippi is a state where you have, where the black population actually outnumbers the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --white population.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So you have a lot of black children I would imagine--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --living in Jackson?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And so you have a church, were there a lot of church schools like this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all over Jackson?
Speaker 2: All over.  And, it, but they were really located in areas.  St. Matthew Church served in the area where I lived called Virden's Addition [sic. Virden Addition, Jackson, Mississippi].  But in the west side there were other places.  And then there were some formal schools like in west Jackson, probably in south Jackson, downtown Farish Street area, that were more formal schools but in the area where we lived where it was all black, the schools were--the elementary schools were held in churches.  There was a high school, Lanier High School [Jackson, Mississippi], where blacks from all over Jackson attended.  And then finally they started a high school, Smith Robinson [sic. Smith Robertson School, Jackson, Mississippi] that the, that the blacks went.
Story_ID: 227622
Speaker 1: So now were these schools in the black communities supported by, you know, tax money (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, they were, they were public schools.
Speaker 1: --or state supported public schools. Public schools, okay.
Speaker 2: They were public schools, under that--
Speaker 1: Okay, so either the school or the church was--
Speaker 2: --under that separate but equal (laughter), if you believe that.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --well I just don't think the--now white kids weren't, you know, one room for all grade school I don't believe they were--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at that time, yeah.  In a church facility.
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.  Not during the time that I recall.  'Cause I remember that even when we walked to St. Matthew [Missionary Baptist Church, Flowood, Mississippi], while we did not have the buses passing us with white kids because there were no white kids in our area, they were always on the other side of town.  So we knew where the schools were because our parents worked at some of the schools, they were the janitors and the maids and the cooks who fixed the meals at those schools during the day.  So we knew that the white kids--and if they lived far enough away they were bused to school--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --while that did not happen in our communities.
Speaker 1: --did you all have lunch at school paid for and that sort of thing too?
Speaker 2: No, we took our lunches.
Speaker 1: Now, so this is the separate but equal doctrine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  That's the separate but equal.
Speaker 1: --in action.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I just wanna make that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --some of that point clear.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 227623
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were, now you were mostly in the black community, did you have to, do you remember encounters with whites as you were coming up in, I mean, in business or taking care of things, I mean who would you shop with and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  You know, I think that living in a separate community, growing up, you are more or less sheltered from encounters with whites.  We did not live in the rural area so we were not sharecroppers or we didn't have to deal with the white owners of the land and that kind of thing.  While I remember the person who owned the house where we lived was a white person who came by every Saturday morning to collect the rent that was maybe a weekly thing, but not an encounter that I had.  But I remember as I was older, of course, there were several occasions.  You, you grew up knowing that you were black and that there were some rules to being black.  You knew that there were, for instance when you went to visit the zoo, that there were fountains that were whites only, there were bathrooms that were whites only and that you did not use those.  You didn't drink the white water.  You didn't, you didn't go into the white restrooms, you went into the ones that said colored.  And, and that's one of the things I remember about growing up that all over there were colored signs, even stopping in a restaurant, coloreds served in the rear, you know, that kind of thing.  And it's interesting that it, because it was an acceptable practice for so long, that at the time you didn't think about it.  In the late '50s [1950s] when the Civil Rights Movement started, and people began to raise the issue of race, and particularly in the South, that you realized those signs were demeaning and that white water tasted the same as colored water and that somehow you had to help make a difference.
Story_ID: 227624
Speaker 1: When you were coming up, now this being Mississippi and all, were there any like horror stories about black mistreatment down there that you remember, people talking about or did they--
Speaker 2: I think probably the one that that that stands out in my mind most is the event of the, the black oh, shoot, I'm blocked, I'm blanking on his--
Speaker 1: The young man that was killed?
Speaker 2: Well, well that during the Civil Rights Movement but even earlier than that there was a black man who was electrocuted after many years of appeals and they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh right.
Speaker 2: --for raping a white woman [Willette Hawkins] who--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when actually it wasn't a rape, he had been seeing her on the side, she was married, they got caught, [Willie] McGee, I think, I think his name was.
Speaker 1: I think you, I think you might be right.  I've heard this story and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --it was, the way it was told to me, now tell me if you remember this 'cause you were living there, there at the time.  They said that when he was electrocuted the lights actually dimmed in the homes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and stuff.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I and because actually, and, it he, and I guess it was the first time that they had appealed for, it was a number of years from his actual arrest and trial to the execution.  And probably the first time that a black man had ever been able to be processed even through the appeals system.  But there was ample evidence that that it was not a rape but the fact was it was a black man involved with a white woman and it had to be nothing less than, than a rape.  And so I remember when he was electrocuted for that.  For me that, that was the first time I remember I understood the horror of segregation and Jim Crow.
Speaker 1: And the interesting thing about that too is that, on some level and as crazy as it is, that's some kind of a victory that he actually got on trial, right?
Speaker 2: It is.  It is.  And it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Even an unfair trial.
Speaker 2: Right.  And even though people, blacks in Mississippi knew what the outcome would be and I guess I must have been five or six years old, I wasn't that old, but just old enough to understand that something wrong was happening here, something was going on.  And I can remember the conversations between the adults, the fact that they would allow him even to appeal through the process was new because ordinarily, he would have just been hung on the site.   And--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and nothing would have been done about it.  But the fact that they allowed him to remain in jail and to go through the appeal process of trial and then electrocuted legally was in itself a victory.
Story_ID: 227625
Speaker 1: Now you grew up during World War II [WWII] basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were a child during--
Speaker 2: Right, I was.
Speaker 1: --that conflict.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you remember what it was like when the soldiers came back--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the black soldiers came back?
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember when they announcement was made that the war was over.  I had three uncles in the [U.S. military] service, two in the [U.S.] Navy, one in the [U.S.] Army.  And all of my uncles had gone in one, two, three.  And at the end of the war, they all came home, all of them survived the war.  But I remember in our community how people in the, were in the streets, I mean celebrating, going from house to house and calling people out and saying, you know, "The war is over, it's over, the president [President Harry S. Truman] just announced that the war is over."  And people were huddled around radios, no television at the time, or you could go to the movie and see the news trailer on the movies, movie screen.  But for the most part, it was people gathered in homes around the radio to hear the details of the armistice.  It was, it was awesome.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so there were some radios in the neighborhood, I guess so people could gather around, that's good.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Oh, yeah, yeah, most people had a radio.  I remember we had a big one that sat in our living room and so people gathered at my grandmother's [Paoline Cole Johnson] house.  And you know, my grand--I remember my grandmother crying because her boys were safe and I had never seen her cry.  I hadn't seen my grandmother cry but it was suddenly like the burden of praying for them and worrying about them was now lifted, I remember that, yeah.

Speaker 1: Now, in terms of radio and so forth, now did you have a favorite radio show or did your household have favorite radio programs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, you know, we used to listen, I think, I don't remember it, I think it was Saturday night on there was one called 'Fibber McGee and Molly,' nobody except for me would, (laughter) nobody's old enough to remember that.  And then there was the one with the, with the black folk on it, what was it?
Speaker 1: 'Amos 'n' Andy'?
Speaker 2: 'Amos 'n' Andy,' yeah, thank you (laughter).  Those were kinds of favorites, you know.  It wasn't until I was an adult when I started to listen to the soaps.  'All My Children,' and 'As the World Turns,' all came on the radio before they were on television.  But growing up 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  And then, of course, during the, during the day, you really didn't have time to listen to much you, you were busy doing your chores and going to school and going off to work and, and in the evenings you were just too tired to listen to anything but the news and my grandfather [Dave Johnson (ph.)] would find, listen to the news and then the radio went off 'cause it was time to go to bed, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 227627
Speaker 1: Now did you all get many newspapers down there in Mississippi?  There was a black paper, it doesn't run now but there was one (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  When I was growing up there was a black paper and we got it once a week.  The, Mr. Miller [sic. Percy Greene] was the owner and editor of, of that--
Speaker 1: The Jackson--
Speaker 2: Advocate.
Speaker 1: --Advocate [Jackson Advocate], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever get the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] or the [Chicago] Defender?
Speaker 2: You would get those every once in a while, somebody would maybe send a copy.  The, the local paper was The Clarion-Ledger which was the daily paper.  And you couldn't afford it, it was like twenty-five cents a week.  So you'd get a copy on Sunday which was a nickel.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, were you into reading the paper when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: I liked the funnies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  And then sometimes you had to do social studies things for school, you know, so you'd read articles that the teacher would assign.  And I was an avid reader as a child but books, I liked to read books.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: Probably my favorite ones, even in school were the history books, social studies, that kind of thing.  I liked to read novels, particularly romance novels, you know.
Story_ID: 227628
Speaker 1: Were you able to, I know you couldn't use the Jackson Public Library [Jackson Hinds Library System, Jackson, Mississippi] but did they have, was there a school library or something that you could use?
Speaker 2: The interesting thing about growing up in Mississippi with black teachers in a black school, they found ways of making available to their students materials, library type materials, in a way I think that teachers today don't seem to have the ability to do because they, they do have libraries and that, there are facilities available, and I'm not so sure that young teachers could, could be as innovative as the teachers were 'cause they had to be, out of necessity they had to be.  And I hope teachers watching this won't think that I'm being ingenerous [ph.] to them because I don't mean to be, it's just that, necessity they say is the mother of invention.  And I think out of necessity the teachers when I was growing up had to find ways to expose their students.  I remember in, in eighth grade when I, my teacher taught black history and she was not allowed to do that.
Speaker 1: Now, oh, what was the second grade school now, it's time to give the name of it I guess?  This is at that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Mary C. Jones [Elementary School, Jackson, Mississippi] was the second school.
Speaker 1: --Mary C. Jones.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is at Mary C. Jones right, where your teacher--
Speaker 2: Right.  And, and, uh-huh at Mary C. Jones and went through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And what was your teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Bradford [ph.].
Speaker 1: Mrs. Bradford.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she taught black history?
Speaker 2: She taught black history.  And it was interesting because we was scheduled one day of the week, I don't remember now which day of the week it was that she taught it, but the Jean teacher, Jeanes teacher who was the supervisor, a white woman (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, the Jeanes Supervisors, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Was a white woman and they always knew when she was coming.  And if she came on the day when we were to have black history, of course, we had American history that day because if she had found Mrs. Bradford teaching black history Mrs. Bradford would have been fired.  And it, so she didn't have enough books for all of us with anything that had to do with black history, so often she would have us write paragraphs from the single book that that she owned herself.
Speaker 1: Do you know what book that was?  Was that--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't.
Speaker 1: --[Carter G.] Woodson's book or--
Speaker 2: I, no not then, Woodson hadn't written his book by then.  It wasn't published by then.
Speaker 1: Yeah he had, well he had one, 'The Negro in Our History' [Carter G. Woodson] that came out in the '20s [1920s] and--
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: --and there was [Edward A.] Johnson's '[A] School History of the Negro [Race in America']--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --it came out in the 1920s [sic. 1890] too.
Speaker 2: Might have been, might have been but I'm trying to think, I--it seems to me, no it seems to me that I'm remembering that we started to use Carter Woodson's book when I was in high school [Brinkley High School, Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that she--
Speaker 1: Could it have been J.A. Rogers or somebody like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  It could have been, I don't remember.  I just remember that she would bring articles that, that she had somehow gotten for us.  And would share them with us.
Speaker 1: Well that's interesting too that the Jeanes Supervisors, now they you know, you gotta give 'em credit they went around and really--
Speaker 2: They went around--
Speaker 1: --improved the quality of education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Right, right.
Speaker 1: --in the black schools.
Speaker 2: They would come in and sit a whole day and you'd see 'em making little notes, you know.
Speaker 1: Did they put a, it puts a interesting political spin on this.
Speaker 2: Sure.  And, and but also we would sometimes get new books when she had been and to visit and would see that we were three or four of us sharing a book and within a month or so, we'd get a box of books.  So, yeah, you're right.  As oppressive as what--that as they could be sometimes, it was also helpful.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it's kind of a dilemma.  A friend of mine in Chicago [Illinois] wrote a book, well it's a man I know, William [H.] Watkins wrote a book called '[The] White Architects of Black Education[: Ideology and Power in America, 1865-1954,' William H. Watkins].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: He's at the University of Illinois [at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] which is, which kind of, it discusses the Jeanes Supervisors and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --some of the founders of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --black education in the South--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --being the same people that founded the schools in--the colonial schools in West Africa--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and India (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and other places too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, same thing, yeah.
Story_ID: 227629
Speaker 1: So, black history was taboo for Jeanes Supervisors?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was.  But it was amazing to me when I brought my children to California, I expected that there would be classes of black history and I, and I discovered that in order for my children to know black history, I had to teach it at home.  I could not rely, until the late '70s [1970s] on the school system in California to teach my children black history.  I took for granted because I learned it in the schools in Mississippi that surely the liberated schools in California would teach it openly and that was not the case when we came in 1964.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you have the sense when you were a student in grade school that other black children in other schools were getting black history too or was it kind of unique to your teacher?
Speaker 2: No I thought we were all learning it and I think that other teachers were doing exactly what my teacher was doing.  And the reason I say that is because as I go into, to high school [Brinkley High School, Jackson, Mississippi], and, and people are coming from different areas we're all on, it appears an equal plane.  I think my generation of blacks probably know more about our history between slavery and the 1940s and '50s [1950s] than most young people know about black history now.  'Cause even today you can ask young people who was [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and you may not get the right answer.  And it ought to be common knowledge in this day and time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 227630
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school at a school called Brinkley High School [Jackson, Mississippi].  It was in my community, the year I attended a brand new high school, now Jackson [Mississippi] has three black high schools, Lanier [High School, Jackson, Mississippi], Smith [Robertson School, Jackson, Mississippi]--Lanier High School--
Speaker 1: You said Smith Robinson [sic.] you said before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there's a, there's another now.  In west Jackson, I'll think of it in a minute.  And then Brinkley High School which was, which, which was the newest of the, of the three.  And the--I remember it was built in a neighborhood that was just starting to be built, black neighborhood, middle-class neighborhood which was a new kind of thing.  Most of the people who were in the black middle class such as it was, lived in west Jackson.  And so now, here we are in the northeast of the city developing now a middle class.  And the neighborhood became so well developed, that people were now moving from the west side into what was called School View district--area.  But it was a modern state of the art school for the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I mean, did it compare to the white schools in terms of the facilities?
Speaker 2: Almost.  We had now a, we had now a cafeteria, we had a library on site.  We had the classes, of course, separated so that we were changing now, classes from one, one room to the next and for me it was an experience.
Speaker 1: So this is, this is--
Speaker 2: New, great (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) like 1948, I guess you start school.
Speaker 2: Actually, it was 1950, let's see when did I get married [to Kerry Tyler]?  1950, '50 [1950], 1950, '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: So you started high school '50 [1950], '51 [1951]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so you got married almost as soon as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  In 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: You weren't there long, okay.
Speaker 2: I got married by promising my husband I'd stay in school (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you didn't stay?
Speaker 2: Not then.  I went back later (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we know the rest of the story.  It's worked out--
Story_ID: 227631
Speaker 1: Did you like school [Brinkley High School, Jackson, Mississippi] at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.  I did like school.  I remember I had one, one teacher, a male teacher who was a homeroom teacher, I'm trying to remember his name.  I can see his face as clear it was yesterday.  I'm, lately I'm getting really bad with names (laughter) remembering names, but I remember he was the homeroom teacher and he made all of us feel that he was our friend to a point that if you were working on a difficult lesson you could go to him whether it was his class or not and, and he would, he would assist you.  It was, it was a, it was a good, good, good time.  I did, I liked school.  And I liked school because I did well.  My personality is that I don't like to do anything that I can't do well at and so I did well at school.  So I did like school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And your favorite subjects are still history and or well had they changed in--
Speaker 2: I think it probably had changed so that I was, I liked English and writing, anything that had to do with writing because I discovered that I could express myself on paper and with paper and pen in a way that I couldn't verbally.  So I started to enjoy English and we started to have some classes that resembled journalism which of course were not quite but were close enough that it helped us to develop writing skills.  And they were actually called writing classes rather than journalism classes, you know, at the time, and it was a part of the English curriculum.  And so I discovered that I really enjoyed those and there it stood me in good stead as a preacher, you know, is from that small beginning.
Speaker 1: And probably in those days it probably, you probably stood out too just amongst the other students if you were really articulate and you spell well and write well.
Speaker 2: I did--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and in fact, I made excellent grades and was, some of the students said I was the teacher's pet.  So whenever they wanted to get anything from him they'd ask me to ask because they said he always let me do what I wanted to do.  And they weren't jealous of me it was just that, you know, they would use me to get what they wanted (laughter).  I think it was the only time I was the teacher's pet probably or maybe not, I think I was kind of Mrs. Ford's [ph.] pet to 'cause I used to go to her house on weekends and do things with her.  She was, she had several girl students who would come to her house.  Mrs. Ford, by the way, was the sister-in-law of Mrs. Bradford [ph.] who was that eighth grade teacher.  And Mrs. Ford had been my teacher first through fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you knew her well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 227632
Speaker 1: Now tell me now I didn't ask you about this but was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was what life was.  I mean school was extra, you know, curricular.  But, but my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] was one of the founders of our little A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church in Jackson, Mississippi--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Institutional A.M.E. Church [Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Institutional A.M.E.?
Speaker 2: And, and so I was actually born when the church was meeting under a brush harbor and for those who don't know what that is, they put poles up and put a covering over it, and cover it with brush, straw, to kind of shield from the, mostly from the sun because the rain would come through.  And the church started meeting in the homes of my grandmother, Mrs. King [ph.], Mrs. Harrington's [ph.] home.  And, and then they built the brush harbor where they would meet when the weather was good until about 1945 when we had a pastor who was a carpenter, Reverend McGee [ph.], who came to pastor us and actually built the building, including building the, the pews, and I remember those things were hard to sit on, (laughter) and we had our first church building.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  So this is 1949?
Speaker 2: About 1945--
Speaker 1: Five [1945], okay.
Speaker 2: --when he built the church, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But in 1937 when I was born, the church was already being started and I was baptized at the altar in that church as an infant.  And so it was all I knew, Sunday school, the Mothers Sunbeamers [ph.], the YPD [Young People's Division], [Women's] Missionary Society, I grew up in the church, never been away from it.  And, and have been in probably just about every organization, I've been a trustee and a steward and all that.
Speaker 1: Did you read the Easter messages before the congregation when you were a little girl and that sort of thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Did I recite that, I didn't read them--
Speaker 1: Recite.
Speaker 2: --I always learned them and I always had to have the longest one, you know, I was always sure to have the longest one.  I would memorize my speech and stand up.  I think it's where I learned to stand before a congregation and, and speak without fear.  I remember during those years at church when our presiding elder would come and he would bring with him the conference director of the YPD and when the elder would hold his quarter she would take the young people after Sunday school and she'd give us a script and in the afternoons we would have learned the script and we'd come back and we'd do a play, with some prompting from her, from the side, of course.  But those were wonderful times.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you spent a lot of time in church, okay.
Speaker 2: I spent a lot of time in church.  I remember, you talk about sights and sounds, I can remember one Sunday morning, in those days on Saturday evening, you got your hair straightened and curled so you'd be ready for Sunday and, and so on Sunday morning I had on my Sunday shoes, black patent leather shoes and my Sunday dress and my mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips] had curled my hair on Saturday and I was all ready for Sunday school and it was raining.  And it probably happened more than once but for some reason this one particular Sunday, I can remember so well.  And I remember standing on the porch wishing that the rain would stop, and all of a sudden it stopped and, you know, like in the, in those southern summer days, the sun comes out and the rain stops, and I thought, oh, great.  So I took off running 'cause it was maybe half a mile to the church, took off running to the church and got almost there and it started to rain again.  So my freshly curled hair gets all messed up and I'm wet but I'm at church.  And I remember that was, that was just a happy time to be able to get there.
Story_ID: 227633
Speaker 1: --Now back to [Brinkley] High School [Jackson, Mississippi].  I'm taking you back to high school.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And now, you like high school, you enjoyed high school a lot but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you were kind of swept off your feet there, is that it?
Speaker 2: I was in high school.  Let, let me take you back to when I was five years old and, and I think it connects how I met and married my husband.  I remember when I was five years old because in the days when I would, when I was growing up, a young woman growing up and getting married was the goal.  But I remember that as a child, somehow I came to have a desire to have a loving, happy home.  And I remember seeing a family next door where the parents were fighting.  And the father stormed out of the house and went down the street in one direction and about ten, fifteen minutes I suppose later the mother came out of the house dressed up and she went in the opposite direction.  And I was, it was in the wintertime and I was standing in the, in the, in the window at--in our house and I was looking at this, 'cause we had heard the commotion and I was looking out.  And in the window facing the one that I was looking out of in their house were these two little boys with their face pressed to the window watching their parents leave.  And I can remember thinking, and I know I was about five years old and, and because the church was so much a part of my life, it was not foreign for me to think, dear God when I grow up and get married, I want my husband to like going to church with us and so we can all go to church together.  I know now that that was the prayer of a little girl's heart.  And that God honors our prayers, in particular prayers of children, I'm sure.  In 1951 I think I was about fourteen and I was already teaching the kindergarten's Sunday school class and I had a kindergarten student who came in with a strange man that I didn't know.  And so when my student came into, to our Sunday school class, I said to him, and his name was Sylvester Van Buren [ph.], Sylvester Bernard [ph.], and we called him S.B., which was common in, in the South in those days.  So I said, "S.B. who is that man?"  He said, "That's my uncle, Kerry." I said, "Oh."  And so I went on teaching the class and then a few minutes I said, "S.B. is Kerry married?"  And he said, "No."  And he was a little boy about five maybe in the, he was, he was just kind of, he didn't wanna be, be asking him these silly questions (laughter).  And his whole body language and attitude reflected that.  But Kerry was good-looking and he was, I mean, he was dressed to the nines.  He was good-looking, he really was.  And he didn't have his hair conked, but he had the kind of hair that, you know, you just kind of put a little water and grease in it and finger it and that's how he used to fix it and it would just curl up on his head, you know, he was good-looking.  He was maybe sort of a coffee color with lots of extra cream.  And so after Sunday school I went up to him and I said I found out his name, Mr. Tyler, and he was surprised that I knew his name.  And I told him, "I'm Carolyn Jackson [HistoryMaker Bishop Carolyn Tyler Guidry] and I want to welcome you to our church."  And well I usually sang in the choir but that Sunday I was, the choir wasn't singing, another choir was singing.  I sang in the youth choir but the adult choir was singing that day.  And so I said, "I'd like to invite you to sit with me since you're new to our church."  And he thanked me and we went to a seat in the sanctuary and sat down and I kind of pointed out all the people to him during the church service.  And so after church, he asked me if he could walk me home.  And, and he did and I told him about myself and he told me, well his sisters, were already coming to our church so it wasn't like he was a stranger and his little nephew was in my class and so I knew part of his family already, I just didn't know him.  And so he walked me home after church and so that was really nice.  He was, he was nice.  And I didn't see him again until the next Sunday.  This time our choir was singing so I invited him to join the choir.  He joined our church shortly after that.
Story_ID: 227634
Speaker 1: So, I think, I left, we were talking about when I--my husband [Kerry Tyler] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  He walked you home, right.
Speaker 1: --right, right.  So I invited him to join the choir.  He did, he joined our church [Institutional A.M.E. Church, Jackson, Mississippi].  And dating just kind of evolved.  I was fourteen, I really had not been given permission to date, and so he asked my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] if he could come see me at our house and she liked him so she said all right, and besides, when he came, he brought her her favorite ice cream.  And so he was really a nice young man (laughter) after that, you know.  Now, I knew from his sister, who was just a little older than me, how old he was, he did not know my age and, of course, my grandmother did not know his age.  He did not look his age.  He was, at the time twenty-five, and so he did not look his age.  And so he started to come to see me, could not take me out anywhere because my grandmother would not allow that but he was allowed to come to our house and sit in the porch or sit in the living room and talk.  And my grandmother would go into her room and she'd allow us to, to sit there and talk but with the doors open, of course, and, you know, she could hear every word we were saying and (laughter) and she had always access to--but we dated for a little over, about a year 'cause this started like late 1950 and for the whole of 1951.  My grandmother had an accident, had a fall where she broke her arm and was in the hospital and my, my uncle came or my aunt came and took her to stay with her to recuperate and so I went to live with my mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips] who was now living in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Kerry came to New Orleans at Thanksgiving time and asked his mother if he could marry me--asked my mother if he could marry me.  And my mother said "No, she's too young," 'cause by this time I was fifteen.  That was the time he learned how old I was, and when my mother said I was too young, he thought I was eighteen.  And the reason he thought that was all of my friends were eighteen or twenty and they were people that he knew.  I had, I had hardly any friends who were fourteen or fifteen, they were older and, and so he thought that I was the same age.  But by that time he was smitten, (laughter) you know.  And so my mother said no.  And instead of leaving and taking her no he decided to stay until the next day which was actually Thanksgiving Day and he would have dinner with us.  And so that evening I remember talking to my mother and I said, "Why are you saying no?"  She said, "You're too young, you need to finish school [Brinkley High School, Jackson, Mississippi]."  And I said, "But this is the man that I've prayed for, he comes from a good family, he knows about building a good family, and I wanna have a good family and I love him, and if you don't allow me to marry him I'm gonna run away and I'll marry him anyway but I'd rather do it with your blessings."  That was the first time in my life, even though my mother had not been the one to rear me, it was the first time in my life that I had ever defied her because she kind of ruled with a strong hand and when she spoke, I listened, but for the first time in my life and I think that was a shock to her and she realized how serious I was about this man.  But the fact of the matter is, everybody in the family who had met him, liked him.  They had met members of his family at the church and they liked the family.  It was a family of seven brothers and sisters, an eighth sister had died as a youth but the mother and father had been married nearly fifty years.  It was a strong family, the sisters that we knew had strong marriages and so my family knew it was a good family and that was important in those days.  And I can remember when he came to dinner on Thanksgiving Day without telling me what she was going to say, at dinner my mother said to him, "My daughter seems determined to marry you and so I've changed my mind and I've decided to give my consent."  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
Story_ID: 227635
Speaker 1: This was Kerry Bernard Tyler, my first husband.  We were married for thirty-five years and together we have six children, actually eight, two of our children died shortly after birth but he was a wonderful husband and father.  And in that thirty-five years we were each other's best friend.  And we raised our children as a partnership, neither one of us ever contradicted the other in our discipline of the children.  If we didn't agree, we did it in our bedroom where the children didn't know and it was in a manner I don't think you should have said or done, I think you should have done.  So much so that my oldest son was in fifth grade and we met his teacher and she said, "Oh I've been wanting to meet you all.  I wanted to meet this couple that never, ever had a disagreement."  And my husband and I looked at each other and laughed.  And we said, "What does that mean?"  He said, "Well your son says that his parents never disagree, that you always agree on everything," and so we realized then that we were really setting a bad example for this boy.  He needed to know that sometimes mothers and fathers (laughter) disagree.  But we also pleased because later on, I heard this son say to his brothers, and the first of our six children are all boys, say to his brothers when he didn't know we were listening, "Listen fellows there's no need trying to get one of those people to do anything that the other one says no to, 'cause those two people have their stuff together."  And I eased out of the room before they could see me and went and told my husband and we were pleased to know that they realized they couldn't play us against each other.  And so, I, I think primarily we raised a healthy family.  Our sons are fathers, and while a couple of them have had failed marriages they have had, they are excellent fathers.  They've taken care of their children.  And one of my sons has raised a boy who is twenty-three years old now and in college and is raising an eight year old as a single father.  My oldest son has four children.  And I remember he was in college when his second daughter was born and he would strap her to his back and take her to class with him.  And I think that their father was the example of what a father ought to be for them.  And so after thirty-five years Kerry died when I was pastoring in Bakersfield, California.  And I was single for eight years.  The Guidry part came eight years later in 1996.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So you're currently married to a Mr. [Don] Guidry?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 227636
Speaker 1: Now you, did you drop out of [Brinkley] High School [Jackson, Mississippi] when you got married or--
Speaker 2: I dropped out of high school to my husband's [Kerry Tyler] chagrin.  He was after me all the time, you need to go back, you promised me you would, I promised your mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips] you'd finish high school and but I dropped out of high school and, because I really enjoyed being a housewife and wanted to be a mother.  And after we had been married about fourteen months, I was pregnant and our first child was born, and then about fourteen months later we had the second child who was born prematurely and died after six days.  And then we had a year, two years later, I guess, we had a second child, both girls, who was also born prematurely and died after three days.  Oh, and about two years later, now about six years from the first child we have our second son and I was working as a domestic in Jackson [Mississippi].  And my husband came to pick me up one day, I was working for two families a couple days a week each.  And the one family was the daughter of the governor of the State of Mississippi.  She had a son, a little boy about four or five, six years old, six maybe.  And I worked for the family next door who was one of the lawyers who worked in the governor's cabinet, and he had children, a little girl about the same age.
Speaker 1: About what year is this, this is when?
Speaker 2: This, this, this was like 1959, 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was, they were sitting on the curb when my husband came to pick me up and he parked the car and, and waited, didn't have to honk he knew that I knew he was there and so I'd come and so he just parked.  And he sat in his car reading, and he heard the little boy say, "See him," he said, "he's a nigger."  And the little girl was from, her family was from Chicago [Illinois] so she didn't have these lessons, that was the little difference.  And so she said, "Why?"  He said, "'Cause he's a darky."  So she said, "Well, but [HistoryMaker Bishop] Carolyn [Tyler Guidry] is a darky but she's not a--."  He said, "No, she's colored."  And she said, "Why?"  He said, "'Cause she works for you but he doesn't work for you, so he's a nigger."  And, and my husband was about your color, and when I got out to the car he was almost blue he was so red, (laughter) he was angry.  And he didn't say anything to the kids and I got in the car and I said, "Hi!" and he said, "you're going back to school."  And I said, "Well I know you had a good day," (laughter) you know.  And, and I'm trying to figure out what is, what is wrong, what's wrong?  And so he said, "No more discussion, you go next week and you take the GED test and you go back to school."  And on the way home, of course, he tells me the story of the two kids on the curb.  And the first time he'd ever given me a directive, I mean, we discussed, we made decisions, but he would never give me a directive and tell me what I had to do.  And so I knew that that this meant a lot to him.  He was serious.  And he said you're not going to spend the rest of your life working for white folk who don't appreciate you--
Story_ID: 227637
Speaker 1: Now did he have a chance to go to school too, himself or did he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: Now where did he go to?
Speaker 2: My husband [Kerry Tyler] had had a couple of years of college when we married.  And then after we were married, he went to Bible school with me, actually years later, four years of Bible school at Los Angeles Bible [Training] School [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Where did he go to college at?
Speaker 2: He went to college in, in Canton, Mississippi and Canton Commercial College [ph.] or something like that back then, two year college, after he was out of the [U.S.] Army, right.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was a veteran?
Speaker 2: He was a veteran, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.  And so a month later, I went to the college, Jackson State College [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] and took the GED test and passed it.  And enrolled in the fall at [Bonner-]Campbell College [Edwards, Mississippi] in a secretarial sciences business course and did my A.A. [Associates] Degree there.  And then went to Tougaloo College [Jackson, Mississippi] and enrolled in economics, did not graduate Tougaloo but took the economic courses there.  And actually finished when I came to Los Angeles [California], at Los Angeles Bible School after I started preaching.  Enrolled in, I guess, probably '86 [1986] I think at Fuller Theological Seminary [Pasadena, California]--
Story_ID: 227638
Speaker 1: --Maybe we can go back to Jackson [Mississippi] in the '60s [1960s].  And you said you were involved in the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at that time you mentioned off-camera that Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses] and--
Speaker 2: Right, right
Speaker 1: --and [HistoryMaker Reverend] James Bevel and some of the other people--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that were down there.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And I don't know who, how did you get involved in the movement, I mean it seemed like it would be hard not to be involved in it, but how did you get involved in it and, and how did you meet these people?
Speaker 2: Well the Reverend R.L.T. Smith was a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and my husband [Kerry Tyler] and I were also.  Medgar Evers was field director in Mississippi at that time.  The sit-ins started on the college campuses, students started to sit-in.  And R.L.T. Smith decided to run for [U.S.] Congress, it was the first time a black had run since Hiram [Rhodes] Revels a hundred years before.  And in my connection with being a member of the NAACP, he needed an office manager, somebody to run his office.  I had just graduated from, from the secretarial sciences program at [Bonner-]Campbell [College, Edwards, Mississippi] and I applied for the job and got the job working for Reverend Smith in his campaign office, which put me in a day to day relationship with Medgar Evers and the NAACP because our office was housed in the NAACP building, office building, which was the Masonic Lodge and the NAACP used most of their available offices.  And so when I started to work for Reverend Smith, I became heavily involved in now the, the budding politics, black politics of, of Mississippi, so much so that later I became the women's voter registration chairperson for Mississippi for the NAACP.  Mass meetings as you recall from the history was held across the city beginning in late 1959, early '60 [1960], until the Civil Rights Movement, through 1964 and during that time.  And black churches, all of the churches, Baptist churches, the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] churches, particularly all over the city, would house these meetings where black people would gather from across the communities to hear speakers like Medgar Evers and R.L.T. Smith, and eventually [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] in Georgia became a part of that.  People from NAACP would come down from the Legal Defense [and Educational] Fund [LDF].  The preachers in the community were the leaders of the movement and would be the nightly speakers which would urge the people to stand up and to, to fight for their right.  And initially it started in Mississippi just as the right to vote.  And R.L.T. Smith was to be that focal point for black people, to give us a reason to register to vote.  In Mississippi at that time you had pay a poll tax in order to be able to register to vote.  And when black people started to pay the poll tax and started to register, then something started to happen at the registrar's office.  They started not to be available, the office was not open or the registrar was out to lunch and he was the only one who could, who could register you.  You had to have a poll tax receipt in order to register, showing that you had paid your tax.
Story_ID: 227639
Speaker 1: As the [Civil Rights] Movement progressed and as the meetings began to become more and more frequent, the focus began to be on downtown merchants.  Blacks started to boycott certain stores because, for instance, there was a store named Parisian's [sic. Parisian] where you couldn't try on anything, you could go in and buy anything in the store if you had the money but you couldn't try it on, including shoes and women buying dresses couldn't try on anything, you could buy it and if you bought it, it was yours, you couldn't take it back if it didn't fit.  And these kinds of practices were not unusual in many areas.  And so they began to boycott the downtown stores, so much so, that many of the stores were closed in Jackson, Mississippi never to reopen again.  They may have opened in the now newly emerging shopping malls out in the, in the suburbs.  But the blacks in Jackson literally closed down Capitol Street shopping area in Jackson, Mississippi in those days.  And so when Medgar Evers, Evers was, was assassinated, it was following a meeting on Monument [Street] in one of the churches.  And because I was the chair for the voter registration at that time, I kind of hung around as people were leaving, Medgar and my husband [Kerry Tyler] and I were literally the last people to leave the, the grounds of the church.  And he said, "I'm gonna go by my office and do a little work and before I go home," which was not unusual for him.  And but I remember we told him, you know, "It's been a long day man, you really need to go home."  And he said, "No, I'll be all right, I'm gonna run by here.  I got some stuff I really need to do."  And he went to his office.  We went home, of course.  And to my knowledge my husband and I were the last people to see Medgar that night.  It was about five o'clock in the morning, the next morning we got a call and say Medgar's been shot.  And my husband and I got up and went to the house, and they had removed the body but the puddle of blood was still smoking in the morning air on the driveway of his home.  It was probably one of the most devastating events I can ever remember in my life.  Because I remember being in the office the next day and because I worked in the office, was one of those answering one of the many phones.  By this time the leadership of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] has descended, people from Washington [D.C.], the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], civil rights, Civil Rights Movement people from all over had come to Jackson.  [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had come to Jackson during that time.  He was not as well-known as he soon came to be but he was on the rise at that point.
Speaker 2: Now this is 1960--
Speaker 1: This is nineteen--
Speaker 2: --two [1962] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Actually it's 1963.
Speaker 2: --three [1963]? Okay.  'Cause it was like the summer before or the spring before--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --King--I mean [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy himself was killed.
Speaker 1: Right, it was like 1963.
Speaker 2: Three [1963], okay.
Speaker 1: And so people were calling the office and saying in a southern drawl, a man, to speak to Medgar or, "Can I speak to the Nigga Evers."  And you say, "Who's calling?"  And they'd laugh and hang up.  Or they'd call and say, "We got that nigga, see who's gone register you niggas to vote now," and they'd laugh and hang up.  And it was the first time in my life when I realized how cruel people could be.  You know, I had heard the stories about folk being hanged but I had never witnessed anybody being hanged.  I knew the story of Willie McGee which my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] and the adults I heard as a child, thought it was a terrible thing because he really didn't do anything wrong.
Story_ID: 227640
Speaker 1: Had you, did you remember as a child Emmett Till also?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you were, you were, I guess--
Speaker 2: Well, I was an adult then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  You had just--
Speaker 2: --I was, that was a part of the--
Speaker 1: --yeah, you were just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were kind of older teenager at this period.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, no actually I was involved in the [Civil Rights] Movement by that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you were still only a teenager (laughter) at that time.  You would have been--
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess I would, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) he was, he was killed in '54 [1954] was it, '55 [1955]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but by that time I was like seventeen, sixteen--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's still--
Speaker 2: --seventeen.
Speaker 1: --an older teenager.
Speaker 2: But I was married--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you were still teenager.
Speaker 2: --so I don't remember I was a teenager (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Yeah, I was married by then I had my first child and I, I guess I don't remember that I was still a teenager, yeah, I guess, I was.  But, even that because you heard of lynchings all the time but it's, you're removed for, from it because you're not personally involved in it, like we are today, you know.  Tragedies don't really hit us so hard until somehow we, we can put a face to it--
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --you didn't really, you were kind of insulated from that fear, I guess on some level.
Speaker 2: I guess I was.
Speaker 1: You didn't operate being afraid of white people or anything--
Speaker 2: No. And, and my husband [Kerry Tyler] and I knew that the phone at our house, when I became involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Voter Registration Movement, we knew that the phone in our house was tapped.  We could pick up our phone and hear a radio and when they realized we had picked up the phone it would be silent, so we knew that.  And we really knew it before Medgar was killed when the, the courts got an injunction against Medgar Evers and the NAACP and named several other people in the, in the injunction to stop the demonstrations and the mass meetings and my name was on there because I was one of the leaders at that time.  So we, we knew that we were a part of that, that whole thing.
Speaker 1: Now did you feel afraid for yourself after that?
Speaker 2: No.  I think that my perspective on life had changed because now I've got at this point about three little boys and I want their life to be different.  And I can remember at the beginning of the movement when people were pushing for voter registration, one of the women that I had worked for as a domestic, happened to call me one day and when she came on the phone she says, "I need to understand something," and I said, "all right."  She said, "What is it you people want?"  This is a woman who had called me Caroline because she gave nicknames to people she loved, even though my name is [HistoryMaker Bishop] Carolyn [Tyler Guidry], she called me Carolina, and I said, "Why do you call me that?"  And she says, "'Cause I give nicknames to people I love."  And my answer was, "Don't love me so much, call me Carolyn."  But, but she called me and said, "What is it you people want?"  And I, and at this time I had children, I'm a mother, so I know very well what it is I want.  And I said to her, "What I want is for my son to have the same right as your grandson.  I want him to be able to grow up and decide which college he wants to go to and where he wants to live if he's got the money to afford it, and if he's got the ability to learn."  I said, "I want him to be able to decide where he wants to work without being concerned about the color of his skin, just like your grandson."  So she said, "Well, I think that these people coming from the North are just inciting our good nigras."  And I said, "Your good nigras have some sense to think on their own," and I remember hanging up the phone, I never heard from her again.  But it was then that I realized that I have to be a part of this.  My husband's father had never been a sharecropper.  He had rented land but he would never sharecrop.  And my husband remembers hearing him say, before I will work as a sharecropper for a white man, I'll walk up the road and throw rocks or do nothing but I won't sharecrop, and so he never did.  So my husband grew up in an atmosphere of independence, of seeing his father work hard for his family but independently.  And, and I grew up in a household where my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] always told me that the color of my skin was only important to other people, that it must never stop me from being or doing, that I had the ability to learn and to do, based on what I wanted to do, not on other people's limitations of what I could do.
Story_ID: 227641
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, 1964 is a historic year for the State of Mississippi.  That's when thousands of people were registered to vote--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --by SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] basically--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know.  I guess they, they formed COFO [Council of Federated Organizations] or what, what else--
Speaker 2: CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Congress Racial Equality [sic.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, I know about that but that's, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's, that's the big summer of what they call now Freedom Summer in retrospect.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Story_ID: 227642
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the historic Freedom Summer of '64 [1964].  Now, what role did you play in this summer where, you know, they--which culminates in the Democratic National Convention [Atlantic City, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a whole--
Speaker 2: I think for the first time we had black delegates who were really not legal but went to the convention and fought for seating and got it, and that was, that was historical.
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah.
Speaker 2: I think by that time Fannie Lou Hamer is, is starting to be a leader in the, in the northern area, in the Delta area of Mississippi and makes a very strong presence at the convention, and argues for the right of the black delegates to be, to be seated, and talks about representation without the ability to vote and how it's time out for that.
Speaker 1: Now what's, what happened all summer was that black voters were registered to vote--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and organizers, they weren't allowed to participate in the white democratic organization--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they formed a Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party [MFDP]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which was integrated in theory but mostly black--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly black cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  During those years there was a lot of support as some of the killings indicated from other than blacks, a lot of good people who saw the validity of the fight.
Speaker 1: Yeah, hundreds of white students--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --came down--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to volunteer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with Bob [Robert Parris] Moses--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --being the leader of the, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, and who put their, their lives probably more at risk than the blacks because they were nigger lovers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Was it--
Speaker 2: --as the term was then.  And were--
Speaker 1: The summer started off with the murder of--
Speaker 2: The three students [James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner], right.  And they were, and so they were probably more at risk even than the blacks.  And the, in the South, the whites, those who were opposed to integration felt that it was the northerners who were inciting the blacks.  If they could get rid of the northerners then the blacks would go back to being the good colored people.  They somehow did not realize that the times and the tide had changed and that southern blacks were no longer content to be separated from the democracy, the process of democracy and that things were changing.  And perhaps the beginning of the change really came when soldiers started to come home from World War II [WWII] and found that they were not any more citizens after having fought and died in a war than they were.  And I think this--that was some of these people who were becoming college students, later on descendants of these people who were deciding that we have a right to be here too.
Story_ID: 227643
Speaker 1: Did you go door to door in those days or were you mainly in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] office in '64 [1964] or--
Speaker 2: No, we actually went door to door to register people.  I was a block captain where we actually knocked on doors to get people to register to vote.  During some of the demonstrations when the city [of Jackson, Mississippi] decided to use a garbage truck to pick people up who were being arrested for demonstrating, my ten year old son, was one of those picked up and we had to go get him out of jail.
Speaker 1: They picked him up in a garbage truck?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  They used the, the dump truck to put people in to take them off to jail.  And the jail was not large enough to hold all the people so they took 'em to the fairgrounds, the county fairgrounds where they locked people up.  And that, I remember we had to go and get our son out of that, no charges, he was ten years old.  So there were no charges brought against him and as parents we went down and we got him and so he was okay but that was, that was supposed to be a form of intimidation.  And I think in the past when blacks have been lynched, that it put fear in blacks and so maybe they were assured that black folk wouldn't rise up.  And I think even the whites were, were surprised themselves that it didn't work anymore, you know, these folk were crazy now, they don't behave the way they're supposed to.
Story_ID: 227644
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah it was a different time.  Now--
Speaker 2: It was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)  off-camera you described Bob [Robert Parris] Moses to us and, the description was--can you recall when you first met Bob Moses, who was basically the field--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he--
Speaker 1: --person for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].
Speaker 2: --he must have been twenty, twenty-one years old at the most.  Very serious young man who, who even as young as he was chronologically, might have been be forty, fifty years old if you didn't know any better.  Not by his looks or his--but by his demeanor.  He was very serious and an excellent organizer.  I mean he could put together an event or force almost effortless.  But you always knew he was serious.  Some of the students, you know, would joke around and laugh and but Bob was always very serious.  And I remember seeing him, and he always had books and notes and stuff in his pockets, you know, everywhere.  And he always had his stuff with him, whatever he, you know, you needed to know from him.  He was always, always very, very serious.  And when I heard what he was doing years later, I lost track of him, and years later I heard that he had organized a school in the Delta of Mississippi.  I was not at all surprised.  Bob, I think, kind of really dedicated his whole life to making a difference for black people.
Speaker 1: I think he just received one of the MacArthur [Fellowship] genius grants.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: His picture was in the paper for that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Right, I have not seen--
Speaker 1: --Algebra Project.
Speaker 2: --him since those days.  And, but I've asked about him often and people who know where he is, people in Jackson [Mississippi] who see him from time to time because they interact with something that he's doing, some organization, have been able to tell me and that, and I've covered--I've seen him when he's been covered in the Ebony and other magazines and I'm glad to have known him.  He's a good guy.
Story_ID: 227645
Speaker 1: Some of the other people in, Dr. Victoria Gray [HistoryMaker Victoria Adams] is--and you got like--
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)  Endesha Ida Mae Holland in Mississippi.  There are a lot heroes that emerged from that.
Speaker 2: And the sisters [HistoryMaker Joyce Ladner and HistoryMaker Dorie Ladner] who were, what was their last name, Landers [sic. Ladners]?
Speaker 1: Oh, the sisters up in Carthage [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The two twins, like, or that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I'm not sure, I don't think they were twins.
Speaker 1: --they were two sisters, I think they were--okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But one is the--
Speaker 1: But I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: --professor or something or the president of some college or something in, I'll think of their names in a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, you're talking about, you're talking about, gosh, I know who you're talking about 'Death of White Sociology[: Essays on Race and Culture,' ed. Joyce A. Ladner] author, yeah.
Speaker 2: I will--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I will think of both their names in a minute.  But they were sisters.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  And, and they were--
Speaker 1: --I can see those--
Speaker 2: --students at, at Tougaloo College [Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And but yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 227646
Speaker 1: The pressure off of us, we now know its [HistoryMaker] Joyce [Ladner] and [HistoryMaker] Dorie Ladner.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Joyce and Dorie Ladner, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, we were talking about, yeah.
Speaker 2: Dr. Joyce, yeah.
Speaker 1: Dr. Joyce, yeah, she was the president of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And but they were members at--they were students at Tougaloo College [Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And when, when I was taking classes at Tougaloo I also worked in the business office and I was the assistant to the business manager.  So I had almost daily interaction with the students 'cause I was the one who prepared their bills and gave them their meal tickets and so they had to come talk to me (laughter).  They would remember me as, as [HistoryMaker Bishop Carolyn] Tyler [Guidry], Mrs. Tyler at the time, yeah.  Was not a preacher, had twins while I was on campus which, became the, the big event of the year on Tougaloo campus when my babies were born in 1964.
Speaker 1: Now, did you go to the [1964 Democratic National] Convention in Atlantic City [New Jersey] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I did not go to the convention.  I had small children at the time to, and but we sent my sister-in-law who was very active Sevilla Van--Serilla Van Buren [ph.] and she went to the convention.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you see Fannie Lou Hamer on television?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Deliver that--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So they didn't black it out in Mississippi or they couldn't?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, the--okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 227647
Speaker 1: What's next, now when did you decide to go back to school in a serious--I mean to really get advanced degrees and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: In 1973 when I answered my call to ministry, I was a member at Second African Methodist [Episcopal] Church [Los Angeles, California], had been really kind of fighting what I knew was a spiritual calling in my life for a number of years.  I had talked to my pastor about it and kind of denied it and tried to do some other things.  By now, since I had moved to California in 1964 and 1965, I had been working at Security Pacific Bank [Los Angeles, California] and was--
Speaker 1: Well, the question was (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, I'm gon' tell it.  It--
Speaker 1: I didn't have to ask--
Speaker 2: --all leads up to that, it all leads up to that.
Speaker 1: Now, so how did you--why did you move to California in the first place or how did you--
Speaker 2: My husband [Kerry Tyler] was a construction worker.  His sister had moved to Los Angeles [California] and she would write or call and say, "You really should come, the weather is always good for construction here," because in Mississippi in the winters most times he couldn't work at all and with a growing family he needed to be working all the time.  We had just bought a new house and we had, we had now our five sons and so when she started calling and saying, "You can work all year round," it looked good.  So my husband, my husband came to Los Angeles and, and got a job, found a house, and two months later I came with the five boys and his two nephews who drove us across country in our station wagon.  My babies were eight months old, the twin boys, at the time.  And so we came across, with these babies.  And when I came to Los Angeles I had been doing accounting with Tougaloo College [Jackson, Mississippi] business department and I got a job at Security Pacific Bank at the time when the government was requiring that companies hire blacks.  And I got hired because of two things, one I had the background, educationally and workwise, and I was black at Security Pacific Bank and went to work in their bank services department.  And I started working at night processing drop box payments for companies like Shell Oil [Company], Texaco [Inc.], the Prudential Insurance [Prudential Financial, Inc.].  And eventually got promoted to the daytime where I would have accounts, individual accounts that I would handle.  And then promoted to servicing their loans, commercial, individual, business loans for the bank.  And became a branch liaison representative, which meant that I would go into the bank, I helped to convert Security Pacific's loans to the computer.  About 1968 when we started, they had this big 'ole room with the computers in it, it was ice cold, these machines were so big, and we'd do little microfiche on the machines.  I had to convert the system to the computer so that we had a next day turnaround of reports instead of the week that it took by hand.  And then became a liaison representative, which meant that I would go into the branches and teach their note department people how to process the work for computer.  In 1973 I left Security Pacific Bank when I finally answered my call to ministry and went back to school.  And after a lot of prayer asking God to find me a place where I could go to school and he sent me to school in Watts [Los Angeles, California] called the Los Angeles Bible [Training] School [Los Angeles, California], which was operated under the auspices of Talbot [Theological] Seminary [Talbot School of Theology] at Biola University [La Mirada, California].  And I went there for four years and graduated at the top of the class.  And my husband joined me at that school even though he wasn't officially called to ministry, he went to bible school with me.  So for four years we went to bible school and graduated from Los Angeles Bible School--
Story_ID: 227648
Speaker 1: Now what's the difference between bible school and theological school in that sense?
Speaker 2: Well, the difference is that it [Los Angeles Bible Training School, Los Angeles, California] taught mainly Bible--biblical studies, not much of administration or history and that kind of stuff but mostly from the books of the Bible, some of the characters of scripture more than anything else.  There is a, there was one class called pastoral counseling because many of the people there were pastors or were going to be pastors but the year that I would have taken it in my fourth year the class was closed to women.  And because the one of the beliefs of the school was that God does not call women to preach and I had enrolled as a preacher in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  In the four years that I was there, I was ordained as a deacon which is the first ordination for ministers in my church.  And so now I'm Reverend Tyler [HistoryMaker Bishop Carolyn Tyler Guidry] which is opposed to everything that they teach about women, in women's ministry.  And so by the time I'm in my fourth year, I'm up for ordination as an elder in my church which will allow me to pastor, and in that fourth year they closed that class to women and would not allow me to take it.  But God was good.  I had a friend, a male friend in the class who took the class, recorded it, and gave me his notes every class period.  So I studied the class with him.  We would study together.  And while I did not get a grade for the pastoral counseling, I still had the pastoral counseling class.  Then graduated in 1977 in May and was ordained in November of 1977 as an itinerate elder in the A.M.E. church, and was sent out to pastor in a little place [First A.M.E. Church] called Indio, California and where it's hot as hell all the time.  At Christmastime you may have a hundred degree weather.
Speaker 1: Now where is that?
Speaker 2: It's sixteen miles east of Palm Springs [California] in Riverside County [California].
Speaker 1: And the blacks folk there--
Speaker 2: One percent black at the time I pastored there.  They had twenty-two black churches, you're talking about, about 1200 black people, most of them went to church.
Speaker 1: Indio County [sic.]?
Speaker 2: In Indio, California.
Speaker 1: Indio, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I-N-D-I-O?
Speaker 2: I-N-D-I-O.  Yeah, it's the, it's the date capital of the states.  The second largest area for dates outside of, where do dates grow?  India somewhere.
Speaker 1: They grow in, in the Middle East, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, in the Middle East.
Speaker 1: --Palestine, you know, all over there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere, right.  Well, in the states, Indio they actually harvest dates in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 227649
Speaker 1: So you're in Indio, California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  For six years.
Speaker 1: --you know this small church--for six years?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  When, when I went there the church was so small they could raise about twenty-five dollars a Sunday, and so three Sundays they paid the pastor the twenty-five and the fourth Sunday was trustee Sunday they paid the light and gas and telephone bill with that offering.  And the second Sunday I was there, the leader of the congregation decided that since I was gonna be there they needed to pay me a decent salary, so he determined how much each one of the present members would give so that they could pay me seventy-five dollars a week, which they did.  But, of course, when it came time to pay the bills he had to give each one of the members one of the bills, somebody got the light bill, somebody got the water bill, and they would pay, that's how they paid their bills.  So, when it came time to other obligations, the women would have chicken dinners to raise the money and this went on my first year.  And then I--the man who was the leader would not sell any dinners, wouldn't help the women and I said to them, "Look ladies, look at who's doing the work, you don't need to do this.  We can do this a better way."  And I began to teach tithing and stewardship.  And I remember we had this, this three month program where we had Bible study on tithing and we had set a goal the first Sunday in August was going to be our first tithing Sunday.  And the first time we did it, and they raised $1200, they could not believe it they'd raise that much money.  But it was sort of the turnaround in the congregation.  The congregation was growing numerically, we now had young people, we had a choir of about thirty, young people in the youth choir, the adults were coming back to church, and they had a $1200 offering on a Sunday when they couldn't raise twenty-five [dollars] before.  And so we began to, to grow and the church became important.  I used to go to the school board and give the invocation.  I'd go to the city council and give the invocation.  I joined the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, black and white preachers, and became president of the alliance.  Anything that was going on in the city I made sure that First A.M.E. Church [Indio, California] was superimposed.  When the fair would come and we had a booth, so that we were there, our presence was there.  So much so that six years later when I was about to leave Indio, something happened on the [city] council and one of the members was dismissed and the charter says that if the council, remaining council can agree on an individual they don't have to have a special election.  And the council members came to me and asked if I would serve on the city council, they could all agree on me as a person.  And it was tempting, my ego said, ah ha, be on the city council, but I had been told by my bishop that I was being moved to another congregation to pastor.  And I had to remind myself that God had called me to preach and that I was a pastor and I had not been called to serve on the city council.
Story_ID: 227650
Speaker 1: And so I was moved in the next month to Bakersfield, California where I served again.  It was actually the first church that a woman is assigned to that is considered a connectional church where they brought pastors from across the church to pastor.  Bakersfield was about four hundred members and it was an absolutely good move.  I was there [Cain Memorial A.M.E. Church, Bakersfield, California] for six years but in the fifth year my husband died at Bakersfield, Kerry [Tyler].  And after a year I decided that if I wanted to start my life over again, because I had spent thirty-five years with him, he had been in the midst of, a part of everything that I had done for the last thirty-five years of my life.  And he'd started new ministries at that church and was in everything and whenever I would leave town and come back I was physically sick.  That was a part of the grieving process.  But in that year the Lord had taught me how to experience his loss in every single event that occurred in our lives.  He taught me that in twelve months you experience every anniversary, every event, and once that twelve months has passed, you have to make a decision either to continue to celebrate it or to start afresh, and I decided to start afresh.  So I asked my bishop to move me from Bakersfield and I explained to him that it didn't matter if I went to a smaller congregation, I just needed an opportunity to start my life over again.  My children were, for the most part grown, our daughter was now sixteen, she was in high school in her last year of high school, and so I left her with friends in Bakersfield for a year and moved to Los Angeles [California] where I was assigned to Walker Temple [A.M.E. Church, Los Angeles, California].  But it did two things, first of all it gave me an opportunity to start my life over again.  But it also gave me the distinction of being the first female elder to be assigned to a major metropolitan congregation in the history of the African Methodist [Episcopal (A.M.E.)] church.  So it was a first.  And--
Speaker 2: This is 1989?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-eight [1988].
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988], okay.
Speaker 1: Well, actually, it was '89 [1989] when I moved to Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when my daughter graduated high school in 1990, I brought her to Los Angeles.  She enrolled in Northridge, in Cal State Northridge [California State University, Northridge, Los Angeles, California], where she graduated in the theater arts department four years later.  But in that time I was at Walker Temple for four years as their pastor, and after four years the bishop [Bishop Vinton R. Anderson] offered me the position of presiding elder which is--which was at that time, a rare thing for women.  I was the first east--west of the Mississippi River, first time in the Fifth [Episcopal] District.  There had been a number, a small number of women made presiding elder over the last few years, most of them in the same area, one or two in Texas, one in Ohio, overseas there were a couple.  But the female presiding elder was a new thing in the A.M.E. church, really.  And so it was an opportunity for me to grow, an opportunity for me to move up, and so I accepted the offer.  And in 1994 became presiding elder in Southern California.
Story_ID: 227651
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as presiding elder [of Fifth Episcopal District, Southern California] you were, you had responsibility for the operations of twenty-two churches?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, when I first became, I really only had eight churches because I took over a small district that a retired elder had and it was just kind of given to him to give him something to do, and so when I took it over it had eight churches, which did not pay a salary.  I took the position and realized that I'd lost about $40,000 a year in salary from when I was pastoring.  And it took a year to regain it when the bishop then took the three districts in our area and revamped them to make them equal so that I had now, I had now a district that could at least pay me a living wage.  And so for a year I literally lived on faith, and but somehow by the grace of God I was able to do it.  And I would not do anything differently than I did then because it's been an experience.  But in 1995 when the church, the bishop who read the state of the church, the episcopal address, made a statement that the church would have to soon start thinking of a woman on the bench of bishops.  I was a member of Women in Ministry and our church had been the second elected president.  And I went to the commission that, at that meeting and said to them we have to help the bishops, and the way to do that, is that we need to call the church to elect a woman to the bench of bishops but give them a time.  And this is 1995, the next election is 1996, they need time to adjust to it so let's call the church to elect a woman by 2000.  And so the commission agreed with me and I wrote the resolution with Reverend [J.] Edgar Boyd.  We presented it to the church when Bishop H.H. Brookins was presiding and we asked [HistoryMaker] Reverend Cecil [L.] "Chip" Murray at the First A.M.E. Church [(FAME), Los Angeles, California] to read the resolution and he did and the general board passed the resolution.  So now it means that we can work within the framework of that resolution to get a woman elected to the bench of bishops by 1990--by 2000.  At, about November of that year I realize that no woman was running.  So if we're ever gonna get a woman elected by 2000, somebody has to run.  And so after a lot of prayer and the Lord spoke to my heart and, and said I could do it.  So I, without consulting my bishop because I wasn't political enough to realize I needed to go to the bishop and say, you know, I'd like to do this, and, and get his permission or at least his approval, and I didn't do that.  In fact, I filed the papers asking for a letter, and that's when he knew what I was, what was I was going to do.  But I ran and in 1996, I was the first woman ever invited to come to the backroom where negotiations take place between the candidates with enough numbers.  I had over two hundred votes on the first ballot and lost about twenty of those on the second ballot and decided that okay, with, the with my bishop's advice, that I should come out and throw my support to our candidate in the district, and asked the delegates to vote for then Reverend T. Larry Kirkland [Sr.] who was elected.  But now women are moving.  A woman has been invited into the room to negotiate for, because she has enough votes.  In 2000 when I came back, there was another woman who was running, [HistoryMaker Bishop] Vashti McKenzie, and so we were both candidates, and for the first time the church has now two candidates who are looking good.
Story_ID: 227652
Speaker 1: In 1999 while we were all campaigning toward 2000 general conference, it dawned on me that, or at least I heard that there were rumors going around where the bishops of the church were saying we won't, we won't push to elect a woman in 2000, we'll wait until 2004 because eight people are coming off the bench and that would be a good time to do it.  And but my thinking was the church has passed a resolution, we'll elect a woman in 2000, and if now the push is to wait 'til 2004, we, we could very well get to 2004 and it's pushed to 2008.  I met Dr. [HistoryMaker] Jamye Coleman Williams at the [Connectional] Lay [Organization] convention in Rochester, New York.  And I went to her and I had asked her for support and she told me that she'd committed to [HistoryMaker Bishop] Vashti McKenzie.  So she did not, you know, try to do, give her commitment to both of us, she'd made a commitment to Reverend Vashti and, and she had me to understand that.  But in our conversation I said to her, "Did you know about the resolution?"  And she said, "What resolution?"  And I explained to her that in 1995 we had brought before the general board the resolution that the church would elect a woman to the bench of bishops by 2000.  And she said, "No I didn't know anything about that, tell me about it."  So not only did I tell her but I got her a copy of the resolution.  And she immediately in that meeting took it to the leadership of the Lay Organization, Connectional Lay Organization in Rochester and that, at that meeting, the Lay Organization lifted it up and, and agreed that they would support the resolution, they themselves passed the resolution to support the resolution.  And they began then to help with the push and, of course, Dr. Jamye was the catalyst, she was the leader, she was really the one who pushed.  As it happened, between '95 [1995] and, between '99 [1999] and 2000 the Southern Baptists met and came out with this thing about not honoring women, not ordaining women, not recognizing ministry women.  And everybody was down on the Southern Baptists, how racial this was, how, how this was a thing against gender and gender bias and so all of the denominations for the most part, the Christian church across was, was down on the Southern Baptists, and rightly so.  And so when we got to general conference and Dr. Jamye was pushing and talking to the bishops and talking to the leadership and they were still saying, "Well, no, we can wait until 2004 when more people are coming off the bench, we, we don't, we don't think we're gonna elect a woman."  And this was while we were at the general conference in Cincinnati [Ohio].  And she called a press conference and had Women in Ministry, and the leadership of the Lay Organization with her and began to talk to the press about the A.M.E. church not being any better than Southern Baptist if we, if we go back on this.  And in essence what it did was it started people to think.  She had the resolution to bring to the floor and she got it read on the floor and the general conference delegates approved it again.  And so with that push, now there are two women and in the election Vashti McKenzie was elected, everybody thought that I would be the first, including me, thought I'd be the first one elected.  But for whatever reason, the politics or the change, I prefer to think that it was the move of God because I believe that my life is in the hand of the God, and that in the hands of the God and that whatever happens to me is already arranged and it's for my good and so I saw it, while I was disappointed at not being elected, I saw it as, as God's choice.  And so Bishop Vashti was elected in 2000, she was assigned to the 18th [Episcopal] District which is Southern Africa, Swaziland, Botswana, and did an excellent job.  So now the church can't say women can't do this 'cause not only can she do it but she's done it in an area where before they were saying the church would not accept women because it's in Africa but they did.  Her people loved her, her husband [Stan McKenzie] became the first male supervisor of the missionary work and so she was an excellent model for women as bishops.
Story_ID: 227653
Speaker 1: Now in the meantime before I left the 2000 convention [general conference], I did have the good sense to ask Dr. [HistoryMaker] Jamye Coleman Williams if she would help me next time and she consented to do so, and it was one of the best things I did because the rest is history.  After four years of campaigning I became the second female bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] church but more than that, we elected a second woman in 2004 so now that they, since 2000 there are three women on the bench of bishops and so we've fulfilled the resolution passed in 1995 that the church would elect a woman in 2000 and in 2004 we now have three women on the bench.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, that election just took place in 2003?
Speaker 1: July of two--
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000]?
Speaker 1: --two thousand four [2004].
Speaker 2: Two thousand four [2004], so you were just elected (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, July 5th [2004], yes--
Speaker 2: --okay.
Speaker 1: --July 5, 2004.
Speaker 2: July 5, 2004.  And what, what's the other bishop's name?
Speaker 1: Bishop Sarah Frances Davis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Out of Texas.  And she is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 1: --now serving in the 18th [Episcopal District] where [HistoryMaker] Bishop Vashti [McKenzie] was.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what are your responsibilities in this regard as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Responsibilities in this regard is to oversee the churches of the African Methodist Episcopal church.  It's an administrative role more than a supervisory role.  The office of, of presiding elder is middle management, it's like supervision, it's to take a look at what the pastors are doing, to set programs in a district meeting where they come and you offer workshops and classes, you give it, serve as an advisor to the congregations and to the pastors.  As a, as the bishop you are the administrator of the work.  You can set programs and plans and hand them down to the presiding elders who gives them to the pastors or directly to the pastors and then report to the general church.  For instance, now in the district where I'm assigned which includes the Caribbean, all of the areas that have been hit in the last month with the hurricanes, these are in my area, Grenada, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, those areas that have been hit hardest with the hurricanes, Haiti.  And so my responsibility now is to raise funds to aid those places so that the churches can be rebuilt and repaired so that members of the congregation can be assisted with clothing, food, medical needs, and this kind of thing, to administer the funds that are raised and to see that the supplies get to these, these areas, as well as to provide some spiritual direction and see that the rules of discipline of the church are adhered to.
Story_ID: 227654
Speaker 1: What are the biggest challenges, I think, facing you in this job [bishop of the A.M.E. church], do you think?
Speaker 2: The biggest challenge for me immediately, of course, is trying to serve the people in the churches who have been devastated by the natural disaster right now.  But I think ultimately the greatest challenge will be to, to continue to develop the spiritual growth.  For instance, so much of the area over which I'm assigned is undeveloped, there are no A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] churches there.  We've received an invitation to come to Brazil and talk to some, to some people who would like to know more about the A.M.E. church, who are interested in starting a congregation of black Methodists in their area as they say.  And so that it would be a challenge to do that but it's one that I welcome because it also will mean the spread of the gospel in a new way, in a different area.  To build in some of the areas where we are already, for instance, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, at one time we had churches in Saint Thomas and Saint John, we no longer have churches there but to see if we can rebuild those congregations in those areas, to see if we can assist in some way of rebuilding or improving the congregations that we have in Saint Croix.  We have churches in London, England and Amsterdam, Holland [Netherlands], small congregations, three of them.  And the idea is that in London people don't go to church and this may be true of some people in that area but we have people who have come from Africa and from Jamaica who have settled, black people, who have settled in London.  And I know of some denominations, nondenominational churches that are starting to grow, and so I think that the African Methodist church can grow in these areas.  And, and so part of the challenge will be to work with the leadership in those areas to see how we can grow and develop the ministry there.
Story_ID: 227655
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the African American Episcopal church [sic. African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.)] has a history--
Speaker 2: African Methodist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, African Methodist Episcopal church has a history of activism going back to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Richard Allen in 1829.
Speaker 2: It, it started as a, as an activism movement.
Speaker 1: That's, that, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is, and over the years, you know, people like Bishop [Henry McNeal] Turner and other people who were activists, so.  Are there, do you think the church is still like an activist church?
Speaker 2: In most places, yes.  If you will look at the politics in America, ministers, pastors, A.M.E. congregations are involved.  I just did a, a piece with [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson in Chicago [Illinois] this past weekend where we were talking about Haiti and trying to bring the community in America to the aid of people in Haiti.  The voter registration drive, in the African Methodist church we have a program called V Alert, Voter Alert.  And in every city where the A.M.E. church is located there are active organizations of people who are registering people to vote.  And so, yeah, I think the activism takes different terms--turns, depending on the situation but yes I would say, if you look at [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Floyd Flake in Allen A.M.E. Church [The Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York] in Jamaica, [Queens] New York [New York], when you go into the community where that church is, you know you're in Allen A.M.E. Church territory.  When you see First A.M.E. Church [FAME] in Los Angeles [California] and the area in which it is housed, you know that First A.M.E. Church is in the community, it's an activist church.  And, and this is an example of large congregations and small congregations, wherever the African Methodist Church is located.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, do you have a, what is your, and we always ask people this question, question that are involved in religion.  What is your own philosophy of--or your own personal theology?
Speaker 2: My for, well first of all, my theology is that we are all sinners and that Christ died for our sins and that by the grace of God, salvation is for all people without any discrimination.  A part of that is that as a Christian, I am commanded by the scriptures I believe in, by Jesus, to reach out, to be responsible for my brothers and sisters in whatever way that I can.  And that it doesn't matter if I can do it in a big way or in a small way or but by sharing what God has done for me.
Story_ID: 227656
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'm concerned about the young people, about families because I see the family structure broken down so that children are by and large raising themselves.  I know that there's been a lot of criticism of the remarks that Bill Cosby made some weeks back but I think if we would stop being embarrassed by what he said and take a look at what the situation is in our communities that we will know there is a lot of work that we need to do.  We need to get back to a time when all of us were concerned and responsible for each other.  In the time when I grew up, I could be across town and if an adult spoke to me I'd better listen 'cause even without a telephone when I got home my grandmother [Paoline Cole Johnson] would know.  And, and but it, it helped me to be the person that I grew to be I think because I knew that people were concerned about me and there were certain things expected of me.  We--and so our children are, are allowed to fend for themselves all too often.  And so I think we need to strengthen our families and I'd like to see that.  I think we need to again lift up as my parent, my grandparent, my grandmother did and my mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips] for the, for the importance of education.  While it took me a long time to get around to really completing, and I have now a master's degree in theology, I've always known the importance of education and all my life I've taken a class.  If you look at my school record there was hardly two years that passed when I didn't enroll and take a class somewhere.  And so I believe that we can get back to a community that plants hope into our children instead of defeatism.
Story_ID: 227657
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything that's happened so far, I think you addressed this in some way already, but would you do anything major differently?
Speaker 2: I probably would finish school [Brinkley High School, Jackson, Mississippi] but I'm not sure I would do it if I would miss marrying Kerry Tyler.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you recently remarried right?
Speaker 2: I was married nine years ago to a native of Los Angeles [California] whose family comes from Louisiana Don W. Guidry.  And I was, sort of a second chance for an old lady (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now did your mother [Mary Wheaton Phillips] get a chance to see you become successful as a minister?
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh.  My mother died when my second son was a year old.  I didn't start preaching until maybe twenty, twenty-five years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you children surprised that you became a minister?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they were surprised they, they never seemed to be surprised.  It was sort of like we were always in church anyway and I was always up talking or teaching a class or something and so I guess they figured it was just sort of like how things happen, yeah.
Story_ID: 227658
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we always ask this question too, when you look back on everything you've done so far, and you're a new bishop [of the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) church] right now, but at this point what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think the young people that I've had an opportunity to mentor.  Right now, I can think of at least four of them including, well, five including two of my own children who are in the preaching ministry.  And hardly a day or a week go by when I don't hear from some young person that I've influenced their life.  And it's happened not because I've set out to do it but just by living my life and being who I am.  And to know that I've influenced people for the good, I think is a legacy that anybody would want to leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think the second part of that though is my own family.  I tell people I have six children and as a young mother trying to rear my children there were times when I didn't like 'em, I always loved them and if you wanted to really get a fight out of me mess with my children, but there were times when I had to provide for them and when I had to get up at night with somebody who was sick or, or with a baby who was colicky, I didn't like 'em but now they are all adults and they are people that I really like.  Not only do I love them but I have great pride in all of my children.  And every single one of them as unique as each one is, has done well in their own right and I am very proud to be their mother.

Speaker 1: --Is there anything we need to talk about that we didn't cover, you think?  Something as we near the end, I only have one more question left. Nothing?
Speaker 2: It seems like I've been talking forever (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well the last question is, and we ask this of everybody to and it's similar to legacy, but, ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered by my children as a mother who cared, who loved them, by my grandchildren as somebody who spoiled them, and by people in my ministry as a woman who most of all loved the Lord and the Lord's people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: It's been a pleasure.

Shemaranga is now twenty-six years old so that tells you how old this picture is.  And that's Ziede in her in his mama's arms.
Speaker 2: I want you to bring it in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: This is the, this is the daughter of my son, Timothy [ph.], who is Reverend Dr. Timothy [E.] Tyler who pastors in St. Louis, Missouri, and this is his daughter Imani [ph.] all dressed up in her Easter finery.

Speaker 1: This is his son, Chenelo [ph.], who is now nine years old and quite a young man and smart as a whip.  This is my grandson, Chase [ph.].  His daddy is the twin brother to Timothy whose two children we just saw, and Chase is the youngest of two sons.  He is eight years old and he has an older brother who's twenty-three.
Speaker 2: This is my son Michael [ph.] and his wife, Leslie [ph.], they live in Palm Springs [California] area.  This is shortly after they were married, probably about fifteen years ago.
Speaker 1: This is actually a couple that I married in Mexico and I don't remember the, his name is Kofi [ph.], can't remember her name (laughter).

Speaker 2: And this is Brian Michael [ph.] who is now sixteen years old, he's really growing up.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: And you would think that with twelve grandchildren and six children and two great-grandchildren that I'd have enough children of my own but this is a godchild, this little boy is our neighbor's son and we are his godparents.  I baptized him and he is now three years old.  He's Cole McNeil [ph.].

Speaker 1: This picture was taken about 1995.  And the people in the portrait are my, my youngest daughter and one of my twin sons.  We were at First A.M.E. Church [Indio, California] and they had not too long hung the portrait of Mayor Tom Bradley, so we thought that was a good historical shot.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on one second.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE): How about this one?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Family is, is important and I guess that since 1952 when I married into a larger family than I grew up in, I've been surrounded by family.  This is actually my second family-in-law, I suppose, in love.  This is the family of my, my husband, Don [Guidry], just before we were married and that's, that was taken in the summer of 1995.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is Don and me right after he had suggested that we were going to get married.  That's in, that is a Good Friday service, we were leaving and he had just announced to somebody that we were gonna get married probably in another year (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: That's why I was smiles (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this is on Mother's Day in 1995.  When Don had talked to some of the men at the church about getting engaged they told him he had to follow the tradition of First A.M.E. Church, the men have to come on the altar and propose on their knees.  He had resisted, I had said to him I don't need it and, but the guys insisted and so here we are on Mother's Day with him on his knees written, reading a poem that he had written to me and getting lots of applause (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Very good.  Next.
Speaker 1: And this is on that same day as we were leaving the church, this is his mother on--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Dropping, dropping.
Speaker 1: This is his mother with a, with the red hat and, of course, me and Don following the church service where he proposed.

Speaker 2: I am pastor of Cain Memorial [A.M.E. Church, Bakersfield, California], Bakersfield and so I'm probably getting ready for a meeting in the office.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION
Speaker 1: This is in 1982 with my husband Kerry.  We were in Indio, California and we decided that it was time to have some new pictures taken.  We hadn't had any for a long time and so this is our official portrait.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is in 1988 when I was serving as the women's representative to Consultation on Church Union [COCU] from the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and we were meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana and this is the A.M.E. delegation conferring around the table.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Very good.  Next.
Speaker 1: Is that's a meeting with the United Methodists [United Methodist Church]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Catholics, Methodists, Episcopals.
Speaker 1: Oh, really.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, all those.  There were about seven unions coming together.
Speaker 1: This, this picture is, is during that time, this is a group from the Women's Status and Role of Women [General Commission on Status and Role of Women] in COCU, Consultation on Church Union.  And we had gathered, I believe this was in New York [New York] as we gathered together and we were taking a picture with the young woman in the front is our chairperson and so we were discussing how the churches would come together around the issue of women.
