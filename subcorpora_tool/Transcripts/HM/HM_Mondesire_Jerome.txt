Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewing today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: Jerome Whyatt Mondesire [HistoryMaker Jerome W. Mondesire].  Jerome is J-E-R-O-M-E, W-H-Y-A-T-T, M-O-N-D-E-S-I-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind that name?  What kind of name is that?
Speaker 2: My father [Jerome A. Mondesire] is--comes from the West Indies, at the island of Saint Kitts.  It was originally called Saint Christopher [Saint Christopher Island].  It was grabbed by the French and then snatched back by the English, and it went back and forth over time.  The story, as we tell it in the family at reunion time, is that the name originates with a white French priest, who had a housekeeper who was African, and he had a child and the English were very different in the way they treated their slave children as opposed to the French.  The French priest admitted the child and gave the child his last name, and when he returned to France, sent money back for the boy's education, and that's the legend as we've kept it going in the family for about 120 years now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to ask you more about that when we start talking about the family history, but that's--yeah, it's good. I knew there was a story there somewhere. And is--
Speaker 2: It means my desire.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mondesire, okay.  And, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Ten, fourteen, forty-nine [October 14, 1949], October 14, I was born in New York City [New York, New York].  I was raised on 125th [Street] and what is now Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].  In fact, the site where I was raised originally is where the state office building is, where Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] has his office, and they just put a statue honoring Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] on that property.
Speaker 1: That's right in the heart of Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right in the heart of Harlem.  People who have seen the Malcolm X movie ['Malcolm X'] see the scene where Denzel Washington is speaking in front of something then called Herbert's Jewelry store, which was a real jewelry store owned by a Jewish family.  I lived on the second floor above Herbert's Jewelry store.  There are apartments up there, as they were all scattered throughout New York at that period of time, and I would come out of the house, you know, when I was like four or five years old, and we'd see people standing on ladders.  That was common in Harlem at the time, and I'd ask my dad, "Who was the guy up on the ladder with the glasses?"  And he said, "Oh, that's some character named Malcolm X."  And that's how I first saw Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: That's right, the National African Bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore, New York, New York], yeah (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was around the corner and, in fact, when Fidel Castro came to New York in '59 [1959], I was ten years old, he wasn't allowed to stay at a downtown hotel.  He had to stay at the Hotel Theresa [New York, New York], so we watched him from my window with the chickens and the goats and all the police and all the hullabaloo and the media attention that was generated by his visit.  So, it was a great time to be in Harlem in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].  Famous people like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan walked through the streets.  They appeared at some of the local nightclubs like Small's Paradise [New York, New York], and ate in the restaurants like Frank's [Frank's Restaurant, New York, New York].  Joe Louis was still alive, you could see him walking up and down 125th Street.  Jackie Robinson ran the Chock Full o'Nuts, which was located on the ground floor of the Hotel Theresa, which at that time, I didn't realize, was run by--the man who became the commerce director under Bill Clinton--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Brown [Ron Brown].
Speaker 2: Brown.  By his dad [William Brown].  I met Brown, of course, later on when I went to work for the Urban League, but, so it was a great time.  You could see things.  You could meet people, and you would hear conversations, so being involved in Harlem's life, for me, just became a natural extension of my day-to-day existence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm gonna get into that later too, but--that's good, I just want to--all right, oh, what is your--our next question, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm in newspaper now.  I began my professional career after college as a journalist with mainstream newspapers.  I spent a period of time working as chief of staff for the former congressman, William Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III], and then when he resigned to run the United Negro College Fund [UNCF], I decided to partner up with some of the brothers I had met in politics and we started a newspaper called the Philadelphia Sun [Philadelphia Sunday Sun].
Speaker 1: Okay. What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is July 11, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the Hyatt hotel [Hyatt Regency Milwaukee] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, attending the 96th NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] national convention.
Story_ID: 597995
Speaker 1: Okay, now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that they always ask me to ask--and I must ask them.  They only require a short answer.  The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, you want me to name it?  Strawberries (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: The summer.  I love the heat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red, I just love the brilliance of the color.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The Caribbean.  I like to go home.
Speaker 1: And the last one, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Ignorance is a terrible thing to watch, by William Goethe [sic. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe] the German philosopher.
Story_ID: 597996
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Jerome A. Mondesire] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name was Winnifred Catherine Taylor, Winnifred, W-I-N-N-I-F-R-E-D, Catherine, C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Charleston, South Carolina.  She died when I was eleven, so I couldn't tell you when Mom was born. She had me when she was forty-three, so she was obviously, you know, just before World War I [WWI].
Speaker 1: Okay. About 1914 or '15 [1915], something like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Somewhere around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, well, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Not very far, because she died so young, so young in my experience.  Her father's name was Thomas Whyatt [Thomas Whyatt Taylor]; that's where I get the middle name from, and I can't remember her mother's name, but they were raised in South Carolina, and she moved to New York City [New York, New York] when she was a young girl with her mother and her mother's three sisters and they relocated to Harlem [New York, New York], and she met my dad at a West Indian dance.  They had so many dance studios back during the jazz era and during the Harlem Renaissance.  They met in the '40s [1940s] at a West Indian dance.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, she died when you were how old?
Speaker 2: I was eleven.
Speaker 1: Eleven?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  She got pneumonia.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did she ever tell you any stories about growing up in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: She described the harshness of it and why she--that they wanted her to leave, because it was an inhospitable place for black people, even for black women who were domestics, they were all domestics.  My mother was a domestic.  When they left the scene of where they were working, it was ugly and brutal and they wanted out.  And they had the promise that there were better jobs in the garment industry, 'cause my mother had a daytime job when she wasn't a domestic.  She worked in the garment industry in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she get a chance to finish high school?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think my mother finished the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Now, you said--so, they met at a--your parents met at a dance.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the dances, both of 'em thought they were--could really cut a rug, and so they would regularly attend these West Indian dances and the cabaret was, the night club scene hadn't really gotten started; the cabaret scene, West Indian dances, different islands would have competitions for dances if you were from Jamaica or Trinidad.  Saint Kitts [Saint Christopher Island] has really joined with a place called Nevis [Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis], which is another small island, and so they would be part of the competition.
Speaker 1: Where Alexander Hamilton is from.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yep. So, well, anything else about your mother's family that you can tell us that--?
Speaker 2: She had three crazy old aunts who, since I was the only child that my mother had, they used to give me a fit, trying to raise me all the time and make sure I dress properly and went to church every Sunday and when I wasn't around them I was happier (laughter).  That's my most ready memory of that experience.  The other thing I would say, my mother's commitment to my education was phenomenal.  It cost her life.  She had three jobs, and my mother had this extraordinary belief in education, and she would go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that I got it.  She actually farmed me out to live during the week in homes of friends or people she would meet who lived in what she considered good neighborhoods, where the schools were predominantly white, where she thought I would get a good education.  So, I only went to school in Harlem for the--for kindergarten and the first grade.  From second grade all the way through high school, I went to predominantly white schools, living, and not with blood relatives.  These were friends of people she'd met at work or people she'd met through contacts at work and she would always check them out and what she would do is that she would pay them to actually let me board at their house during the Monday through Friday, and I can remember like it was yesterday.  She would give me the money to pay these people in my sock, so when I got on the subway to ride out to their homes, whether they were in Queens [New York] or the Bronx [New York], the quote unquote better neighborhoods, I wouldn't get robbed, or even if I did get robbed, nobody would find the money and, remember, she was a domestic.  She didn't make a lot of money, and--but she did that to make sure that I could read and write with the best of 'em.
Story_ID: 597997
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Jerome Alexis Mondesire; Jerome with a J, J-E-R-O-M-E; Alexis, A-L-E-X-I-S; Mondesire, M-O-N-D-E-S-I-R-E.  He was actually born in Dominica and raised in Saint Kitts [Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis], the town is called Basseterre, and I took my children to Saint Kitts so they could see where he was raised just a couple years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he was--born in Dominica (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He came to New York City [New York, New York].  He was born in the West Indies.  He was a British subject, so Saint Kitts by this time was a British colony, and he came to the United States.  He got off at Ellis Island [New York, New York] the same week as the Titanic sunk, so that it did not, so at certain--at family gatherings we'd have to listen to the story again on how he read the Titanic stories.
Speaker 1: That's like 1912?
Speaker 2: That was April of 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was waiting for--to get cleared because you have to be cleared of any disease and you have to make sure that you've got a place to live and you had to go through all the credentialing to get off the island.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about the ancestors on this side?  You started telling us a story.  Was that story, was that--.
Speaker 2: My father told the story and, of course, his brothers told it and on his mother's side, they were Arawak Indians. We had--there was a surviving picture of my father's mother and the Arawak were the original people that Columbus [Christopher Columbus] encountered when he got lost and bumped into El Salvador, thought he was in India (laughter).
Speaker 1: Just for clarification now, just for clarification now, you said the name [Mondesire] is from Saint Kitts; is it from Dominica or Saint Kitts?
Speaker 2: Saint Kitts.
Speaker 1: Is it from--okay, so the name is from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's where the priest lived--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right. I just wasn't sure.
Speaker 2: --'cause the French had Saint Kitts first.
Speaker 1: Yeah. They had Dominica, too, I mean they had, like, Haiti--
Speaker 2: They had most of 'em, right. And then the British grabbed Saint Kitts from them.
Speaker 1: The Arawaks were from--
Speaker 2: The Arawaks were the people that Christopher Columbus--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --first encountered, and you could see the Arawak, the Native American features in her bone structure and her cheeks and in her hair in this picture, and my father's father was an African, you know, ex-slave, deeply black man, heavy ebony and hued black man, whom my father described as very mean and very dictatorial.
Story_ID: 597998
Speaker 1: Did he [Mondesire's father, Jerome A. Mondesire] say much else about growing up in Saint Kitts [Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis]?
Speaker 2: Well, he was, then because of my father's father, of course as I told you, had been--been the beneficiary of the French priest's financial support, he was well-educated.  He owned a plantation and he set his wife up, my father's mother, as a baker and they also had an ice factory, so by standards on the island back, say, in the 1890s, the early 1900s, they were upper middle class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the French priest was your grandfather, then on your father's--
Speaker 2: Great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Great-grandfather on your father's side.  That's what I meant to say.  Okay.  Oh, what is the date of birth and place of birth--well, the date of birth of your father?  We know the place--
Speaker 2: I believe it's December 8, 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And so, when he came here [New York, New York] he was a--
Speaker 2: He was teenager.
Speaker 1: Teenager, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was eighteen.
Speaker 1: And did he talk about, I mean, I guess it could be supposed everybody knows why somebody would come to the United States, but what reason did he give?
Speaker 2: Mostly what he said was that it was to get away from his father and, of course, economic opportunity.  My dad had a good education, too, because the British were very, very smart in how they colonized.  When they found that there were smart people of color on the islands, they would allow them, assuming they passed the entrance exam, to attend the schools with the white colonials' children.  So, my father attended children [sic. school] with the colonial governor's children and spoke Greek, spoke a little Latin, spoke French well, could even read Greek and Latin quite well, and so when he got off the boat in 1912, my father went to City College in New York [City College of New York, New York, New York] and all but finished.  He almost had a B.A., but he had gotten married and he had a child.  He had to work to take care of the child, but the best job despite the education and all this fluency in various languages.  He ended up as an elevator operator in the garment industry.  He later became a sleeping car porter on the railroads, the Pennsylvania Railroad located in New York, obviously.  He didn't like serving people, especially serving white people, so he only did that a few years, and then he went into the publishing business, not to own his own company but to--he worked for various publishing houses because at that time, New York City had a plethora of newspapers, you know, ten or twelve newspapers, so you either worked for the Daily News [New York Daily News] for a period of time or what people call the Daily Mirror [New York Daily Mirror] or the Journal-American [New York Journal-American] in the print shop and in the paper handling shop.  He became a foreman in the paper handling wing of newspaper publishing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those are the guys that handle the big rolls of newspaper.
Story_ID: 597999
Speaker 1: Can you describe your parents' [Winnifred Taylor and Jerome A. Mondesire] personalities and can you tell us, like what--who you think you take after?
Speaker 2: Probably the old man.  He had a rough temper, didn't suffer fools well; could be arrogant, so probably from him.  My mother had patience and a belief in the long term of the future, and suffered people much better than my dad did (laughter).  I get in the most trouble because I don't like to waste time, and I get that from my father.  I'm very conscious of staying busy.  My father's idea, especially like on vacation time, if he was up, you better be up, so if school was closed you still better be up at 6:00, 6:30 dressed, eat your breakfast and ready to do something, either go to work or help him go to work, or be prepared to be productive.  He did not let you sit around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you didn't talk about your father much when talking about being raised.  Were you around him much?
Speaker 2: Not--my father and mother were not married; in fact, my father was married when I was born.  And so, I mean, we knew each other.  My mother made a point of making sure that she gave me his last name and introduced me to him and, of course, it was extraordinarily beneficial to me 'cause she died when I was eleven, and then he took me in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he basically took care of you when your mother--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Now, did you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: My father had a whole 'nother set of family with his wife, three boys and one girl, and one boy who died, and there's only one left out today, but we all knew each other, even though they are considerably older because my first half-brother was born when my dad, as I said, was eighteen and I was born when my father was fifty-three.  So, there's a big, wide--big, wide age gap.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'd be like almost parents in terms of their age (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Almost, right.  And, in fact, their children are considerably older than me and I still made 'em call me uncle (laughter).
Story_ID: 598000
Speaker 1: Well tell us about growing up.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I mean Harlem [New York, New York] was a--truly was a village and it was exciting.  The smells, of course, fumes from the buses, all of the fish fry and soul food places, the sounds, of course, were the record stores and the vendors on the street, where guys that would shave ice, you know, big blocks of ice back in the '50s [1950s] and they would shave the ice and put it in paper cups, paper Dixie cups, and then pour, you know, flavored liquid over it.  Basically, I guess it would be like Kool-Aid today, and they were what they called snow cones and they would sell those for a nickel.  There were still sounds of horses, you know, drawing the carriages.  Sometimes they were picking up junk.  We used to call it junk men, or they would be drawing the light--knife sharpeners; the people would come outside and bring their knives.
Speaker 1: So, they had--still had horses on the street in New York [New York] in the late '40s [1940s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  In the late '50s [1950s], late '50s, [1950s] okay.  And early '60s [1960s]. Of course, you had the sound of people whose homes were heated with coal.  The coal truck would back up and you'd hear this rushing sound of all this ugly, dirty coal rushing down and then you'd hear the other sound of the janitors walking around, digging out the ash and carrying and lugging it up outside.  Of course, in the hot summertime in New York City and by the time of the early '60s [1960s] the sounds were the fire hydrants, spraying.  By the time the movement got started in Harlem in the '60s [1960s], we had the men preaching upon the ladders.  We had demonstrations, you had the drums during the whole explosion of Afro culture and Afrocentric culture.  It was just a wonderful place to grow up in.  It's very different today, but then--and then we had people, probably the most significant part about my youth in Harlem is that prior to the end of Jim Crow segregation, everyone lived in Harlem.  When you went to church, the same teacher, nurse, or doctor that you might be sitting next to in the pews was also your neighbor.  Might live in the same apartment building, might live in the adjoining brownstone, but lived in the neighborhood.  By the end of the '60s [1960s], that was gone.  They had all moved to Queens [New York] or to Long Island [New York], or to Westchester [Westchester County, New York] and you had a concentration of the very poor, the very downtrodden and disinherited, as we sometimes were called in Harlem and it was very difficult but the separation of the classes is something I remember, you know, very vividly 'cause I watched it, 'cause I lived in Harlem my entire life, you know, when I'd come back home and especially when I was in college [City College of New York, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 598001
Speaker 1: I guess it's just me but maybe I'm just drawn to this bookstore [African National Memorial Bookstore, New York, New York] (laughter).
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Name of [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson, who was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --used to talk about, you know, taking a train ride to that store, you know.
Speaker 2: It was the most phenomenal--the most phenomenal, probably, collection of literature in North America, dealing with people of color.  The Michaux family, you've gotta keep in mind, the man [Lewis H. Michaux] who owned it, was also related to Oscar Micheaux, the filmmaker.  I don't know if they were cousins or if one was--they weren't brothers but they were related, so you had one Micheaux who was a pioneer black filmmaker--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oscar and then--
Speaker 2: --who made all these great films and used some of the black stars, who became somewhat famous in Hollywood in later years, and then you had this other member of the Micheaux family that--
Speaker 1: Lewis--
Speaker 2: Lewis Michaux, with his collection and he had this great series of pictures of Kwame Nkrumah and other African leaders, Haile Selassie, on the front of the building.  So, just walking past the store was, in fact, a black history lesson and he would change the books in the window, you know, repeatedly on a regular basis.  It's the first place I encountered J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers], you know, history of black people, Paul Laurence Dunbar, obviously Elijah Muhammad, and then Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, the books by Garvey, of course all of Du Bois' [W.E.B. Du Bois] books were there, but you were also encouraged to go inside the store.  That was the other part of it.  You could meet anybody in there, you could meet professors from Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], or City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], or Fordham [Fordham University, New York, New York]; sometimes, even the white professors would come, but all the black professors would come, but all the activists would come, all the lawyers and the people who were in the movement, things that you would see in the news, you'd hear about it, you'd see, I saw Floyd McKissick in there one day, Sutton [Percy Sutton], the lawyer for Malcolm X (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Percy Sutton, yeah.
Speaker 2: --who went on to--Percy, and who went to fame and then fortune as an attorney and now as a cable TV operator.  Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] would hang out in there on his way up to Frank's Restaurant [New York, New York], or going across to get some coffee at the Chock Full o'Nuts from the Hotel Theresa [New York, New York], so it was a gathering spot, and then during the height of the movement, during the height of the '60s [1960s], all of the pan-Africanists, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], the Nation of Islam, the Five Percenters [Five Percent Nation], you name the group, you give their initials, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] would meet there, Muhammad Ali is there, in fact it's depicted in the film ['Ali'] where--with Will Smith.  He is walking past the bookstore after, you know, signing autographs and then making a speech.  During times of trouble and crisis, when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated, when there were also people killed by the police and there was trouble in the neighborhood.  The bookstore became also a repository of fact; not that Michaux saw himself as some kind of street leader, but he would gather, people would come to the bookstore so you could find out was, in fact, someone killed by the police, what was his or her name.  What's the condition if they weren't killed, and so things were--there was a conversation that was always going on.  It became a very important place, and when it was lost because of his death, it left a huge hole and there was a place that opened up on Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard], called Liberation Bookstore [New York, New York], but it never filled the void.  I mean, it was just such a unique place, plus it was huge.  It was--I believe, I remember I was going as a kid and I believe it had a backyard.  So, and then there were books everywhere, from the floor to the ceiling.  It was just a wonderful place; so, you're right to remember it.
Story_ID: 598002
Speaker 1: Any other memories growing up in Harlem [New York, New York] that you--?
Speaker 2: It was cold in the wintertime (laughter).  We didn't own anything. And that was clear, you know, from the very beginning.  We didn't own stores, we didn't own the laundromats, they were owned by the Asian Americans.  We didn't own the jewelry stores, we didn't own the furniture stores.  People don't remember, but I think Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] really became famous for desegregating a place.  The sign is still there today, called Blumstein's [Blumstein's Department Store, New York, New York], which was a Jewish-owned department store, which it did not hire black people to work on 125th Street on any kind of job other than the most menial; janitorial, sweeping the bathrooms up, or, you know, loading and unloading the trucks when they came to deliver.  Powell's first major demonstration, and I was a little guy, my mother [Winnifred Taylor] went to his church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] and told me about it because she marched with him, was to force Blumstein's to hire black sales clerks; in fact, I remember one of her best friends became a sales clerk and I--we used to go in Blumstein's and always go to her when she worked there and this was in the mid-'50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that was the other memory, that we just, you know, and in my household ownership of a business, even though neither parent owned anything, but it was something that they always strove to see that their children did, 'cause my older brothers had their own business and my brother-in-law did, and now I do.
Story_ID: 598003
Speaker 1: It seems that growing up in that area was a place where you could see a lot of activism going on and--
Speaker 2: It was a part, you had to close your eyes not to be a part of it.  My dad [Jerome A. Mondesire] loved to eat out and there was a Greek-owned restaurant in Harlem [New York, New York], 125th Street, it's now a grocery store, or a dollar store, and it's called Frank's [Frank's Restaurant, New York, New York], and you would see everybody in there.  As I said, you would see Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], you'd see Jackie Robinson. I remember Lena Horne walked in and my father almost fainted, he was so impressed (laughter).  It was, you know, a place you have to close yourself off from, and my dad was a Garveyite and people remember the pictures by Van Der Zee [James Van Der Zee] with the people all dressed up in their splenderous uniforms with the plumes and the plume hats and the epaulettes on the shoulders and the women in their flowing white dresses.  My parents were a part of that, and they loved it.
Speaker 1: You were unique in the sense that your parents were older when you were born than most people's parents usually are--did you think that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that was a great boom.  It didn't--wasn't then, because, you know when my father would show up at school sometimes, people would say, "Is that your grandfather?"  And, of course when you're six, eight, nine years old, you're embarrassed, and especially after my mother [Winnifred Taylor] died and my father would have to come attend PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meetings, you know they would say, "Your dad looks real old," of course he was balding.  But, the beauty of it is that the house was full of books; all kinds of books, some of the books I couldn't read.  I never learned Greek.  My father did, and so my dad couldn't play ball, for example, where the kids' fathers might show them how to play football or basketball.  So, my father's idea of an activity on Sunday was to do what?  We had to go to the Museum of Natural History [American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York], the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], the Guggenheim [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York], and all of these; I know every museum (laughter) probably built before 1975.  I visited each twice, and his favorite was the Museum of Natural History, and that was the kind of activity, and he loved baseball, so we'd go to baseball games.  But that was the beneficial plan; of course, I didn't realize it until I was in high school or even college, when people would talk about certain books or activities that they have been part of and some of the African American students couldn't say--you know, the white students, you know, "I went to the museum, and we saw this or we saw that," and I said, "Well, so did I."  And they would all turn around like, "Really?" They didn't believe me.

Speaker 1: You were going to tell us about the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].  We have speed now, so--
Speaker 2: I mean because the Apollo--you asked about the sights and sounds, and I was remiss not to mention the Apollo, because every week, every week, you'd have this huge line of people and some days it would come all the way down to my apartment building and I know people find that hard to believe, but there would be over eight hundred people in line to see James Brown.  The gay show, which the name of it will come to me in a minute, of course the 'Motown Revue' [sic. 'Motortown Revue'], and--
Speaker 1: The gay show, you're talking about the female impersonators or something like that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the female impersonators, and Jocko Henderson [Douglas "Jocko" Henderson], who became famous in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but before he went to Philadelphia, he had this thing called 'Jocko's Rocket Ship Show,' and he'd have all the non-Motown acts and they would line--and he would wear a, this is before people went to the moon (laughter), so he would wear a costume announcing himself as a astronaut and he'd have this plastic suit on with a space helmet under his arm.  That was the big poster, and so you'd--and then of course, James Brown.  Those four or five shows, you'd have this humongous line all the way down 125th Street underneath the Loew's Victoria Theater [New York, New York], past Percy Sutton's law office, past the corner bookstore, and it would wrap around sometimes to the RKO Alhambra [New York, New York], which was the main movie theater on the avenue at that time, it was called 7th Avenue.  Now it's Frederick Douglass Boulevard [sic. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].  So, and then you'd see the signs of the artist, whether it'd be Stevie Wonder and then the 'Motown Revue,' which would include maybe ten acts, you'd have Stevie Wonder, The Miracles, two or three other parts of the show, and it'd all be like two bucks [two dollars], and you could stay all day because in different theaters, it had that similar kinds of things, used to call it the chitterling circuit, but we always got a movie at the Apollo, and sometimes it wasn't a bad movie and I was, you know, it was a B feature; it wasn't an A feature.  It wasn't 'The Ten Commandments' or 'Ben-Hur,' but sometimes it was a good, sometimes a good murder mystery with Van Heflin or Humphrey Bogart, and then of course, there was a comedy act on Wednesday nights and 'Amateur Night' ['Amateur Night at the Apollo'], and the famous character with the long cane, he'd grab you by the neck--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sandman [Howard Sims].
Speaker 2: Sandman hook, it's all been popularized and written about, but to see it and then to be a part of it, you couldn't, you can't talk about Harlem [New York, New York] in the late '50s [1950s] or early '60s [1960s] until you talk--without mentioning the Apollo.

Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a kid growing up.  What was your personality like, and what would people say you were like?
Speaker 2: Shy, bookish, and I probably--those were probably the main characteristics that people would see first, and I wore glasses early, so I guess that implied that I read, which I did read; of course, you had to read 'cause in my household, reading was almost--not reading was almost a sin (laughter) according to my father [Jerome A. Mondesire], and I wasn't very athletic.  I had bronchitis as a child.  I had been sick.  Those would be the main characteristics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did you like to do the most?
Speaker 2: Ride a bike and walk, because walking strengthened and helped me eventually get to the point where I could run track and overcome the bronchitis and, of course, New York [New York] is not a car owner city.  My dad never had a driver's license.  He lived to be seventy-two, but my mother [Winnifred Taylor] never drove anything.  I'm not even sure she could ride a bike, so it's a walker's city and you can get to any place, you know, with the public transportation as long as you can walk to the bus or to the subway.  So, those are the main activities.  And playing sports with the other kids, we, in New York, our version of baseball, because we didn't have a lot of baseball diamonds, there's a thing called stickball, where you would saw off the handle to your mother's broom or to your mother's mop, and you go get a--we used to call them Spaldeens [Spalding High-Bounce Ball], a little reddish ball, pink ball, that had air in it, and we'd play stickball and throw the ball at the fastest speed you could pitch it and then you'd have to swing it and you couldn't run the bases necessarily.  You would judge if a person got a single or a double or a triple by how far the ball travelled down the block, and if the ball went up on the roof, that was an automatic homerun and then, of course, everybody would have to chip in and buy another one.  Luckily, they only cost a quarter so it meant that each of you had to kick in a nickel (laughter).
Story_ID: 598006
Speaker 1: What grade school did you start off at?  You started off in kindergarten in Harlem [New York, New York], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kindergarten--I can't remember the name of the school in Harlem.  I went to elementary school in the Bronx [New York], living with a family that my mother [Winnifred Taylor] met.  The lady of the house was a nurse, and she was a West Indian, and I believe she met this lady at one of the dances and she eventually became my godmother, and it was P.S. 88 [S. Silverstein Little Sparrow School] in the Bronx, predominantly Jewish school, went there from grades one through four, and then--she had became very sick and my mother found a family for me to stay with in Queens [New York] and I believe that was Junior High School 172 [J.H.S. 172, Hillside Junior High School; Irwin Altman Middle School 172, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In a place called Jamaica [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then in high school, went to Martin Van Buren High School [Queens, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay, now where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which is in Springfield Gardens, also in Queens--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a predominantly white school.  On Jewish holidays when--not when someone--or the days leading up to the Jewish holidays, I'd be maybe, it'd be like three or four of us in the school, 'cause the rest of the students were all gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: New York had a thing, too, that some they call open enrollment, which meant that if you could travel to a school you could attend it, and a few African American and Hispanic families took advantage of it.  Of course, my mother found out about it and made sure we took advantage of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, she sacrificed quite a bit of time with you to send you to these (unclear).
Speaker 2: She worked to make sure that there was money to pay these families to take care of me, and she couldn't always understand my homework, but she would try to check it.  She always wanted to be a part of my activities until she passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you--were there any teachers that really stick out as mentors to you, or--?
Speaker 2: In my fifth grade in school, at the junior high, at the school after P.S. 88, yeah, my fifth grade teacher, Mrs. McAllister [ph.], who was an African American teacher.  She was an extraordinary woman, used music to teach us.  She loved music.  She played the piano and, I believe, she played the violin and she taught us all kinds of international folk dances and used music from all across the world, including Af--first time I ever heard African drums on a record.  I don't know where she got it; maybe it was Olatunji [Babatunde Olatunji], or someone else who was around at the time, I can't remember, but she used all kinds of music to teach her students about the multicultural world, and--
Speaker 1: So she taught social studies or geography or something?
Speaker 2: Yes, she taught geography.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--but she used music to teach us not just about land formations but about who the people were on the land, and to differentiate them.  It was quite revealing and something you don't forget.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She took us on field trips.  She loved to take us on field trips, Mrs. McAllister.
Speaker 1: So where did she take you?  I mean, did she take you to the--
Speaker 2: To the museums, but also to festivals. I mean, we got buses and went to Ukrainian festivals, went to Puerto Rican festivals, went to Russian festivals, there was another one I'm trying to remember, Italian festivals; whatever was going on during the particular school year that she thought she could find a bus that could get us there, back and safe in the same school day, she'd take us.  It was reasonable.  I mean, I think it may have cost maybe thirty-five cents, fifty cents.  Each child put up.  You took your lunch in a brown bag.
Story_ID: 598007
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school, or--?
Speaker 2: Math.  Math and science.  I was going to be an engineer.  In fact, when I went to high school [Martin Van Buren High School, Queens, New York] it was during the Cold War, height of the Cold War, and they told us anybody who wanted to be an engineer, 'cause that's what the country needed then, you know, to fight the Cold War, to beat the Ruskies, take Russian or German. So here I am, the only black kid in the class taking Russian for four years in high school.
Speaker 1: Took Russian for four years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I took Russian for four years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you--did they tell you about Pushkin [Alexander Pushkin]?  I bet you probably knew, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew--my dad [Jerome A. Mondesire] had told me about Pushkin, and there was another African American influential character from Russian history that may come to me in a minute, but it was just, whenever we--you know, the Russian class would travel to other schools, and I was--because I was tall and skinny I was at the end of the line, you'd go visit these other schools to have, you know, Russian language face-offs, or just learn about Russian culture, and here comes this one black kid in the class.  You could just see the looks on their faces like where did he come from (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Now that must have been quite a feeling to know that you knew something that a lot of people didn't--other people didn't know, I guess.
Speaker 2: It was--I mean, in a sense, it kind of--it clearly separated you, there's no question about that.  Not a lot, there were a few African American students in both my junior high [J.H.S. 172, Hillside Junior High School; Irwin Altman Middle School 172, Queens, New York] and high schools.  They thought it was funny 'cause they took Spanish, most of them took Spanish, a couple took French.  Most of them took Spanish.  No one took German.  I mean, the Germans just were not in.  They were not cool.  The Russians were not, you know, we just had mystery and then we had questions about them.  Of course, the Cold War scare stories, the Cuban Missile Crisis, which literally scared the heck out of the students in school.  I remember when it happened, they made us climb under the desk, you know, 'cause they thought that World War III was gonna start back in October of '63 [1963].  When Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassinated, remember there was a lot of speculation, maybe the Russians [Soviets] were behind it, so a lot of the students figured that anyone who could speak the language, you know, was--had a special in, so it kind of separated you, but also kind of made you cool, that you could speak it a little bit and that you were taking a class in it.  I didn't dislike it.  I changed career options when I got to college.  I decided not to be an engineer.  It made my dad very mad.  He wanted me to be an engineer, but I enjoyed it.  I don't remember a lot of it today, but I remember some of it.
Story_ID: 598008
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, was television or radio a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Not, not at first.  People remember the movie about the 64,000 ['$64,000 question']--'Quiz Show.'  People shared televisions, and today that's, you know, the young generation has no concept of that.  We did not have the first TV in the block.  My father [Jerome A. Mondesire] bought my mother [Winnifred Taylor] a TV.  My father, you know, made more money than my mom and he bought the TV, and in fact I can remember him bringing it to the house.  I was about eight years old, and it was a humongous thing, and it weighed a ton.  Two of his friends plus he brought it up these flight of steps, you know, in this small apartment above the Herbert's Jewelry store [New York, New York] and set it up and, of course, my mother got on the phone and called all her aunts and friends and girlfriends and before we know it, we were having a part in the house (laughter).  There must have been thirty people.  And, it could have been 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' or 'The Dinah Shore Show,' or some show like that.  It was a variety show, and everyone was watching.  Or it could have been 'Amos 'n' Andy,' who--I can't remember, but everyone was watching it.  The shows we all watched, of course, were the, you know, the cartoons on Saturday morning and then the westerns.  I wouldn't say it was a big part of my life because, you know, homework and reading was pushed in the house.  You had to do your homework and then make sure it was checked before you could watch TV.  You could play outside more and then, of course, and I told you when I lived in Queens [New York] and in the Bronx [New York], these were different neighborhoods and you could go outside, not like today.  Not like, you know, my children--I take 'em to soccer games, baseball games, basketball games.  Even when they become teenagers, it's just a different kind of existence, you don't let them just run outside the neighborhoods.  My children are blessed.  They have been raised in some of the most safe and hospitable environments in the--in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] proper, and I'm still careful about it don't let them just run outside, 'cause it's a different time.
Story_ID: 598009
Speaker 1: Was music a big part of growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother [Winnifred Taylor] sent me to piano lessons a couple years before she passed away.  Didn't keep it up after she died, though, but the house was full of music.  My--as I told you, my mother and father [Jerome A. Mondesire] met at a dance, so we had plenty of calypso music playing in the house, we had plenty of classical music.  My father didn't play anything, but he loved music and he took me to a lot of concerts, and because you're raised in New York [New York], which is the cultural capital, especially at that time, of the world, at least on this side of the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean], we went to concerts at Carnegie [Carnegie Hall, New York, New York], at Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  He even made me go to the Metropolitan Opera once with him.  That wasn't fun, but I remember it (laughter), and as a teenager, if you weren't at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] during the summer months, you were at some festival, and because everybody came to New York and then, I remember when the Newport Jazz Festival, remember it fell out of favor in Rhode Island and it came to New York, and so you never missed it, and then we had a beer in New York then called Schaefer [Schaefer Beer], (unclear) then there were regional beer distributors and beer manufacturers back then, and they put out the Central Park Jazz Festival [Rheingold Central Park Music Festival; Schaefer Music Festival] in the late '60s [1960s] up to the early '70s [1970s], and you could go to see any show in New York in the Wollman Skating Rink [Wollman Rink, New York, New York] for one dollar, and so Nina Simone, Herbie Han--Herbie Mann, Trane [John Coltrane], Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon.  I was a jazz buff.  You could get to see these people up close for a dollar, so the crew, we'd would leave school, either high school or college, and we'd go and get there in line real early, from, you know, June through the end of August, and you saw everybody.  The only thing that stopped you was the rain, and then some of us figured out that if you took the old cleaning bags, you could use them as a, like a village rain protector, and we'd cut it in half and you'd each share it, so even--so the concert sometimes wouldn't even stop unless the rain got real heavy.  So, we saw everybody and then, of course, when the Newport Jazz Festival moved to New York, it was even more, so it was always a lot of fun to do; in fact, I was at the Central Park Festival seeing Herbie Mann play when he invited somebody from the audience.  He said, "Does anybody in the audience want to join the jam session?"  This was a true story.  And, a little brown-skinned girl got up and said, "Yeah," and she got up and she played one of his songs and then jammed again and he asked her name and handed the microphone, and she said, "My name is Bobbi Humphrey."  And that was the first time a public, a large public audience had ever heard of Bobbi Humphrey and of course she went on to fame and fortune with 'East River Drive' [sic. 'Harlem River Drive'] and everything else.
Story_ID: 598010
Speaker 1: Did your family keep up with the Civil Rights Movement?  All the stuff down South was going on (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Winnifred Taylor] had passed, my father [Jerome A. Mondesire] had been a Garveyite as I said, then he got conservative and he became very afraid for my safety, because I joined SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and started the black publication on my college campus.  My college was in New York City [New York, New York], and it was free, but it was predominantly white.  There were about twelve thousand students and three hundred black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--okay.
Speaker 2: --the City College of New York [New York, New York]. The big dividing, the big block to getting African Americans to attend it was you have to have a B average and you have to have a certain score on the SATs.  That's why there was a program created called SEEK [Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge] program, and I can't tell you what those initials stand for, S-E-E-K, but that was created to increase the number of African American students who went to the City College.  We eventually took over the campus in '69 [1969], to force the government of New York to have open admissions, and that became a big crusade at the school at the time, but prior to open admissions, prior to the SEEK program, when I went to college in '67 [1967], three hundred black students out of twelve thousand.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you graduated from Martin Van Buren [Martin Van Buren High School, Queens, New York] in '67 [1967], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Martin Van Buren. Yeah, I had a B plus average and I had a good score on the SATs, so I had no trouble.  I knew I was going to go to City College as of fall, but I wanted to go to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], but my dad had retired and we didn't have any money, and so Fisk had, of course, been one of the leading HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  Also, been the school where Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] went, so I figured that had to be a cool place to go, but we couldn't afford it.
Speaker 1: So did you kind of idolize Du Bois when you were--?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, 'Souls of Black Folk' ['The Souls of Black Folk,' W.E.B. Du Bois] and founded the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], founder of Crisis, somebody you always remembered, and whenever you read his books you find something new.  So, Fisk became economically impossible, so City College became the institution for fallback reasons.  Liked it, got involved in all the politics on the campus; of course, it was the height of the civil rights struggle, the height of the Black Power movement, so I joined SNCC, went down south, became very active with SNCC, and my dad, at this time, became really afraid.  He thought I was--get hurt, remember Schwerner [Michael Schwerner], Chaney [James Chaney] and Goodman [Andrew Goodman] were killed in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was like '64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: So, I'm four years later.  People were still being killed or shot at; Meredith [James Meredith], of course, was shot on the highway [U.S. Route 51].
Story_ID: 598011
Speaker 1: By this time, I had this huge Afro, which my dad [Jerome A. Mondesire], of course, didn't approve.  He was a fair-skinned black man born in the 19th century with straight hair, so he wanted to know why I liked to tease my hair so it would look like an Afro (laughter), and wore dashikis.  He said, "Why are you wearing that stuff?"
Speaker 2: Did he--he didn't make any connection with the Garvey Movement in this at all, at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At this point, he, you know, he had become disenfranchised because the--you know, he had bought the shares in the Black Star Line, and he had given money and, of course, when Garvey [Marcus Garvey] was discredited and attacked by the power structure, some of it came out that Garvey had, in fact, how would you say, misappropriated some of the funds.  So, my father had a somewhat different attitude about the Garvey Movement.  Still believed in the cause of African liberation, there is no question about that, but became less than enthusiastic about some of the leadership personalities that were on the scene.  They raised questions about some of the people in the civil rights (unclear), but he didn't dislike King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], he didn't dislike Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], or some of the others.  He didn't think much of the black power student leaders, people like H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] then that was his name, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] who became (unclear) Ture, definitely didn't like the Panthers [Black Panther Party].  He thought the guns and the in-your-face attitude would lead to wholesale slaughter.  He wasn't really wrong about that in terms of the Panthers, when you count how many were killed.  The SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] activity, he thought would have long--would have good benefits.  It was just the risk.  He didn't want to see his, his younger son (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, was there a SNCC chapter in New York City [New York, New York], in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they came to recruit on college campuses.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they recruited us. Yeah, we went to Alabama, post-Stokely in the Black Power movement in '69 [1969] we were in Alabama and we helped elect a sheriff in Lowndes County [Alabama], which is where Stokely made the famous, you know, black power speech, but we actually went down there; students from City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and NYU [New York University, New York, New York] went down there jointly and worked to elect the first black sheriff of Lowndes County.
Speaker 2: That's the county where the Black Panther Party was formed.
Speaker 1: That's exactly.
Speaker 2: In '65 [1965], '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: And in fact, people need to know the history, the white Democratic Party of Alabama symbol is a chicken.  It actually was a rooster.  And, they came up with the idea of having the black panther, you know, confront the rooster and obviously the panther is never going to lose a struggle between a (laughter) rooster and a panther, but that's where it comes from.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then the symbolism at least spread to the, the West Coast and that idea (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, they got picked up, and--
Speaker 2: And the Black Panther Party that we know was found on the West Coast using that symbolism--
Speaker 1: Using the same symbol.
Speaker 2: --from Lowndes County, Black Panther Party, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now, his concern was my personal safety (unclear).  We would argue about reparations or whether Huey [Huey P. Newton] should be freed, or this or that, you know, particular atom, but his overall belief in the cause was sound.  He just, he also saw the headlines, people getting arrested and people getting hurt.
Speaker 2: There's still a lot of that going on in the--especially in the Panther Party on both coasts.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They're still trying to clear the case of Assata Shakur.  She's in Cuba now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Well, she was the--my roommate at the time  went out with her during the time when the police officer was gunned down, so a lot of my personal relationships were also involved, crisscrossed with people who you either heard about or read about in the news.
Story_ID: 598012
Speaker 1: My father [Jerome A. Mondesire] was also--I was naive, of course this is 1919--didn't always understand the treachery that the government could attend to, and in fact, I was very lucky.  My father had grown up at a period of time; he had seen what the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] had done to people who were Socialists and/or Communists.
Speaker 2: And the Garvey Movement.
Speaker 1: And the Garvey Movement.
Speaker 2: He may not have been aware of that, but that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But he had seen it, and so he would warn me, "You gotta be very careful about authorities and questions," and so forth.  I'll never forget this, as the head of the black student paper on my campus [of the City College of New York, New York, New York], of course, I interviewed people of all shapes, sizes and political affiliations.  So, an older West Indian student, who was an engineering student, I had no idea really how activist he was.  He was a Pan-Africanist, and he wanted me to come to a meeting, and I told him that, you know, I don't think I can make this particular meeting.  It was down in Greenwich Village [New York, New York].  He said, "Well, I think you're a serious brother, and I'm a serious brother, and I think you should, you know, hook up with us, 'cause we don't think this marching is gonna change everything.  More dramatic steps have to be taken."  And you could read what you want into that phrase.  I read a particular sense of what he was saying without having to use any words that even imply violence.  But I clearly saw that he was talking about more than just carrying some placards and walking up and down 125th Street off 5th Avenue.  I'm coming from a job that I had working in Macy's [R.H. Macy & Co.] one evening, a hot summer evening, and I'm on the subway, and I pick up the paper and I see that there's been an explosion at a house in Greenwich Village that was, allegedly, so the FBI said, run by the Weather Underground [Weather Underground Organization], and as I'm reading the list of people who were injured or killed in the explosion, I see my friend's name and his partner, one of his close friends, had lost both arms and both legs in the explosion.  It was on the front page of the New York Post, you know, in banner headline, you know, like World War III declared headlines, (unclear) headline, and he was killed.  His name was Ishmael Reed [ph.], and his partner, who I can't remember, became an invalid and he lost both--all four extremities, and as it turned out later, there was ample evidence that the FBI had sold--one of their agents had sold this member of the Weather Underground faulty dynamite, hoping that something like this would occur, and he wanted me to attend (unclear) that was the meeting he wanted me to attend.  Two or three days later, there was a knock at the door early in the morning when I was going to go to school, and it's the FBI, who had come to interview me about him, about my activities or my association with him, and so forth.  So, it was very clear that his activity could have led to my injury or demise, and so when that occurred, I was really clear that my father's warnings were--had more meaning than I had initially given them and my naivete, trust me, suddenly evaporated (laughter).
Story_ID: 598013
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in activism right out of high school [Martin Van Buren High School, Queens, New York], I mean did you--'cause it didn't sound like your--well, your father [Jerome A. Mondesire] is a Garveyite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--yeah.
Speaker 1: --you said he wasn't really that active at that point.
Speaker 2: No, he really wasn't.  I guess, you know, seeing it on TV, reading about it.  In conversations we had a fairly brisk high school group.  I was active in something called the Conference of Christians and Jews [National Conference for Christians and Jews; National Conference for Community and Justice], and they would always had conversations back then, it was the, you know, mid-'60s [1960s], about bringing the races together.  The church, I was a part of Abyssinian Baptist Church [New York, New York], which was Adam Clayton Powell's [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] church. I guess, I always tell my children that was bred in me, so I would just get on college campus, start going to meetings, and one meeting leads to another meeting, you join, you become active, you march.  The war [Vietnam War] was going on in Vietnam, so there was always an anti-war march, and of course, this is New York, so if there wasn't a march in Manhattan [New York], there was one in the Bronx [New York] (laughter).  If there wasn't one in the Bronx, there was one in Queens [New York].  If there wasn't one there, there was one in Brooklyn [New York].  So, it was never hard to find a march against Vietnam.  My brothers had been active--in their business, they owned a silk screen printing plant, and a lot of the artists who came to them had Afrocentric art, and so they raised my own consciousness, and, as I said, that time in Harlem [New York, New York] you couldn't not be a part of it.  You had to shut yourself off.  My favorite restaurant in Harlem at the time was Shabazz Steak-n-Take, so you came in contact with the Nation of Islam, and those brothers, and they would grab you on the street and try to sell you a bean pie or, I think it was Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal], and now it's called Final Call [The Final Call].  So, the conversations and associations led me in that direction--and I was a part of the NAACP Youth Council.  One of my buddies that I grew up with had made me join, and we went to conventions and meetings.

Speaker 1: We're getting towards 1968, the death of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], now.  How did that affect you and affect Harlem and right there in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: It was the end of Harlem as a neighborhood.  In a word, obviously there are other forces, economics, sociological, cultural things taking place in Harlem, but if you had to crystalize a moment, it was in April '68 [1968].  I was laying down listening to the radio, the jazz station, WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York], and news breaks in, and King was killed. And the first things you hear are broken glass, and I call my partners, we go out in the street and the place is on fire--cars are burning, cops are everywhere, sirens, gunshots.  We walk up 125th Street and stores are being broken into.  Stores are being emptied.  There were no riot shields and there were no riot gates, you know the big metal sheets that we see in the hood today.  They didn't exist yet.  They came about as a result of '68 [1968], but Harlem was on fire.  There were some leaders who were trying to move to the streets in cars with bullhorns, talking things down.  Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], remember, had been defrocked as a congressman, so he wasn't a player at the time.  Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] had won--I mean, the seat was empty. Charlie Rangel hadn't won yet, so there was--it was, we had, I can't remember, it was Hulan Jack, I believe, was our borough president, but no one really respected him.  He was a product of the Tammany Hall machine.  Some of the ministers came out.  It didn't do any good.  The city was ablaze.  People were getting shot.  People were getting arrested.  It made you just, all the rage you felt about the system, about the country, exploded.  A lot of people my age, when I was eighteen, nineteen--you're ticked off.  I could use stronger language, but not on the tape.  You're even tempted to maybe want to participate.  It wasn't hard to find a gun; of course, you know, some of the brothers who were not in the movement could tell you where to get a gun in fifteen seconds or less (laughter).  And then at that particular moment you better not even pay him, you could even go on credit and get the gun.  You were tempted.  We talked about it on my corner with some of my brothers; even some of the sisters.  Cooler heads prevailed.  People gathered, I forget where we gathered, either at a church or the community center.  There were several meetings called during the night into the early morning, trying to keep people from doing any further harm to themselves or to the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: That's a tightly packed community to have that kind of--yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very tightly--where density, remember, our buildings go up sometimes twelve stories high.
Speaker 1: And the rage, I guess, is, well, directly against the--
Speaker 2: The system.
Speaker 1: The white proprietors, businesses--yeah.
Speaker 2: White proprietors, police, police cars were pelted with stones and garbage cans.  People threw garbage cans off the rooftops on the police cars.  Some of the police cars, some of the policemen were injured very badly.  A lot of individual citizens, private citizens got the brunt of it, of course, 'cause they got smacked around by the police, a couple were shot.  I can't remember all the statistics now about who was shot and who was wounded and who was killed, but it was devastating.  Of course, the TV was full of it, because it's not just going on in New York City, it's going on in Washington, D.C. and Detroit [Michigan] and in Newark [New Jersey], and--
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: --Chicago.  Urban America was ablaze.  It was a devastating moment, and I think it destroyed the Harlems, the vitality of the inner city in--across America that year forward.
Story_ID: 598015
Speaker 1: 'Cause you said there was already a trickle away of the, was it brain trust of Harlem [New York, New York] people moving (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No question.  The brain-trust had left, the economically independent, the people who could make independent decisions based on their income had already begun to leave.  The real estate, the crooked real estate deals of, you know, flipping properties and renting, you know, cutting up units and the multi-family units that were designed for one family had already begun and just took a greater enmity and the neighborhood was just destroyed.  Public housing projects, which were once the model of home living in America, especially urban America, became cesspools after that period of time.  They had already begun to descend, but the rapid unwinding, unfolding of that tableau just happened almost right in front of your eyes.
Speaker 1: So, during this period of time you--you're in second year of college [City College of New York, New York, New York], I guess, and this was going on, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you just became more committed to getting out of school, staying active and figuring out a way to use the education and God-given talents in a way that could be, obviously be personally beneficial.  You don't--no one seeks to go to school and graduate to go on the breadline.  But also I wanted to find a way to make a living that I could be happy and respectful of my own self in--during the course of the day and at the end of the day.  So, staying with journalism became something that made sense to me, as opposed to being an engineer, because being a journalist meant that I could investigate wrong, I could investigate things that I thought were bad about society, I could expose them in the newspaper and hopefully force action on them.
Speaker 1: Was it that verve to, you know, tell the truth, or tell the story that, you know, got you involved in the newspaper?  'Cause you were an engineering student before--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was no question about it, 'cause they also saw that you could make it happen almost in front of your eyes.  You know, there's a great impatience when you're nineteen, twenty years old about, you know, I can't wait until I get it done.  The good thing about journalism is that you can actually see it being done, and first of all you can see the publication, and sometimes you can actually see the reaction and, sometimes even the positive response that can happen; sometimes, obviously, there's a negative response, but there's not a long lag time, 'cause I also thought about going to law school, so my partners went to law school.  They wanted to become civil rights lawyers (unclear) the model of Thurgood Marshall or Percy Sutton.  That seemed like a longer period; they were caught up in process.  I didn't know if I could put up with the process.  As I said earlier, having a sense of patience was not something I was necessarily born with.
Story_ID: 598016
Speaker 1: When did you first get involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]? You said (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the last year of high school [Martin Van Buren High School, Queens, New York].  I had a friend who was a member of the church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] who was even more active in the NAACP Youth Council.  He made me go to a couple of meetings, and we joined the Youth Council.  The NAACP national headquarters was located in New York City [New York, New York] at the time, so it was a hotbed of activity for the NAACP.  It was also in the news a lot more, and then it was the Big Six.  There was the NAACP, the National Urban League, CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], Sleeping Car Porters [Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters], you know, Whitney [Whitney Young]--I can see their faces; I can't remember all their names.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: You know, setting up the meetings with LBJ [Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and going to the meetings with Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] about the March on Washington. So, the NAACP was much more of--in an activist mode in various chapters and, of course, the New York chapters were very activist.  They had all kinds of meetings and you could find out the latest activities by Marshall [Thurgood Marshall] and some of the other lawyers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's a feeling of--well, the NAACP youth chapters around the country seemed to be involved in--were getting involved in more direct action activities, I guess from 1960, I guess through the time that you were (unclear)--
Speaker 2: A direct threat to the national leadership because they, of course, wanted to clear everything but, no.  The NAACP youth chapters at this time were doing their own marches, they were setting up their own community activist programs.  Some were even modeled after what the Panthers [Black Panther Party] were doing by feeding kids in public schools and for breakfasts [Free Breakfast for School Children Program].  None went to the point of having, you know, guns or having self-protective operation, but some were quite activist.  Some were pressing for better housing conditions and stopping police brutality.  The NAACP was in turmoil back in the '60s [1960s].  No question about it.
Speaker 1: Now did you come in direct conflict with the national leadership as a youth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Because I began--I saw that they--you were going to spend a lot of time having to battling the New York office, Roy Wilkins' company, so, whereas SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] allowed me to become on the ground running and, of course, it allowed me to go south.  You know, the NAACP has lots of rules and regulations.  You couldn't go be a part of the New York office or be a New York branch member, and then go to Alabama or Mississippi.  They just wouldn't allow it, whereas SNCC was actively encouraging kids like me to go from Michigan, Wisconsin, New York, California, to go south, so it became a much more welcoming venue for me.
Story_ID: 598017
Speaker 1: Where did you first go when you went south?
Speaker 2: Alabama, and then to Georgia.
Speaker 1: What was that like?  Had you ever really visited the South before (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nope.  My mother [Winnifred Taylor] had sent me to, before she passed away, to spend a summer, I guess I was about eight, with a good friend of hers who was a domestic.  They met on a bus or the subway, and she was from a little place called Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and that was the first time I had ever seen cotton growing in the fields and watermelon, and I'll never forget the lady who I stayed with at summer, but I guess that's about two weeks maybe, seven or eight days.  She said, "Be very careful when you go downtown," and I asked her what she meant.  She said, "You just have to be very careful.  You can't speak to white people here the way you do in New York [New York]."  She said, "In fact, I'm gonna take me with you--take me with you if you ever wanna go downtown," and she did, 'cause I think she was afraid that my New York sense of what life was like in confronting and dealing with people of different races would get me in trouble.  So I never had any personal experience with it down there, but I did see the signs, you know, white and colored on the fountains, and in the waiting room 'cause you took the bus, that was the only way to travel.  But, it was just, it was just a memory.  The best part was the picking of the cotton, 'cause I had no idea when you picked this stuff, your hands could get hurt, and I'm picking it and it has these burrs, or whatever it is that sticks out on the stalk, and they cut into my fingertips, and I asked her, I said, "This is what we have to go through when we were slaves?"  She said, "Absolutely."  She was a lovely woman.  She chewed tobacco and she showed me how to do it (laughter).  So, going to Alabama in--when I was nineteen, was an eye-opening experience because clear up front, the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] was out there to meet us.  They had signs up there, threatening the people we were staying with.  They told 'em that if they registered to vote, they would be killed.  If they put up these niggers from New York, their houses were going to be fire-bombed.  But you just have to admire the guts of these people who welcome all these strange kids from New York who got off these buses and, you know, got off carrying transistor radios, some of them carrying more clothes in their suitcases than these families owned.  Not only did they open up their homes to us, but they risked their lives for us. And so, that experience was--became a life changing one, 'cause I realized what people go through when they really want change.
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay in Alabama?
Speaker 2: A whole summer--
Speaker 1: A whole summer?
Speaker 2: --a whole six weeks, '69 [1969], so I had to miss my classes [at City College of New York, New York, New York], would have to catch up later on, and it was voter registration, setting up a community center, and just giving people a sense that they weren't alone, but that probably was as much a part of that experience as anything, because the folks in Lowndes County [Alabama] sometimes believed that no one cared about them.
Story_ID: 598018
Speaker 1: Were there any professors in college that you remember that were especially inspirational, or--?
Speaker 2: There were a couple, but the names kind of, you know, you lose track as you get to middle age.  You lose track of the names.  Most of, the ones that probably had the most impact on me were the ones who taught me that you could--the material that you were arguing about or discussing in class, they were pushing us to put it to use. And so, of course, those of us who left to go south or become involved in any kind of demonstrations were actually doing it, and those are the ones that I remember the most.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not their names, though.  I wish I could (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was Leonard Jeffries at the City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] yet?
Speaker 2: No.  He came long after open admissions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We opened the door for him to get there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, back in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So, I finished school in '71 [1971], and got a fellowship in journalism, something called the Washington Journalism Center [Washington Journalism Center Fellowship], which allowed me to work as an intern for The New York Times' Washington [D.C.] bureau, which was an extraordinary experience.
Speaker 1: Did you know [HistoryMaker] Salim Muwakkil at that time?  'Cause he's--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --he went to City College around that time.  He's a writer--
Speaker 2: What's his Christian name?
Speaker 1: He's a columnist at Chicago [Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times]--
Speaker 2: What's his Christian name?
Speaker 1: I can't think of it--
Speaker 2: Or is that his whole name?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: That wasn't his given name.  No it wasn't.  But, I think he took that name in the early '70s [1970s] and he was in New York [New York], and he's a well-known writer in Chicago [Illinois].  We interviewed him.
Speaker 2: So anyway, I did that Washington Journalism Fellowship for a half year, worked at The Times, Washington bureau, and they helped me get a job at a place called The Baltimore Sun, which I integrated.  Baltimore [Maryland] was a half and half black town in '71 [1971], but the newspaper, which owned the local CBS affiliate [WJZ], the publishing company [Patuxent Publishing Company] for the newspaper, and the major ink factory had had one black reporter before me, and he had stayed about four months and he couldn't take it, and he left.  So they hired me and I saw why he left within a couple of days.  The--you start out as a reporter back, especially back then, writing all the police stories at night.  It's called a lobster shift.  I don't know where he gets that name 'cause they don't serve lobster (laughter) from roughly eight o'clock at night to two o'clock in the morning, so you cover all the police shootings and the stabbings and the accidents, and you also have to write the obits [obituaries], and in a medium-sized town like Baltimore, obituaries are very much a part of the city's history, because people of prominence want to get an obituary in this big newspaper, and so the city editor came over to me and he said, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Jerome W. Mondesire], I want you to try to get some black obituaries in the paper."  So, I mean I had had my experience in the South, you know, brief, but you know, obviously I was a northern kid.  I didn't know all the social mores, so I said, "Okay, I'll call some of the funeral homes."  Now, Baltimore was so segregated like most American cities, that once you know the address of the main streets in the black neighborhoods, all you had to do is go in the yellow pages and get the names of the funeral directors in those black neighborhoods.  So, I started calling a few of them and I'd say to 'em, you know, who's died prominently that you'd like to get an obit?  It doesn't cost anything, you know, if they're a teacher or a doctor, or a lawyer, minister, business person, community leader, and I'll never forget this one particular funeral director, older gentleman, in West Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland], had been in business for maybe half a century.  First of all, he said, "Your name is what?"  And I said, you know, "Jerry Mondesire."  He said, "Well first of all, are you colored?"  I said, "Well, why do you ask?"  He said, "Well, you don't sound colored, and that name of yours."  I said, "Well, first of all, I am an African American."  I probably said black then.  I said, "I am black.  I'm from New York [New York], and I've been working at the Baltimore paper now about a month" and I said, "And yes, we want to do obits."  And he said, "Well, the Sun doesn't bury black people."  In fact, he said, "The Sun doesn't bury colored people."  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "Where have you been?  The Baltimore African American [sic. Baltimore Afro-American]," the black newspaper down there at the time, and still there.  "That's where we send our obits.  We don't send 'em to the Sun because the Sun doesn't take note of black people who pass."  And I said, "I'm going to call you back," and I took his name, and I went to the city editor, and I said, "Did you ask me to do this because the Sun has never really written about black obituaries?"  And he sheepishly ducked it for a few seconds, and he said, "Yes."  They had never written about ordinary black people who died in Baltimore.  Now famous black people like a Duke Ellington or Jesse Owens, or people like that they would mention, but not ordinary black people.  Not people who were born and raised in Baltimore, unless they were super prominent and, you know, maybe a major business person or someone.
Story_ID: 598019
Speaker 1: But there weren't black obits [obituaries]. Here now, here's the other part I found out. Newspapers at that time used to guard the title, Mr. and Mrs., very carefully.  You became a Mr. as long as you were never arrested and convicted of a felony.  Yeah.  You became a Mr. as long as you were what?  As long as you were white. So when I went back into the library of The Baltimore Sun, I found it.  It just seemed like--I only had to go back a few years.  They had gradually changed it so that all the people mentioned, their story, not that they wrote a lot about African Americans at the time, but even the few that they did had suddenly become Mr., but previous to that time, so say previous to the civil rights era, anybody of African American descent who was mentioned in the pages of The Baltimore Sun was not mentioned as a Mr. or a Mrs.  They were just John Jones or Sally Smith, who was witness to a crime, so that told you immediately that that person was a person of color.  So, the funeral director, I called him back, I said, "Oh, yeah.  You're right.  You were right. We do bury--." But I said, "We do bury colored people now." And, "Forget the past.  I'm here.  We're gonna get you started and you can feel free to call in people who are prominence, who have color, to us." And, I met him.  I can't remember his name now.  And, we became friends.  He's dead.  He since has passed.  His business is still around as far as I know, and he became a very good source of mine, which I will mention to you in a few minutes.  Because he was just shocked that, you know, The Sun had finally gotten around burying colored people and actually hired one (laughter), and I stayed there two years.  It probably was the most memorable part of my early journalism career, because out of the civil rights era, came another struggle within the black community and that was over the question of drugs, and everybody remembers 'Super Fly' and 'Mack' ['The Mack'], and all the pimp movies and the drugs, and so forth.
Speaker 2: Coming out of the early '70s [1970s], '70 [1970], '73 [1973]--
Speaker 1: Right.  So I'm there in '72 [1972], '71 [1971] through '73 [1973].  Also, something that we live with every day now, but it was a very great shock to us, was Middle East terrorism; in '72 [1972], the Olympics [Summer Olympics, Munich, Germany] are attacked by the Black September [Black September Organization] movement.  All of this will connect to you in a second.  In early '73 [1973], throughout the City of Baltimore [Maryland], especially in West Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland], in the black neighborhoods, you start to see these signs that say, "Save Our Children.  Death to the Drug Dealers."  Signed, Black October.  And, what made it interesting as I would drive to and from the work every day is that the graffiti got even bigger, but it all looked like it was by the same hand.  There was no question about it being in the same hand.
Story_ID: 598020
Speaker 1: The Baltimore Afro [Baltimore Afro-American] wrote about it, and just talked about who were these graffiti artists. My city editor [at The Baltimore Sun] asked me to look into it and see if I could track anything down.  So, of course, I started asking police sources and, you know, street people, who knew the streets better than I did, you know, who were Black October?  So, for some reason, I just pick up the phone and I called the funeral director, and I also asked him, and I said, "Well, you know everybody.  I mean, you bury all these prominent people.  You know everybody.  People come to you through your business.  You know people in the churches.  Who do you know?"  And he was an older gentleman, and he did have a great respect to the neighborhood, but he said he would pass it around that I was--wanted to research this group called Black October.  By, so, by this time, you couldn't drive in any black neighborhood without some bare wall having the sign "Death to the Dope Pusher.  Save our Children."  Signed, Black October.  And so, one afternoon at the paper, I get a call and there were not automatic telephones back then, so the person, the operator hollers out, she says, "Mondesire [HistoryMaker Jerome W. Mondesire], some character wants to talk to you.  He won't give his name."  So, in the news business you can't hold people to certain kinds of protocol.  You just take the call, and the person at the other end of the line says, "We hear you're looking for us."  And I said, "Well, who are you?"  He said, "We heard you been looking for us.  You've been asking a lot of questions about us."  And I said, "What are you talking about?"  He said, "Well, this is Black October."  I said, "Really?"  I said, "Are y'all crazy?  Y'all really painting up all these signs, mess up the neighborhood putting up all these things around the street?"  And he, you know, went on to defend the position and why they were doing it, trying to let people know that they were deadly serious.  And they had adopted the name Black October to instill a certain level of fear into the drug dealers as Black September [Black September Organization] instilled fear into the rest of the world.  So, hence, the connection between Black October and how they got the name from the Black September movement.  I said, "Well, you know, we talked about this in the height of the civil rights, Black Power movement, about what to do about the Super Flys and the other pseudo-gangsters running up and down Harlem [New York, New York] and in Chicago [Illinois], and in the other big cities," and I said, "but you and I both know if you attack anybody violently, the police and the law enforcement authorities are going to come after you with greater vengeance than they went after the drug dealers."  And he discussed how he believed that there was no alternative.  He had to do it.  At the same time, the rival newspaper in the city was called the News-American [Baltimore News-American].  It was a Hearst [Hearst Corporation; Hearst Communications] paper, and it was not really as respected as The Baltimore Sun newspaper.  It broke a story about a state legislator who was supposed to be the drug connection between New York and Baltimore and Washington [D.C.], but didn't name the person, so huge headline, big story on TV, lots of pressure for the newspaper to name the person that they say is the drug connector.  A few days go by.  They do break the name, and they name him as James "Turk" Scott, who turns out to be a state senator, and he filled the entire 'Super Fly' stereotype.  He had the big Cadillac, the fancy apartment building, always was seen publicly with two very well-endowed women on either arm, who wore furs and lots of gaudy jewelry.  So, he fit the 'Super Fly' model.  His name was James "Turk" Scott.  He, of course, denied being a drug dealer.  At one point, there was--it was also printed in the News-American that he was the connecting link between "Pee Wee" Matthews [Frank "Pee Wee" Matthews], who was the model for 'Super Fly' in New York, who is the biggest drug dealer at the time, and in fact, he was on the front page of The New York Times Sunday Magazine [The New York Times Magazine] during that period for being the biggest drug lord in New York City [New York, New York].  That--Scott was supposed to be the link between the Baltimore and Washington corridor.  He, of course, denied all that.  The feds said they were interested in looking into the connection--the rumor, but they would make no, you know, definitive statement about it either.
Story_ID: 598021
Speaker 1: July 13th, I was at my girlfriend's house, summer of July 13th of '73 [1973], and I get a call late at night.  I was watching an old movie and by this time, the man who was calling me and giving me the information as a member of Black October, had given me a code name that he would use, and I'd given him my home number and how to reach me so that if something ever did happen, I said, "Well you just call me if anything really does happen."  Of course, did I ever believe it?  No.  And, about 11:30 that night, he called me and said, "This is"--gave me the code name, and said, "We've just killed James "Turk" Scott, and you'll find his body in such-and-such a place and we used these kinds of weapons," and he gave me the calibers, "and he's dead."  And I said, "Are you 'S'-ing me?"  He said, "You'll find his body," and he hung up the phone.  So I jumped in my little Volkswagen, I drove down to at a high rate of speed, broke--went through red lights and there was "Turk" Scott's body, sprawled out in his garage of his basement--parking garage of his fancy apartment building.  He's a huge guy, about 6'4", weighed about three hundred pounds, body's riddled with bullets and around it are leaflets that say drug dealer, and there's a young, white, rookie cop, he looks like a rookie to me, and he goes for his gun.  He goes for his holster and I said, "Hold it, hold it, hold it.  I'm from The Baltimore Sun."  He said, "How the hell did you hear about this?  We haven't even gotten the paramedics and the other cop."  I said, "I heard it on the police radio."  We had police scanners in the company cars at the time.  He didn't know I had not driven my company car.  And I said, "Well, can I see who it is?" And he just let me get close to the body, and then he shooed me away.  So, I went back to the nearest pay phone, because there were no cell phones in '73 [1973] (laughter), and I called the city desk, and it was one of the few editors who actually liked me, an Irish guy, older guy.  And I said, "You're not gonna believe this, but Scott is dead, and I could tell you where he was killed.  I can't tell you who killed him.  I can tell you how he was killed."  And, I said--of course, people don't believe it, but the presses actually do run.  And so, he said, "You're telling me a story.  I should stop the presses."  He said, "We've never done this.  We haven't done this since World War II [WWII]."  I said, "Well, you better do it now."  And so he did.  And he ordered a stop on the press.  He said, "But, if you're wrong, we're both gonna lose our jobs."  I said, "You're not gonna lose your job."  And he stopped the press somewhere in the mid-run for the final edition.  I think we made about 2/3 of the final edition and they changed the headline, and said that Scott had been killed. And TV, of course, starts out the morning questioning the story because they're the ones who always break, you know, big crime stories.  It's just their nature, radio and TV.  So, they come on that morning saying, "The Baltimore Sun reports that so-and-so was allegedly killed," because the police won't identify it either.
Story_ID: 598022
Speaker 1: We're talking about the Black October story.
Speaker 2: And, we get the call, and the--all turned out to be true. And the editors [at The Baltimore Sun], when they all come to work the next day (laughter), 'cause they wanted to know how it happened, so I told 'em.  You know, journalism was different then.  There was Watergate, and there was WoodStein [Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein] who was chasing down Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], and I'm chasing Black October, and there was a different sense of what journalism could accomplish and the responsibility of what newspaper owners owe to the reporters.  So, whereas there was some trepidation in my heart as to whether or not they would try to give me up to the authorities, or whatever, they actually never did.  I mean, I think there was some grumbling in the management suite about, you know, we got this crazy black revolutionary, you know, getting our paper in trouble because, as the story unfolds, the editor decides that the next day's story is going to be a description of the telephone call, because what happens is when I call the police and tell them what the details of Black October's call has given me, I said the caliber weapon used, the police just blurt out, "Well that's what was used." So, we suddenly realized we've stumbled into a goldmine.  We've actually talked to people who've committed a political murder--a political killing. So that becomes the headline story for the following day.  And then the police want to come over and interview me and potentially take me down as a witness or what have you, as well, as to whether I'm even complicit in these killings--in this killing.  And, the paper gives me a lawyer and we hold him at bay.  So, the second story runs that the police verify that the telephone call does accurately describe the weapons used to kill Scott [James "Turk" Scott].  Scott is buried, has a big funeral, big hoopla; of course, they denied that he was a kind of a drug dealer.  The rival paper, News-American [Baltimore News-American], then starts to put out the story that Scott was really killed by enemies of "Pee Wee" Matthews [Frank "Pee Wee" Matthews], because he was coming under pressure from the federal Narcotics Strike Force, and that they were afraid that he may talk.  So, this makes my caller even more angry and more full of rage, and he says, "We're gonna kill someone else."  I said, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't talk to me anymore about killing somebody else, especially, if you're about to tell me who this person's name is, because then you put me in a legal position where I can't defend myself.  That's 'cause I obviously have to talk to the paper's lawyers.  They made it very clear I would not be protected by the press shield law if I knew the name of an intended victim of a homicide.  Since you've already demonstrated that you're capable, quite capable of taking one life, what's to stop you from taking a second life?"  He says, "Okay.  You won't know the name."  He said, "We'll call you like we did the last time."  I said, "Okay.  Long as we have those ground rules cool, I'm not advocating you kill anybody, but if you insist on it, make sure you call me first," (laughter).  And so, he says, "Well, we're gonna shoot the next person.  Gonna be so low down in the drug dealing world that there won't--"Pee Wee" Matthews or Frank Matthews or anybody won't even know who he is, and the police may not even know who he is, but he is in the drug world and we're going to use the same weapon we used to kill Scott to show you that it has nothing to do with any kind of Mafia drug lord or big time 'Super Fly' character.
Story_ID: 598023
Speaker 1: Couple days go by, it's clear that my phone is being tapped.  You could hear the clicking noises, you know, it wasn't sophisticated, you know, (laughter) wireless communication like we have today.  I come out to walk the dog, the police are out there, an unmarked car.  My girlfriend had a little son.  I was taking him to school.  They followed me to the school, so it was real clear that they were watching.  Now, I'm in the newsroom [of The Baltimore Sun].  I'm constantly looking around, afraid that one of these people's probably posing as a newspaper reporter.  He's probably really a cop.  So, things are a little tense.  Four or five days go by.  Late at night again, they [members of Black October] call.  "So-and-so has been murdered."  They gave me his whole name, the address, where his body is, and it all turned out to be true.  So, the second man is killed.  Both were African American.  Body was exactly where it was, where they said it'd be, and shot in the same way that Scott [James "Turk" Scott] was killed.  This time, I was in the newspaper's car.  I figured that if I had any kind of protection from either the police or the drug world, having The Sun [The Baltimore Sun] car would help; for some reason, I thought it would.  So, I got a Sun car this time (laughter) and I had taken it home, so I just drove right to the crime scene, and as I drove up, because my picture had been in the paper and been on TV, the dead man's family recognized me, and so they started to bum rush the car to attack me, and the police stopped them and some of their family and friends also stopped them, but it all turned out to be accurate, and so the two bodies, the police now are really going berserk. They wanted to know what information I have.  I said, "I have no other information other than what you read in the newspaper."  They subpoenaed me anyway and tried to force me to go before a grand jury.  The lawyers resist, but because it's a homicide, they don't have much of a legal leg to stand on and so I end up having to testify before the grand jury.  Because we only had code names, there was no information that I could give 'em that would put me in such a way as to be useful to capture them.  So, the man who has been calling me, called me a second time (unclear), a third or fourth time and we chatted about that whole aspect of the case.  The police eventually did arrest someone who is on the periphery of the organization, but I don't think they ever caught the shooters, but I think some of the people involved did scatter because the pressure became too great.  The one side benefit, you couldn't find a nickel bag of heroin, there was no crack [crack cocaine] back then, in Baltimore [Maryland], for about a month.  Wherever the drug dealers went, it was outside the City of Baltimore, and there were no shootings, and there were no killings associated with drugs.  I'm not saying that that's the way to answer the drug problem, but that certainly was an immediate impact on what these men did.
Story_ID: 598024
Speaker 1: It's interesting because, as we speak, Baltimore [Maryland] is almost a poster city for drug deals.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Every crime show on television uses Baltimore as--I think, 'Law & Order' takes place in Baltimore [sic. New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Wire' ['The Wire'].
Speaker 1: --'The Wire'--everything's in Baltimore.  It looks, if you drive through Baltimore, it actually looks like it's drug--I mean, parts of it really do look drug infested if you look at it.
Speaker 2: In fact, if you live or work there, you're called a Balmer, and it does look horrible.  I've been back several times the last few years, and it's really depressing.  East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland] looks like a war zone today.  It's very depressing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, big drug use.
Speaker 2: I left The Sun [The Baltimore Sun] shortly thereafter.  I got a job offer from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] newspapers, and I came to Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: What did you just, well, I guess we can imply from what you said what you think about this--well, what did you think about--I'm gonna ask you any way, just as clear, what did you think about Black October and its approach to this.  I mean, we live in a time now where we saw in the '90s [1990s], especially, and it's still now there's a lot of drug-related shootings in the black community, none of which have anything to do with trying to stop it, just trying to collect money, you know, drug dealers trying to collect money from people and they kill innocent people all the time.
Speaker 2: The desperation of vigilantism, I think, speaks for itself.  I don't think of it as an answer.  I know that we get so frustrated sometimes.  The caller who called me said that one of the reasons he had been propelled to go in this direction was that he had lost a personal family member, I believe it was his brother, who had died to it, and that was one of the reasons he wanted to strike back.  In the end, I think that level of violence only begets other violence.  I think it is a tragedy that we as a society must confront, but not with a weapon in our hand, 'cause I don't think that that will stop it.
Story_ID: 598025
Speaker 1: But what happened when you left The Baltimore Sun?
Speaker 2: I get to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], working for The Inquirer [The Philadelphia Inquirer], which had been owned by Walter Annenberg, who was the very rich philanthropist, who had owned TV Guide.  He sold The Inquirer and the Daily News [Philadelphia Daily News] to the Knight Corporation [Knight Newspapers, Inc.; Knight Ridder].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, before we--now, when was Black October (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm sorry. In '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, what year did you go to The Inquirer?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The following spring.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Because even after the stories I had broken out to see The Baltimore Sun had made a lot of money off these stories.  You couldn't find a Baltimore Sun during that two or three-week period in the newsstands or in the vending machines.  I mean, they made a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Did you feel that you had to leave Baltimore [Maryland] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, absolutely, because now did they not even want to give me the credit for doing the stories either financially or, you know, professionally, when it came time to get another assignment, you know, they started giving me a lot of stories about the kinds of pathways to better assignments I had to take that I told them that my white colleagues did not have to take, so it wasn't long before I felt that glass ceiling closing in, so I vacated, and the job from The Inquirer came through, in large part because they had read about the Black October killings and had sent somebody down to cover it for them and he recommended that The Inquirer take a look at me, and so I came, 'cause one of the things I wanted to cover for the Baltimore paper was local politics, and they told me I'd have to wait a year, and I told them no, and so when I came to Philadelphia, they let me cover city hall [Philadelphia City Hall, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] right away and, of course, Frank Rizzo was the mayor of Philadelphia, so that made it worth it (laughter).  That was a lot of fun; not because he necessarily was a good guy, but because he was always making headlines.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Frank Rizzo, I think, and the other guy, Tony Imperiale [Anthony Imperiale], too, in Philadelphia [sic. Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: We had quite a number of characters, and so I came to The Sun, I mean I came to The Inquirer in the spring of '74 [1974], and I was allowed to cover city hall right away.
Story_ID: 598026
Speaker 1: Frank Rizzo.  Well just describe who, you know, he was a mayor, there is a big statue, I imagine (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a police commissioner, who used the backlash, impetus among white Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] especially ethnic Philadelphians, Irish, Italians, German, very strong white ethnic communities in Philadelphia back then, to propel him against the party.  He was a Democrat, but he really wasn't endorsed by the party to become the mayor on this law and order platform, that he would strike a blow against the revolutionaries, whether they be black or white, and one of the most--things he's famous for is the strip searching of Panthers [Black Panther Party] in Philadelphia at the time, as well as having his police officers use fairly brutal tactics to quiet all kinds of civil unrest, whether it was against the war [Vietnam War] or against racism or against segregation.  He--there's a famous picture of him leaving a fancy ball, dinner ball, wearing a tuxedo with a cummerbund--with his nightstick stuck in his cummerbund.  He's going to personally leave the dinner to go patrol some civil unrest episode on the streets of Philadelphia--
Speaker 1: With a nightstick (laughter).
Speaker 2: With a nightstick (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's incredible.
Speaker 2: He was quite a character.  So I covered--covered his terms as mayor, became the city editor of the paper [The Philadelphia Inquirer], and the glass ceiling thing hits again, because the town--getting close to thirty, and I started asking whether or not there are chances for advancement to become part of the management structure of the paper and, again, they start telling you what you have to do and not have to do, and they also sent me to management school and I realized the insidiousness of some corporate operations and their idea of management school is to set you up in small groups and you're middle management then as city editor, and you're put in groups from the advertisement department or street sales as photography, as well as editorial, and then you're given a series of tasks to perform, hypotheticals, what kinds of stories to cover, sales problem or an advertising problem, and you have to overcome it.  What we found out was that in each of the groups was a corporate spy, who basically wrote down how you reacted to the particular hypothetical choices that you had to make; did you use aggressive methods, did you use introspective methods, were you kind to your colleagues, were you impatient with them, did you try to dominate the conversation.  How did you behave throughout this hypothetical.  Not whether or not you got to point A and were successful, but they described in their own personal way and their own personal assessment of you, of how you reacted, and you do not know that these corporate people were you in your group.  You thought they were a part of the same workforce that you were, but, in fact, they worked for the personality measuring group, (unclear) guessing, we call them psycho-shrinkos (laughter) that the company had hired.  How we discovered it was in the conversations with one of the editors.  He made a passing reference to how our group did, because you did it and also reported to work at some point during the day also, so you did this maybe for four hours and you might have worked for two hours, and he made a comment about, "You know, yeah, I was reading about how you handled the problem A from your management training program."  And so, a couple of us who were in the program turned to him and said, "Well, how the heck do you know that that happened?"  And he realized he had made a faux-pas, and so I took great umbrage at that because, as it turned out, I was described as aggressive and somewhat domineering and a couple of other interesting adjectives, and I said, "You know something?  If this ever gets out that you did this to me and to the others, then I'll take legal action against this company, because you misrepresented yourselves and this person made a judgment on me and used, in my opinion, stereotypical descriptive language in such a way that could be harmful to my career here, but it speaks more about how you operate as a company," and I knew I didn't want to be a part of that anymore.
Story_ID: 598027
Speaker 1: And so when an opportunity came to go to work for then-freshman congressman Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] about a year later, I jumped at it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what year is this?
Speaker 1: This is 1979.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, well tell us about that experience.
Speaker 1: So, I retired from the paper [The Philadelphia Inquirer] in '79 [1979] and went to work for Bill Gray as chief of staff in 1980.  He had defeated the long-term black congressman of the city [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at the time, a guy named Robert N.C. Nix [Robert N.C. Nix, Sr.], who basically had stayed there since the mid-'50s [1950s] as a tool of the Democratic Party.  A very brilliant man, who graduated University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in the '20s [1920s] in the top of his class, but who had sank into second rate political hack, and was just not interested in keeping pace with the post-Black Power, post-Civil Rights Movement, and he was a member of the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] in name only, and Gray defeated him the second time.  The first time, the race was stolen from him and--by less than a thousand votes and the second time he won the Democratic primary by more than ten thousand.  So, chief of staff meant that I went back forth to Washington [D.C.] on a regular basis from Philadelphia, helped frame legislation, helped manage the staff, became involved in the political activities of the city up to my eyeballs, and it was great fun--did that for twelve years.  Then, of course, Bill Gray became the highest elected official of color in the country's history and became the majority whip of the House [U.S. House of Representatives] after serving as the budget chairman.  We travelled the world, we helped change and get passed legislation that freed Nelson Mandela by getting the sanctions law passed over Reagan's [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] veto to prove money is going to ACBUs, or HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], you know, created a program called Operation Understanding where we send kids to Israel and Africa every summer, increase funding for housing and medical programs and it was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, twelve years.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And left--and when he went to work for the UNCF [United Negro College Fund], I knew that that was a little too stodgy for me personally.  I believe in education, you know, and I support African American schools.  Two of my children have gone to HBCUs, but, you know, being a part of a bureaucracy like that wasn't something I wanted to do, so some of the people I'd met in my political life formed a partnership with me and we created a weekly newspaper; an African American paper which I still run today, fourteen years later, called the Philadelphia Sun [Philadelphia Sunday Sun].
Story_ID: 598028
Speaker 1: And we publish every weekend.  We stress news about our local community, obviously, but we also do international reporting through the wire services and now through the Internet and we cover heavily the third world as well as other parts of people of color scattered around the globe, and we've been blessed.
Speaker 2: When did you found the Philadelphia Sun [Philadelphia Sunday Sun]?
Speaker 1: September 1992.
Speaker 2: Okay. (Unclear) go back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We own our own building, so we've been blessed and I have a radio program, a local radio program that's connected to the newspaper where every Sunday, where we discuss public issues with the leading political and civic figures, or disfigures, in the area, and then when national people come through, we also, you know, interview them and I also do a cable television program similar to that, and it's called 'Freedom Quest.'  Both programs.  And they're both weekly.
Speaker 2: Prior to the start of the Philadelphia Sun, what was the black paper in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: It was called the Philadelphia Tribune.  One of the reasons that I sensed that we would survive; I mean, we would do okay once we got over that first couple of years of economic trial was that the Tribune is the oldest continuously published newspaper in the country; more than a hundred years old.  Robert N.C. Nix [Robert N.C. Nix, Sr.] had been a partner in the paper, ownership partner, at the time that Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] defeated him, so it meant that the Tribune was not a particularly strong ally of Bill Gray's political initiative, shall we say, and in those twelve years, I think we lost one race to the Tribune, so I figured that the African American community was ready for a change, and I was right.
Story_ID: 598029
Speaker 1: I want to go back to the Nelson Mandela thing for a minute (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there were the, the thing to focus on there was what role could this country actually play in freeing Nelson Mandela. And it's controversial, and we'll discuss it in a second.  We first went to South Africa in 1985, and we tried to visit him on Robben Island [South Africa] and P.W. Botha, who was then-president, threatened us with arrest.  He threatened U.S. congressmen, Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III], Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy], a white congress lady [Senator Nancy Kassebaum] from Kansas, with arrest if we did anything out of the norm and tried to go see him.  It was clear that these were very sick people, that they were never about to budge.  The one thing that we did notice; we noticed two things when we were there in '85 [1985], the youth of the country, the white youth that we saw on the college campuses, were not gonna participate with an apartheid regime, if it meant that they had to risk their lives to patrol the townships.  They have to risk their lives to keep black people down with threat of force and violence.  Second thing that we also noticed was South Africans had great pride in being in the world community.  It may seem petty to us, but when the U.S. Olympic Committee refused to let the Springboks participate in the U.S. Olympic competition [1984 Summer Olympics, Los Angeles, California], that hurt their national pride in ways I'm not sure we, in this country, have anything close to that because that represented them as a national entity.  You know, our baseball teams, our football teams, our basketball teams, represent cities or regions.  The Springboks represented a country.
Speaker 1: A rugby team, right?
Speaker 2: A rugby--so what we--soccer [sic.] team. We heard about it constantly wherever we went in the country.  So, as we were on the plane and travelling together, the group kept saying, "This really injured them and their national pride.  Well, what about if we were able to affect their money."  And that's what a lot of the activists in the community didn't grasp; that hurting South Africa couldn't really be done with a gun.  First of all, there was too much speculation that they had nuclear weapons, which we later found out they did.  And who, at the time, even knew that they were experimenting with these drugs that could kill millions of people; you know, biological weapons.  I mean, South Africa was really on the cutting edge of the most human savagery.  Probably, we would have--it could have been unleashed in any part of the world, probably since the Nazi regime.  So, the conversation among the congressmen and all the staff was how can we affect their money?  And so the sanctions bill [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986] we wrote made it impossible for the Krugerrand to be traded in this country.  And, once you change the way the Krugerrand is affected in America and if you can convince, then, the Japanese and the Germans and the British to do the same, even if they don't really want to run and do it, but if they have to do it because they do business with us, we got a clear sense that that would have a tremendous impact on them, whereas, Congressman Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] attacked our bill as being too weak and actually wrote to the speaker of the house, because I have a copy of the letter, and he called Bill Gray an Uncle Tom in the letter, because Dellums wanted to have a bill passed that would ban all economic ties, all social ties, all cultural ties, and no one--no one in real politics believed that bill would ever have a chance, 'cause first of all, who was president?  Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].  Tip O'Neill was a fine Democrat, but he wasn't exactly the most effective speaker of the house, and I can't remember the name of the [U.S.] Senate leader at the time, but there were clearly problems with getting any bill passed, and so we saw this as a compromise bill that could have dramatic impact.  And we'd also been by both Tutu [Desmond Tutu] and Boesak [Allan Boesak], and outlawed members of the ANC [African National Congress] that we talked to in Europe, that affecting the money might just be the way to tip the scales and, of course, that's the bill that passed, that's the bill that overrode Reagan's veto, and once that bill passed in about eighteen months, we went back to South Africa and they were already talking about going to the table for negotiations, and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 598030
Speaker 1: That bill [Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986] passed, I believe, in 1989 [sic. 1986] or 19--or in 1990, and we all saw Mandela [Nelson Mandela] walk out of jail in 1992.
Speaker 2: Okay. So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I met him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us about that.  I mean, what--?
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, you're there.  You're celebrating his release and, you know, I'm just a lowly staffer.  I mean, I've got, you know, a big title back in Washington [D.C.], you know, chief of staff to the whip of the house, but who am I in Johannesburg [South Africa] or Cape Town [South Africa].  Of course, all the members of [U.S.] Congress and the other foreign members of the--leaders of the world, you know, he stops and talks to them and, of course, he recognized Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III], and I'm standing next to him and when he comes over, he, you know, shakes hands and exchanges a bear hug with Bill Gray and he looks at me and he says, "And who are you?" and I said, "Well, I'm nobody, Mr. Mandela.  I work for this guy."  He says, "If you work for this guy, you are a somebody," and he gives me a bear hug, an extraordinary man, extraordinary man, to talk time for me, and you know, you've heard all kinds of stories that he's done that for people all his life.  I never met Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], but I was glad I was able enough--I lived long enough to meet Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 2: When you think about all the black people around the world, you know, who live in--outside of Africa.  Some call it the African diaspora. Do you--you really think that the African Americans really did, it sounds like, you know, that we've made a big contribution to the freeing of Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I mean, I was there.  We (unclear) Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.], you know, and I'm not saying that that bill freed him, because we haven't even talked about TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] and Randall Robinson, and all the men and women who got arrested who focused the issue.  We haven't talked about all the people who came over to this country from South Africa at risk of their lives to keep the conversation going, to keep our attention going to it.  But I think, overall, there is no question that without the political activity in this country, and that's the other beauty about the Black Power movement; it doesn't always get appreciated.  There was an international concept with the Black Power movement.  You gotta give Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] credit.  You gotta give Amiri Baraka credit.  You gotta give Martin Luther King credit.  You gotta give Malcolm X credit 'cause, remember, it was he in the early '60s [1960s] who said he was gonna take the case of the treatment of black people in America to the United Nations [UN].  That was unheard of, but even before then we gotta give Garvey [Marcus Garvey] credit.  He talked about the international--level of the struggle, as did W.B. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois]; so, you're absolutely right.  Black people in this country don't always get it, but our history is tied to Africa and even if we just send a check or went to a meeting, the fact that we have always kept these conversations going impacted what goes on in South Africa, as well as the other parts of the world.  It helped to lead to the ending of the colonial era.  What we're not doing today, in my opinion though, we're not using the same kinds of pressure both here at home and in other parts of North America where people are concentrated to aid the area; you know, to fight AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], to fight the level of poverty.  More complex, more difficult to get a handle on, but I think we can make a difference.  We just haven't figured out how.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So we may have a lot more power than we think.
Speaker 1: I know we do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I've seen it.
Story_ID: 598031
Speaker 1: Is there anything else from that twelve-year period that really stands out as major (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's mostly local.  You know, I thought that we built a great model in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] politics, based on, you know, Bill's [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] experience as his being a major church leader.  Mine as being a kind of an urban political guerilla warfare activist (laughter), using what Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] did in Harlem [New York, New York].  We restructured the way the Democratic Party worked in Philadelphia.  We elected a lot of local people to city council [Philadelphia City Council] and state rep [representative], who were not tied to the party structure.  We became independent and fought for reforms, both economics, and housing, as well as changed some of the local labor laws, increased the money going to education, and so I think overall we probably elected about fourteen people, fourteen or fifteen people who are still in office today.  Some have passed away, some have retired, but built up a tradition of independent party politics.  It wasn't a singular idea.  It wasn't mine or Bill Gray's.  It came out of a long history of changing politics in the City of Philadelphia.  Wilson Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.] was one of the beneficiaries, as that is the city's first black mayor.  What we did was to formalize how it can be done, how to raise the money, get people elected, and then how to hopefully hold them accountable, which they are way more when they are elected; so, without boring you with all the names of the personalities, I think we set a model in place which still exists today.  That model, of course, was used to help elect Harold Washington, who is a part of Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus].  There's a great story there, when Chicagoans are talking about electing him.  He calls the Black Caucus meetings as, you know, he doesn't say the brothers and sisters, but I'll just paraphrase what he says.  Harold Washington looks at us and he says, "You know, this brother sits back in Chicago [Illinois] trying to get me to run for mayor."  He said, "Them folks is crazy."  He said, "But I got 'em fooled."  He said, "I told 'em they gotta register a hundred thousand people and have x-number millions of dollars in the bank."  That's a true story, 'cause I heard him say it.  He says, "They'll never do it.  You know how we are.  We talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk."  He says, "Man, I will be here with you guys for the end of time."  Everybody kind of looked around and said, "I think what we're hearing, they're gonna do it."  And, you know, history defied him and not only a hundred thousand people, they exceeded a hundred thousand at registration 'cause everybody chimed in.  And then the money just kept pouring in from Chicago to our area and, of course, and all around the country and then, you know, a few months later Bill Gray and Ralph Metcalfe and Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] and Shirley Chisholm, and everybody's being invited to go to Chicago to campaign for this guy, which was a great experience and, of course, he won. And, of course, we were all saddened by his sudden death of a heart attack in his second term, but that same model we had in Philadelphia was repeated in Chicago and in other cities.  So that--those years I would say to you, reflect how politics can be used to bring out peaceful, social change.  What I see today is depressing because the young people are not registering or participating in the political process at the same level.  There seems to be a loss of faith at the political process works in this country the way it did when we thought it did after the '60s [1960s] and a step back.  But we don't have an alternative, because this is still a democracy, and if you want to change it peaceably, you gotta elect people who want to bring about social change.

Speaker 1: In terms of the election of Wilson Goode [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. W. Wilson Goode, Sr.], was he, was he the--I mean, the clear choice of the independent political people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd say yes, he was a disappointment, of course, in what happened with the fire and the way he left the city [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] bankrupt at the end of the second term, so that's--those are given facts.  We know eleven people are dead, five of them children, after the MOVE disaster in '85 [1985].  We also know that the city was teetering on bankruptcy when he stepped out of office, but in '83 [1983], he was the choice of the independent groups, of also, a lot of progressive people.  He had been the city's managing director.  That is, he was appointed to that position by the previous non-African American, and he performed admirably, so there was a great sense of optimism that he could handle at the top job.  And again, that turned out not to be an accurate assessment, especially when you look at the MOVE disaster, because he picked a complete incompetent individual to run the police department [Philadelphia Police Department], and the man he chose to be the managing director, it turned out could hardly run a soup kitchen, and the great tragedy was that we lost so many lives and people lost their homes, an entire two-block area of West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was burnt to a crisp.
Speaker 1: I know there are a couple schools of thought on what happened, who's really to blame for that. Is it--do you think that, well you say he actually appointed the person that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who ordered the bomb to be dropped, and there was ample evidence that the individual who was a police commissioner was not equipped for this job.  He had never been a technical police commander, never.  He had run the Police Academy [Philadelphia Police Academy, Philadelphia].  Is that ample training to run a major police department?  A lot of us thought not.  A lot of us urged him to choose another man.  He stuck with his choice.  In the end, (unclear) Wilson was obstinacy. That was the foundation in my opinion of his undoing.  He was given other advice before the MOVE fire.  He chose to ignore that advice and go in the direction that he finally chose to.  MOVE cannot be held completely innocent in this episode, because it was they who so disrupted life in this neighborhood which is, by the way, a working class black neighborhood.  They made life so uncomfortable for their neighbors with their noise and their penchant for violence, and the fact that they did everything they could to become disreputable and disruptive in the normal neighborhood life, where they would feed the rats and not send their children to school, and, again, go back to the way they treated their neighbors, that you've gotta also ask yourself why did MOVE choose to behave in such a way where they knew there was gonna be an eventual confrontation.

Speaker 1: Philadelphia Sun [Philadelphia Sunday Sun]--now, first paper you worked for is The Baltimore Sun.  Does that have anything to do with calling the--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It could be.  I've asked myself that, I think maybe ten thousand times.  In the end, I decided the--'cause we experimented with a lot of names.  We used a focus group.  The Sun, you know, has been used as a mass type for publications going back to almost the beginning of the printed word.  Why, because the sun is naturally associated with light, enlightenment, and opening people's minds.
Speaker 1: The new day--
Speaker 2: New day, I mean, there's a New York Sun [The New York Sun], there's been a lot.
Speaker 1: Chicago Sun-Times (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chicago Sun-Times.  So, I say to myself, yeah, I guess, he worked for the Baltimore paper influenced--but in the end I convinced myself that it has more to do with lighting the way (laughter) than my own personal history, and we've been blessed; as I said earlier, we've been in business now fourteen years.  We own our own building.  We have a multi-part communications vehicle today with both radio and television, and I feel very fortunate because it--that allows me to run the local branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], because I'm self-employed.  I took that challenge in '97 [1997], the NAACP in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] well long before I even came to the city, had been the biggest, baddest branch in the country under a man named Cecil B. Moore, who was this kind of a rapscallion lawyer, who smoked cigars and cussed a lot and drank four figures of bourbon before eleven o'clock in the morning.  I'll tell you that story in a second.  He has so threatened the national regime of Roy Wilkins that they conspired to break up the NAACP in Philadelphia in '67 [1967], and cut it up into five parts, and so weakened it.  When he--at his peak, there were 21,000 members of the NAACP in the early '60s [1960s] of Philadelphia.  When I took it over in '97 [1997] there were about two thousand, to give an example of the impact.  The five branches had only been brought back together in 1991, by a lady named Gladys Reese.
Story_ID: 598034
Speaker 1: That's something.  That's quite a struggle you're talking about here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is quite a struggle.  Cecil [Cecil B. Moore] had--Cecil really was trying to change the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] into a grass roots organization.  He wanted to be an urban brother or sister, depending on your persuasion, to the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  He wanted to be grass roots-based, action-oriented, in your face.  Not necessarily wait for legal niceties, and not necessarily wait to go settle an issue in court.  If it called for a street demonstration, have a street demonstration.  If it called for a parallel legal strategy, have a parallel legal strategy; but whatever the cause was, fight the cause.  And definitely remain in the public eye constantly.  The national office brought him up on financial indiscretion charges and, you know, won their case.  In my opinion, it was kangaroo court, which has not always made me the most popular personality that the national office deals with, but I call it the way I see it and since I'm self-employed, as I said a few minutes ago, it allows me to speak it the way I see it.
Speaker 1: When was that--when did they do that to Moore?
Speaker 2: In '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: In '67 [1967], okay.
Speaker 2: And so, by the time--I had been a member of the local branch NAACP almost from the time I got to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I joined under one of Cecil's predecessors--persons who followed him by the name of Alfonso Deal, who is now deceased also.  He was a police officer who challenged with [Mayor] Frank Rizzo, and did to the point where Frank Rizzo's police department actually put a death warrant on his life.  He was a very courageous policeman.  He ran one of the local branches in Philadelphia in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].  That was called the North Philadelphia Action Branch.  It was the most activist of the five branches, and so Alfonso Deal got me to join and so I went to meetings occasionally, but obviously I'm going back and forth to Washington [D.C.].  I can't be as active as I should be, so when I start the paper [Philadelphia Sun; Philadelphia Sunday Sun] in '95 [1995], I started going to meetings and I was just, you know, embarrassed by what I saw.  There was a lot of in-fighting, and it had no focus.  The membership had really dwindled down, as I said, to around--less than two thousand, or less; only a couple hundred people came out to the annual fundraising dinner.  There was really no youth program to speak of; I mean, there was one in name but it really had very little focus or activities to mention.  So, I put together a crew of folks from my own political history and in days of being involved in local Philadelphia politics and we went after the membership, recruited about a thousand people joined, and not only did I win, but my entire twenty-four-member board slate won.  So we swept out the old regime and brought in a new regime.
Story_ID: 598035
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of resistance to, I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, quite a bit, quite a bit.  In fact, the woman who I ran against had been one of the architects along with some of the other folks against Cecil [Cecil B. Moore], and what she failed to realize that as a journalist I did my research, and so I had found one of the letters that she had written to Roy Wilkins, attacking Cecil.  By this time, Cecil had become an icon.  He's dead.  Obviously, he died in '79 [1979].  He was a, you know, there are murals of him painted on the walls now in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (laughter).  There's a street [Cecil B. Moore Avenue] named after him.  I believe there's even talk now about naming the school after him.  There are scholarships named in his honor at the various law schools, so where he was a controversial antagonist who the status quo in, say, '67, [1967], by 1997, thirty years later, he's a historical figure that people want to emulate.  There are people--there are busts of him in people's homes.  So, she--my opponent, in the race of '96 [1996], didn't want to be associated in any way with his demise.  But, you know, through my own research I had found one of the letters he had written to Roy Wilkins attacking him, calling for this inquiry, this court of inquiry.  And so when we had a public debate, which he had resisted for a long time, I reached into my folder to read the letter, and she denied being a part of this.  I said, "Well, that's interesting, because I have a letter here dated August so-and-so," and then she saw the letter coming out of a folder.  You could see her collapse, and she begged me not to read the letter, which to the audience was clear affirmation that she was complicit.  So, it wasn't close.  We beat her two to one, she and her slate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we've--I think we've reformed the local branch [of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)].  We're now one of the largest in the country.  There are only about a dozen branches in excess of a thousand members, and we're one of 'em.  We have almost four thousand members now.  We own our own building, debt free.  We do a whole host of programs ongoing.  The ones I most want to mention for this chat with you would be the prison reform.  We got the ex-felon disenfranchisement law changed in Pennsylvania.  We are the first and only state to do that.
Speaker 1: And that's a big issue now.
Speaker 2: It's a very big issue.
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois] and other places, too, yeah.  There are so many people in jail.  They're coming out.  They have to do something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They can't vote.
Speaker 1: They can't vote, they can't--they can't get IDs--
Speaker 2: Some, some can't vote forever.  In Louisiana and Alabama, you can't vote forever.  So, we, we went through the state legislative route.  We tried that and we got stymied by the Republican leadership and so we joined with Pennsylvania Prison Society, 'cause they were very much a part of this, and we won a Commonwealth Court [Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania] victory in the State of Pennsylvania.  The Commonwealth Court had a law--election law, and we overturned the ex-felon disenfranchisement law by one vote on the Commonwealth Court in 1999.  So, we're very proud of that.
Story_ID: 598036
Speaker 1: We've also expanded and built up our ACT-SO student scholarship competition.  ACT-SO stands for Afro-American Cultural, Technical, Scientific Olympics [sic. Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics].  We call it the Olympics of the Mind, after its founder, [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett created this great program about thirty years ago.  I think it's just one year shy of thirty years.  Where children compete for financial prizes as well as kind of a social gratification and a social achievement in everything other than sports.  We don't do anything that's to do with a ball, basketball, football, soccer ball; it's science, math, chemistry, physics, cultural arts, business entrepreneurship, the dramatic arts, and so we've been a part of the program that Vernon founded since its inception.  We're happy to report that we consistently win national awards, either gold, silver or bronze.  We just won a bronze medal in musical exposition, classical musical exposition, at the 2005 national convention.  How it works is students compete at the local level for local cash, prizes, and awards.  The winners from the local competitions then go to the national convention, to compete with students all around the country, and it's open to high school juniors, and seniors.  And, it's all free to the children, and we hope it builds the next generation of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] membership.
Speaker 2: So, they get involved through their local chapter?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then we encourage them to join the local Youth Council [NAACP Youth Council], which does NAACP, you know, civil rights kinds of activities.  We've been very fortunate that most of the children who come through our ACT-SO Program in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] do, in fact, join the Youth Council, and we try to keep them for at least a year or two, and urge them when they go to college to join a college chapter, or if they don't have one at their college chapter, to start one.  And certainly, when they come back home to, after four years, to reconnect with us.  We're also very proud of something we do in Philadelphia that we wish others--branches would repeat and we also do a welfare-to-work training program.  Welfare-to-work training under the Republican--was passed under Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], but you know, really pushed by the Republicans, also.  We feel, as the largest manpower training and workforce development program since the '60s [1960s] and what we do with the young ladies, most of our students are women, we send about a thousand now, we're doing it every five years because the medical industry is one of the few growing industries for workforce in the Philadelphia region.  We train these people to become support staff for medical, HMOs [health maintenance organizations], for hospitals, and clinics, medical billing offices, and a few have even gone on to nursing school, but that's not many.  I mean that's a whole different rigorous training modality that a lot of people who had been on welfare don't, can't even think about.  But, we've had a couple success stories of people who have actually gone to nursing school.  But the majority of them are part of the support staff of the major medical institutions, labor unions, HMOs, university hospitals, clinics, blood plasma centers, and AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] research clinics and things of that nature.  Most of these people who are in these programs are people of color, no question about it.  And, we just thought it was important that we be a part of what goes on, because we want to train people to become independent.  We don't require that they join the NAACP; in fact, very few do, but we let them know that the reason we created this program is that welfare really is a form of slavery.  It controls where you live.  You can't have a bank account.  You can't send us your kid through schools and you can't own certain things, so about the only thing that you can do while you're on welfare is what?  Vote.  But most of them don't.  So, we also do a voter education program as part of our training.
Story_ID: 598037
Speaker 1: And so those, those four programs are the ones that are most consistent.  We [Philadelphia NAACP] do the traditional advocacy.  We have lawyers that represent people all the time.  We take on whatever issue people bring to us.  But those are the four consistent programs that we're most proud of.  The last one is more depressing, because it's a response and we don't--no one has come up with an answer for this one.  In the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] last year, we lost thirty-five kids under high school age, under the age of eighteen, to violence, mostly guns.  This year, I think it was twelve.
Speaker 2: I know you've taken a strong stance against (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A very strong stance.  We had a march, we had a ten-thousand-person march run by the students.  We almost had no adults speaking on criminal violence, because if you're not around, what civil rights are we talking about?  I mean, if you're not here what civil rights issues are you gonna have to face--if you're not breathing.  We have gotten to the point now where we kill more young black men in one year in this country than were killed in all of Vietnam [Vietnam War], from '64 [1964] to '75 [1975].  Homicide is either the first or second leading cause of death, depending on who's doing the counting, in almost every major city in America, young black men under the--between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four.  It is destroying the fabric of some of our neighborhoods.  I've said this over and over again.  It's not my phrase, but we're destroying the flower of a generation, but it's destroying the fabric of a neighborhood when kids don't go to school because they're afraid they may be killed.  When they just had the march was after one young man, Faheem Thomas-Childs, was gunned down in the City of Philadelphia two years ago.  A group of the black men, we called each other, got on the phone, we all descended on that school the next morning to surround it with black men, to give these children a sense of comfort that somebody cared about their lives.  The children grabbed our arms, not out of, you know, anger or resentment or rage, but just thankful, and you looked down at their little faces grabbing at your arms or your thigh, or your calf, depending on your height, and you sense what had to be done, and so we have continued to work with other groups throughout the City of Philadelphia on the anti-violence issue, drawing attention to it, keeping it in the public's eye.  We've joined the inner coalition, where a group called Mothers In Charge [Mothers In Charge, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which are--which is made up of women who have lost sons or daughters or grandsons or nephews to killing, and I always tell them this is the one club I never want to join, and we had a summer camp program, this summer, for the second year in a row.  We sent children away for at least a week, as kids who live in inner city neighborhoods where violence is a part of their culture, of their daily life. Some of them have been siblings of kids who have been killed, and this is the second year we've done it.  We've teamed up with some of the local politicians and some of the social service organizations and we helped raise money.  The newspaper where I used to work, The Philadelphia Inquirer, runs free ads for that, raising money.  The goal this year is about $150,000.  They are doing quite well.
Story_ID: 598038
Speaker 1: Yeah, the long-term solution.  We've got to give a lot of these young people a sense that they can have a future.  The scary part is when you sit down with kids at eighteen or nineteen, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Chicago [Illinois], Detroit [Michigan], Atlanta [Georgia], Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and they tell you, "Well, Mr. Mondesire [HistoryMaker Jerome W. Mondesire], it doesn't matter.  I'm not going to be around much longer.  So, yeah I got a gun, or I can get a gun.   And if so-and-so looks at me wrong, or he comes up short on the dollars he owes me, I'm gonna take him out before he takes me out."  There's a sense of immediacy that I can't even grasp growing up in Harlem [New York, New York] in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s].  This was supposed to be a violent area, tough neighborhood, but certainly none of us thought we were gonna die at nineteen.  And certainly we didn't behave as though we wanted to die at nineteen.  That's changed.  There is a hopelessness and a despair that we've got to attack as a black community.  We've got to talk about it, and so we have, you know, joined that conversation in Philadelphia.  We hope that others are doing it in their cities.  I don't think that the idea of a national movement like we had in the '60s [1960s] will probably ever come again, certainly not in my lifetime.  So, that's why I admire what Bill Cosby is doing around the country, you know, going to cities and opening up city conversations in St. Louis [Missouri] or in East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland], or wherever he's going.  'Cause I saw him recently on television.
Speaker 2: You know, a lot of people, they--there's a big kind of controversy, of course, over what he says, and a lot of people, Michael Eric Dyson, I'm thinking (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right in Philadelphia. He has written a book ['Is Bill Cosby Right?: Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind?,' Michael Eric Dyson] attacking him, and I debated Dyson on the local public affairs station and I asked him, "Didn't your mother make you go to school?" 'cause his mother and my mother [Winnifred Taylor] have a similar kind of story.  "Didn't you work hard and when you got in trouble didn't somebody come along and help you and pull you up?"  He said, "Yeah." I said, "Well then, what is it you disagree with?  Personal responsibility, behaving in such a way, not having music that debauches black women, providing job opportunities when you can, urging black businesses and white businesses to contribute to the overall improvement, and pushing education in your household as a daily experience?"  And, so I don't see what the rationale is to argue with Cosby about, because you may take umbrage at some of the words he uses to describe a quote unquote class of black people, but his message is a basic one, and this is the part I find irrefutable.  He is basically saying that I am approaching a deep puddle in the highway and my car is stalled and I get out of it and tell you that if you keep going past me and I'm waving you off, that you're gonna drown.  Now, you can ignore me because you don't like my message, or because you don't like something I did in my past, but I can assure--I can assure you that if you pass me, you're not gonna get out of that puddle.  So, I think it's a sound one.  And so, I'm not saying that there is a singular answer for the pathos that's within some of our communities, but we better start to have a conversation about it in order to address it.
Story_ID: 598039
Speaker 1: One of the things that I've noticed as I move around my region, and I visit a lot of prisons and Ben Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] put a NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] branch in one of our Pennsylvania prisons, a high security place called Graterford Prison [Graterford State Correctional Institution, Graterford, Pennsylvania].  This is a no-nonsense place, very much like Sing Sing [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York], 'cause I visited several times already, and I'm going back in August of this year.  There are two things that I--you notice immediately when you walk into the prison and you engage into a conversation with these men.  The place was built for 2,100.  There are four thousand men in this place and they all look like me, or my brothers, except for a few Hispanics and an occasional white guy.  It's that these men are functionally illiterate and they come from father-absent households.  Those are the two most serious common denominators.  Now--
Speaker 2: It's not like there's a mix or anything.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  We can argue.  We can refrain from having that conversation 'cause we don't wanna air our dirty laundry in front of the white man or the purple man and the brown man or the yellow man, but that's real, and I end a lot of my speeches by telling people this particular story.  I was at the prison about four years ago, when I first, not my first but my second visit.  It was a Black History Month program and the brother who was the emcee, he was a tall brother, he was about thirty-eight, thirty-five.  He was a dynamic guy.  He was just, you know, brilliant, and he had a goatee, very striking looking brother, deep baritone voice, and I--you're not supposed to ever ask but I just couldn't help it, because I just got compelled by my journalistic hat as opposed to my civil rights, you know, hat and I asked him, "What are you in for?"  And he said, you know, "Multiple bank robberies.  I'll be in for thirty years."  I mean, you could just see the potential he had to be something far beyond that.
Story_ID: 598040
Speaker 1: So, this brother, who is the emcee, as I told you, could--should have been an anchorman instead of a bank robber.  He said, "Mr. Mondesire [HistoryMaker Jerome W. Mondesire], I want you to meet somebody."  Now remember he's doing thirty [years], at least thirty, for bank robbery.  He said, "I couldn't get this man to come to this Black History Month program."  It was in February, of course, 'cause he's basically a bitter guy, you know, and "I want you to meet him because you guys have a lot in common.  He's always liked Harlem [New York, New York], especially hearing about the Harlem Renaissance, and you spoke about the Renaissance, and, you know, seeing Malcolm X when you were a kid, and so I want you to meet him."  So, we go back in the prison [Graterford State Correctional Institution, Graterford, Pennsylvania] where the men are sitting in their bunks.  You pass the workshop areas, the wood shop and the metal place, and the--one of the many areas they have for weight lifting, and there's a middle-aged man sitting on the bunk reading a magazine, Newsweek or something like that, and the brother who was the emcee introduces me to him and we're chatting for a while and he says, "I want you to meet somebody, Mr. Mondesire," and the man looks over his magazine and the young man says, "This is my father."  They met in prison.  And so, of course, he didn't want to talk about the Harlem Renaissance.  He didn't want to hear about Malcolm X.  He didn't want to hear about Duke Ellington.  He didn't want to hear about anything that I ever saw in Harlem, because he wanted to be a musician when he was young but he killed somebody, and he's doing life.  So the three of us are talking now, and it's getting late and it's almost time to get out of program and I've had about enough of hearing these bars clang back and forth, and I'm ready to get out in some fresh air, plus you know, it's not daylight savings time, so it gets dark early (laughter), so I don't definitely want to be in this place when the sun sets.  The middle-aged man, though, tells me he wants me to meet somebody who really, they never could get him involved in anything, reading, participating in Black History Month programs, he didn't even participate in any kind of vocational training.  He's been to prison a lot off and on.  So we would have to go way back into the prison.  I had to ask the guard for special permission, past all the areas where light comes in, past all the areas where there's group activity.  It's very silent in the back.  It's almost back, you would almost make the assumption that's where they would have solitary confinement, but it's not.  It's back by the infirmary and there were some rooms back there where men are playing cards or just sitting by themselves.  There is no window in this room, just a light hanging from the ceiling.  The middle-aged man introduces me to this man as his father.  He's doing two murders.  They met in prison, all three generations.  That's where we are as a community.  Not every black family is like that.  Not every black household, not every black community has that level of tragedy; but, we have it at different levels in our families.  There are members of my family who are incarcerated, or have been incarcerated.  There are members of my family who have dealt drugs or are dealing drugs, or have been victims and/or perpetrators of violence.  What I'm saying is that our conversation has got to change in the 21st century.  As leader of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I can feel blessed of seeing some of what happened in the '60s [1960s], but in the beginning of this century, we've got to figure out ways to meet the challenges for these younger people that are coming up behind us, for the young boys and girls that are killed in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I've got to come up with answers for their future, because they don't remember Rosa Parks.  They don't remember, they hardly even remember Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], let alone who Marcus Garvey was.  So, it's going to be a great and significant challenge to meet that need, but that's where my vision is and that's what we're working hard to try to do.
Story_ID: 598041
Speaker 1: You seem to be in contention with the mayor of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], John Street [John F. Street], and in that contention, you are characterized by someone as not being black enough, and then in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you're too--you're characterized as being too black and stuff, and so what's the--?
Speaker 2: There's no simple answer to any personality who actually is in the struggle to actually make a difference.  In the John Street issue, we go by our--our feud goes back to the Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] era.  His brother [T. Milton Street] was a state politician who ran against Bill Gray.  We defeated him and took him out of office, and he returned to what he does best and that's being a vendor.  Not a fight we chose to fight.  He asked for and we gave him his answer.  In the John Street case, he was not always, in my opinion, the most responsive leader politically that you could imagine.  He ran, he was the councilman for North Central, Philadelphia, which is where the NAACP is located.  I put it there, and it is the Harlem of Philadelphia, North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and it's still very depressed economically and educationally and sociologically speaking part of the neighborhood, so I didn't support him when he first ran for mayor, and he took great umbrage at that and tried to have someone run against me as head of the NAACP.  To that person's chagrin, not only did we defeat him, we basically ran him out of town.  So, we've patched it up.  We have cordial communications now.  We are expecting to do a number of things together.  People try to make more of these feuds than they are.  We've actually worked together on a number of things.  John Street, for example, is a big supporter of the local ACT-SO [Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics] program.  I supported him for reelection, especially when he was being investigated by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and help set up meetings for his reelection campaign.  So, it's like anything else.  Sometimes you can agree, as long as you agree to disagree cordially, and keep it from becoming personal.

Speaker 1: Couple Internet stuff we--pieces we read say that you're criticized by the white press in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] of being too black of an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leader or something, using race as a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that--that label is tossed around whenever the white community either can't figure you out, is afraid, or wants to separate you from your own community, and also build up road blocks you have with the corporate community.  No NAACP branch anywhere in America gets all of its resources from the black community alone, so let's be real frank about that (laughter).  We have built up over time, though, strong working relationships with Philadelphia's corporate community.  They were very supportive of us in the national convention held in Philadelphia in 2004.  They were the main sponsors of our jobs program that we just did this summer to hire teenage inner city kids to go to work.  But, when I tell all these corporations whether they be the giants like ARA [ARA Food Corporation], the big food service company, or Comcast [Comcast Corporation], the big cable TV giant for the country, both are located in Philadelphia, or any of the banks like PNC [PNC Bank National Association] or Wachovia, which have big operations in the commonwealth.  Because you do something for us in Monday doesn't mean that if we find that you've been guilty of a discriminatory act, or not supporting a community benefit program, that we won't criticize you on Tuesday.  You don't buy the NAACP.  You don't buy my silence.  We try to measure the activities and the behavior of corporations, individuals, politicians, and other civic leaders, by what they do.  We had an interesting clash with the former head of the black clergy association [Black Clergy of Philadelphia and Vicinity].  He did something which we really thought was unspeakable.  They endorsed a host of candidates running for judge.  We elect our local judges in Pennsylvania, and the majority of the candidates he endorsed were people of color who paid the Black Clergy for this endorsement, except there were eleven slots open, and he endorsed twelve people, so it meant that somebody paid for something they could never get.  Now, I always say that the head of the NAACP is supposed to shout where most people whisper.  Now, the rest of the community was whispering about this at cocktail parties and in the barbershops and the beauty shops, and we had a press conference to condemn the head of the Black Clergy about that.  Some people thought it was controversial.  In the end, I think the candidates who ran for judge, especially the black candidates, thought it was beneficial, especially since they were one.  Because, by doing the press conference we focused attention on what had happened and so then the public began to think about what was at stake.

Speaker 1: People can say that a civil rights leader is supposed to win results as opposed to win friends, and not let the loss of a friendship keep you from the purpose which you accept this responsibility.  There is something that a lot of people don't grasp.  First of all, all NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] local offices are volunteers.  There is--nobody pays us, so nobody can control us through economics.  But the other thing is that you take an oath of office after the election.  And see, we're all elected and when you take that oath of office, you've gotta ask yourself who else took this oath of office.  A guy named Medgar Evers took this oath of office.  A guy named Vernon Dahmer took this oath of office.  People don't know the Vernon Dahmer story the way they should know it.  Vernon Dahmer ran the Hattiesburg, Mississippi NAACP in '63 [1963].  Vernon Dahmer paid the poll tax of people of Mississippi who had the guts to register to vote.  He so frightened the Klan [Ku Klax Klan, KKK] that they went to his store, he owned a grocery store where he used to give black people credit so they could get their basic food stuff and clothing to live day-to-day.  Hattiesburg, for those who don't know it, is in the Delta.  It's a very poor area.  Vernon Dahmer's store was attacked many times.  Finally, one night they showed up en masse with gasoline cans and lit his building ablaze.  As Vernon held the door open with his outstretched arm for his kids and wife [Ellie Dahmer] to escape, they testified thirty years later about smelling his burning flesh as they walked up, you know, crawled or walked or ran under his outstretched arm, and he died a few days later of those wounds.  You take the same oath of office as Vernon Dahmer.  You take the same oath of office as Daisy Bates.  People forget her.  She's the mother of the Little Rock Nine; not the biological mother, she's their civil rights mother.  She sheltered them, fed them, encouraged them when they were walking through those, that phalanx of National Guard troops in '57 [1957].  She owned a newspaper [Arkansas State Press] like I do.  Now my newspaper didn't get criticized and people call up talk radio shows and, you know, call me names.  Hers got burned, not once but twice.  Burned to the ground.  She never gave up.  She just kept starting the paper over and over again, as many times as she needed to.  She just died recently so--I think about that.  That influences me more than whether or not someone will criticize me; that I take the same oath of office as Medgar, Vernon and Daisy.
Speaker 2: Going on, Amzie Moore, E.D. Nixon, Gilbert Mason [HistoryMaker Dr. Gilbert R. Mason, Sr.], you know, a lot of people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right. Right. All those people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The youth.  Bringing some kind of focus on the extraordinary opportunity that they have.  I look at my own children.  And I've spoiled 'em.  They had to have all the toys and the cell phones and the TiVo and stuff that I'm sure my mother [Winnifred Taylor] and their grandmother wanted--would have wanted them to have but I asked myself am I doing a good thing?  Have I not maybe spoiled them too much?  What will they learn and take from it that they have to earn?  So I'm concerned about your youth.  I'm concerned about the quote unquote inner city youth, attacked by AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], and violence and drugs.  So we're spending a great deal of time rebuilding our Youth Council [NAACP Youth Council].  We're almost at two hundred kids, you know, high school kids, who are part of our youth council.  My legacy with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I hope that we will have put the Youth Council on a solid footing that can sustain itself long after my generation has passed on.  For the adults within the NAACP, we're trying to use the welfare-to-work training program and the economic revitalization programs to give the NAACP, at least in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], an economic base that is self-sustaining.  I think that's probably the greatest criticism of what came out of the Civil Rights Movement when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was murdered and the alphabet soup organizations, you know, were faced with the--the burning question is where do we go from here?  We don't have self-sustaining forces and institutions in the black community today, so we are renovating an abandoned building in Philadelphia and we will rent them to low income families and a portion of those rentals will go back to the NAACP so that the NAACP can, at least in Philadelphia, will never be broke, will never have to look for money to go hire lawyers or investigators, or what have you.  So, that's what we're trying to put together, a self-sustaining economic entity that will continue to fund the civil rights struggle, at least in our region.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done at this point, you're still relatively young by the standards of the ages that we interview, what--would you do anything--any major thing differently?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question.  No, I don't think so.  Not major.  Some people have asked should I have run for political office, but I think not because I tend to be a little too quick-tongued (laughter) too quick silver with my verbal reaction to causes.  You can't stay in political office if you tell people always how--exactly how you really feel.  So, I'd probably say no.  I feel blessed to have come under the circumstances in which I was born and raised, to have reached this point in life, and have a great sense that the future still has things I can't predict.  I love waking up every day believing that the rest of the day will be different than anything I could ever have predicted.  That's a great feeling, and as long as God gives me that, I want to keep doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you don't think you'll ever run for office or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think.  Not at, I'm fifty-five now and starting a new career (laughter).  No.  I enjoy being a critic and a watchdog of political activity.  I enjoy being behind the scenes and communicating with people who want to run for office and I'd love to see some people in their twenties and thirties, in my part of the country, become really active in elective office.  I really don't see any alternative to bring about the kind of social change that I believe is necessary.  What I don't see right now is that we're not training a cadre of young people to run for office. I mean, I look at all the major cities right now, whether it be Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New York [New York], or Chicago [Illinois].  The majority of people of color who are in office are middle-aged.  I'm not sure that that's a good thing, because when we were coming along, we were always pushing the middle age and the older generation in a certain direction.  I very rarely get criticism from the younger generation.  My criticism comes (laughter) from the older generation and my current generation.  I tell my college chapters [of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)], and there are several in the area; in fact, we've started a couple.  We've got one at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], one at West Chester [West Chester University of Pennsylvania, West Chester, Pennsylvania], one in Drexel [Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Why don't you guys ever come and raise noise and beat me up a little bit?  I said, a little bit.  You know, just trying to get them to engage in the conversation.  That's what I'd love to see and that's what we are, you know, going to continue to work toward.

Speaker 1: What would you say at this point is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Continuing the best traditions of the organization [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in terms of civil rights, and continuing the legacy of outspokenness by Cecil [Cecil B. Moore] and Alfonso Deal, and some of the other lesser known people.  In terms of the newspaper, an independent voice, what I love about what we do at the Sun [Philadelphia Sun; Philadelphia Sunday Sun] is that we often will break stories that the mainstream papers haven't, and we always get a charge out of seeing the mainstream papers have to quote us in their columns and their news stories, because I think that that's how you stay out in forefront, and remain a pioneer and help determine where your particular industry or your direction is headed by staying on that cutting edge, and, you know too many of our publications of color don't really go after that kind of hard news that's out front; you know, which forces The New York Times or The Washington Post or Newsweek to react to us.  I like doing that, and that's what we try to do in journalism.  And then personally, I've raised three children, and they're all doing well, and thank god they're all healthy.  So those are the three things that I think will be my personal legacy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you have three children now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Two are grown, and one is still at home.  One's a doctor and one's a lawyer, and one is a pseudo rap star (laughter).  We're just hoping that he decides to concentrate on something and do well at it.  It can be rap as long as it's clean, but we just want him to concentrate on something and do well.  He's floating around doing--talking about a lot of different things.

Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't asked you you think you need to address before we ask our last question?  Is there anything I've missed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: There's probably a lot of stuff, but we can't think of it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But tell us, this is our last question similar to legacy in some ways, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As somebody who made a difference, as someone who cared, as someone that people could pick up the phone and know that I would respond.  And, as King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] says, as someone who served.  That's important to me.  Sometime, it's nerve-racking, but at the end of the day when you've actually helped someone who's had a problem, or you get a note from them or get a note from their mother or their girlfriend or their wife thanking you, it makes it worth it.  That's what I'd like to be remembered as.  As someone who people could count on.  If that happens, I'd be content.
