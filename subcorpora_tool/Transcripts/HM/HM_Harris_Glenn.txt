Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions we always ask as a warm up.  But I don't know if we need one, but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Here's a warm up.  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'm easy to please (laughter).  I'm--not really.  I like--I'm very eclectic, I like what I like.  If I like it, I'll eat.  Like, I ate at escargot one time and I had never had it.  Taste like steak and eggs to me (laughter) so.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, I don't have a favorite food, I think a lot of foods.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Blue, some greens, and obviously red (laughter).  Yeah, blue, green and red are my favorite colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Especially, in the area that I live in, the Washington [D.C.] metropolitan area has the greatest springs, I've ever seen.  Springs and falls in the D.C. area are unbelievable.  And, I've been a lot of places.  This, this I'll top it for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: You know, not really, 'cause I'm a photographer so I can, I can, I can be home.  I've been a lot of places, but I get bored when I go away, you know.  I've been to Hawaii.  I've been to the islands.  I've been to Puerto Rico.  I've been to Mexico.  They're nice places, but I'm a home person, I don't really have to go anywhere.  I like to go to the mountains.  And, I think the best place I ever been, for my soul, was a place called Estes Park, Colorado.  I cried when I went there.  Well, I'm very emotional anyway, so.  I might cry during this interview.  But, yeah, I would say if I wanted to really go someplace in the spring or summer, it would be Estes Park, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the last questions is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: You know I have it, but I can't think of it right now, so.  I can't think of what it would be.
Speaker 1: Well, if we think of it later on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I will, I will.
Speaker 1: We can add it in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I will.
Story_ID: 610399
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm a ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [Pleasant Harris].
Speaker 2: Right, if I can remember.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: First question is, can you give us your--her, give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was June Puckett Harris.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, Puckett, P-U-C-K-E-T?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess, that's two Ts--
Speaker 1: Two Ts?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure whether it was two Ts or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like Kirby Puckett would spell his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, J-U-N-E?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's about, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know those names back in the day (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  So, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in January, 1927.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, how far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?  How, what do you know about (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I can't, because my mother was an orphan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was born in a hospital and she was raised in a hospital for five years.  We did some research.  She was born in Bellevue Hospital [Bellevue Hospital Center] in New York City [New York, New York], which is like St. Elizabeths Hospital here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  But, I didn't know that.  And, when I told a New Yorker that my mother was born in Bellevue, she said, "Stop playing boy."  And, I said, "What, why do you say that?"  "Man, that's a crazy hospital," like that.  So, I didn't know.  So, my sister who lives in Miami [Florida], she did some search and found out that her father [Kitchen Puckett (ph.)] was a psychologist in the hospital, and her mother was a nurse.  So, I'm putting two and two together 'cause, I ain't the dumbest thing in the world, but I'm not the smartest, but I'm not the dumbest.  I think he had an affair with a nurse.  Her nother--her mother's name was Kathleen Knott [ph.].  And, what happened, this was 1926, '27 [1927] now, when she got pregnant, I think they abandoned her.  Because that's all we know.  She never really saw her parents, and she looked for them well into her forties, kept looking for 'em.  And, used to cry many nights.  I say, "Ma, why you crying?"  She said, "Well, you know who your parents are, I don't know who mine are."  So, she was raised by foster parents from sixteen on.  The only parents--
Speaker 1: From sixteen?  So, she was--?
Speaker 2: What happened, she was in various orphan homes in New York City.  So, what they did was they sent her to a black foster parents, sent her to black foster parents when she was sixteen but they--well, no, she was early, it was earlier in her life.  She was about eight or nine years old, maybe sixteen.  When they found out that Mr. and Mrs. Robert Huntingnell [ph.] were black, they said, "Oh, no, we gotta get her outta there."  So, they lived on 45th Avenue in Flushing, New York, Flushing, Queens [New York].  And, they got her outta there.  In those days, I guess at sixteen you were pretty much emancipated.  You were on your own if you wanted to be.  So, she was in, I guess, ninth, tenth grade and she came back to them and asked them, and they remembered her, "If you would take care of me and I get the state to pay you guys, could I live with you all?"  And, this is a white girl.  This is 1926, twenty, no, this was, well, no, early--later than that because she--
Speaker 1: This was in the '40s [1940s].  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was born in '26 [1926] but, god, this is, it must've been, you know.
Speaker 1: In the early '40s [1940s], I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, they said, "Sure, we'll take you."  So, those were my grandparents on her side.  And, I, I never really knew why they were so dark and mom was so light, you know.  And, I found out when I was about fourteen, she told me.  But, let me get through that first.  That was Nana, and Pop Pop to us.  And, they raised her from sixteen on.  And, this is in the '40s [1940s], I guess, or late '30s [1930s].
Story_ID: 610400
Speaker 1: My mother [June Puckett Harris] graduated from high school in 1945, Bayside High School [Bayside, New York].  And, hey, that was her parents.  And, I didn't know what color anybody was 'cause it really didn't make any difference 'cause no one can help who their parents are, which is why racism is so stupid and dumb.  So, I asked her one day, I think I was thirteen or fourteen years old, I said, "Mom, how come you so light and they're so dark?"  I didn't even know what Ma was.  And, Ma said, "Well, because I'm Caucasian, and they're not."  And, I was like, "Okay."  I guess they were calling us colored, Negro, whatever it was in those days.  So, I said, "Well, what am I?"  She said, "What do you wanna be?"  My mother was funny, she was pretty smart.  I said, "I don't know."  She said, "Well, I'm what Daddy [Pleasant Harris] is."  "Oh, okay."  "Now, really I'm Caucasian and you are Negro, colored, black," whatever she said.  "But, I'm a light skinned black."  Oh, man.  I'm finding out some new stuff here, I don't know.  I know in the hood I'm a redbone.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm like, what is, what's going on here?  So, I said, "Okay."  She said, "You wanna be what daddy is?"  I said, "Okay, that's good, sound good to me."  So, that's it.  So, now, she said, "You can be one of two things now, you can be a mulatto.  You wanna be a mulatto?  You wanna be a half breed?"  (Laughter) She was so funny.  She was good, man.  And, I, I didn't feel bad.  I was like, "Hey, whatever you guys are, I'll just be that," (laughter) you know.  So, a lot of people have always questioned me about, "What about the--?"  You know, white folks get a little dramatic sometimes, you know.  Hey, "Well, didn't that offend you?"   "No.  It didn't offend me."  It's just something I learned, you know.  And, in the hood you're officially called a redbone.  So, I understood.  When they don't know my name, they called me reds, or white boy.  But, that's all affectionate.  There's nothing damaging about it.  I understand that.  Or, I always say, "I over-stand."  I always over-stood everything.  I could see.  You know, under always makes me feel like something is being hidden.  So, I never said that (unclear).  I learned it from somebody else, of course--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that was a little smarter than me.  But, anyway, my, that's how I led my life and I'm a light skinned African American, black person, whatever we are called.  It'll change in the next dynasty.  But (laughter), I'll be old then, but I, at least I can say I touched based with all of 'em.
Speaker 2: So, your mother, you said your sister did some research and found out that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Your, your--
Speaker 1: My mother's father--
Speaker 2: Actual biological--
Speaker 1: Biological--
Speaker 2: Grandfather was a doctor?
Speaker 1: Was a, was a psychologist.
Speaker 2: A psychologist.
Speaker 1: At the hospital, at Bellevue Hospital [Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: At Bellevue.  Okay.
Speaker 1: His name was Kitchen Puckett [ph.].
Speaker 2: Kitchen Puckett.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).  He was of German ancestry, or descent.  He wasn't a German but, I mean his people were.  I guess his people were of German descent.  I'm sure his parents probably couldn't speak any English, who- whomever he was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: So, we didn't know anything about Ma's people--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At all.
Speaker 2: So, now, did she, she finished Bayside High School in--
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-five [1945].
Speaker 2: What did she go, go into as a (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She wanted to be a nurse--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in her life.  She wanted to be a nurse.  Met my father.  I guess, my father's from outside of Richmond.  A little country town called Fine Creek, Virginia [Fine Creek Mills, Virginia], which is just outside of Midlothian [Virginia] and Richmond, Virginia.
Story_ID: 610401
Speaker 1: Let's just get his name and everything first and, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Let's see so, yeah--
Speaker 2: My father's name--
Speaker 1: What's his full name?
Speaker 2: Was Pleasant (laughter), Samuel Harris [Pleasant Harris] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Born in May of 1923 (laughter).  My mother [June Puckett Harris] called him Pete, P-E-T-E, or Peter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was born in this town of--?
Speaker 2: No.  He was born in Midlothian, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Midlothian, okay.  Virginia and--
Speaker 2: Which is about two hours from here.
Speaker 1: And, he was raised in Fine Creek?
Speaker 2: Raised in a little town called Fine Creek Mills, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to Pocahontas School.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That was the last of it for Pops; fourth grade it's over (laughter).  Pops was hard working guy.  Actually, he was a landscaper.  And, my dad had--Uncle Arthur [sic. Alfred Harris], Aunt Anna [Annie Harris], Uncle Hawk [ph.]; I'm trying to figure out, let me see, let me see, Uncle Arthur, Uncle Hawk, Aunt Anna, and I guess Daddy.  I guess that was it, I believe.  Oh, no, no, no, his Uncle Will--my Uncle Wilburt [Wilburt Harris].  So, it was, it was five of 'em; four guys, one girl, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, everybody called Aunt Anna, Mama Nana.  But, that was daddy's sister.  But, we called her Aunt Anna, and her grandkids called her Mama Nana.  I thought that was cute, so I started calling her Mama Nana.  But, that was daddy's family.  All of them are gone now.  They're all dead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any--?
Speaker 2: Except for, except for Uncle Wilburt.  He's still living.  He's ninety-seven, ninety-eight years old, I think.  Aw man, I gotta check into that.  I don't know--we used to call him Uncle Kissel.  But, I don't know--
Speaker 1: Is he like a great uncle?  Yeah, he's a great--
Speaker 2: Nah, he's my, my, he's my first uncle.  He's an uncle.  He's my father's brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's actually twenty-seven years between, I mean, twenty-three years between 'em?
Speaker 2: My father was the youngest.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: My father, my father's brothers and sisters born in 1917, 1914.  Grandpa [Pleasant C. Harris] was born in 19--1881, Grandma [Lavinia Gannaway Harris] was born 1882.  Matter of fact, my father's great aunt had sixteen kids by the slave master.  And, all we knew was his name was, that was Aunt Charlotte [ph.].  I don't know whether she was a great aunt or she was my father's, I mean, whether she was my grandfather's father's sister.  And, the slave owners name was John R.  That's all we know, J-O-H-N, R; have no clue.
Speaker 1: And, there was a John R Street in Detroit [Michigan].  I don't know.  I, they're probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You never know, man.
Speaker 1: --not related, but.
Speaker 2: You know, my grandmother was a Gannaway.  And, in the Detroit, Chicago [Illinois] area some--there's a photographer named Gannaway [Preston Gannaway].  I don't know if that's a Native American name or what.  But, there're a lot of Native Americans down that way.  My grandmother was a good looking woman, I think.  She always looked old to me.  But, I mean, she look like she could've been a nice looking whatever, nice looking is, you know, I mean, that's all perception, you know.  But, I thought she was kind of cute, you know, (laughter), I mean, I'm sure grandpa did.  Grandpa was not a very educated man, but he was smart man.  He was a carpenter by trade.  Matter of fact, he could draw blueprints and everything.  Don't ask me how.  But, but you know what, in certain parts of our history in life, reading and writing wasn't the ultimate intelligence.  It was what you could do.  You know, everybody couldn't read.  But, you didn't have to read as long as you could count.  That means you were intelligence.  You know, grandpa didn't read well, but obviously he was a master carpenter.  So, obviously he was doing some estimations pretty good.  My father ended up being a landscaper.  And, he knew how to, man, he could--but, he never could work for the park service because in the '50s [1950s] and late '40s [1940s], they weren't hiring black people.
Speaker 1: Now, how did he, well, it seems like, you know, well, a lot people in this area come from, you know, rural Virginia and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Virginia--
Speaker 1: But, but he--?
Speaker 2: Carolina.
Speaker 1: When did he, did he have any specific--
Speaker 2: Pops came here?
Speaker 1: Reason that he gave for coming here, you know?
Speaker 2: Work.  Probably a job, you know.  And, he and Ma, he and Ma--he went up to New York [New York] a lot of times.  That's where we were born.  And, I guess, he stayed up there for minute and they came down here.  And, Pops got turned down in the [U.S.] military 'cause he had flat feet.  In those days you had flat feet, they turn you down.  All that walking and stuff like that with the backpacks on your back, you're going bidwackey if your feet are bad, you can't walk anywhere.  But, his feet were flat, so (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 610402
Speaker 1: You were getting ready to tell us how they met.  Now, he, how did they meet?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  She must've been a kid.  Well, he's four years older than her.  But, she, I don't know if the word is forgo or forewent in a career as a nurse, she wanted to be a nurse.  Now, she graduated from high school [Bayside High School, Bayside, New York], which was a big thing in those days, huge.  If you went to college, it was like, whoa.  My father [Pleasant Harris] was not an educated man.  Not a stupid man by any means but he and Ma [June Puckett Harris] didn't have a whole lot in common.  It's taken me all these years to really know that Ma and Daddy didn't have a lot in common.  They just didn't.  My mother was a reader.  She listened to music.  She put crossword puzzles together.  She was champion Scrabble player.  She was an innovative person.  And, Pops, you know, that was, that was his buddy.  But, they didn't have a lot in common and I don't really know 'cause I was a kid.  I don't never know what the heck they talked about.  I mean, what could they be talking about?  And, this is not to put my father down.  But, I'm trying to, as an intellectual person, what in the heck were they talking about sometime.  Other than, cooking, washing, playing cards or whatever.
Story_ID: 610403
Speaker 1: My mother [June Puckett Harris] tried to get my father [Pleasant Harris] to go back to school.  And, he did but he only got to the sixth grade, and his boys talked him out of it.  Because this is the '50s [1950s] man, they, we have one guy in our neighborhood, Mr. Haith [ph.], who graduated from North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], he was an educated man, and still didn't have a good job.  And, he was light like I was.  A matter fact, very light, straight hair and the whole bit.  But, you know, people knew what he was or either we was, and he didn't get what he deserved.  And, all my father's neighbors were just, you know, they were either machine operators or something like that, you know.  My father worked at the PEPCO, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], which is the Potomac Electric Power Company, which is the electric company.  And, he did what we call substation maintenance.  He went to east--
Speaker 2: Now, that's not a bad job.
Speaker 1: No, it was very good.
Speaker 2: That's a pretty good job.
Speaker 1: Very good job.  Didn't make a lot of money, but his--
Speaker 2: Had benefits and stuff?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  He, he retired in thirty-seven years.  I mean, how many guys retired from a job, you know, anywhere?  He retired from PEPCO.  And, he was a good guy, and he--substations maintenance meant that he took care of all the shrubs and all the grass because that was his job.  He was a, he was a, he was a landscaper.  And, he took care of flowers and all that stuff.  Probably in those day, that was considered some job that you, you know, that wasn't really a so called upscale job.  But, really, that was a pretty doggone good job.  And, the way people cut, cut grass now and have their own businesses, if he was in his youth, man, he probably could make a lot of money on the side today.  Because people come to your door, they wan- you know, they wanna do your house and everything, so.  He could've been, been good but he was too early for that time, you know.  Matter fact when he came over to this house, he said, "Man" 'cause he always like to, he taught his--when my mother died and he got married again, he taught his wife, my stepmother, how to do the lawn.  You oughta see their, man, that place looks beautiful.  I'm horrible.  All I ever did was play ball, and he let us play.  So, and it's funny because, he used to say, "Man, I'm too old to come over and do your yard."  He said, "I used to be able to do it, but I can't do it anymore."  And, now that I'm sixty, I understanding exactly what he's saying (laughter).  I can't do all that craziness anymore either, you know.  And, everybody talking about, "Your age is just a state of mind."  Yeah, try moving one of those table over there and see how state of mind it is (laughter), you know, so.  But, I've always had a good sense of humor.  And, me and Pops could always laugh and talk and, he--I kind of miss him.  He, he's been dead now thirteen years and it's funny, man, he sat down and told me, he missed Ma so much.  And, when Ma died she was only fifty-six.
Story_ID: 610404
Speaker 1: And, you know, I kind of realize, I don't have any recollection of the stress she must have gone through in her life.  Marrying my father [Pleasant Harris] in 1945 (laughter), good lord, in this country?
Speaker 2: Well, were most of the people, your neighbors aware that she was white?  Or, did they--?
Speaker 1: I think so, yeah.  A matter fact as I talk to 'em now, they already knew it, you know.  But, I didn't know.  I know one thing, she was from New York [New York]; she had a whole lot of heart.  She had a lot of courage.  My mother [June Puckett Harris] used to--that's why I've become such an eclectic person when it comes to music and books and all that.  I can go from Tchaikovsky [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky], Rachmaninoff [Sergei Rachmaninoff], Brahms [Johannes Brahms], Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach], to this popular D.C. [Washington, D.C.] music called go-go.  I can do it all, man.  I, I'm proud of myself 'cause I never pigeonhole myself.  My mother never pigeonhole herself.  My mother was a tough New York chick, man.  She married my father.  There's two things you couldn't talk about; her husband or her children (laughter).  She was just as black as my daddy was in her mind.  But, she was cool, man.  And, when she died, she suffered like a dog, man.  She had scarlet fever when she was kid which scratched one of her eyeballs.  She had ear surgery where they took the mastoid bone out of her ear, so she couldn't hear in her left ear.  She had so many childhood things, you know, and TB [tuberculosis].  And, that's probably why I never got sick.  I got immune to everything she had.  The doctor told me that one time.  And, plus I always was pretty, you know, pretty strong and everything.  She--he said, "Probably because you don't get sick is because you got, you're immune to everything your mother had."  I don't know if that's true or not, but, you know.  But, anyway, he, they had a marriage for thirty-seven years.  I'm sure Pop tipped out a little bit.  I'm sure he did.  My mother was pretty straight.  I always said, "She only had sex five times, that was five kids that we had," (laughter).  But, Ma didn't like daddy to drink; and, he drank.  And, I guess, he drank because he was frustrated about a lot of things in life, you know, just like a lot of brothers that were drinking in those days.  And, man, you could probably relate to your father, being a cool dude, man, he's okay.  But, you know how this country was, man, it was apartheid.  They wouldn't let him do nothing.  So, only in the so called black area where you could go and enjoy your life.  Mainstream was what everybody wanted to be in, you know.  I think sometimes that set us back about three hundred centuries.  But, (laughter) at least we could read (laughter), you know what I'm saying, our young people.  So, Ma taught us how to read and count money by playing Monopoly and the games and we played, Sorry and Clue, and Monopoly; all those things, man.  Didn't have a lot of money.  Christmases were always big, you know, we're always wondering when Santa Claus was gonna come and Ma would always say, "He won't come until you go to sleep," you know.  So, I figured that one out when I was twelve years old.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I was twelve.  I say, "Good gosh, it took me long time, didn't it?"  But, in those days, you know, Santa Claus was big, you know.  So, and everything was real idealistic, you know.  You hear people talking about the good ol' days, the '50s [1950s], yeah, please (laughter).  The good ol' days, black folk couldn't do nothing.  It was unbelievable, you know.  Good ol' days for whom?  So, those were--that's the, that's the era I grew up in, you know.  And, I understand that, and as I got better and started reading and understanding more stuff, or over-standing, I really felt like, okay, the field is balanced now, I know what's happening.
Story_ID: 610405
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back.  You got five brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I'm rambling, I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: There're five brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, where do rank in the--?
Speaker 2: I'm number one, baby (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're the first.
Speaker 2: Number one pick--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: All right (laughter).  How many--well, how are your siblings then?   Just, if you could give 'em to us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Ronald Nelson [Ronald Harris], Peter Johnathan [Peter J. Harris]; notice all those Anglo names we had, see, that's from Ma [June Puckett Harris].  Anna Elizabeth [Anna Harris (ph.)], and Carla Lavinia [Carla Harris].  Lavinia is the middle name from my [paternal] grandmother.  Her name was Lavinia Harris.  Lavinia Gannaway Harris.  That was my--that's grandmother's name.  Old, old name.  And, my first name comes from my mother's stepfather, foster father, father; Robert [Robert Huntingnell (ph.)].  She never really wanted to call me Robert [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris].  She wanted to honor him by naming me Robert.  And, my middle name, Glenn, is because she liked Glenn Ford, the actor.  That was her favorite actor.  And, so, Glenn Ford, well I was named after him.  And, just like people name their kids after stars today, Jada Pinkett [Jada Pinkett Smith], Tupac, you know, whatever.  A matter fact, my granddaughter's name is Jada [ph.], which is a beautiful name.  My daughter's name is India [India Harris], which I think is a beautiful name.  And, my son's name is Jason [Jason Harris], in which I thought was a real spartan name at the time, you know, so.  His name is Jason Christopher, and my daughter's name is India Renee.  So, I thought they were nice names.  But, I asked permission, could I name the kids.  So, I kind of like those names, they were kind of spartan, you know.  Names are pretty ethnic now, which, not a bad thing.  You know, a lot of people wanna make fun of people when they--their names.  And, some of 'em are made up (laughter).  Some of these names from the neighborhood are actually made up names.  But, that's what a name is.  A name is really made up.  So, you make up a name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not that big of deal.  But, you just put people in so much jeopardy when they grow up if your name is the father's name and half the mother's name.  I call that the hood name, you know (laughter), the hoodie name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Now, let me--
Speaker 2: That's a project name (laughter).
Story_ID: 610406
Speaker 1: Now, do you have first childhood memory, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What age you talking about?
Speaker 1: The earliest.
Speaker 2: Geez.  Well, when we were five, six, years old, we didn't have a lot to eat.  And, this is true; I know you hear this all the time.  But, Pops [Pleasant Harris] worked every day.  Ma [June Puckett Harris] worked every day, but we didn't have a lot.  Rent wasn't but fifty-five [dollars] a month.  But, that was like huge back in the day.  But, we always got this summons on the door (laughter).  "Ma, what is this?"  "If we don't pay in thirty days, we gotta get out," so.  We had an old shotgun apartment over in Southeast D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  And, shotgun apartment, and you open up the front door and you open up the back door, you could shoot a shotgun straight out the back, straight back.  I could remember my father was out there hustling, man.  And, I'm not saying illegal hustle, just working, you know.  My mother would always, we'd always do something.  If it was raining, we'd walk out, put our raincoats on and go singing in the rain.  My mother was singing in the rain, and we'd go do that.  Then, she would, before Pops would come home, she would, we would all eat air sandwiches.  And, when we ate the air sandwiches, we actually got full (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Air sandwiches?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Ma had these innovative things, man.  You know, it was that we just didn't have a lot going, you know.  Ma couldn't drive.  We had no telephone.  And, I remember my first phone number; Johnson2-5864, JO2-5864.  Our first telephone.  And, man, we got on the tele- man, we got a telephone, and I guess, my mom was a youngster.  She was only about twenty some years--she used to live on the phone with her girlfriend, and they talk all the time.  So, I called my mother the talkie mouths, you know, 'cause she was always on the phone, and--when we got a phone.  But, anyway what she would do, "Mommy, I'm hungry."  "Okay, before Daddy comes home, let's sit down, we have to eat some air sandwiches first, and you might be kind of full."  But, man, she used to put those sandwiches together--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We'd eat those air sandwiches.  And, I told that to, that story to my wife and she cried because she realized how the struggle was trying to raise kids, man, you know.
Story_ID: 610407
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let me go back to--now, why did your parents move to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: That, I have no idea.  Probably for better, better work.
Speaker 1: Was there an offer or something, you think?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  My father [Pleasant Harris] and my mother [June Puckett Harris]--it could've been--
Speaker 1: Or, was it beca--
Speaker 2: Working at PEPCO [Potomac Electric Power Company].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was a stable job.  Matter fact, my (laughter) first job in life was PEPCO.
Speaker 1: Did he have relatives here in D.C. working for them?
Speaker 2: You know what, they could have been.  They could've been some relatives here but I don't know them.  I don't know, I--'cause people come up to me all the time, "Man, don't you have an aunt live in so--?"  "Nah, nah."  So, and, don't forget, Richmond [Virginia] was only two hours away in that area.  And, then go down thirteen miles from outside of Richmond, my father--my father would go home like he were going across town.  He just tell us, "Hey, man, I'm going down to the country, I'll be back," you know.  And, my mother, her home was New York [New York].  So, we'd go up there sometime.  Nana and Papa [Robert Huntingnell (ph.)] took care of us in the summers in New York.  But, that was 'til we start playing ball.  And, then after 1957, we didn't go back anymore.  You know, we never went back.  We just, we saw them periodically.  But, we never went back 'cause we were playing sports.
Speaker 1: Now, did your father play sports at all?
Speaker 2: My father was an old sandlot baseball player.  That's what they said, you know.  I never saw him play anything, you know.  I guess he could have.  But, I guess, thirteen, forty years old back then was a little older than it is now.  In a way you looked at things and thought about stuff and, you know.  And, he--I don't think he was that good to play on any of the top average teams or nothing.  But, he played old country ball down there where he'd run around and they say he was a pretty good ballplayer, you know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 610408
Speaker 1: You know, but my mother [June Puckett Harris] was a career secretary.  My mother could type 100 words a minute on a standard typewriter.  She was, she was the secretary.  She was a real secretary.  You know, real secretaries are like a top in the [U.S.] military.  You know, when you an E-8 in the military, you're a top, you're a top sergeant.  You know everything that the generals know.  Generals don't bother top sergeants.  They never bothered my mother until they saw my father [Pleasant Harris] (laughter).  My mother was a top secretary in one of the top real estate agents in this town.  And, agencies I should say.  She had two dresses (laughter), and she got them from a catalog.  But, my mother was voracious, voracious reader.  She would devour books.  My mother would read one book, a whole book in a week.  A novel in a week, two weeks tops.  She would read all night long.  I don't even know if she went to sleep.  She may have.  She would sit up 'til four  and five [o'clock] in the morning, get us up, get us ready to go to school, eat food, get us out, and go to work.
Story_ID: 610409
Speaker 1: She was an innovative punisher.  She--if you're interested, I'll throw you some of those.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what's, what's, tell us the story about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My mom [June Puckett Harris] was, my mother used to spank you with a hairbrush.  And, she had the greatest backhand of all time from here to here, bam!  If you talk back or whatever, which was me, it wasn't my brother.  I did all the talking back.  See, it was me and my brother, Ronnie [Ronald Harris], for a long time.  And, then Peter [Peter J. Harris] came.  All right we go, I'm sixty, he's fifty-nine, Peter is fifty-two his birthday, Anna [Anna Harris (ph.)] just turned forty-nine, and the baby [Carla Harris] is forty-one.  Which I'm old enough to be her father.  I asked my parents, "What the heck were you all doing, rolling around or something?"  And, they laughed, you know.  And, they really weren't that old, but I thought they were.  They had a kid later on in life, you know, so, I guess, Mom said, okay (laughter).  Maybe Pops [Pleasant Harris] came in and said the right thing.  I don't know (laughter).  So, it's five of us, and my mother was tough on us.  But, she had an opened mind though.  My mother was pretty open minded, but she was tough.  After twelve years old, she say, "You don't have to go to church anymore if you don't want to."  Because my father came from all the way hardcore country church.
Story_ID: 610410
Speaker 1: What church did you all attend?
Speaker 2: We went to the church in Southeast D.C. [Washington, D.C.] when we were kids.  I wanna say St. Matthews [Matthews Memorial Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] but I'm, I, I don't wanna be dead wrong because it was around in South- in Southeast--church is still there.  Right in the middle of the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: What kind of church is it?
Speaker 2: I, I have no idea.  I just went.  We went to Sunday school, bible school, stuff like that.  And, when we went down to the country, Grandma [Harris' paternal grandmother, Lavinia Gannaway Harris] made us go to church.  Put an old hat on your head, you sit up in there half bored falling off--the church is still there in Powhatan.  That, that's the county Powhatan County [Virginia], Richmond [Virginia], Midlothian [Virginia], Powhatan, you know, all that's, you know, same thing, same area, which is now the suburbs of Richmond of course (laughter).  In our days, it was the country.  And, then, Ma [June Puckett Harris] said, "You don't have to go to church anymore if you don't want to."  My mother always taught us to think, just think about things.  Wanna believe in God.  And, then I started as I got better and older to me all of that became a concept, you know.  And, to me that's what it is.  I mean, I have no proof of anything.  All I know is what ever concept it is to you, if that's your celebration then, I'll celebrate it with you if that's what you want.  So, church doesn't validate me.  I validate me through what I read and research, and that's what I'm about.  And, I've always said, if there is a God, than God is the ultimate intellect.  And, intellectualism means that you can discuss anything and nobody is above criticism, including God.  And, I'm sure God would say, "Yeah, that's what I'm talking about."  Because God is all about intellectualism.  It's not about crazy, wildness, "Oh, Lord have mercy, God.  You know if it say it in the book, it's got to be true."  Yeah, well, that was 21 B.C. or 21 A.D. or whatever.  Nothing is different.  What it is, times are different.  When you start rolling that wheel around, that was modern times.  That was big.  It was all relative.  It's all relative.  It's all relative.  So, that's the way I look at it.  So, I think God will be real proud of me because I'm an intellectual.  Because that's what God is; intellectualism, you know.  The plant is all about being intellectualist--intellectual.  You know, I believe in relative, what is it, what was Darwin's theory?
Speaker 1: Rel--
Speaker 2: Evolution.
Speaker 1: Evolution.
Speaker 2: I believe in evolution, 'cause it makes sense.  We all evolve.  It's no magic.  The earth is God.  The planet is God, you know.  There's no man.  There's nobody sitting up here with a clipboard.  If you curse, "All, there, there it is."  You know, words didn't become profane 'til it go to this country anyway.  There are a lot of words that were not profane that we--the curse words in our culture, but not curse words in other cultures.  So, you gotta read, man.  You gotta read.  And, stop listening to what everybody else says without checking on it.  The Bible even tell you that.  Don't take my word for it, do your research.  Find out what's going on, you know.  Discuss things, be intellectual, have some karma about yourself, you know.  If that's God, then that's God.
Story_ID: 610411
Speaker 1: Okay, now.  Let me ask you, what was your personality like--?
Speaker 2: That's a long way from where we was (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We jumped from, we just got on a, on a trampoline and leaped across from my mother [June Puckett Harris], to, to what I'm talking about (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: You can condense it (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was your personality like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How would people describe you, you know?
Speaker 2: I was a kid that knew a lot and had a rough--bad temper because I knew so much because of my mother's teachings and early readings.  And, I kept rememb- the grown people that I was around, they didn't finish no high school.  They didn't finish any college.  They didn't have a clue what I was talking about.  All they knew that I was a smart ass kid saying anything, and you ain't never gonna be nothing 'cause you, you--who are you questioning?  You know, we came up in them seen and not heard era.  You don't be doing no talking no grown folks like that.  But, thanks to my mother, who made us think, I'm challenging grown folk (laughter).  I'm like, "Oh, no, that's not right."  They was saying, "Boy, what you know, you don't know what you talking about," (laughter).  So, I got that all the time.  My brother was quiet.  He never said anything; Ronnie [Ronald Harris], who was a total intellect.  But, he never said much.  I did all the talking, you know, so.  Yeah, I was a stormy young'un.  I was a stormy, stormy person.
Speaker 1: Did you get in trouble, or?
Speaker 2: You know, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not really.  My mother taught us--we were so honest.  If we got a note from the teacher, we took it straight to her, and got the butt whipping, you know.  We didn't say, "I'm a hide this from my mother."  Because, we had sense enough to know that she would find out, you know.  My mother faked us out good.  Ma would call home, she was one of these right now mothers.  "Did you make up the bed yet?"  "Nah Ma, not yet."  "Let's do it, let's just get it done right now."  "Ma, it's only like seven or eight o'clock in the morning."  She'd call from work, "Let's get the work done right now.  I'll be home in a few minutes."  Not knowing that my mother had no car.  My father [Pleasant Harris] was at work, in the field.  'Cause my father was a, his, his--when he got in his truck, he drove to different substations [for Potomac Electric Power Company].  So, he was in the field.  How could she get home?  We didn't know it, we thought she was big time.  We didn't know.  We think Ma was gonna pop up at the door, man.  We making beds up, trying to get the dishes done.  Everybody had an assignment; everybody, you know.  My mother--didn't realize how short she was 'til she died.  My mother wasn't but 5'3" but I thought she was 6'5" (laughter) you know.  She's tough.  She--we had assignments.  We couldn't just go up to the laundromat and the nickel and dime laundromat and throw the cloths in a bag.  We had to fold the clothes.  I say, "Ma, we the only people in the neighborhood that do this.  You know, the other kids they throw it in there."  And, she said, "Well, you're not the other kids.  You fold the clothes in colors and bring 'em down the hill."  We were like, "Lord have mercy, come on, Ma."  But, she was like that, man.  She was, you know, each time you had a--
Speaker 1: Has any of that stayed with you?  I mean, has it, has it--
Speaker 2: No, 'cause I'm horrible.  You walked in my house, it look pretty good.  But, actually this place is--look like crap.  I mean, stuff all over the place.  But, actually, what I do now, which I learned.  I ain't--wait 'til I'm sixty years old to actually bring somebody in to clean the house up.  I have two jobs so I can do that.  So, you know, I bring people in now.  But, I really like a neat place.  But, I don't have to have it neat.  I can lay in the junk (laughter); typical man type thing, you know.  And, not all men are like that.  My brother's very neat; my brother, Ron.  You could, you could eat out of his trunk of his car, that's how neat it is.  And--
Story_ID: 610412
Speaker 1: You all are very close growing up I would suppose, yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we're fifteen months apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Totally different.  Even though he's [Harris' brother, Ronald Harris] a Cancer, I get along with 'em.  But, he's different.  He's more frugal than I am.  I'm more impulsive.  He saves, I don't.  If I like you, I'll buy you something.  If you're a woman and I like you, I ain't gotta want nothing, I can buy you something, you know.  Women are very suspicious about that.  I was gonna buy a lady an ice cream cone one day, she was at the ice cream store.  I love ice cream.  So, I said, "Look, I'll pay for hers."  She, "Oh, no, no.  Don't do that."  I said, "Ma'am, I don't want nothing."  "If you're buying something that little cup of ice cream, I'll get it for you."  We had a conversation.  But, I think her guy was sitting in the car, and traditionally, she probably got scared, "No, no, no."  He would probably ask--now, if I was a big ol' fat slob, somebody would've probably say, "Oh, yeah, I saw that fat man buy you some ice cream."  But, when you look halfway, you know I'm not trying to say I'm all that.  But, I'm just saying, when you look half athlete and all that, somebody gonna say, "Who's that?"  'Cause you know, people threatened by the way somebody looks.  So, they're all, "Who was that big dude in there, looking kind of halfway athletic?"  And, of course, his stomach hanging over top of the steering wheel.  So, he's already feeling bad about how he looks.  So, if somebody offers her something, they think I guess they, you know, "Hey, he's trying to take my woman."  I don't even know the lady, you know.  So, I never got into all that craziness like that.  So, I said, "Okay, if you don't--it's okay," you know.  So, I didn't buy it for her.  She didn't want me to.
Story_ID: 610413
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about like, in terms of athletics when did you, I guess, you probably started playing real young, I guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --fifty-five [1955], '56 [1956], we started playing in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My hero was a guy name Bobby Hinton [Robert Hinton].  Man, was he a good athlete; went to Anacostia High School [Washington, D.C.].  One of the--
Speaker 1: Was he a local?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a local.  He's dead now.  He been dead over thirty years.  Came back from Vietnam, had some heart problems or something; passed away.  What an athlete.  What an entertainer, a funny guy, throw a fastball ninety miles an hours, good pitcher, played American Legion Baseball when baseball was big in this area. He was the, well, actually, there were a lot of great amateur leagues around in those days and Bobby Hinton was my hero.
Speaker 1: Now, were you living in, you were living in Southeast D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Southeast, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Bobby Hinton lived down the court.  You know, we lived in courts in those days, you know; lived down the court, three doors down, you know, whatever.  So, he lived--oh, that's a rock group's name, two, 3 Doors Down. I just thought I'll say that (laughter).  I got things rolling around in my head.  It's funny man, that I don't recall a lot things that--my long term memory is better than my short term memory, 'cause sometime I think people, like yourself, you're bring out my intellectualism.  'Cause sometime I get lazy.  I can't remember nothing, man, you know what I mean?  And, they, they said that comes along with the territory.  When you get over fifty years old, doesn't have anything to do with you being, you know, senile or Alzheimer's (laughter) you know, it just, you just forget things, you know.  I don't wanna do that.  I'm doing pretty good right now, 'cause I'm throwing all of this stuff in the, in the pan, and we're frying it up smorgasbord, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, Bobby was my hero.  I really was upset.  It upset me when he died.
Speaker 1: So, he was a baseball player?
Speaker 2: Baseball player.  Used to come outside and practice--it's punting in football; sixty-five, seventy yards, man, it used to punt the ball.  And, just kicked it so high, man, we thought he was everything.  Actually, Bobby wasn't but three years older than me.  But, he looked like he was a giant.  And, he was a little guy.  Bobby wasn't but 5'6."  But, could he throw the baseball, man, he was quick.  Bobby Hinton, they called him Rapid Robert.  And, of course, Bob Feller was a big time pitcher; probably retired when we were growing up.  But, we knew who Bob Feller was, and Bobby Hinton could throw the baseball.  In those days, Anacostia was king in baseball, and so were they in my day too.  But, in his day, man, they were king, man.  It wasn't but a few blacks on the team in those days.  And, Bobby Hinton was a star; played on the football team, played baseball, and got us started playing ball, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  You mean, playing formal--?  Just playing --?
Speaker 2: Just playing base- yeah, playing--
Story_ID: 610414
Speaker 1: Another guy took us under his wing.  A guy named Robert Sprigs [ph.], thug, gangster, barber.  He was a barber in his trade.  He ended up dying terrible, man; a drug addict and all that.  But, Robert Sprigs took us in; always had respect for my mother [June Puckett Harris].  He took us to the recreation center; me and my brother [Ronald Harris].  And, that was it.  When he introduced us to the coach, who ended up being one of my mentors, Mr. Ballard [ph.], man; we start playing from then on, man.  They always thought me and my brother were gonna be Major League baseball players.  We were so ahead of the group, man.  We picked up the game so fast, and I taught myself how to be a--actually, I played third base.  In 1958, we won the city Little League baseball championship.  And, I was a third baseman.  I had a strong arm, and I could play.  My brother was at first base.  My brother was such an exceptional hitter, they were gonna bring him up to the twelve and under group at nine years old; that's how good he was.  So, I asked the coach could I catch.  I was just enamored with this, being a catcher.  He said, "You can't even play third base well, yet."  'Cause you know coaches in those days, just hardcore, you know, "Can't play third base yet."  He put me back there, man, and they said, "Man, you are a natural."  The reason why I was natural is because, we used to play strike out and I'd get behind the plate and I never blinked.  I didn't have a mask or nothing on and we play strike out, and I would play catcher, and I'd be the catcher.  So, then I became a catcher in formal baseball, with uniforms and all that.
Speaker 2: Now, this is something.  Now, people today, especially young people, probably don't have any idea of how big baseball was--
Speaker 1: Huge.
Speaker 2: --in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh.
Speaker 2: And, you know, we had like, it was like, take ten years after Jackie Robinson--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was in the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball].  'Cause you had like all the big stars, Mays [Willie Mays]--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Frank Robinson, McCovey [Willie McCovey]--
Speaker 1: Roberto Clemente.
Speaker 2: Clemente.
Speaker 1: Warren Marshall [Willard Marshall], Orlando Cepeda.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron.
Speaker 1: Hank Aaron.  You know, you could look on my wall right in front of you there and you'll see a photo of those guys, my heroes up there.
Speaker 2: But, those were the biggest stars (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, they were big, man; big time.
Speaker 2: --in the black community in those days in baseball.
Speaker 1: Huge.  They were our, they were our guys, man.  And, I mean, Mickey Mantle, you know, Mickey Mantle.  I could name you the whole Yankee [New York Yankees] infield, you know.  I can go from Clete Boyer to, from Clete Boyer all the way to Tony Kubek, Bobby Richardson, Bill Skowron, you know.  And, the Yankees had three catchers; Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, and Johnny Blanchard.  Centerfield was Mickey Mantle; right field was Roger Maris, and Hector Lopez was in left field.  I can remember that stuff like it was yesterday, man.  But, that's what we did.  Back over in my corner over there, I got over a hundred thousand cards.  A hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, maybe, you know.  That's what we did, man.
Story_ID: 610415
Speaker 1: We kind of enjoyed our childhood.  We didn't have anything, but we enjoyed the childhood, we enjoyed it, you know.  And, what I would do, we used to walk to school, and I would take, we'd have music on Tuesday.  I would take twenty-five of my mother's [June Puckett Harris] classical music records to school.  I was looking back, I said, "What the heck did I do this for?"  I'm trying to teach these dudes how to listen to Rachmaninoff's 'Theme of Paganini' ['Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43,' Sergei Rachmaninoff] (laughter).  They looking at me like, "N are you crazy?"  (Laughter) Are you--but, they liked it though.  Miss Frye [ph.], we had a teacher name Miss Frye, junior high [Frederick Douglass Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].  She weighed about, oh eight hundred pounds.  She couldn't move.  She was this.  Miss Frye, I respected her 'cause she's a very educated woman.  She just big.  She used to play that music, man, and you know all them thugs I was in the class with, man, they was like, (nods head).  Music, I don't care what you're listening to, I don't care what you think you like, if it does something for you or put you somewhere, you're gonna be quiet and listen to it, you know.  I got a Bose wave radio upstairs, which took me all these years to get 'cause I, I always look at it in the magazines, "I'm a get one of those one day."  Finally got one, still paying for it, and I put in--when I go to CDs [compact disc], get CDs, the guy said, "Man, where you coming from, man?"  "I coming from where I wanna come from," you know.  I like what I like, you know.  I can do Sergei Rachmaninoff or I can do Pachelbel [Johann Pachelbel].  I can do Johnny Mathis if I want to.  I can do Sinatra [Frank Sinatra], Robert Goulet.  I, you, you name 'em, Barbra Streisand.  I hear some of the youngsters talking about, I heard a young girl say one day, Streisand couldn't sing.  I said, "You crazy?  Please, get serious."  Then, I heard the other day, they said, "Robert Goulet started out as a lounge singer and he was pretty good."  No, he was very good.  He was an outstanding singer, you know.  And, he does a lot stuff on--heck, he's gotta be in his late seventies now.
Speaker 2: He was on a commercial the other day.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I saw 'em, I saw it.  I saw that.  But, I mean, just be aware of everything.  I'm always aware of everything.  I'll always--I don't ever look sight of anything.  My peripheral vision, I can--I know what's on the side because, you know, when you grow up in a neighborhood, man, you always have that, that shield, you know.  If I was in Beverly Hills [California], I'm a lock my door (laughter), 'cause, 'cause it ain't the neighborhood, it's the people that come in your neighborhood.

Speaker 1: Well, I didn't ask you this but what school did you start at?
Speaker 2: I went to, gosh; went to, three elementaries.
Speaker 1: Three, which ones?
Speaker 2: I went to Birney Elementary [James G. Birney Elementary School; Thurgood Marshall Academy, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Is that B-I-R--?
Speaker 2: B-I-R-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is right in the Barry Farms [Barry Farm, Washington, D.C.] projects.  Which I didn't know then, but, I knew Barry Farms projects was there.  But, I knew Birney school was there.  I, you know, went there and I guess, kindergarten, I guess, first grade.  My kindergarten teacher's name was Elise Derricotte.  She gave me a kiss on my cheek, man, I thought that was the greatest thing.  And, then I went to Anita J. Turner Elementary [Anita J. Turner Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], and I finished up at Garfield Elementary [James A. Garfield Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, did they have junior high school here?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to Douglass junior high, Frederick Douglass Junior High [Frederick Douglass Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].  And, went to Douglass in 1959.  I was in the seventh grade.  And, Douglass was built, I think in 1951 or '2 [1952].  I didn't know it was a new school at that time.  But, I do know, we had a dental office and all that stuff.  So, it was a pretty modern school when we went there.  I didn't know it, I'm just going to the school, you know.  And, we walked everywhere.  We walked to school.  When we lived in Southeast [Washington, D.C.], when I went to Garfield Elementary, my brother [Ronald Harris] and I used to walk, what we have, I guess in Chicago [Illinois] you have the Dan Ryan [Dan Ryan Expressway]?  Okay.  It wasn't as long as the Dan Ryan, but the Suitland Parkway was kind of new then.  And, me and my brother used to--you can't do it anymore, they won't let you walk the highway anymore, but we used to walk to school.  We walked all the way to school, elementary school, all the way to Garfield, went to the rec center and then walked all the way back home; every night.  You know, I walked to high school every day until my senior year in high school, we finally took the bus.  Now, anybody from the D.C. area can tell you, the D.C. transit, which now called Metro [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] was ten cent to ride the bus.  We was so broke, my mother [June Puckett Harris] didn't have a dime to let us get on the bus.  And, that makes me, brings me to another thing, when the ice cream man would come around, we couldn't get a gourmet thing like an ice cream sandwich.  We could only get a Popsicle and then split the Popsicle; you talking about broke.  Man, we were broke.  And, I'm sure people--there have been some broker people.  But, we didn't know we were that broke because my mother was so upbeat all the time.  But, I didn't realize how they was scuffling, man.  I didn't realize, my mother had two dresses.  And, she would iron them every day.  Wear one Monday, one Tuesday, and then Wednesday she wear the one she wore Monday.  They were struggling, man, (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 610417
Speaker 1: And, then the sad part of it is, is that, it was rough, man.  Black folks getting treated like dirt.  We pick up the paper in The Washington Post, man, D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was a rough town, man.  In Prince George's County [Maryland], where I'm living now--
Speaker 2: Well what kind of things were going on?
Speaker 1: Oh, my go- I mean, just blatant racism.  You couldn't go into the major department stores.  What my mother [June Puckett Harris] would do, we have an area here called Anacostia [Washington, D.C.], which is an old area.  Anacostia was where some of the freed black slaves would come.  But, it was all white.  But, they would come and we have a big project here called Barry Farms [Barry Farm, Washington, D.C.].  It was really a guy name Barry [David Barry].  In 1865, he opened up this area that was a farm for freed black slaves, for freed slaves and their children [sic.].  And, what he would do is he would give them a plot of land where they could, you know, get vegetables, and stuff like that, plant it.  And, that's what they did.  And, Nichols Avenue which is now Martin Luther King Avenue [Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue], that's where the blacks were.  At the end of that area, there were no more black folks.  As you rode up the hill towards what we call Naylor Road, there were no more blacks.  That was the Congress Heights [Washington, D.C.] area, which is now all black and pretty dangerous too.  But, then re-gentrification is gonna knock all that out anyway.  But, that's where we were.  We're in this, we're in this one area.  Then, you could go up what we call Morris Road, 18th Street, Alabama Avenue, all that was black.  But, once you got out of that area which was at the end of that, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: So, it was a little black pocket and then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, it was a pocket.  We had pockets of blacks in Southeast [Washington, D.C.].  Because Southeast was pretty much--all the old senior pre-baby--post--'cause we're the baby boomer group, the '40s [1940s], but before that, all the old crew that live all the way down in Charles County [Maryland] and all down here in Prince George's County, they're all from Southeast; they're all Southeast.  Southeast had Italians, had Jewish people, Greeks.  I went to school with Kannacopolis [ph.], (unclear), Borcelinos [ph.], the Cohens [ph.], all that; went to high school with those people.  So, you know, it was a very ethnic group of people.  We--everybody, it was a melting pot of people.  But, we still couldn't go to the Anacostia theater [Anacostia Playhouse, Washington, D.C.].  We still couldn't go to the Naylor Theatre [Washington, D.C.].  We still couldn't go to the Congress Theatre [Washington, D.C.].  Young folks don't know nothing about that.  My mother would take us, 'cause he had guts and she was a white woman.  And, she took me and my brother Ronnie [Ronald Harris], "Shh, be quite I wanna see this movie."  Daddy [Pleasant Harris] couldn't go.  We had to go to U Street.  U Street was the D.C. Harlem, you know.  That's where you go to the Lincoln Theatre [Washington, D.C.], the Republic Theatre [Washington, D.C.], you know.  Well, Daddy could go with us then.  And, you know, one thing about it, black folks would let white folks come in, but white folks wouldn't let us come in.  So, my mother would walk us right on in there.  And, what we did, we could only go to the Carver Theater [Washington, D.C.], named after George Washington Carver of course, on Nichols Avenue, which is now Martin Luther King.  Which is now where all the dope fiends hang out at.  So, they getting ready to clean all that mess up.  So, that's where we went.  What we would do is, when Ma and Daddy would take us out on Fridays, they would take us to the movies on U Street.  We go to a restaurant where we learned to put our napkins in our lap, food never tasted any better, but that was the etiquette; napkins in our lap, hands in this.  So, I always knew, Mom was teaching us all that as we grew up.  So, now where ever we went, we had a foundation, everywhere.  Then we could go to the movies with the kids if Daddy had any money.  It was only twenty-five cent to get in.  So, on short--on good pays we get fifty--a dollar a week.  On short days our allowance was fifty cent.  And, on a bad, we get zero, so.  It was kind of, we didn't know, flip a coin, you know.  But, we never got mad, you know, kids were, "Well, they didn't give me none."  No, we never got, we never got mad.  We just said, "Well, guess Pops short.  We just go out and play some ball or throw the ball around or whatever," so.
Story_ID: 610418
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us about how--now well, first of all, did--were there any particular teachers or mentors in grade school that you, that stand out that you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I really hated school.  I, I like it when I got to high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.] because I played sports.  I was a functional illiterate in mathematics.  I was, I was so terrible in math.  I'm still terrible; I'm not good now.  I don't ever admit that to a lot of people 'cause they don't ask me, but I don't mind putting myself out there.  When I work with young people and they struggle with things, I put myself out there first.  I say, "Look, I couldn't count either, but what I could do," you can get away with not counting, but you better be able to read.  And, if you don't read, you don't know, you, you don't know whether you can save your life or whatever.  I mean, when you go foreign countries and you can't read, you're illiterate.  You're going like, "Oh, man, I don't--what does that sign say right there?"  When I was in Mexico I was like, "What in the world?"  You know, and even though I took my little notes with me, you still can't memorize all that, you know.  All I know is, "Como esta, amigo?  Como esta, senor, senora, senorita?"  And, I always had good dialect 'cause I can mock people all the time, you know.  You know, I mean, there was two hours, I've been to San Juan, Puerto Rico, you know.  "Are you from Puerto Rico?"  "No.  My espanol is poquito," (laughter).  They think I know how to--but, that just come from radio, TV, you just picking up words, you know.  And, I know how to say it and sound like I'm all sophisticated; dumb as hell, you know what I mean.  But, but it's okay.  And, I, I just, you know.  But, I never was a very good--I'm very nervous when it comes to computers and counting.  I'm terrible.  I don't, I did not know the concept of my times table 'til I was twenty years old, man.  I didn't understand, I didn't over-stand (laughter), three times five means three fives, okay.  You count five, three times.  Couldn't get it, man.  Count not get it.  Me, I always had a good sense of humor.  It never affected me to where I would get in any depression.  Now, I got kicked out of class a couple times 'cause I was frustrated.  But, I always made fun of myself.  My boy, my friend, Rock Newman always tell me (laughter), he say, "Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris], you know we going east but you don't care nothing about that, 'cause you don't where east, north, south, nothing is."  I said, "You're exactly right."  But, when it came to reading, it came to certain things to over-stand, they always ask Glenn.  "Man, read that for me, man.  Spell this for me."  Because I could do it.  I was in the seventh grade, I was reading on a twelfth grade level.  In the sixth grade, I was reading on a twelfth grade level.  I'm talking about reading with expression and knowing what I was reading.  I don't know why I could do it.  Maybe it was 'cause of Ma [June Puckett Harris].  Maybe because ma read so much.  And, we read.  And, we played games, word games.
Speaker 1: Did she read to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yep, she read.  She read to us and it just, boom, just like that.  I used to make my son [Jason Harris] read black heroes every day he went to school.  And, he be crying, "I don't wanna read about Paul Laurence Dunbar.  I don't wanna read about Frederick Douglass.  I don't care about no George Washington Carver."  'Til he got to college.  And, he called me one day and said, "Daddy, god, man, thank you for making me read those, those guys, man.  We're in a freshman class, nobody knew anything."  He went to the University of District of Columbia [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], which is a, you know, is a--it's a commuter school for D.C. [Washington, D.C.] people.  You know, everybody makes fun of it, but it really, really a good school.  It's a school like, like in Detroit [Michigan], Wayne State [Wayne State University].  You go to Wayne State, I mean, you could, you know, if you're in city person, you get your college--high school diploma, you can go to Wayne State, they not gonna turn you know, you know.  That's just an example.  I'm sure there's some schools in Chicago [Illinois], where your hometown is--
Speaker 1: Chicago State [Chicago State University] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that you can, you know, everybody, you know, Chicago State is the place to go.  But, they have an outstanding graduate programs, they're undergrad now.  You can get in but they can kick you out, 'cause you can flunk out, you know.  Or, Cleveland State [Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So.  I mean, places like that give people an opportunity to get an education.  And, that's, that's all you want is just an opportunity.  You take advantage of it if you will, and you go do that.
Story_ID: 610419
Speaker 1: So, you had, I can see right away, you had a--had to figure out how am I gonna get out of school without knowing any math.
Speaker 2: I was pitiful.  I was horrible.  I was so ner- that's why I was so scared.  What kind of technical--I'm not, I'm not technically inclined at all; I'm horrible.  I'm strong with people.  I'm strong with groups.  I can stand in front of a hundred thousand people and do a speech with no problem.  People go, "Aren't you nervous, man?"  "Nervous? I'm doing what I know, man."  You know how you hyperventilate, man?  Your heart go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Man, it ain't never bother me.
Speaker 1: Were you always like that when you were--?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I was.  Maybe I was; I don't know.  I didn't even know I could do it.  I know when I first got into TV, I was, nervous 'cause I never expected to be on any TV.  So, I was like (inhales).  And, the worst thing in the world--you know something, man; I'm so experienced with this media thing, when people are talking to me, I can tell when they're nervous.  I can tell because they, you can see 'em breathing, man.  You know, when you hyperventilating, (inhales), you, you, that's how you're talking, you know what I'm saying.  So, "Oh, man that person's nervous."  So, I used to always tell people who come on my show, I can look at 'em, "You nervous, aren't you?"  They go like, "Yeah, I'm a little nervous, never done this before."  I say, "Well, don't worry, I ain't gonna ask you about no trigonometry or nothing, or no tetrahedron mathematics."  Now, see you know why I know what tetrahedron math is?  From my reading.  I can't do it.  But, I know what it is, you know.  The Star of David, is tetrahedron, you know.  And, I know the history behind that too, so (laughter), that's another story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, it, you know, I know stuff 'cause I read about stuff.  I don't even read a whole book.  You saw my library, it's got every book in the world in it.  But, I'll start a book from the back.  I don't care what they--if I know the ending.  I love movies.  You can tell me the ending and I'll still go see the movie.  You know why, because I'm unorthodox, man.  Because I don't care about, I don't care about all that mystery in life.  All I care about is, is some sun and some, and some, and some trees, and some grass.  I love seeing the--I go buy stuff for the squirrels and throw it out there and let the birds eat it.  What am I doing that for?  You know, 'cause I'm a mother nature freak, you know.  I love all that stuff.  I'm a, I'm, you know, I'm an organic person.  Now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If a bug is in here, I'm a kill it.  But, if he stays outside, I'm a let him go (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so--
Speaker 2: You just said, "How weird is this guy?  I can't even think of what else to say."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, no.
Speaker 2: He's jumping all over the place (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Story_ID: 610420
Speaker 1: You didn't name any mentors in high, was it that, were there any, anyone (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Yeah, that was the original question--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I went off into space somewhere.  Academic mentors, Dave Brown [David Brown].  Dave Brown was my coach in high school and my mentor in high school.
Speaker 1: Now, that's Anacostia High School [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Anacostia High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I came to Anacostia, Dave Brown was me and my best friend's, Reggie Rucker's mentor.
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk, let's talk about him for a second too.  That's, well let's talk about Dave Brown first and we're talk about Reggie Rucker--
Speaker 2: Dave Brown was a very articulate and educated man, well read, quiet, and quietly filthy rich (laughter), never spent any money.  He was a guy that would bring a carton of milk in and his lunch from home; old school, military guy.  Coached Elgin Baylor in high school.  He started out at Phelps Vocational which is where Elgin went first.  Then he transferred from Phelps Vocational High School [Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School, Washington, D.C.].  When then Lieutenant Brown went to Spingarn High School [Joel Elias Spingarn High School, Washington, D.C.] and that's where he was.  At Spingarn and then Elgin followed him to Spingarn and that's where Elgin "Rabbit" Baylor was famous; at Spingarn High School, which was a new high school in the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  They called him Rabbit?
Speaker 2: Rabbit.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rabbit--
Speaker 1: He's one of the great players in NBA [National Basketball Association] history, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was the, he was one of the first great players that put the dipsy doodle in the game, or whatever we wanna call it.  He put the flare in the game that nobody had.  He was dunking on people and all that kind of stuff.  Willie Jones was another great player like that, they all played together.  Matter of fact, that's another name, the, you know, some of these we done on Will Jones, Willie Jones.  One of the great, great athletes, S talkers of all time.  He talked trash but he was a great coach and a great player.  Matter of fact, his number was just retired at American University here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  He and a guy name Kermit Washington, who was another very good friend of mine.  Oh, by the way, Kermit Washington also on the list (laughter).  Another great, great person; great human being.
Speaker 1: He's got a tremendous story too, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, he's a great--
Speaker 1: From the--
Speaker 2: Well, I talked to Kermit three weeks ago.
Speaker 1: He had that, that incident with the punch, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I interviewed Rudy Tomjanovich.  And, in those days when all that happened, you could actually fight in the NBA.  See, Sam Jones is another good friend of mine, he's my fraternity brother.  We talk all the time.  And, Sam tells me about the time he picked up a chair to hit Wilt Chamberlain (laughter), and nobody got thrown out of the game.  So, you know, at that time it was different.  And, knowing Kermit, Kermit was a rugged player.  But, Kermit wasn't a cheap shot artist.  Rudy came up behind him to be a peacemaker.  And, Kermit didn't know what, what was going on; he turned around, and he swung.  And I mean, he just caved his face in.  And, that was just the way it was, man.  And, Kermit's been treated like a dog ever since.  Can't get a job.  Can't get anything in the league.  But, Kermit is a humanitarian.  He does a lot of work in Africa; building schools and all kind of stuff out there, man.  He's a great person.  He's a guy that's worthy of The HistoryMakers.  He's something else.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I think, I think you're right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's, he lives out in Loudoun County, Virginia; he and his wife [Patricia Washington].  And, he's a good man.
Speaker 1: So, this is the, this is like a--
Speaker 2: This area?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like a crucible for a sports town, isn't it?
Speaker 2: You'd be surprised (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're talking about a lot of--
Speaker 2: --at the people that come from D.C.  You look around, you know, that's where Duke Ellington is from D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Story_ID: 610421
Speaker 1: And you said your best friend in high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.] was Reggie Rucker?
Speaker 2: Was Reggie Rucker.
Speaker 1: Wide receiver for the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, man, my main man was Reggie Rucker.
Speaker 1: --New England Patriots, and the Cleveland Browns, and, yeah.
Speaker 2: Reggie Rucker was a smart guy, man.  Poor as a church mouse, poor.  He--I was honored to go to Canton [Ohio].  The mayor have him a day.  One of the Hall of Fame groups was up in there.  Reggie's not in the Hall of Fame [Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton, Ohio] but his numbers are pretty good (laughter), you know.  But, he'll never get chosen.  And, but, he's my buddy.  And, we met, and he lived in the projects, and I lived in the apartments down here in Southeast [Washington, D.C.] and he lived on the other side of Southeast, a place they call Simple City (laughter), which is Benning Terrace [Washington, D.C.].  And, we met.  And, at first we didn't hit it off 'cause Reggie was a smart, good looking, arrogant dude, man, and nobody knew he was poor.  Until I look at his shoes in the tenth grade and he had the same ones on in the twelfth grade (laughter).  What a guy; straight A student; had over 1200 SAT score, out of the hood; smart; got accepted to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] on an academic scholarship.  He was my buddy, man.  And, Dave Brown [David Brown], and Dr. Jesse Chase [ph.] helped get him in to Boston University.  He played four major sports a BU; baseball, football, basketball, and ran indoor track.  Never ran track in his life, just went out there.  Great athlete.  Hit the longest homerun ever hit by a freshman.  And, ran the first punt he ever touched against Bucknell [Bucknell University, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania].  He went sixty-five yards.  He just was just--graduated in four years.  Got the top award at Boston University.  Don't tell me you can't come from the neighborhood and not do what you need to do.  Why?  He had drug addict brothers.  He got a brother that's in prison for life for first degree murder.  His mom, rest her soul, just beautiful as she can be, had different fathers for the kids.  How come he made it and nobody else made it?  Unbelievable, unreal.  James Brown came from the neighborhood too, same thing.  Good parents, his mother [Mary Ann Brown] was beautiful person and had good family.
Speaker 1: This is the sportscaster, James Brown (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but some of the people--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, he had, you know, he had some, he had some strings out there, man.  Here's a man that took five buses to go to high school, man.  He went to DeMatha Catholic [DeMatha Catholic High School, Hyattsville, Maryland].  He should've went to public school; but, nah.  He could've went anywhere he wanted to.  This man had a 1480 SAT, out the projects.  What--where is that coming from, you know?  I've noticed that the kids I work with, they're smart too.  But they think that education is gonna grab 'em around the throat and choke 'em to death, and shake 'em.  It's not that bad.  But, the teachers have to convey to these kids, "It ain't gonna hurt you."  They need to take away and A's and the Bs and Cs and the Fs and just work on people getting some knowledge.  You know grades are a way to judge people.  And, they are scared of the grades, man.  Nobody should flunk in high school, nobody.  Only way you flunk is if you don't show up.  You should never fail.  Nobody should ever fail.  Nobody runs the world by themselves.
Story_ID: 610422
Speaker 1: Now, how did you do in, in high school?
Speaker 2: I was horrible.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a horrible student.  Not because I was dumb.  My, my first wife, by the way I've gotten three of 'em.  But, I stuck around a long time, eighteen years; thirteen years, and my current wife, who's not with me now, been with her ten years.  I've been married all my life.  My wife, my first wife looked at my report card and she was a 160 IQ person, graduated from McKinley High School [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.], and went on and finally got her degree at fifty-seven years old, fifty-eight, brilliant.  She's a--you know, she goes overseas now.  She's a Mother Teresa type person.  And, I remember when she wasn't Mother Teresa.  But, you know, she a--but, she was always an excellent student.  She said, "Your report card--do not ever let your children see this.  This is terrible."  I was.  In my senior years, I finally dug myself out of the grave and got Cs.  And--
Speaker 1: So, did you play high school sports?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Big time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --star, big time.
Speaker 1: So, did you play all the sports?
Speaker 2: I played baseball, football, and I was--basketball in the tenth grade; couldn't play everything 'cause I'm try to--I didn't wanna flunk off the team.  When I went to Anacostia [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.], I transferred from Ballou High School [Frank W. Ballou Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  Ballou and Anacostia in those days was the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] of Southeast [Washington, D.C.].  It was rough.  And, then we went to school during the track system, man.  You know, you had honors, college prep, and business.  If you were under that, you were in remedial.  And, you were stuck in--the racist thing about it, is that you couldn't get out of remedial, even if you found yourself, they wouldn't let you get out.  Believe me, it was--I didn't realize it was racist until I was thirty-five years old.  I didn't get it yet.  I didn't have any education like that yet.  But, I start understanding things later on, and said, "Oh, I see."  But, the way the schools are today and most public schools, I hate to say it, but it's true, they made--they need to go back to the track system so that kids will feel more comfortable with people of their own, you know, if you're in, if you're in remedial, if one can't read, the other one can't read.  So, we need to help them, develop them, get 'em along.  And, then if they get good enough, let's slide 'em outta there, you know.  But, let's give everybody an opportunity to see where they are.  Because a lot of kids get intimidated by kids that are smarter than they are.
Speaker 1: Now, did you actually know you were in remedial, I mean, did you know--
Speaker 2: No.  I wasn't in remedial.  I was in college prep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And, then got out of college prep into the business thing, where you took typing and all that stuff.  Scared to death.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you weren't stuck in that--?
Speaker 2: Nah, nah.  Well, I got my--well, I was taking twelfth grade courses in the tenth grade.  I was taking twelfth grade courses in eleventh grade.  I didn't know that was what it was; I didn't know.  I didn't know they had me--I didn't know where I was.  I didn't have a clue.  I'm just going to school.

Speaker 1: All I knew was that you had to have decent grades to play sports.  And, I never flunked nothing (laughter).  So, I always got over because I wanted to play.  And, Dave Brown [David Brown] was all about education.  Even though my grades weren't great, but that was what he was about.  "No son," he would always say, "no, no son.  You gotta study."  I was a red shirt.  When I came from Ballou High School [Frank W. Ballou Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] to Anacostia [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.], he would not let me play in 1963, wouldn't let me play.  He said, "No, no son, you're not gonna flunk outta here.  We're not gonna let you just flunk out."  But, we--but everybody knew who I was; big time [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris, the big catcher coming in.  We had some great players; Joe Stovie [ph.], Jimmy Jenkins [James Jenkins].  All those guys were great players that nobody never knows about in the world but me.  I mean, because they were area start in those days.  When I came over, "Oh, god, man, Glenn Harris is coming to Anacostia."  I was a phenom catcher, man.  I mean, I was doing the Johnny Bench thing.  I was framing pitches.  I could do the one hand.  I could do this; I could--I was doing stuff that youngsters wasn't doing behind the plate.  I played with and against some good players.  But, I was a pretty good catcher.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Pretty good catcher.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was, I was--
Speaker 2: That was your strength with baseball--
Speaker 1: I was ahead--
Speaker 2: Was a--?
Speaker 1: Baseball was--but, I averaged eleven tackles a game in football.  You know, I was outside linebacker.  But, I was just playing football for fun.  Matter of fact, I went out for a team, I was a starting linebacker and a third string center.  And, and I went out and I said, "Coach Brown, can I go play--can I come out for the football team?"  Just for something to do.  And, he was always, Mr. Brown was, this guy was the Ben Franklin [Benjamin Franklin] of, of words.  Son--he, "Son use your head for more than a hat rack," okay.  Now, those kind of things, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He had a saying for everything.
Speaker 1: Everything, everything.  And, I used to look at the board every day.  We had over a hundred fifty people come out for baseball in a public school; this was big time.  I used to look at the board.  They say, "What you looking at the board for, you know you're on the team?"  I said, "Dave Brown is coaching the team, are you crazy?  No, baby.  Let me see where I am, man.  I hope my name still on the board."  As long as your name is on the board, you in there.  I was, you know, I mean, we respected him so much, never raised his voice, a la Lovie Smith, and Tony Dungy, never raised his voice.  Always called you by your last name.  Never by your first name.  If you got the first name status, you were in heaven.  I got the first name status.  Glenn, oh, Reggie, Reggie Rucker, Quintin for Quintin Robinson [ph.], Teddy for Teddy Markopoulos [ph.]; the big four.  He said, "Man, go talk to your daddy, man.  That's your surrogate daddy, go talk to him."  He didn't call nobody by no first name.  It was always, "Harris, Rucker, all right let's go son.  Let's get going son.  Son, you late for my class?"  "Oh, no.  Dave Brown, we weren't late for no class."  Oh, no way, unh-uh.  I'd never forget one year we worked on the swing pass and we were playing Eastern High School [Washington, D.C.].  In those day, Eastern was huge, big time, big time.  I'm outside linebacker and I learned that today, you never over pursue.  You wait, as a weak side linebacker, you wait and you make your pursuit angle when that guy crosses the scrimmage line.  I learned that in high school.  Never made a mistake again.  He told me, "They have this reverse."  It was just simple reverse, which teams do today.  What they did, the quarterback would go to the right and the end would come around, he'd flip him the ball and he'd run.  And, what I did, I got caught in the flow, which Dave Brown would always say, "Linebackers don't get caught in the flow."  I knifed in, because my eyes got wide, I'm a make a tackle.  (Snaps fingers) There go the guy.  I just said, "See ya later," (laughter).  Dave, I knew I made a mistake.  He called me to the sideline, you never want--you didn't even wanna look Coach Brown in the eye.  That's how much you respected him.  He said, "Harris, what I tell you son?  What did we work on all week?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  "Next time they do that, make the tackle."  And, I did.  The next time we played Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], he said, "Next time he throw it over there, pick it off and go for a touchdown." (Snaps fingers) Boom, picked it off, went sixty-two yards.

Speaker 1: I mean, things like that in your life, man, you pick up and you use 'em in your everyday life, because sports is life.  My wife used to always get mad 'cause they weren't sports people.  My wives weren't sports--why is everything gotta be a baseball situation?  'Cause it is three and two.  It's always in the ninth ending.  You're always at the free throw line hitting--'cause if you make this shot, there's a decision to be made.  If you miss it, you got another consequence on your hand.  But, want's wrong with that?  Why don't you use your metaphors in other ways, you know?  I never cared about anything anybody did their way.  Even if it was kind of annoying.  It's their way of doing it.  That's where, as I got older, I got better because the more I understood, the better person I became inside.  We don't get it in life until we're forty years old, man.  We have wasted so much time with bullshit that we just don't get it.  Because that's what we've been raised on, bullshit.  Lies, myths, misdirections, misnomers, a bunch of crazy magic things that we wait on.  Now, I believe in karma.  I do.  I really believe that there is some magic in karma.  But, not Houdini [Harry Houdini] stuff.  Whoop, there it is.  Those are tricks, you know.  It's good because a person is skilled that way, but in life we take everything so literal.  We got people killing themselves because, "Well if God wants me to die, I'm a die."  No, you keep drinking that liquor, you're going to die.  If you walk out in front of the street and a car is coming, it's going to be your time when a Mack truck runs you over.  When Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris] goes across the street, nothing is coming.  You can't get buy nothing.  If I die, it'll be because I had a stroke or a heart attack because I was sick already anyway (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, people often ask like why is sports important and I think you were touching upon something here that, it offers some sort of a al- it's something that's real on a level but it's not, it's not, you know, life or death, but it's, it's a, something that has consequences.
Speaker 1: It was real.
Speaker 2: I mean, if you do this, this'll happen and--
Speaker 1: You notice your best administrator were ex-jocks because they know how to win and lose, you know.  Nobody wants to lose, but you're going to lose without a doubt.  Matter fact, I encourage some failure.  It makes you a better person.  It's not whether you're gonna have turmoil in your life, it's how you're gonna handle the turmoil, you know.  You know, turmoil?  Please.  You gonna have that every day.  You ever see the commercial where the guys try to get the perfect date?  And, they, "You think I, you think I could marry, the person to marry, you're looking at her like this.  Oh, no this is a bad date here," you know.  Or, one person saying, "Well, you didn't look like your pictures," and all that kind of stuff.  All that crazy stuff.  That's--their brain is so convoluted with a whole lot of preservatives, that that's what they do.  I don't expect anything from anybody but respect.  You know, we, we got people so screwed up, they can't even go out on one date; one date.  How could you screw up one evening when all you gotta do is sit down, get something to eat, get a drink if you drink, or whatever you do, and go home.  If it's good enough, you hope they go home with you.  But, they may not.  Okay, see ya.  Hey, we had a nice time, me and Suzy, or whatever name we got.  I mean, what, what's the hard deal about going on one date?  It's nothing.  It ain't like we getting married.  It's not like I have to know you all of that, we're going out on a date; doing to movies.  We ain't gotta hold hands.  We just be companions for a minute.  It's okay.  But, people are so busy--have you ever seen these date shows, man?  They sit down and talk, and people are screwed up, one date.
Speaker 2: This is true.  But--
Speaker 1: All you gotta do is listen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Let's, now--
Speaker 1: Go ahead, I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)when you were, yeah.
Speaker 1: --getting off the subject again.
Speaker 2: But, that's okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going crazy, again.
Story_ID: 610425
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.], were your--did you have expectations of, of college or what college you were going to go to?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't.  You know, you, as you take these pictures around, you'll see my football picture up there from high school.  I was a hundred ninety-five pounds, had big thick legs, didn't have a big upper body like I got now 'cause I never lifted any weights.  No of us lifted any as a matter of fact.  But, I was naturally, for the time, I was an old rail, 'bout six feet tall, rail thin.  They thought I was think, but I really wasn't thin for the times.  I was one hundred eighty-five pounds, one hundred ninety pounds, that's a good high school linebacker because one year later, I was two hundred fifteen pounds, you know.  So, I had the frame.  I had big bones and a frame.  But, I don't think I had any grades.  I didn't even take the SAT until later on and I got a lousy SAT score.  I didn't know anything.  I didn't ask any questions.  I didn't know about any scholarships.  It was a time where, if you didn't think about going to college, man, you went to Vietnam.  You got drafted, you went in the [U.S.] military, you married your childhood sweetheart which was the up to date thing to do, and you went to the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] (laughter).  That was your job.  And, you stayed on post office 'til you was--forty years, and then you got good benefits and, or you was a GS-1 and now you end up being a GS-15, and you're out, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there any pro baseball scouts looking at you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, they considered me a banjo hitter.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: Didn't hit for, didn't hit for any power, I spread the ball around a little bit, you know.  Not, not a power hitter in those days.  If you were black, you better be a power hitter.  Or, you better hit, you better--you know I played against a guy name Chuck Vinson [Charlie Vinson], who played against us in high school.  He was hitting golf balls outta there, you know what I mean.  He played fifteen years in pro ball, came up to the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball] a half a year.  So, I see him now, and he's so disappointed.  All of his boys played in the big leagues.  My friend Jimmy Williams, Vince Colbert, pitched for the Cleveland Indians.  Matter fact, he works at Cleveland State [Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio] now.  Another guy I played against in high school, first black athlete to play at East Carolina [East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina].  My boy, Jim Williams; great player, fifteen years of pro ball, played in Tokyo [Japan], played eight years in AAA, no free agency then, you had to stay on a club.  He was with Gary Matthews, Willie Mays, all those--he could never go anywhere.
Story_ID: 610426
Speaker 1: You said, scouts were, they were looking at you, but--?
Speaker 2: Scouts started looking at me when I got--later on, you know, later on.  And, I started growing.  I stop pulling the ball, all that.  Pittsburgh Pirates were interest in me.  Joe Consoli and he was one of the chief scouts.  And, he start- he's dead now.  Syd Thrift who was a general manager in the big leagues [Major League Baseball].  Consoli wanted to sign me, Thrift didn't.  So, you know, Thrift was the big boy so, they didn't sign me.  The Cleveland Indians were interested in me.  Frank Sansausie [ph.] was chief scout then at that time, or one of the scouts for the Indians.  They were interest.  Matter of fact, I caught batting practice one night for the Cleveland Indians at RFK Stadium [Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium] here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  It was called D.C. Stadium [District of Columbia Stadium] then.  And, they were interest.  But, I played on a top notch amateur baseball team which would be considered the Negro Leagues back in the day.  But, the Washington Black Sox was big time here.  You played with the Washington Black Sox, you were a stud.  And, their coach's name was Dobie Jones [sic. William Jones].
Speaker 1: Now, this is while you're high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No.  I was--I came out--I was, I didn't play with the Black Sox 'til nineteen sixty--1966.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a rookie in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had all these ex-minor league players big time.  And, that's when the scouts looked at me and they liked me.  But, I was a belligerent person, man.  I, I always thought, if you came to practice every day, and you worked hard, and you made a position, that you got to play.  I learned different.  In the adult world, it was about favoritism.  And, that's cool 'cause I learned myself, later on.  If I like you and you're good, you're gonna play in front of somebody else or whatever.  That happened to me and I didn't like it.
Speaker 1: Now, that's one of the most puzzling things about sports as a, as an observer or a fan, like watching teams, and you know sometime guys are play because they must be the favorite 'cause that other guy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is better than they are.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And, I've seen it from high school all the way--
Speaker 2: Well, Coach Jones, you know, he was born 1912, '13 [1913], '14 [1914], or whatever, in 1920.  And, he told the scouts, when the scouts were interested in signing me, and he knew where all the black talent was in D.C.  And, he didn't give me a good, a good send off, man.  So, they, they said, "Well, if Jones says that he's gonna be a problem then we're not gonna sign 'em."  So, they didn't sign me.  I begged him to let me go.  "Man, I don't know what you gonna do youngster.  You might cuss one of them guys out."  "What?"  I'm nineteen.  But, see again, I wasn't cursing anybody out.  What it was, is that I was smarter than he was.  I could hold conversations with people.  So, my friend Lionel Stevens [ph.] who was a college grad and a great baseball player and Bobby Harrison [ph.], rest his soul, he's dead now, they were the two guys that always talk to me.  They always used to put their hand on me, "Calm down, it's okay man, just let it go," you know.  So, I never did get to sign early.  But, the good thing about was that I glad I didn't sign.  I'd never graduated from college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I would've never gone on to the, to the business I'm in now, which is communications.  I could've been released early.  I wouldn't've had anywhere to go.  I couldn't've played college baseball.  So, it was good.
Story_ID: 610427
Speaker 1: How did you get to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  I mean, what happened with that story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's another story (laughter).  I would've went--
Speaker 1: What happened when you graduated?  You graduated in high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.] in '65 [1965], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Had no clue what I was gonna do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got a job.  I was a correctional officer in the prison for a couple years?
Speaker 1: This is right out of high school?
Speaker 2: Pretty close.  I took the police exam.  I passed it by one point.  And, was going to the police academy.  Flip a coin, man, I was doing--went to prep school for one week, and left there; went to junior college in Miami [Florida] with my intention to go to University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida]; had people, mentors write letters for me.  Man, I, I said, "I have no skill.  I'm an athlete.  What am I gonna do?"  I don't what to do.  I don't know what job to do.  I ain't know anything about any jobs.  I was a fidgety person so I didn't wanna sit in anybody's office.  I didn't like dressing up.  So, I went away to junior college.  I went to Miami-Dade Junior College, North Campus, Dade County, Florida [Miami-Dade College].  Right in the heart of Miami.  First person I met was a guy name Mickey Rivers (laughter).  Twenty-five years in the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball].  Eventually, he was just Mickey Rivers then, who was a big time baseball prospect who could run like the wind.  And, Mickey set it up where I could stay at his sister's house 'cause I had nowhere to stay when I went down there.  Then, I moved to the Northview country club apartments [Northview Apartments] in North Miami [Florida].  And, I was the only brother there; light skinned brother.  First brother ever there, ever (laughter).  A big ol' white boy beat me up from Tampa (laughter).  I hung on to him tough.  First time I ever got called a nigger; first time.  I said, "How you know I'm black, boy?"  (Laughter) He--we, we ended up being friends.  But, I mean, what do he know, he's from Tampa, Florida, 1960 something, please.  He only said what he knew.  I forgave him, you know, I wasn't all mad at him or nothing.  But, I held on to him though.  He a big boy, 'bout 6'5", 260 pounds (laughter), you know.  I was like the king of my room, man.
Story_ID: 610428
Speaker 1: My roommates from New York City [New York, New York], Vinnie Faleeka [ph.], Ronnie Burke [ph.], and Ronald Reek [ph.].  I'll never forget those names.  It was a long time ago.  And it's funny 'cause, Flaleeka was an old slick kid, Italian from New York.  He brought his GTO [Pontiac GTO] down there.  Remember the goat?  He rode around in his little white shoes, and slick hair back.  He looking like something from the '50s [1950s].  But, he was a little younger than me; about three years.  Ronnie Burke was nice Jewish kid, from New York.  "Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris], Vinnie, man, man he took some of your food, man.  You shouldn't let 'em do that, man," you know, that was Vinnie.  That was, that was Ronnie Burke.  And, Ronald Reek was from Binghamton, New York.  Had never seen a light skinned black person in his life; straight as an arrow.  I straighten all of 'em out.  They cried like babies when I left.  They did.  I've always thought that I could always put something in people's lives, you know.  I never was, I never felt for any kind of okey doke; well, I have.  But, I mean, I always understood what I was doing at the end of it.  I always tell kids, "Whatever you do, learn a lesson from it."  And, I've always learned lessons.  Now, whether I, whether I made anything out of myself because of the lessons, that's another story.  I never cap--
Speaker 2: Now what's the story (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah--huh?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) the story (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, you know, I don't know if I ever learned anything from some of the stupid mistakes I made, you know.  I just know I don't take a lot of chances because I know chances can get you killed and hurt you.  So, I'm a look out for me, you know.  I'm just not diving off into some waters when they're shark infested waters, to say I did it ten years later.  "Yeah, man, I jump in that water," unh-uh.  "Is any sharks in there?"  "Nah, man, no sharks around here."  "Okay, good then I'll jump in there 'cause I can swim."  I'm a ghetto swimmer.  I know who to get out the water.  So, I don't take a lot of chances.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you're in Miami-Dade Junior College [Miami-Dade College, Miami, Florida]--
Speaker 1: I'm in Miami-Dade, yeah, well, how did we get to the shark waters (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is nineteen sixty--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Well, that was--
Speaker 2: --six [1966]?  This '66 [1966]?
Speaker 1: No.  It wasn't '66 [1966], it was sixty--may- it might be '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967], okay.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is after--
Speaker 1: It's close to '69 [1969], I'll say.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in 1970.
Story_ID: 610429
Speaker 1: Okay you, you already had play for the Washington Black Sox?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had played for the Black Sox.  I went down to Miami-Dade [Miami-Dade Junior College; Miami-Dade College, Miami, Florida].  They had a tremendous baseball program.  Matter of fact, we had eleven players sign off that team.  Three of 'em went to the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball].  Mike--Ray Bare, Mickey Rivers, and Glenn Borgmann.  Borgmann could not out catch me; could not out catch me.  Not that he was a bad catcher but he didn't have the skills I had.  When they first saw me behind the plate, Coach Mitchell [Nelly Mitchell (ph.)] said, "Yeah.  Yeah, that's what we're looking for back there; quickness, blocking pitchers, framing, know how to handle pitches."  But, again, I was from D.C. [Washington, D.C.], man.  I was kind of a, you know, when we were running laps I talk clap it up.  But, I didn't then, I didn't really understand racism.  I didn't, I really didn't.  I'm in Miami [Florida] and Mickey Rivers was the first one to tell me, "Man, they ain't gonna let you catch down here."  "What?  What you mean I ain't gonna catch?"   "This man ain't gonna let no black man catch down here."  "They won't?"  I'm so green.  I'm from D.C. now, even though there's a lot of racism in D.C. but I didn't know it 'cause I really didn't know.  I went to school with white kids at Anacostia [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.], blue collar white kids and we just was cool, you know, with each other.
Speaker 1: Now, is it because of the leadership position a catcher has (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know when we looked--
Speaker 2: No question.
Speaker 1: --at the history of baseball--
Speaker 2: Ain't no, wasn't no whole lot of black catcher.
Speaker 1: When you look back, I guess, in the early '50s [1950s], we had like--
Speaker 2: Campanella [Roy Campanella].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Campanella, and Elston Howard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, then I can think of any others.
Speaker 2: Earl Battey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, there're very few.
Speaker 2: Paul Casanova came here in the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, he caught.  That was it, man, wasn't no whole lot of catchers.
Speaker 1: About four.  That's four, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, you didn't see--
Speaker 1: And, pitchers too.  You don't, in the early days you had, you had some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not that many.
Speaker 1: But then all of a sudden it thinned out to--
Speaker 2: You right.  In the Major Leagues--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You're right.  Right.  You exactly right.
Speaker 1: Played the outfield.
Speaker 2: Played the outfield--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they, you know, home run hitters that's what they said they were, home run hitters.  You know, then McCovey [Willie McCovey], Bill Williams [HistoryMaker Billy Williams] the first base.  But it wasn't no whole lot, you know, no, no, no, no.  Isn't it embarrassing, man?  Isn't that ridiculous and embarrassing?  I can catch like the white boys, man.  I caught like Sherman Lollar [Sherm Lollar].  I caught like Andy Etchebarren.  I had all those skills behind the plate, man.  Didn't have the strongest arm but I could catch with all of 'em.  Had a good arm, not a strong--I mean, my arm could've been--I didn't have a gun like Johnny Bench.  But, then Johnny Bench's hands were two of mine put together.  He just, whoop (gesture), you know.
Story_ID: 610430
Speaker 1: So at Dade, now you were there--
Speaker 2: Miami-Dade [Miami-Dade Junior College; Miami-Dade College, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: You were there 'til '69 [1969] and then how did you--?
Speaker 2: I would say '68 [1968], '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had never been on a third team in my life.  I was a third string catcher.  I was like, whoa!  But, they had ten infields, man, you could get cut in one day.  That's how tough it was.  So, okay, let me get this.  So, I grabbed the first baseman mitt.  I said, "Coach I could go down to first base and shag something a little bit."  Never played first base in my life.  Moved up from third team to second team first baseman.  So, they told me--we had a coach, Italian guy out of Massachusetts, Tony Simone.  Boy, he was a jerk, at that time anyway.  He probably a nice guy now.  The coach's name was Demie Mainieri; Dr. Demie Mainieri, had a Ph.D., big time coach down there.  He, Charlie Greene [Charlie Greene, Sr.], all those guys were, I mean, it's, they were like the Florida State [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida] of junior colleges, or the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] or you name the top baseball powers in college, they, they filtered them out of them schools into those big schools.  Man, I wanted to go to University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] so bad, man, play baseball, it's big time; big time.  And, I just knew I was gonna be a ballplayer down there.  But, Simone was on my all the time and he could've been hazing me but I didn't get it 'cause it was cruel hazing.  It was, it was rough, you know.  I was trying to eat.  I lost twenty-five pounds.  I wasn't eating well.  Had to go to practice every day.  And, go to class, had early classes; didn't get college right away but I understood that you had to get up and go to class.  I was cool.  I went to class.  And, then we were running the steps one day and I was talking, "Hey, let's go, come on guy."  Said, "We don't do that down here."  I said, "What do ya mean, you don't do that?  You don't talk it up when you running and, 'We don't do that.' What do you mean?"  So, then I was on the S list then.  But, Demie Mainieri, the head coach, liked me.  But, he never came to practice that much.  The assistants ran the practice.  So, Mitchell, Nelly Mitchell [ph.] really like me.  Yeah, he always winked, you know, did that wink, you know, that type of thing; corny but it was back in the day.  So, I'm hitting pretty good.

Speaker 1: Everything you did was game style down there; everything, game style.  Situation, games, games, games.  Mickey Rivers was a star so he was the leadoff hitter for the Miami-Dade ball club [Miami-Dade Junior College; Miami-Dade College, Miami, Florida] and he was a star, he was a star.  He played international baseball when he was thirteen, fourteen years old.  He was just that much ahead of everybody else.  And, he had a cousin named Emmett Law, had an unbelievable bastard curve ball, man.  He could throw that thing up there.  He couldn't break a pane of glass but when he threw that hook at you, you, you was ducking, you were--that thing was good.  He got--ended up getting drafted by the Rangers [Texas Rangers].  But, they released him in a couple of years, he wasn't even no great player.  But, he was Mickey's cousin.  That's cool; got a chance to play.  Emmett was a nice guy, real quiet.  But, they were my friends down there, other than my roommates.  And, Mickey was starting centerfield.  Mickey didn't have a good arm at all but he could, he could rake, and he could run.  He hit a ball in the infield, man, you would rush to throw to first base.  That's how fast he was.  He had already been drafted twice in the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball].  Not no good student or nothing, not a very good student at all but, you know, they looked out for him down there.
Story_ID: 610432
Speaker 1: So, I struck out.  And, you know, we were using wood bats then.  So, I hit the bat, oh man I went back, threw the bat on the rack and Tony Simone say, "Harris [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris] go in, get your gear and go in, son."  I said, "For what?"  I'm tired now.  I'm tired of him being on my back, tired of being hungry.  I'm scuffling.  "What?"  Is this like cable?  Can we say how--what we wanna say, or?
Speaker 2: You can say what you wanna say, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Cool.  All right.  'Cause I'm being nice now anyway.  I said, "Fuck you, Simone."  "That's it Harris go in."  I was the hero on that team.  'Cause nobody--everybody was scared of him.  But, they brought me, and right is right, wrong is wrong.  We sat down in front of the head coach [Demie Mainieri] and I sat there, now my high school team [at Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.] was very good.  I said, "Look, don't tell me I can't make this ball club."  "Glenn, what did you say to Coach Simone?"  So, I wouldn't say nothing.  "Coach Mitchell [Nelly Mitchell (ph.)] were you there?"  Man, Coach Mitchell couldn't lie.  And, I didn't want him to lie.  I look over at him, I said, "Might as well tell 'em what he--what I said."  "He said quote, 'Fuck you, Simone.'"  He said, "You're off the team."  I started crying.  I said, "Man, I gotta go back home and I came down here to make this ball club [at Miami-Dade Junior College; Miami-Dade College, Miami, Florida].  I wanna go to college.  I wanna play ball."  He said, "Yeah, but you can't curse at a coach."  And, he was right, I couldn't.  So, went back home.
Story_ID: 610433
Speaker 1: And, Howard University [Washington, D.C.] jumped on me, man, like, they was like, pounce.  Baseball was, you know, they don't play baseball anymore at Howard.  But, it was big, sorta big.  They played in the CIAA conference [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association].  They hadn't been Division I yet.  "[HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris is back from down at college, man, he back.  Go get 'em."  So, American University [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Really, did you know anybody at Howard then?  I mean, did you--
Speaker 1: I didn't know nobody at Howard.
Speaker 2: And, they just--?
Speaker 1: They just, they heard about me.  "I can--Glenn Harris is back home."  Dr. Arnold McKnight, who's still a friend of mine, offered me a full ride to Howard; sight unseen.  Never saw me play, all he did was hear about me.  I was gonna go to American University because I was so stupid.  My brother [Ronald Harris] who graduated from GW [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], he said, "Why are you trying to go to American University when Howard is offering you a full ride?  And, AU is offering you a partial."  Cause I had this white/black school thing in my mind.  I was so stupid and so ignorant, I didn't know any better.  "I ain't going to Howard."  He said, "What do you mean, you're not going to Howard?  Go to Howard, man.  It's, it's a good school.  You'll graduate, you're gonna be there--you'll be all right."  He graduated from GW.  My brother has no ties to GW, except for a couple of his ex-teammates.  I went to Howard.  But, I didn't know that Dr. McKnight's cousin worked in the admissions office at American University.  He had set it up so she could turn me down (laughter).  So, I could come to Howard.  So, I got into Howard.  But, my SAT scores weren't good.  So, what you had to take in those days was a big test; a written exam.  And, they was right up my alley then.  'Cause I could write and talk and all that stuff; didn't know I could do all that.  So, in some schools what they do is if you don't pass your entrance exam, you take remedial stuff until you work your way up.  So, in other words, I would've been taken courses had I been remedial and then--'cause I hadn't been to high school in five years.  So, a lot of stuff was new to me; English, oh, I was struggling, man.  But, I didn't flunk it.  I took the exam with the five hundred word essay and smoked it.  I got in there man (laughter).  I got into Howard I was like, "Okay."  'Cause see Howard wasn't letting anybody in.  Howard was upscale, elite, and it was, but, it was during the Vietnam War and they were letting people get second chances.

Speaker 1: From '70 [1970] to '74 [1974] to almost, almost 1980, Howard University [Washington, D.C.], man, was Dodge City, man.  It was some of the great, intellectual minds up there, man.  Teachers, white teacher, black teachers; see, I didn't even really know the history of Howard.  Howard University was founded by Andrew Jackson [sic.] really.  Not, Oliver O. Howard.  He gave the school, the university to a--Oliver O. Howard was liberal in his, in those days and he had fathered some children too that looked kind of redbone like me.  So, Howard University was really opened up for preachers, and their kids, you know, ministers and all that, and of course, everything evolved later on.  But, Howard University's administration was all white until the '20s [1920s], you see.  So, the professional schools at Howard University have always been pretty much white; med schools, law schools, all that, until later on.  And, of course, Howard was into the elite bag of historically black college and universities [HBCUs] because guys like me and you, light skinned guys could get in.  If you were dark, you had a hard time getting in.  So, was Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], the same way, you know.  It was one of these elite schools and of course, in those days with that kind of mentality they wanted you, the paper bag, they called it the paper bag, you know, test.  If you looked as light as a paper bag, you could get in.  What kind of ignorance was that?  These are educators talking like this.  Okay.  So, I did my history.  'Cause I ain't gonna be nowhere where I don't know no history.
Story_ID: 610435
Speaker 1: So, Howard University 1867 [sic. 1967], that's the place I went, man.  I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  It was a revolutionary period after 1968, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], and them had been on campus.  The riots; not really riots, but just take overs and all that.  So, we came in during a revolutionary period.  Howard was very liberal.  Dr. James Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek] was walking around with dashikis and all that stuff on; brilliant man, didn't really get to know me 'til after my senior year.  But, baseball was big on the map then, baby.  Me, Rock Newman, Bobby Woodland [Robert Woodland] and Bush White [Curtis "Butch" White].  They said, "Oops, I'm getting ready to turn the corner."  So, we play Division II the first year.  And, then Chuck Hinton came on campus, we became D I.  Played in our first fall league and all that mess, man.  We--
Speaker 2: So, now, so you went Division I?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, D I, yeah.
Speaker 2: Baseball, now that's a big deal (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Matter of fact, Howard University was D I 1970; Division One.  We're like a mid-major Division I of the Ohio States [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and all that, they were the major-majors, all the big money and stuff.  Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical university, Tallahassee, Florida]--
Speaker 2: So, you were--you were comparable to the most of the mid-size state school--
Speaker 1: Sure.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --like Ohio University [Athens, Ohio] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, right.  In Athens [Ohio].
Speaker 2: --Marshall [Marshall University, Huntington, West Virginia]--
Speaker 1: Marshall--yeah, and, Athens--
Speaker 2: --or, those--
Speaker 1: Marshall, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, those kind of--
Speaker 1: Now, those schools, East Carolina [East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina], Marshall, Boise State [Boise State College; Boise State University, Boise, Idaho].  I remember when Boise State was two year school.  All these schools start progressing and now they were major D I schools now.  Because of their administration and whatever their administration wants to do, they could do.  Howard University of course, gets money from the government, which was a mandate for them to get money because of their, you know, their vision about teaching minority students.  So, they, they get money now.  Matter of fact, Howard University--it's only one other or two other schools that get more money than Howard.  John Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] is one of 'em.  And of course, Howard has one of the finest medical schools, law schools, anywhere.  So, you know, and regardless of what anybody says, and of course a lot people say what they want, you most definitely will get a hardcore education at HU.  And, when you finish those 117 hours or whatever they are, you will have lost a patch of hair, 'cause it ain't no joke.  And, their graduate schools, you know most graduate schools are just research, sit down, and talk about some things, go to your advisors, projects, papers; not at HU, baby.  You at Howard University you will do, you will do hard work in graduate school, graduate school, you--it's almost like working in undergrad.  (Laughter) I don't know why, but that's the way it is, so.
Story_ID: 610436
Speaker 1: So, what was your major [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  Now, here you are, you--?
Speaker 2: My major was physical education.  And, then I changed over to urban recreation administration, which is what I do now all, you know, on the side of my broadcasting career.  I'm manager, or co-manager a department in the department of recreation and parks [D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation].  See, recreation is not--no longer recreation now.   It's only for the kids rath- when you work in recreation, it is a business now.  It's a corporate business.  You're setting up--let's put it like this.  Whoever set up Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida] had something to do with leisure studies.  Had something to do with recreation and parks, had to.  So, when people are making fun of those things, which they do.  "Ha, ha, ha physical educations."  Yeah, well, let me see you take gross anatomy and physiology and stat [statistics], let me see how you do in the classroom, since you so damn smart.  Since you think your father or mother sent you, "Oh, I'm gonna be a lawyer."  Yeah, and you end up diving off the dorm window and killing yourself because you gotta (laughter), you know, 'cause, 'cause you didn't get the 3.0 [grade point average] that your daddy wanted you to get, 'cause he was an attorney.  Give me a break.  That's why they had majors, there's always something theo- there's theoretical--everything has theory to it, everything, you know.  The camera I'm looking at, the pen you're using; somebody had to put it together.  And, whatever you think that major was that, you know, the major that didn't mean anything to you, yeah, okay.  Well, if you're a psychologist since you're so cute, see if you get a job unless you get a Ph.D. (laughter).  So, you'll be in school the rest of your life taking these so called status majors that you really don't like.  Now, if you like it and you have passion for that major, go for it.  But, don't take it 'cause your daddy took it.  Or, don't take 'cause your mom's a psychologist and you don't really wanna be one.  That's what half of college is anyway; especially, the Harvards [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yales [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], the MITs [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, the Stanfords [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  It's all family lineage.  You go in there and, "Dad went to Stanford.  I really didn't wanna go there.  I kind of wanted to go to Cal Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  Or, I kind of wanted to go to Pepperdine [Pepperdine University, Malibu, California].  But, I didn't--I don't know, I gotta go where dad's want me to go."  Yeah, 'cause dad's probably paying, you know.  Again, bullshit, you know.  We don't do what we like to do, we do what other's like us to do.  Then finally, when we get forty-five or fifty, when our damn life is halfway over, then we start saying, "Damn, I wish I hadn't done that, man.  I wish I hadn't married her, because mom and dad wanted me to marry her."  Man, we ain't--we, we've been puppets most of our life.  So, when you're thinking out of the box then you're an a-hole to somebody, you know.  You really, "Oh, now, he's got a bad attitude."  Not really.  He's thinking for himself.  She's thinking for herself.
Story_ID: 610437
Speaker 1: You mentioned the all-star group of scholars at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in those days, and who--
Speaker 2: The names (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) who were some of the teachers that you had that you--that really impressed you?
Speaker 2: At Howard?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Two teachers; Suzanne Saul, and the other, and the other teacher's name was Sidwell [Rolin Sidwell], and I can't think of his first name.  I call 'em Bonnie and Clyde.  Boy, they were great; humanities teachers.  She was really good.  They were two white teachers at Howard.  Another one was Dr. Barnes; Dr. Samuel Barnes.  He was a good one, man.  He was sharp.  And, he was one of the first black naval officers.  Matter of fact, he's got a book out too.  He's dead now, Sam Barnes.  Never say--he was a physical education instructor.  He said, "I don't want anybody saying the word fizz ed in my class."  And, he put the word up on the board, F-I-Z-Z E-D.  There is no such thing as fizz ed.  It's physical education.  We had pride and dignity in physical education, man.  And, if you look at some of these people that have come along today, physical education is not even mandatory in the schools anymore.  That's why our kids are fat and sloppy.  And, when we get in our fifties, we're supposed to be a little fat and sloppy.  But, not when you're seventeen.  Not when you're sixteen.  They got guts hanging all out, man.  They can't walk up the steps because the kids don't wanna take physical education anymore.  You know when you went to junior high school and high school, you stood up in your squads, in your, in your uniform with your high school uniform with your name across it.  And, you, you took physical education.  They got lawyers, man, so fat I don't even know how that he could even get up the steps to the courtroom.  "But, I'm a lawyer.  I passed the bar."  Yeah, but you got about thirty minutes, if you cross them steps again, you gonna be dead 'cause you gonna run outta gas.  We got a rough society man, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A rough, a rough society.
Story_ID: 610438
Speaker 1: I got a lesson too, man, on it--my mother [June Puckett Harris], go back to way back again, Miss Sarah Fox [ph.] was our, she was our babysitter.  You know, back in those days, man, you know, babysitter could hit you.  But, she hit me in the face with a belt and she slapped me, and you know, I guess, I was running my mouth for a youngster.  And, I end up pushing her.  I pushed her.  She was a senior citizen.  I guess she was probably in her early sixties, like I am now.  I thought she was old as I don't know what.  And, I pushed her.  She kept trying to hit me and I kept pushing her.  Finally, it all came down and my mother came home.  And, my mother was a tough rebel.  Chick man, she said, "Miss Sarah, don't you ever hit any of my kids in the face with a belt again.  They got a lot of behind that you can spank with that belt.  You know, I don't mind you spanking 'em.  But, you're not gonna hit my children in the face."  This was in the '50s [1950s], man, with a belt.  Man, I'm like this, "Yeah, mom, way to go, you know."  So, we got home, "As for you, you never hit a grown up.  You never hit a grown person.  One month in the bedroom."  Judge and jury, baby, guilty.  In the room.
Story_ID: 610439
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you want me to finish that mother thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Ma [June Puckett Harris] put me in a room for one month.  And, my father [Pleasant Harris] used to sneak comic books to me.  I don't know if you remember the Rex Allen comic books.  It was a cowboy named Rex Allen.  Pop used to throw me the books in there; threw it.  Never would go against anything Ma said.  If Ma punished us, you had to stay punished.  And, she let me out of that room one month.  I had to come from school, go in the room, sit down, that's it.  Couldn't go anywhere else.  After school, get up--here's the great mom punishments.  "I'm not speaking to you for the rest of the day."  Oh, gosh, I know what that means.  "Ronnie [Ronald Harris] tell your brother to pass me the salt, please."  Psychological mind games, man.  She was great.  She was the greatest.  You couldn't slam the door in our house.  If you slam the door, you had to shut a door twenty-five times, man.  Go out shut a door (unclear).  "Come on Ma."  She was tough, man.  Those were orphanage things that she learned in the orphanage.  When--if you spit, "Oh, you spitting, huh?  Okay.  Go out back and spit until I get tired."  We go, "Come on Ma, we ain't spitting, come on Ma."  "No, you're not supposed to be spitting on the sidewalks."  My mother--another punishment was sit in a chair with no sides to it and just sit there.  Couldn't go to sleep, we fall over.  "Nope, nope, nope, nope get back up, oh, no."  And, then Ma used to do this crap that her stepmother used to do to her.  She would annoy you by putting your finger on you like this, barely touching you, going like, "Come on let's go, let move."  I used to go like this, "Ma, please, don't do that.  Don't do that."  She used to do that.  And, you know how it feels, "You gotta do what's right.  You gotta do the right thing."  And, she would go, "Let's go, come on now, come on."   She used to tell me how her mother used to do that to her.  She said, "I used to go like, mother."  She used to always go, "Mother, don't do that," (laughter).  So, she was funny, man.  She was funny.  If she laughed, we laughed.
Story_ID: 610440
Speaker 1: You know, Bob Hope, Red Skelton, Don Rickles, you know all the comedians of those days, you know, and the half hour shows.  And, you know, the So and So special with Milton Berle and all that; Jackie Gleason, man.  Great time to grow up to know television.  These kids ain't got a clue, man.  They don't know nothing about what's good.  You didn't see many black faces in those days.  So, we learned, still learned that good humor is good humor.  Doesn't make any difference whether black folks do it or not.  'Amos 'n' Andy' was big, back in our day.  But, when you looked at it, we thought it was degrading.  Actually, they were business people.  Calhoun [Algonquin J. Calhoun] was lawyer (laughter) I mean, you know.  I mean, Kingfish [George "Kingfish" Stevens], he was head of the lodge, man, you know.  Andy, his character was a cab driver.  These people were working every day, you know.  No, Andy wasn't doing no work.  I mean, Amos--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Amos was a cab driver, right?
Speaker 1: Amos was working.  Amos was the one working.  Catfish [sic.] talked a lot of trash, but Sapphire [Sapphire Stevens] was a big, is beautiful gem.  But, we made fun of it.  Yeah, Sapphire--it was the way he said it.  But, Sapphire is beautiful name; gorgeous name.  But, when did we know that?  When we got forty.  Man, it's a beautiful name.  So, we made fun of it.  But, now they think it's degrading to see those flicks.  No it isn't.  It's art, man.  It's art.  Art's like people, man, you ain't gotta like it all, it's just different, that's all.  When did I learn that?  Forty something years old; late thirties.  Aw, nah, I was a little ahead of the game, so maybe thirties.  But, I'm serious, man.  We got--I'm disappointed in how we don't catch up, man.  We just don't, we don't get it enough.
Story_ID: 610441
Speaker 1: I know the, I was asking you about the intellectual life at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and I know that Howard, all the major speakers of the early '70s [1970s] were at Howard at one point or another.  Did you catch a lot of them?
Speaker 2: You know what, I didn't stay on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I always caught [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory who is now a very good friend of mine.  Another name for your list if you haven't gotten him yet.  All--Dick Gregory, Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]; I heard Farr- but, I heard Farrakhan--see, I used to work at Howard too.  So, I heard them later on as they came.  But, Dick Gregory was one of the greatest speakers, and Farrakhan, unbelievable, unreal speaker.  I saw Nelson Mandela later on.  But, I was way out of school by that time.  But, Farrakhan, you know, of course, as the white media, (pronunciation) Farrakhan, (laughter).  But, I met Farrakhan.  What a nice guy he was.  They tell me President Bush [President George Walker Bush] is a nice guy.  You know what I mean, on the real tip.  When you talk about sports and all that, not the political thing.  And, the same with--see, my friend Rock Newman knew 'em all.  Bush, (unclear), he sat around with all these guys.  You know, when you've been a--when you been out to Las Vegas [Nevada], you're in sports and this and that, man, he used to, man--even met the pope, you know I mean (laughter).  You know, so, me--when you, when you got money and been places, you see things, you run into a lot of stuff.  And, they, Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] they say was probably one of the nicest guys you ever wanna met.  Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] is a friend of mine; nice guy, you know what I mean.  Got his little flaws, but I mean, on a personal tip, I've actually sat down in rooms with these guys just like we're sitting here now.  We're just sitting around talking about certain things.  I've been on panels.  Jesse called me up because he wanted his son [Yusef Jackson] to be a candidate to buy this Washington Senators [sic. Washington Nationals], you know, the Washington baseball club.  You wanted, he said, he had the money and everything.  His son graduated University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], you know, Phi Beta Kappa whatever, good student, he's in the--now in the [U.S.] Congress and all that.  Called me up and said, "Glenn, this Jesse Jackson."  I was like, "Whoa, you know," (laughter).  I mean, I touched base with so many things.  I've had people say, "Man, what you name calling?"  I said, "Nah, baby, they name calling when they say [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris.  I want you to understand that."  So--
Speaker 1: Let me ask--
Story_ID: 610442
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you.  You just said something I wanna touch on for a second, just briefly.  But, the Washington Senators baseball team, the Major League team here in town--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who was popularized in that movie, 'Damn Yankees'--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was shut do--I mean, it was--they moved to Minnesota [Minnesota Twins], right--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --when you were a kid?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that group did, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did the black community have any--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they--
Speaker 2: --affection for the Senators?
Speaker 1: --yeah.  Yeah, they did.  They did, because that was the only game in town, and you were a baseball fan, you went to the games.  Sure, they had something to say about why ain't no brothers out there.  Chuck Hinton was our hero.  Chuck Hinton played for the Senators.  But, he play for the expansion Senators.  When they left to go to Minnesota, the new Senator team came in.  Chuck Hinton was our hero, man, who ended up being my college coach; who lived in my neighborhood.  He, Bennie Daniels was a black pitcher; Lenny Green, Paul Cas- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, Chuck Hinton--
Speaker 1: --Casanova [Paul Casanova].
Speaker 2: --Chuck Hinton was a coach at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] when you were--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  From--for three years, I played under Chuck.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you all won some championships?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.  Yeah, we won a couple.
Speaker 2: How many times did you win?
Speaker 1: Twice.  We won championship, conference championship, twice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, we thought we were going to the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] as an at large bid.  We're 25-5 one year.  And, we knew we weren't gonna go.  But, this is what got me.  It was all strictly again, racism.  We're small, black college conference, you know, the MEAC, Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.  When Chuck first got there, our first big time game was against University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina].  We knocked them off 6-1.  They ain't never played us again 'til my, my group left.  Howard baseball was the toughest schedule in the whole athletic department.  They played everybody; ACC [Atlantic Coast Conference] teams, everything; Maryland [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland], North Carolina State [North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  You know, we played Georgia Southern [Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, Georgia] our second game of the year.  They were number one in the country.  They beat us 3-2 in the ninth inning.  Controversial play.  Ron Polk was the big coach then.  Coach of the Mississippi State [Mississippi State University, Starkville, Mississippi] now.  Yeah, he cheated us.  That's all right, you know.  We were understanding.  We understood the road.  But, we had a good ball club.  Matter of fact, in our conference, Al Holland, who used to pitch for the Yankees [New York Yankees] and the Phillies [Philadelphia Phillies], he was the start pitcher at North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  Gene Richards, who played fourteen years in the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball] and started in right field for the Padres [San Diego Padres], he played for South Carolina State [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  Donnie Shell who, who should be going to Hall of Fame in football [Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton, Ohio] was the centerfielder for South Carolina State.  Willie Mays Aikens who hit forty homeruns in the Major Leagues, he hit a couple against us too.  And, we didn't have a good conference.  We had four guys go to the majors.  Give me a break, man.  Gene Richards stole sixty-eight bases as a rookie for the California Angels [Los Angeles Angels], I mean, for the San Diego Padres.  Willie Aikens hit thirty-two home runs for the California Angels as a rookie.  Man, give me a break, man, stop it.
Speaker 2: You all had a good conference.
Speaker 1: I mean, stop it.  It was a good--it wasn't no SEC [Southeastern Conference] or ACC but it was a good conference.  And, we deserved, as a D I [Division I] ball club, to get a shot to go to the NCAA.  We won our conference.  It wasn't no automatic bid out of baseball conference.  It is now but it wasn't then.  Chuck Medlar was the, was on the committee.  His team was 17-8, Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].  They got in, we didn't.  I said, "Hell, we could've lost two games and come on home."  Hurt us, man.  We stayed on campus two extra weeks waiting.  And, then they called us and told us we wasn't in there.  But, we had a tough ball club, man.  We didn't have a lot of depth but we were pretty good.  We were a pretty good club.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We could run.  We, we hit and ran--
Story_ID: 610443
Speaker 1: Chuck was so smart.  We did so many smart things, man.  We tore South Carolina [University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina] up one year.  See, we had a bases loaded play where we picked guys off.  And, one of our top pitchers, Steve Powell [ph.], man, he could, we had one of the greatest moves to second base.  We used to pick guys off, man, and they go, "Where'd you learn that?"  I mean, what do you mean, where did you learn it?  Us black folk?  "Well, we were out on the farm and we just start playing baseball.  And, we just learned how to pick y'all off."  'Cause y'all that y'all was so cute that you could--big leagues we were tearing y'all--picked off three guys with the bases loaded with two outs, in the clutch.  Chuck Hinton's a smart man.  Taught us, taught us big league baseball.  Yeah, he as big time, man.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Almost got emotional that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was so, he was so good, you know.  Taught me how to hit with the count.  Taught me when, taught me to know what pitches were coming on certain counts.  That's what baseball is about.  Everybody all, "Baseball is a dull game."  Yeah, if you don't play it, it's dull.  But, when you're at that big league level, baby, it's how easy they play it, man.  They play it so easy.  They so good.  The big time pros, you know how good they are by how easy they play the game.  Football, baseball, basketball, whatever it is, it's how easy they play it.  That's what makes--that's why Tiger Woods is so great.  Plays the game with ease, and he understands the concept of the game.  You ain't playing nobody in golf, you're playing yourself.  You're playing the, you're playing the field, you're playing the, you know, the landscape.  The other guys don't get that yet.  "I'm playing Tiger."  No you're not, you're playing yourself.  Just play the game.  That's why, that's why he's so mentally tough.
Story_ID: 610444
Speaker 1: Tell me, did, were there any of the old Negro League ballplayers that were part of the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], were any of them part of the Howard coaching staff, or?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Our sports information director name was Rick Roberts [ph.].  He was very old when I came to Howard.  We didn't take him seriously 'cause we didn't know, we didn't know.  He was an old guy.  He wrote up stuff about us.  But, he was old.  And, Howard wasn't very serious in their sports.  We tried to make it serious.  But, they didn't, the administration didn't--they just let Rick say--sport information director, "Well, we'll just let him sit up there."  This dude knew everything.  He knew Satchel Paige.  He knew Josh Gibson.  He was talking to us about John Merritt and Jake Gaither.  Man, we were like, "Rick Roberts know (unclear)," (laughter), laughing.  This man wrote for the black newspaper in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 1: The Courier?
Speaker 2: The Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier].  He was naming all American and stuff from Pittsburgh Courier.  We were like--we didn't get it 'til later when Rick died.  And, I'm sitting next to, a guy down at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] who was a, a Negro League star that used to do the Morehouse football games.  Who I can't think of his name right now.  He was a horrible broadcaster, but he was still a famous guy.  And, then I end up meeting Judy Johnson.  I end up meeting, you know, the guy that just died.  That just passed away, ninety-seven years old.
Speaker 1: Buck O'Neil.
Speaker 2: Buck O'Neil was one of my great--man, I got pictures of him upstairs that I took.  What a nice guy.  What a great gentlemen, man.  Ninety years old, never had a wrinkle on his face, man; first class.  And, when we had our interview, he said, "Man, you know a lot about baseball."  I said, "I played a little bit."  But, every time I get a--there's been nobody that's ever been on my show ['Sports Talk'] that didn't feel comfortable, didn't feel like they were like, "Hey, man.  I like you, man.  You know what it's all about."
Story_ID: 610445
Speaker 1: So, well, how did you get involved in broadcast in--
Speaker 2: Dewey Hughes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) from, from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?  Now, now, you, when you graduated from How- what did you go right--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was already in broadcast--
Speaker 1: --into physical educa- ?
Speaker 2: By that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what, so it was at Howard that you got involved?
Speaker 2: Not really.  It was before that.  Everybody knew me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --as a radio person when I was at Howard.  I was on different radio shows, talk shows.  I did part-time radio.  Yeah, I did all that stuff while I was there.
Speaker 1: See, how did you first get involved in radio?  I mean, what, and when did you first--?
Speaker 2: Dewey Hughes.  My friend Dewey Hughes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What year was this?
Speaker 2: Aw, man, 19--I was almost thirty years old; 1970--actually--
Speaker 1: Now, that's after Howard, now.
Speaker 2: Well, it's after Howard, yeah.  But, I was doing small stuff for no money and all that, you know.  I was the public address announcer.  "Ladies and gentlemen, good evening and welcome to Howard University basketball," you know that kind of things.
Speaker 1: Oh, so, you were doing at Howard at the, at the--?
Speaker 2: I was doing--yeah, but I didn't know anything about any communications.  I just could talk.  And, I did, I did the games.  I was their public address announcer, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, for the Howard games (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and then I start doing radio later on.  I taught myself how to do play by play.  And, Dewey Hughes had never heard of me 'til his girlfriend at the time, introduced us together.  And, he asked me to come down.  He was there at the show that he was gonna put on.  So, we brought me down to WRC [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.] Channel 4.  And, I sat down in Walter Cronkite's chair (laughter).  Or, one of those guys.  I don't know whether it was Huntley [Chet Huntley], Brinkley [David Brinkley] or one of those guys who was working for NBC and I was reading the teleprompter.  He just put some news stuff in the teleprompter.  "In the news today," I was reading, man, he was like, "Hold up buddy.  You ever done this before?"  I said, "No."  "Do you know, do you realize what you just done?"  I said, "Nah, I was reading."  "You sound like a newsman.  You've never done this before?"  I said, "Never."  He said, "Man, you got a future, man."  So, he took me to every radio station in this town.  And, I was the kind of guy that spoke off the cuff.  I don't know if you ever heard of Warner Wolf.  But, Warner Wolf went to New York [New York] for a while.  He was national.  Well, I know Warner.  Warner's a friend of mine around this town.  He grew up in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], in segregated Washington 'cause he went to Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  He was the first guy I ever heard on the radio, just start talking, you know.  "Hey, you know this guy did so and so."  That was my style.  I used to do the same thing, you know.  But, Dewey could not get these radio stations, especially the black radio stations.  "Can't he just read copy?"  He said, "Man, anybody can read copy."  Dewey was an innovator, man.  He really was.  He was one of the first black execs at Channel 4 here in D.C.  He was making eighty grand [eighty thousand dollars] back in 1970, man, the money's big, huge.  So, and, you know, he didn't know Cathy then, I don't think.  Well, [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, the famous Cathy Hughes of BET [Black Entertainment Television] and a thousand radio stations.  And, her son, Alfred [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], I remember when he was a little--and I used to take him around to the basketball court.  Now, he's a big time exec.  I took his little butt out to the--I used to, every time he'd see me, he'd genuflect.  He'll see me right now, I don't care how big he is, "Hey, Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris], how you doing?"  You better.  And, he's a tough one.  He a tough sucker, you know.  A lot of people don't like him 'cause he's all corporate like his mother.  You'll see her on BET, she don't look corporate.  But, she's a corporate chick, man; real corporate.  But, I gotta give her credit, you know, I started with them, man, when they bought the radio station WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.] man.  And, I had my talk show called 'Let's Talk Sports.'  Me, and my brother kicked it off, me, my brother, Rock Newman.  And, Dewey wanted me to learn my trade so he took my brother off the air with me and let me go first, all by myself, man.  I've been doing this stuff for thirty years, man.  I've taken my radio show to TV and all the black ballplayers used to listen to my show; all of 'em.
Story_ID: 610446
Speaker 1: You started doing the radio, did you do radio at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington D.C.]?
Speaker 2: WHUR.  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.  What is that--?
Speaker 2: My talk show, it was called sport's talk--'Let's Talk Sports with Glenn Harris.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I did regular sports and I did Howard play by play for years.  I was so big at one time, John Thompson would just walk right in and sit down on my show and start talking.  You know, I had guests, Sugar Ray Leonard, you name 'em, I had 'em.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, when did you start doing radio at Howard would you say?
Speaker 2: I guess around '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I keep forgetting that '79 [1979] is twenty some years ago, good gracious.  I can't believe, I can't believe how long ago it's beginning to get, you know.  A long time ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  'Let's Talk Sports.'  So, you started off, at, on the Howard station?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I started off at Channel 4 [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --doing a show called 'Community Sports' [ph.].  And, my cohost was a lady name Sue Simmons, who's a big wheel in New York City [New York, New York].  She was in Baltimore [Maryland] then, I didn't know who she was.  And, another guy name [HistoryMaker] Rudolph Brewington.  He has a brother, twin brother, out in California that does radio.
Speaker 1: Ron Brewington [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington].
Speaker 2: Ron Brewington.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Rudolph, I can call Rudolph right now.  Rudolph Brewington, he has a brother that's an exact twin name Ronnie Brewington.  And, Ron is in California.  You know these guys 'cause you get around a lot, you know.  But, Rudolph was a, was a radio and a military guy.  He went to Vietnam and retired from the [U.S.] military.  And, Ron Brewington is still out in California.  And, I was with, it was [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris, Sue Simmons, and Rudolph Brewington.  And, we were the first three black folk on television talking about the place, the new place, doing community, news and sports; Dewey Hughes producer; unheard of (laughter).
Speaker 1: Community, news and sports.
Speaker 2: And sports, right.  Sue Simmons who was big wheel here and then went up to New York and she became a bigger wheel up there.
Speaker 1: Now, so, so, this is prior to '79 [1979].  This is what, in what year is this?
Speaker 2: This is, oh, yeah, this was around '70 [1970]--this was around '70 [1970], no about '75 [1975]; about 1975.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 610447
Speaker 1: And, you know what, the greatest thing Dewey [Dewey Hughes] told me to do; join a union.  'Cause you know I joined AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)].  I'm glad I did that because now I'm so vested, you know, I'm (unclear), when I retired I'm getting the AFTRA paycheck, so.  That was good man.  I didn't have enough money--I was only making a hundred dollars a show.  I didn't have no money.  So, I had to take a hundred dollars and pay my dues until I got the three hundred dollars, man.  My little check was squashed, you know.  But, I paid my dues, man.  Dewey Hughes was hard on me, man; hard on me.  He said, "You my baby, man, but I'm a--." One day we had a--he disagreed with something I did so I was kind of like this.  He suspended me for two weeks 'cause I wouldn't look at him.  What?  "You're off the air," (snaps fingers).  Put me off the air.  My god, man.  You gotta look--but, he was teaching me how tough the business was, and how rough the white man was in the business on black talent.  So, we'd get fired like that (snaps finger).  Man, he brought me back.  I was always--he said, "Man--," he tells me right now, I could call him right now, and he says, "Man," every time we leave the phone he always says, "I love you, man."  I say, "I love you too Dewey."  So, that makes me emotional.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Dewey Hughes.  Okay.  And, he, he was, he was--
Speaker 1: Well, he was--
Speaker 2: Well, take your time now, he--
Speaker 1: He and Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes] got married, you know, I don't know how great that was, but if it wasn't for Cathy, if it wasn't for Dewey there wouldn't be no Cathy Hughes like it is today.  I can tell you that right now.  Dewey was a very eccentric person.  I thought he was a college grad and all that.  This dude dropped out of high school and was a pool hustler.  This man taught himself how to talk.  Taught himself a lot of stuff.
Speaker 2: He ended up in radio, huh?  Just got himself--?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He had heart.  And, he never looked back.  That's my weakness 'cause I carry my feelings on my shoulder (crying).  What the hell am I crying for?  It's just that, he taught me so much, and I'm and I got--I've been married three times, man.  I always treat people good and they always leave me, all the time (crying).  And, so, I figured it out, I'm one of these guys that take everybody's feelings and put 'em into a--and when they come to me with these issues, man, I take care of 'em, then they leave.  It's time to go.  (Crying) And they go and they leave me.  I'm by myself now.  So, you know, I knew I was gonna do this shit.  So, you know, Dewey--
Speaker 2: Hey, you wanna take--?
Speaker 1: Nah, nah, man, I ain't quitting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Dewey is so tough, man.  He such a tough dude, man.  And, he never really--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: He never really, he took off for California.  He'd been living in Malibu [California], man, for twenty-five years.  He didn't know anybody.  He had a friend name Guy Draper, man.  Guy Draper was the same way, man.  Tough.  When I say tough, whenever they leave something, it's gone, man.
Story_ID: 610448
Speaker 1: He and Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes] are good friends now.  Cathy has helped Dewey, you know, with money and everything.  But, if it wasn't for her--wasn't for him, she wouldn't've had no money.  And, now that she's big, man, she's huge, you know.  I don't know how liquid she is, but she's big.  She ain't as big as Oprah [Oprah Winfrey], but she's big.  I bet you Oprah knows who she is.  Funny, I met Oprah too.  And, her boyfriend [Stedman Graham].  He's a--what a nice guy he is.  I took him home one night when he was on my talk show ['Sports Talk'].  And, he reminded me a lot of Dewey Hughes.  Only, I think we're around the same age.  But, he--what a nice guy, man.  I took him over the [HistoryMaker] Armstrong Williams house (laughter).  Armstrong, Armstrong wanted to represent me one time, you know.  I said, "Armstrong, you too conservative for me."  But, you know who he is, Armstrong Williams.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, in this town, man, you run into so many people but again, I got pictures of Armstrong.  He's my buddy.  He went to South Carolina State [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  And, told me not to get married to my second wife, but I did anyway (laughter), "You crazy, man."  And, Herb Feemster [Herb Fame] from Peaches and Herb, we all grew up together.  Herb is a little older than me.  He told me one time too, the second marriage I got, he said, "Man, don't marry her, man.  You not ready to marry her."  I was in my forties, man when he told me.  I wouldn't listen.  I was in love again, you know, and you know, looking out for people.  Oh, Herb.  It's so many people, man, in this town.  You know [HistoryMaker] Pookie Hudson just died and that was--with that--I was with them three weeks ago (laughter) at this ex-offender ball.  I was the emcee of the show and Pookie Hudson was there.  He's gone now.  But, he was nice guy, old guy that I end up meeting.
Story_ID: 610449
Speaker 1: But getting back to Dewey Hughes, man, he was just an innovator, man.  His friend Petey Greene could've been before Richard Pryor.  But Petey couldn't handle it.  He was an ex-offender and got drunk and, but what a genius.  And, Dewey saw him, man.
Speaker 2: Now, there are books, there are two books on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.  It's gonna be--
Speaker 2: --Petey Greene now, and--
Speaker 1: You wait.  It's gonna big, man.
Speaker 2: A movie in development ['Talk to Me'], right?
Speaker 1: It's gonna be big.  They're working on the movie right now.  My brother did some research for Dewey on Petey.
Speaker 2: And, yeah, Petey had his own show ['Petey Greene's Washington'], right?
Speaker 1: Petey had his own (unclear).
Speaker 2: Was he on the same station (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This guy was on Channel 20 [WDCA-TV] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and said the word nigger on television, man (laughter), thirty years ago.  White folks loved him (laughter).  But, the way he said it, you couldn't even get mad at him.  He was ahead of his time, funny, photographic memory.  Unbelievable talent was Petey Greene.  And, always talked about his son and daughter, Peaches and Pine [Ralph Waldo Greene, III].  Her name is Petra [Petra Greene] really.  But, they're grown now and good friends.  And, I met Petey's ex-wife [sic. Greene's widow, Judy C. Greene].  What a beautiful woman.  She lives in North Carolina.  It's it amazing, man, how you know how beautiful people are in other people's lives.  And, you don't know it 'til they die.  And, our shortstop, Butch White [Curtis "Butch" White], just passed.  He just drank himself to death.  And, when I saw his daughter I said, "How old are you?"  She's thirty years old.  Gorgeous, grandson, didn't even know all that stuff.  That's a great thing about when somebody passes, their family, man, people--everybody got somebody.  And, Dewey was a very strange, eclectic person, man.  His son, Michael Hughes plays in, he's in Hollywood, man.  Does commercials, comes on soap opera, Michael Hughes does commercials.  They weren't very tight but now they're getting tight.  It's that something man, Dewey's almost seventy years old and doesn't even look it; looks great, takes care of himself, doesn't do a lot of drinking and smoking, none of that mess.  Neither have I.  And, the emotional thing is, here's a guy who taught himself this business, a cruel, nasty business like it is.  He just taught himself, man.  Wasn't gonna be a failure.  Was gonna be something.  Man, that's enough to make you break, man.  Guy Draper was, he's a guy you gotta find where, man.  This guy, the group call The Unifics, national group, man, that was--he was the one, man.  He and his cousin June Bug [ph.] and all of those, man, those guys, I mean, he--strobe lights.  He was the first one to use strobe lights, Guy Draper; went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  What an innovator, man.  He was one of the first agents out there, represented Mike Thomas for the Redskins [Washington Redskins], some of the talent around town, he was, he represented them.  Now agents are a regular thing.  He was one of the first agents to go in and represent and, and do a contract; didn't have a law degree.  He was just brilliant.
Story_ID: 610450
Speaker 1: So, you started really full-time--when did you start full-time (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Full-time.  I didn't start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the broadcasting--?
Speaker 2: Full-time until I went to WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C] and I became a full-time broadcaster.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was sportscast- I was the week--I was the regular sports anchor on the radio.  I did the four and the six [o'clock].
Speaker 1: Now, this is in '78 [1978], '79 [1979] rather?
Speaker 2: Nah, this was in seventy--well, in '77 [1977] I was at WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.], and I did a sports talk show.  And, I was the morning sportscaster.  And, Dewey Hughes put me through a lot of changes to see if I really wanted to do this.  You know how cold it is outside now, and of course we're shooting this in February, so, it could be summertime and this will be very generic but, he told me to come from my house in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], all the way to Wisconsin Avenue to take a trash can out of the studio that I had left in the studio.  So, my wife, Melanie [ph.], at the time said, "Don't go up there.  Don't go up there.  Please, don't go.  He's taking advantage of you."  This dude sat there and waited for me, man, to see if I was gonna come.  When I walked through that door he looked at me and said, "You really want this, don't you?"  I said, "Man, why did you do this?"  He said, "I been moved that trash can, man.  I just wanted to see if you were gonna come up here."  That's old mentorship.  That's (crying), that's old time, man.  It's hard.  You know how many youngsters wouldn't've come up there to move a damn trash can?
Speaker 1: Zero.
Speaker 2: It ain't no way they would've went up there.  You gotta want it, man, you know, you gotta want--that's why I'm still working at Channel 8 [NewsChannel 8, Washington, D.C.].  It's not because they love me.  It's because I got a follow in, in the God force.  You know I ain't no God person, I told you that early.  But, it's a force, it's an organic force that's keeping me there because people need me.  They do.  They need me in the neighborhood.  I'm the only one that will talk about David Bing [Dave Bing] in the hood.  I'm the only one that's gonna say something about my best friend, Roger Scott [ph.] who died, who was a great player.  Who gonna mention him?  Nobody.  I will.  I'll bring it back.  That's what Dewey Hughes taught me, community, man.  And, that's why I'm still on television and they can't--when they made me a freelancer, sixteen years, man, I said, "Man, making me a freelance, I'm fifty-eight years old, man."  "That's all right, you don't look fifty-eight.  We ain't gonna fire you."  I could've been a jerk.  I could've bad mouthed them, and then they would've fired me, really.  But, I didn't.  I kept it to myself.  And, I'm still there.  I'm still doing my show ['Sports Talk'], after they fired everybody.  Fired people, man, I'm still there.  A guy said, "Man, I don't know what you got, man.  But, you got a following, man."  I'm still there all because of Dewey, man.  Tough inside and tough individual.
Speaker 1: And, it's something about what--
Speaker 2: Solider, man.  Deep respect.  Rock Newman, I got deep respect for Rock.  Rock--Dewey taught Rock.  I know when Rock didn't know nothing about boxing; nothing.  Now, he's a millionaire ten times, man.
Story_ID: 610451
Speaker 1: So, and Rock was on the baseball team with you at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and, ended up--
Speaker 2: Didn't have a clue about no, nothing.
Speaker 1: And, it, yeah--
Speaker 2: A country boy from Brandywine, Maryland.
Speaker 1: And, he ended up being the manager of Riddick Bowe, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The heavyweight champ (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had a mentor.  His mentor was, who was the guy?  Oh, I can't think, now I'm all upset I can't think of anything.  The guy with the bowtie.  He used to wear the bowtie and didn't wear no shirt.  Took Rock under this wing and taught him the boxing world.  Boxing (unclear)--Rock just loved boxing.  He didn't know nothing about no business.  Rock had been nowhere, anywhere.  Now he been all over the world.  Just as a regular ol' country dude from down in Brandywine, Maryland in Prince George's County, man; smart as a whip, read contracts.  All he ever wanted to do was sell cars, man (laughter).  He was the top salesman at a local place right here called Pohanka Oldsmobile [Pohanka Automotive Group]; top salesman.  One day he went to a Sugar Ray Leonard fight, got the money and went to Montreal [Canada] to see Hagler [Marvin Hagler] and Hearn [Thomas Hearns], and Hagler and Le- Ray Leonard [Sugar Ray Leonard] that was it.  Butch, what was his name?  Butch, Butch Lewis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Butch Lewis taught Rock Newman.  And, Rock got away from Butch, got in his own thing, man.  He never looked back.  He was looking for that football, he ran downhill, man.  And, always look out for us, man.  Whenever Rock was in California or Las Vegas [Nevada], he took care of Dewey Hughes.  He took care of my son [Jason Harris].  My son was on this traveling group, man, on his entourage group.  Went all over the world, man.
Speaker 1: Now, speaking of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Made money for everybody.

Speaker 1: Now, when did you first get married?
Speaker 2: Well, my first marriage was in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nah, '72 [1972] really.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: To my wife, Melanie [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you married when you started at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Nope.  Got married the second year I was at Howard.  But, I was already twenty-four years old.  Nah, actually, I got--now, let me, let me straighten that up and be official.  I actually got married at twenty-six.  So, that was 1973, right.  Seventy-three [1973] I was twenty-six.  I got married at twenty-six years old.  And, I stayed with my wife, Melanie for seventeen years.  We were together twenty years all together.  She had issues too, man.  It's too long to mention.
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have to get into all of that.  But--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't argue or anything, she just was a sad person growing up, man.  She was very smart.  Her father died.  My mother [June Puckett Harris] died, who was her buddy.  She had a lot of loss counseling to get, man.  And, hey, man, she was sick a lot, hey.  We stayed married.  We did the best we could.  Backs hit the wall, man, it's time to roll.  And, I married on a rebound the second time which was so stupid.  But, I did, so, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So, when were you married the second time?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Nineteen ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got married in '91 [1991], and we stayed married for, I guess about, well, we stayed married six of the ten years we was together.  Well, we were already married but we didn't get divorced 'til later.  And, my wife, shouldn't've married her.  My brother said, "Man, she too young."  I was twelve years younger [sic.] than her which is not all that bad today.  'Cause today she's almost fifty years old herself.  But, I--it was just too young, man.  And, again, I invited her in.  She and her husband broke up.  I said, you can come over here if you want to.  Shouldn't've never done it, man.  It was my fault.  But, when you like somebody, you care about 'em, you just do, man.
Speaker 1: So, you mentioned a son.  Do you have a--?
Speaker 2: My son [Jason Harris] is from my first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Son and daughter [India Harris] from my first wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, we was nice little family, man.  We was--I mean, we, we were good.  We never argued.  We always, we were like a little hippie group.  We (laughter), you know.  We had a, we had a--we were very organic, man.  We were outdoors, man, take pictures and, you know, we were all that, man, you know.  And, my kids were very, like my son never had a candy bar until he was twelve years old, you know.  So, we were really, you know--
Story_ID: 610453
Speaker 1: I never had a drink, drug, smoke in my whole life.  Never even drank a beer.  The liquor you saw in my house is for company, you know.  I never knocked it.  I just made a decision never to do it.  I used to take guys home and, you know, make sure they got home safely, stuff like that.  So, I never had a drink.  So, all my boys say, "Man, how come you still looking like you looked years ago, except for that gray?"  I say, "Yeah, 'cause I didn't do what you were doing," (laughter), drinking that steam, you know what I mean.  And, smoking herb and getting high.
Speaker 2: But, yeah, is it hard to avoid that kind of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  Not for me.
Speaker 2: --when you're--well, well nah, I'm just saying in the sports world?  Now, you're in--
Speaker 1: Oh, nah, you can see it.  But, when you validate yourself (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you see a lot of it, you know.
Speaker 1: All you gotta do, in my motivational speaking, man, is validate yourself.  When you know who you are, you ain't gonna drug and drink.  You--most of the kids don't do it 'cause they wanna do it.  They doing it 'cause they like it.  Well, they do it 'cause they like it because they're doing it because they wanna satisfy somebody else.  And, then they get hooked on it, and then they can't help it no more.  And, I've always remembered, man, Petey Greene told me this years ago, "People drug 'cause they like to drug.  They drink 'cause they like it."  Yeah, but you don't like it at first.  You start doing it 'cause other people do it.  My father [Pleasant Harris] was an alcoholic, you know.  He wasn't no, he was a functional alcoholic.  He wasn't no dysfunctional; worked every day.  But, he told me, this how I understood it, he said, "Man I don't know why I drink.  I drink 'cause I like it."  That's why people drink.  He said, he started smoking at twelve years old.  He on a farm, down in the country, everybody else doing it, so he did it.  That wasn't me.  And, see I had an alter ego that's rough.  That's why I never hustle.  That's why I never go into selling drugs.  See, my alter ego is a vicious beast, you know.  My alter ego a kill you, a hurt you.  So, I never dealt with my alter ego.  I ain't wanna get into hustling.  I didn't wanna drug.  I didn't wanna get into that stuff, 'cause I'm a play the game right.  I'm a be strapped.  I'm a have the right people with me, and I'm a get paid.  But, I'm a be sober and smart.  So, all the guys asked me to hustle with them.  I said, "Nah, man, 'cause y'all gonna be hating, y'all gonna--I'll be in jail and y'all a be free, 'cause y'all be the snitches.  Then I'd to kill every one of you all."  So, I didn't play the game.  I just wanted to be, let's go to movies, get some ice cream, kick back.  'Cause my third ego, the alter one, the second one, where everybody has an ego.  I was too vicious, man.  And, I wasn't gonna get hurt, 'cause that's how I played sports.  I hurt you first, you can't hurting me.  I used to tell my blockers on the outside, when I was an outside linebacker, I'll tell the quarterback, I'll tell Reggie Rucker, "Take the crack back.  I'm taking the crack back, you take the run."  You wasn't gonna hit me blindside.  I was gonna knock your head off before you hit me, yeah.  But, Reggie was quarterback in high school [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.], he'd come up and knock you out, man.  But, he close so fast, you know.  'Cause he was actually a pro in high school.  We didn't know it.  But, he close so fast on you, you know what I'm saying, he was ahead of the game.  But, I always told him, man, "I'm not letting no crack back take me out," not in high school.

Speaker 1: Now, is that something that you recognize in other athletes or other human beings, is this ability to, to finish off plays and you know, to--?
Speaker 2: They're exceptional.
Speaker 1: I mean, as a way--
Speaker 2: They're exceptional.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there is a difference in people.  There's some--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, there's some big basketball players.  The guy maybe 7'5" but he just doesn't feel it.  He's not out there really--
Speaker 2: He can't play.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: If he could play--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --he'd be all right.  7'5" don't mean nothing if you can't play.
Speaker 1: But, does a--
Speaker 2: But, if you have ability to do something, that's anything, anything in life, it doesn't have to be sports.  If people would equate life to the things that they do in life, it'll be okay.  We talked about it, some people aren't good interviews.  They're boring as I don't know what.  You're ready to pass out while you're talking to 'em.  It's not that they're not, they're bad people, they're just not exciting people.  It's okay to be non-exciting.  It's nothing wrong with that.  I hate people always talking about getting on nerves.  What you get on a nerve for?  You'll be asking them for a job in three years.  Get serious.  Everybody's different.  I tell--we're like, like I said earlier, we're like art pieces.  There's no bad art.  It's just different art.  You may not like the person because they may not be your style.  But, hey, everybody's different, man.  Everybody has a different way of looking at things.  And, if they're not looking at it our way, doesn't mean that they're bad, they're just different.  So, what you do if you don't wanna be around it, you just separate yourself from the person.  Just say, "Man, I don't, I don't think I like his or her philosophy, I don't wanna be around her too much."  That's like I'm not a religious person.  Religious people always trying to get me religion.  I said, "Well, do you understand what religion is?"  Religion is just a group of people think of one liked mind.  Baseball could be a religion.  I mean, it doesn't have to be a church thing.  It's like it was a couple of scouts talking about gospel music the other day.  I said, "You know what gospel means?"  Means good news.  It ain't got nothing to do with no church.  You can make a church if you want to.  But, I could be telling the gospel every day.  If you try to talk about truth and good feelings, that's gospel.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, in all these years that you've been a sports broadcaster, what have been the most, I guess, the most memorable events in sports that you, you know, that's--?
Speaker 2: Magic Johnson was a good interview.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When he first came in the league [National Basketball Association], I talked with him and he talked about his parents [Christine Johnson and Earvin Johnson, Sr.].  That was good for me.  I like that.  Did Michael Jordan one day and Michael Jordan was sitting there with no clothes on.  Man, he sitting there hanging out, man.  He just sitting there.  Everybody had the microphone in the face, I guess, they had to make the deadlines or whatever.  But, I waited and I got a good interview from Michael because I waited.  I said, "Hey man, how you doing?  I'm [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris from WHUR sports [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.]."  He said, "Man," and Mike will never remember this, "thanks for waiting, man.  I appreciate it."  Now, I know Michael's lawyer, David Falk, and Bill Strickland [William Strickland] was the other guy.  They were two big boys.  David Falk still big, billionaire.  And, Michael Jordan, and of course, he represented Adrian Dantley also.  So, I knew David Falk.  Falk got a lot of enemies; I'm not one of 'em.  But he does.  And, Bill Strickland was another one who was a big time lawyer and a big time agent.  And, every now and then, it'll be me, Strickland, Falk, and Michael Jordan.  Michael Jordan don't remember me.  But, I remember him (laughter).  And, Michael Jordan is an Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], in the fraternity and I'm Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  So, you know, we always throw that around a little bit.  But, he doesn't really know me.
Story_ID: 610456
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did this, how did the city embrace Michael Jordan when he came to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: They loved him.  It was, it was a hustler's ball, baby.  When Michael Jordan came to town, it wasn't about no basketball, man.  It was about people riding up in the minks and the furs and the limousines, all that.  And, Michael didn't know how to play the game.  All Michael had to do was take Abe Pollin to lunch a couple times, he'd still be here.  Michael Jordan played some great basketball when he was here [with the Washington Wizards].  He don't get hurt, they go to the playoffs.  But, he got hurt.  He had two all-star seasons here, man.  This guy had retired and came back and was still kicking butt.  It was some exciting times out of USA Arena [US Airways Arena, Landover, Maryland], boy.  That place was packed to see Michael Jordan.  But, Michael Jordan was staying in Chicago [Illinois] a lot.  And, Abe Pollin who's a, you know, you don't get to be no billionaire by being dumb, you know, he's a tough dude, man.  And, you know, he and Michael always had this, you know, they weren't that close.  So, they let 'em go.  Paid him off and let him go.  And, Michael drafted Kwame Brown, who's not a great player.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a local phenomenon, right?
Speaker 2: Kwame Brown?
Speaker 1: Kwame Brown--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Wasn't he--?
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, he was from Georgia.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  I thought he was from D.C.  Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, he, but, they draft, but Michael drafted him 'cause he like him, thought the kid had potential.  And, I thought he did too.  But, Michael hazed the kids so bad when he came here.  It ain't like inner city guys.  We get hazed all the time, man, you know.  People talk trash to you but kid couldn't take it.  What he should've done was back Michael up in the corner, say don't talk to me like that, I'm a knock you out.  Michael would've loved him then.  But, he didn't get it.  And, they hate- "Come on man, come on."  They called him names, "Come on sucker, you ain't nothing, this, that."  Man, that make you--but, when you grow up in the hood, you know, you grow up in inner city Chicago, Detroit [Michigan], or D.C., you like, "Okay, man, you know."  'Cause you understood the older dudes raised you.  He didn't get that.  So, he went into a shell.  So, he never played that well.  He was inconsistent.  Had a lot of talent; could run, jump.  All he had to do was rebound.  Then, he got this thing that he could score, man, ain't no scoring.  Rebound, get the ball off the glass.  And, then Doug Collins, who was a yes stool.  Shook his head like that (nods head) every time Michael said something.  I think Doug Collins was a good coach, and a smart guy.  And, a good player when he played.  But, everything--Michael was really coaching the club.  So, he hazed him also.  So, Kwame Brown went into a shell.  And, I talked to Kwame Brown he said, "Man, they told me I wasn't even gonna play my first year.  Doug tells me to face the basket.  Michael tell me to play with my back to the basket.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  Man, I wasn't but nineteen."  I understood that.  So, now he's playing catch up now.  He'll always have a job, 'cause he's 6'11" and athletic; not playing bad in L.A. [Los Angeles Lakers].  But, that's what happened.  And, he never--and, see Michael used all his might and power.  Man, them white folks don't care nothing about no Michael Jordan.  And, I don't think Mike got it.  See to white folks, Michael Jordan ain't black (laughter), he's a crossover, you know what I mean.  When you get to be Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, you ain't black, you know.  You have transcended the races.  That's the code word for he ain't black.  Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] ain't black.  She transcended the races.  That, they say, now, I'm not saying they're saying they're not black.  But, the public doesn't view them as black.

Speaker 1: Just like the basketball players out at Maryland, Len Bias was a good friend of mine.  When he died, it shook the world.  But, Lenny wasn't black in Maryland 'til he died on that drug overdose, then he got real black, then, yeah, got real African American.  But, at first he was Len Bias playing at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], All-American, great, great player.  Unh-uh, see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of local sports stories around here.  I'm--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I'm just thinking about him--
Speaker 1: Len Bias' mother is good friend of mine, man.  She went around preaching, man, about a lot, she's a church woman anyway.  Lonise, nice as she could be.  Never would come on my show though.  She--, "Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris] I'm gonna come on there."  "Okay."  She had this conspiracy theory that somebody killed Lenny.  Ain't nobody kill him.  Lenny od'd [overdose].  And, all they had to do was pick him up, stand him up.  He choked to death.  I know all the guys involved; every one of 'em.  They used to come to my office, when I worked at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and I would counsel them.  Keith Gatlin, Adrian Branch, another great player; Shawn Myers [ph.], played on the tennis team, all them was Lenny's boys.  But, see Lenny used to hang out with a gangster name Rayful Edmond, you know.  You may have heard of him.  Big time drug dealer, big boy, big.  Whoever was big in your hometown, drug boy, that's how Rayful Edmond was here.  He's doing time in Lewisburg [United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania] now.  He ain't never coming out.  They made movies about 'em; local legend.  But, what Lenny would do is he was a middle man, not really selling no drugs or nothing.  But, he knew where to get 'em.  And, he was a recreational user.  That night, he was the one suggest that they go get the coke and play around a little bit.  His father, Butch [James Bias], who we know from the playground, said, "Man, come on, come on home, man, you just got drafted, come on home."  "Man, I'm going up on campus"; last time they saw 'em.  Rough, rough time.  I cried like a baby, man.  Well, you know I cry like a baby anyway.  I was in Los Angeles [California] and they called me to do an on the spot.  They found me in the hotel.  I'm crying so bad, I can't even do the report.  I just talked to Lenny.  I just talked to him twenty-five days before he died.  He came on my show ['Let's Talk Sports'].  Went to a pre-draft party thing, had his L.A. cap on, sat down, and said, "Man, all I wanna do is dress good, Mr. Harris," called me Mr. Harris on the air.  Twenty-five days later, he was gone.  And, his little brother--
Speaker 2: And, that was in the, that was around 1990, wasn't it, or was it--?
Speaker 1: It's been almost twenty years, man.
Speaker 2: Twenty, okay.
Speaker 1: Almost twenty years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, his little brother--
Speaker 2: Late '80s [1980s] then.
Speaker 1: --was in the ninth grade or seventh grade, on the other side of the glass when I was doing the interview, four years later he got shot and killed.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.  I don't think most people know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, Miss Lonise Bias was crushed.  Both her sons gone.  And, her son, her other son, who I can't think of his name right this second, Jay Bias, his name was Jay Bias.  He got killed on a little dispute messing around with this girlfriend and this guy got intimidated.  Jay was 6'4", 6'5", shot him dead right in the parking lot, killed him.  Rough.  Jay wasn't doing all the right things that he should've been doing but he didn't deserve to get shot because he was flirting with some girl.  But, that's, that was deal, man, you know, so.  Lonise, as a mature, as Christian as she is and everything, I don't think she'll ever get over that.  And, Len Bias was big as life, man.  He was a beast.  He would've been a great player.  He, Larry Bird, McHale [Kevin McHale] and them, boy he was a man child; man child, big, strong, could run, rebound, shooting improved, jump like Michael Jordan; great player, man.  A great player.  He re-autographed a picture for me one day.  He said, "Thank, Glenn.  See you, I'll see you when you get there, up there."  Man, that was, that gave me chills, man.  I mean, I don't know if he (laughter), it was kind of an omen like, you know.  Something like I'll see you, see you in the stars or something like that.  I was like, "Oh, man."  He was dunking on this guy, backhand dunking like that.  He autographed it for me, man.  I had it in my book.  I don't know where it is now.  I had it in one of my collages.  I've thrown away a lot of stuff.
Story_ID: 610458
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you this.  Now, I know, we just this past weekend the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XLI] was played, had two black coaches in the Super Bowl.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, I need to ask you about that too.  But, I wanted to go back to 1988 and Doug Williams and--
Speaker 2: Right, Doug--
Speaker 1: --the Washington Redskins winning the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XXII].
Speaker 2: A friend of mine, good friend.
Speaker 1: And, there must be a story, I mean, I don't, from the stuff I've read and I haven't, you know, you really don't get what the inside story is about Doug Williams.  Here's somebody who had a rough time as a quarterback in the pros and was able to--and, played perhaps the most heroic game anybody has ever played.  Can you tell us about--?
Speaker 2: Okay.  First of all, Doug Williams was drafted in the first round by the Tampa Bay Bucs [Tampa Bay Buccaneers].  His first three years in the league were great.  He led them to two--to three conference championships.
Speaker 1: Now, well--
Speaker 2: One--
Speaker 1: --wait a minute, no.  Well, wait a minute.  Before we--
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: No.  No, wait.  I'm not disputing that, I'm just saying, I think the first, I think his first year, they broke his jaw, didn't they?
Speaker 2: He may have had a broken jaw, I don't know.
Speaker 1: A guy--
Speaker 2: He may have.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  A guy, rushing him--
Speaker 2: Matter fact--
Speaker 1: --sacked him and broke his jaw.
Speaker 2: Well, which they, you know, quarterback didn't have skirts on then.  You could touch 'em.  Maybe he did have brok- I have to look that up.  I don't know.   I ain't never heard Doug talk about that.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it don't matter.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It's something that you know, and I don't know.  The main thing is, he was successful.  But, then when it came up to his option year to get a check, Culverhouse [Hugh Culverhouse] and them didn't wanna pay 'em.  They wasn't gonna pay no brother that kind of money and he had taken them to three conference championships, one game away from the Super Bowl.  Then, he went to the World Football League, then he got hurt, and that's what slowed Doug up.  Dough was a running quarterback as well as a throwing quarterback, when he could run.  He could roll man.  What a great arm.  He could throw that thing on a line sixty-five yards, man, just a bullet.  He could rope it, man.  He was just a great physical specimen.  Never moved when the rush came, stayed right there, boom!  Great release, big league arm, big time.  And, played in the World Football League, got hurt, kind of went underground for a while.  He resurfaced.  And, Joe Gibbs signed him.  Jay Schroeder, who got pretty good numbers, but he, he'll never make it in the Hall of Fame [Pro Football Hall of Fame, Canton, Ohio].  He's just--Jay's problem, he didn't have no heart.  He can throw it.  Jay was a, one of these phenomenal athletes.  He was baseball player in college, and a backup football player in college.  And, they drafted him in baseball and football.  So, he went out for football.  This guy had a gun for an arm.  But, he did--but, you know, competition riled him.  When Doug came to camp, he made Jay a little nervous.  Then, Jay got hurt in the Philadelphia [Philadelphia Eagles] game and that was, Doug never looked back that year.  The Redskins, everybody says, "Well, they didn't treat him right, Jay didn't treat Doug right."  But, actually Doug's back was bad.  He couldn't play no more.  But, what he was pissed off about, was if Jeff Rutledge can hold the ball, hell, I can make a check and hold the ball too.  I think I might've deserved that.  But, didn't make any difference, they cut him.  And, that's why there are so many non-Redskin fans that live here.
Story_ID: 610459
Speaker 1: There are some, because the Redskins [Washington Redskins] was the last team to even employ a black person.  Bobby Mitchell and his group.  See, Bobby Mitchell was not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Right, right.
Speaker 1: --the first black person to play for the Redskins.  He was the first one to start for the Redskins.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because he came in with John Nisby and all these guys; they were black, and Mitchell was a part of that group.  But, he was the first star of the group.  The other guys didn't even play much, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: I was wondering what it was like here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Me, and Bobby talk about it all the time.
Speaker 2: With the black population of D.C. [Washington, D.C.] being so large--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, then no black players on the Redskins for so long--
Speaker 1: But, that's why they love the Dallas Cowboys in this town.  This is one of biggest Dallas Cowboys contingents in the country, in D.C.  Because even back in the day, 1960, the running back for the Dallas Cowboy was Don Perkins, black man (laughter), you know.  So, they were like, yeah, you know, so they picked out a team; the Dallas Cowboys.  So, you got Dallas Cowboy fans going to bathroom here, man.  They love the Cowboys.  And, some people don't even know why they like 'em.  Because it's a lineage thing.  "My father liked them, so I like 'em."
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: They don't know why.  But, the reason why, is because this was a coldblooded racist town and a racist team.  They--Stewart Udall from the Department of Agriculture [sic. U.S. Department of the Interior] had to make George Preston Marshall put black pe- people on the team.  He said, "Y'all ain't playing no more.  This is the 1960s, get in the ballgame."  He wasn't trying to have no brothers on the team, man.

Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about the integration of the Redskins [Washington Redskins].  And, that must've happened in what, '63 [1963], '62 [1962], '63 [1963] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Something like that, '62 [1962], '63 [1963], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Bobby Mitchell came and really became the first starting--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, start--
Speaker 1: --player.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of people think Bobby Mitchell was the first black man to play for the Redskins, but actually, he wasn't.  He came up with a group of black players.  And, he was the, he was the only star and people recognize him more than they recognize, you know, the other guys.  So, the other guys were like interior linemen and stuff like that, so.  But, Mitchell was the great offensive player for the Redskins.  And, they took him from running back.  And, he and Charley Taylor were the wide receivers.  'Cause you know Charley Taylor when he first came here, he was, well, he was after Bobby of course.  Charley was a running back, when he first came to the National Football League [NFL].  And, he was, you know, he was a rookie of the year as a running back.  And, then he ended up going wide out.  Just shows you how great these athletes were.  You know, they played out of their position and still played well, because they're football players and they were elite football players.  Charley Taylor--
Speaker 1: That's interesting, those are two great receivers that start off--
Speaker 2: That were running backs, right--
Speaker 1: --as running backs, right.
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.  And, you know had they been quarterbacks in those days (laughter), they would've been wide receivers anyway, 'cause they wasn't gonna play 'em, you know.
Story_ID: 610461
Speaker 1: But, black quarterbacks are nothing new.  You know, black quarterbacks been playing quarterback for centuries, you know.  But, they wasn't let 'em play, you know.  Eldridge Dickey was big boy at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], man.  They called him The Lord's Prayer, you know.  He was, he was one of the great ones, man.  And, of course, you know James Harris, and you know, Doug Williams, and many others, you know, that I can't think of right off the top of my head.  But, you know, Sandy Stephens out of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota], you remember him.  You know, Chuck Ealey out of Toledo [University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Marlin Briscoe.
Speaker 1: Marlin Briscoe, you know, they let him play for a minute up there.  They let him run around a little bit.  But, they're all, they were all, you know, Brig Owens, played the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] was a quarterback.  You know, ended up playing defensive back in the pros, you know.  So, they're a lot of people.  Oakland Raiders had an outstanding tight end that played quarterback in Kentucky, can't think of his name right now.  I used to know it off the top of my head.  I just can't think of it right now.  But, he ended up playing in the National Football League [NFL] for ten (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not, Raymond Chester, was it?
Speaker 1: Nah, Ray Chester played at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, he was the tight end.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, this kid played at Kentucky, was a big ol' quarterback.  But, he ended up playing tight end for the Raiders.  I can't think of his name right now; pretty good tight end too.  So, just, you know, just ignorance, man, stupidity, you know.  I think that, that Levi Garrett tobacco got in some of those brain cells, you know, (laughter).  So, hey.  As the saying is now, "It is what it is."  You know, I like to see Tony Dungy, who I don't know and Lovie Smith, I don't know these guys, but I don't people that do know them.  And--
Speaker 2: They was, they just coached in the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XLI] (unclear) this year, right?
Speaker 1: Well, they coached, you know, and you know, Dungy, Dungy was a quarterback in Minnesota.  And, of course, another great quarterback form this area that you may need to talk to one day is Cornelius Greene, played at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Dunbar High School, D.C. [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: He played on those great--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Ohio State teams, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, he was MVP [Most Valuable Player] of the Rose Bowl [Rose Bowl Game].  He and Archie Griffin, man, he was a great one.  If you see him now, he looks just like he did when played at Ohio State.  Haven't gain one ounce.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very lean.
Speaker 1: Little, little--
Speaker 2: Lean but--
Speaker 1: If you see him you will never belie- unbelievable how he looks.  Looks the same (laughter).  He looks--I--we called him Flam, you know, from his old high school days.  "Cornelius when you gonna gain some weight?"  He said, "Well, they, they didn't knock me around.  They didn't touch me too good.  I ran that option perfect."  I said, "You sure did."  Yeah, he was a great player.
Story_ID: 610462
Speaker 1: Is there any one incident or personality around here that is--stands out the most, or--?
Speaker 2: You know, I've been friends with a lot of people.  Phil Chenier and I are very good friends.	Broadcaster for one of the--Steve Buckhantz, good friend of mine.  Tim Brant who does the game all around the country.  I work with him every day.  Kind of grew up with Tim.  He's doing some, you know, he's broadcasting at JLA Channel 7 [WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.].  I've alwa- anybody that I become involved with, for some reason I can sit down and talk to 'em, you know.  Ralph Wiley was my buddy; Michael Wilbon.  Tony Kornheiser called this house the first time he ever did a talk show to ask me, how do you do it?  How do you talk for thirty minutes like this?   Kornheiser will never admit that, 'cause he kind of (laughter), he kind of--he can get a little arrogant.  But, Gus Johnson who was my pride and joy, man, works for CBS Sports.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentored Gus Johnson, right?
Speaker 2: Aw, mentored him, man.  He called me Mr. Harris [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris] until I told him, "Stop calling me Mr. Harris."  But, now he's, he's my fraternity brother.  He's a good man; and he's smart; and he's rich; and I'm so proud of him.  Every time I hear, I heard him, turned on the TV one time and he was sitting there with Quinn Buckner.  I start crying again, man.  I said, "That's my boy," man.  He called me and I said, "Look man, I'm watching you on TV man," I'm a little, I'm a little emotional.  He called me back four o'clock in the morning.  "You all right, Pops?  Man, you okay?"  He said, "You know, you know, you still my man, man.  And, I tell everybody wherever I go, man, you, you helped me."  And, it's funny; I said, "Did you know Quinn Buckner was a pretty good football player?"  He said, "I didn't know that."  'Cause he's still young, you know.  He only thirty-seven years old.  I said, "Look, Quinn Buckner was one heck of a football player, you know, in the State of Illinois.  And, not only football but basketball 'cause he was prep All-American in two sports."  He said, "Man, I didn't even know that, man."  I said, "Man, anything you need to know, I'll hip you to it, man."  James Brown used to call me and my brother before he went on the set.  And, James Brown, one thing I love about him, he's so humble, man.  He wanna know everything.  Want you--he'll call me, man, when I had my, I had an incident with my ear.  I have a bad inner ear and I fell out.  He would not leave the house 'til he talked to me.  He told my--he told his wife [Dorothy Brown], he said, "I'm not going anywhere until I find out Glenn's okay."  James is a hardcore Christian person.  That's good for him.  You know, he called me, he said, "Man, I had you in my prayers, man."  He said, "I'm not going nowhere 'til I talk to you, you okay?"  "I'm all right, man," J.B., man.  If I call him, I guarantee you, he will call me back.  That's guaranteed; he'll call me back.  And, like when I show you some of these pictures, you know, I'll show you me and J.B. together, and whatever.  But, he's my buddy, man, all the way.  And, always been the same, has never ever changed.  And, I'm, I'm glad for him, man.  You know, it's funny people, "Man, why won't James Brown help you get in the busi- ?" Nobody can help me get in the business.  James Brown is just a part of the business.  Let me tell you what you people don't understand in the street.  This business that we're in is a multitrillion dollar business.  They'll, they'll fire James Brown at the blink of a hat, nod, and pay him off and put somebody else in there.  They don't care about J.B.  J.B. left, that's not the first, J.B. left NBC to go--nah, he left FOX to go to the, where he is now.  Now, I know why he left.  He left because his mother [Mary Ann Brown] was sick.  His mother was passed and he wanted to go home; stay close to home.  So, he's in New York [New York] not in Los Angeles [California].  So, he comes back on the, on the commuter train.  That ain't no big thing.  Of course, James like to come, you know, he likes to collect cars and all that kind of stuff.  So, he's closer to home now.  Okay, his mom died, so that was a sad thing.  But, the whole deal is, is that, you know, you, they, something probably went down.  I guarantee you that, in this business, where he left, you know what I mean.  You know, sometimes you don't leave on your own, you know.  Sometimes somebody pushing you out the door and you'll make up some story why you left because you famous.  But, man, they don't care, man.  They do not care.

Speaker 1: Now, Kornheiser, Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon have a, like a--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one of the most popular shows ['Pardon the Interruption']--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of just talking about sports--
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: They making big bucks [dollars].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just like, what's the guy that does 'Quite Frankly' ['Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith']?  You know, from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: I know.  I can't think of his name now either.
Speaker 2: You know, it's--
Speaker 1: But, I know--
Speaker 2: It's--well, anyway, his show was cancelled.  And, I guarantee you white folks didn't like his show.  First of all, he was arrogant, confident, and knew his stuff.  And, by the way, he went to Winston-Salem [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], and played for Big House Gaines [Clarence Gaines].  Wasn't no great player but he went to Winston-Salem.  And, I really like that.  What the heck is his name?  We know his name, we can't think of it.
Speaker 1: I know.  I can't--
Speaker 2: It's, it's terrible.
Speaker 1: --I'm scrambling for it now.
Speaker 2: I'll think, soon as I walk away, I'll think of it.
Speaker 1: I know Stuart Scott is big on ESPN (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Stuart went to the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  And, he's, he's okay.  He's, he's dressed it up a little bit, put some stuff in the game.  And, you know, brought a little black colloquialism there from the hood.  People like all that stuff.  It's a bunch of entertainment.  And, Stephen A. Smith, I knew I was gonna think of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  Right, right.
Speaker 2: And, his ratings were terrible.  I couldn't believe it.  I thought his show was great.  I don't agree with everything he says but I thought his show was great.  He had all the big guest on there, and they cancelled him.
Speaker 1: He had a variety of opinions and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was good, very sharp.  But, I think this; hate to say it like this but, you gotta be said if you tru- white folks, man (laughter), "Oh, he's an arrogant nigger.  We ain't gonna have this."  His ratings were low.  People wouldn't watch him.  He was too arrogant.  Not because he wasn't good.  But, because he was all swaggered back, then he was clean as (unclear) on the board of health, "Oh, no."  And, you know, you gotta go through Nebraska and (laughter).  You gotta go through Iowa.  You gotta go through the Dakotas, and you gotta go through the South.  All those conserve- no we can't having this, man.  "I'm not watching that nigger and he talking that stuff, I can't watch him" (laughter).
Speaker 1: What do you think about the level of analysis on sports?  I mean, there's so many cliches and you see some of the same people over and over again on the air doing analysis.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Some are--I think Kornheiser and Wilbon are good.
Speaker 2: They do a good job.
Speaker 1: But, there are some people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, they go from the--
Speaker 1: --you wonder why they're doing an analysis.  They don't seem to understand what the--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Kornheiser and Michael, they're, they're print journalist, you know.  Kornheiser never played nothing in his whole life.  But, he never said he did.  (Laughter) So, you know, he never said he was a good athlete, you know.  He went to school at Binghamton College [sic. Harpur College], you know, or Binghamton University [State University of New York at Binghamton, Binghamton, New York] now.  Michael went to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  Michael knows a hundred thousand times more sports than Tony Kornheiser does.  But, it ain't about sports.  It's about entertainment.  It's about making people laugh.  And, you know, putting the mask on--you know, Kornheiser is an innately funny person anyway.  He's a typical New York [New York], Jewish kid, who actually remi- he's always complaining about something.  It's his personality.  "Well, you know, I really go to bed at eight o'clock," you know.  I said, "If you go to bed so early, how come you look so bad?"  You know, (laughter).  But, you know, he's like this, don't spend no money.  Not that, that doesn't have anything to do with Jewish.  But, I mean, he's a very frugal person, been married to the same girl for thirty something years, talks about his kids and his dog.  And, his pockets got rolls of money in it.  He ain't gotta work.  He's a columnist; he's on television; he just signed a new deal with a new radio station.  He's, you know, he writes in the city life [The Washington Post] as well as doing--I mean, he's got everything.  Man, this dude's got it made, man, filthy rich.  And, so is, and so is--they do George Michael show 'The George Michael Sports Machine.'  That's fifteen or fifteen hundred, twenty-five hundred, a show.  They do ten of them a year.  Are you kidding me?
Story_ID: 610464
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, George Michael is another personality from this area [Washington, D.C.] that's nationally known.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I know George.
Speaker 1: Now--yeah.
Speaker 2: Me, and George share the same ear doctor.  They all respect me.  I ain't never made their money but they, when they see me coming, they go like--I don't know what they saying, good or bad, but they don't play with me.  I don't do no playing.  I don't play with them.  I'm too serious.  I don't do with all that ol'--I have fun on my talk show ['Sports Talk'].  But, they respect me.  I had Trent Green on my show one night, when he was with the Redskins [Washington Redskins], of course now he plays for Kansas City [Kansas City Chiefs].  And, I had everybody on my show.  I didn't care whether they were third string.  You didn't have to be a marquee player.  So, Trent became the starting quarterback through injuries through the Redskins.  So, George asked him to come on.  But, I had asked him first.  And, the greatest respect in the world is when he came to my show.  And, George start talking about me.  But, see I don't worry about it, 'cause I know George was talking about me.  It's okay.  "What can [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris do for you?"  He said, "Well, he can't give me any money.  But, I'm going on his show because he asked me when I was a third string quarterback.  You're asking me now that I'm a first string quarterback.  I'm going on Glenn's show.  If you wanna get me later, you can get me.  But, I'm going on his show tonight."  Darrell Green, Earnest Byner, all those guys, they my buddies, man; Art Monk, you know, Charles Mann.  Just like you see a painting in there by Charles Mann.  He autographed it and gave it to me.  Darrell Green gave me his fifty-sixth interception ball.  He didn't have no more, he just gave it to me.  He said, "You have this one."  You know, Johnny Grier is one of the top referees.  He's retired now.  Johnny Grier he was one of the guys with the white hats; Dunbar High School, D.C. [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], first black referee.  The first black head linesman was Leo Miles.  Ex-NFL [National Football League] player, was the athlete director at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], good buddy of mine.  He's passed now; D.C., Cardozo High School [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], you know.  It's a lot of people in this area when you talk local here, you talk national 'cause there a lot of people here that have been a lot plac- it's a lot of sophistication in this area.  That's why this area has never really suffered like other areas.  When you come here, once you get in your clique, you ain't never going anywhere else.  This is the greatest town in America.  I'm telling you, man.  When, even in the poor days, nobody's struggling.  All you gotta do is type sixty words a minute, you can get a job.  It's a political town; political now, very political and very politically correct.
Speaker 1: Well, it's a strong culture.  People that come from here never leave here apparently 'cause you hear it everywhere you go.
Speaker 2: They don't leave.  You know why, because if you wanna be country, all you gotta do is go down the road, down here in 301 [U.S. Route 301], you in the country.  You wanna be in the city, gone to the city.  And, it's not like Chicago [Illinois] and Detroit [Michigan] where the building is so tall, you can't even see.  Or, New York [New York], you can't see the top of the nothing, you know.  And, it's real easy--you got some little rough spots, you know, they got--that's everywhere.  But, if you know where to go, 'cause D.C. ain't nothing but a circle.  It's one of the most beautiful metropolitan areas in America.
Story_ID: 610465
Speaker 1: I had one other sportscaster story, I mean, question (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for you.  Howard Cosell got in trouble when he called Michael Garrett [sic. Alvin Garrett]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a tough little monkey.  And, that was like back in the '80s [1980s], I think.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: And, what, what was--?
Speaker 2: It didn't bother me at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know why?  Because I knew he didn't mean to say that.  And--see, I'm fair; black, white or whatev- I'm a be fair.  And, you know, with my background and my diverse type of life, I'm ain't mad at nobody 'cause they married somebody.  My father [Pleasant Harris], he talking about, "I'm surprised these brothers now marrying these white girls."  Yeah, so, my daddy did too, so, you know.  So, I don't care.  It's not about that.  You don't put nothing--you know, nobody can help their parents, what they look like.  I said that earlier.  But, no, when he said that, I don't think he meant that.  'Cause he did look like a little monkey jumping around, you know.  And, when he said it, all the brothers started laughing.  And, then of course, they made it on the political tip, they made it something else.  But, if you know Cosell, and I never knew him, but I knew people that did know him.  People like Reggie Rucker and all those guys.  They knew him.  They said, "Man, Cosell was too intelligent to be that stupid."  Now, Cosell wasn't a very liked guy in the business.  He was a jerk when he wanted to be.  He was, he was very arrogant, and he thought he was smarter than everybody in the world.  But, racist, he was not, no.  He wasn't racist.  At least not to the people that he was close to.  He could've been in his own house somewhere, I don't know.  But, the people that knew him and I know a lot of boxing people, they said, he was straight ahead, man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't know nothing about no sports.  He was a lawyer who had a good time in entertainment and an opinion.  That's it.
Story_ID: 610466
Speaker 1: I've heard you say this a couple times now.  Do you think, are you of the opinion that to really know about sports, you have to have played sports?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nah, you can fake it, you know.  I mean, especially if you're a sports, if you're a, if you're a person that comes on and you're a regular anchor.  All you gotta do is read copy.  You don't have to know anything about sports.  Half of the sportscasters never played.  But, then again, a lot of sportscasters that played, they not broadcasters either.  They don't bring them on to be broadcasters.  That's why I didn't like them criticizing people like, some of the sports people that came on, Eric Dickerson.  They were talking about how bad he was.  Eric Dickerson's not a doggone broadcaster.  He's a pro-football player analyzing something.  And, I can't stand these arrogant sportscasters who think they're so cute and everybody so dumb.  I listen to it every day on radio shows.  Everybody is so stupid but you.  Nobody gets it but you.  You know who doesn't get it, you don't get it, you know.  Just like the lady the day, the other day when Prince came on during the halftime show [at Super Bowl XLI].  "What was that bunny hat on his hea- ?" It's a du rag lady!  Do your homework.  It's a black thing, you wouldn't even understand it.  It's called a du rag.  Your do is your hair.  Don't go on the hair sounding like some stupid little prickcy--what was that bow he had on his head?  I didn't understand that.  If you get black, you'll understand it, you know.  That's, that's what bring, that's when I head go like this, and I start, the third ego comes out and start getting the--from the neighborhood 700 block and Howard Road, Southeast D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  Come on now, you know.  If you don't know what you're talking about, shut up!  Don't say anything.  And, who, what's the other guy's name that comes on, that says, "Talk smack," that says, what the other, what's the guy that comes on, that's still on the air?
Speaker 1: On--Dan Patrick, or?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Patrick is okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, what's the guy that's got his own talk show?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Just like Stephen A. Smith, white kid, good guy, thinks he's all hip and everything.  He was putting Prince down talking about Prince is the--man, Prince is a uni- Prince is like Frankie Beverly, every time you hear Prince, he can sing the same song and you'll be all right.  Nobody every talks about Prince getting in trouble.  He's a millionaire.  He owns the City of Minneapolis [Minnesota], and he's almost close to fifty years old, quiet as it's kept; he's in his forties now.  Still looks good.  Still sharp, and still can play that guitar, piano, writes music and gets paid.  And, they talking about how he--and this guy was talking about him in that kind of arrogant way.  Man, give that man credit for being the professional that he is.  I know your commentary is your opinion because all my commentary I always say, "And, that's the way I see it.  I'm [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris."  And, that's the way he sees it.  But don't, don't do that.  It's, it's not even correct what you're saying.  That ain't even opinionated.  What you should be saying is Prince still hanging there after all these years; haven't molested no babies.  Yeah, he a little weird, he wild--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but, so what.  He's a businessman.  Plus, he was an ex-little basketball player in high school, you know; played a little ball, you know.  So, please.  Not, I'm not talking about Roy Firestone 'cause I like him.  But, what's the other guy's name.
Speaker 1: I can't--I don't know.
Speaker 2: You, you know what?
Speaker 1: I'd probably know if I heard it, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you'll see, you'll see him on television, that's the one Glenn was talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  Because, you know, he's out in California, real laid back, dress nice, all cool, we know him.  I can't think of his name right now.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this--
Speaker 2: --anyway.
Speaker 1: This is one--
Speaker 2: He burns me up sometimes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, he's okay.  He's good (laughter).
Story_ID: 610467
Speaker 1: What are some of your hope and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I wish our kids would do more independent study.  That's how you get educated; through independent study.  Man, school is basically pretty rote.  And, college is only important when you start learning your major.  Because then you start getting into something that you're really passionate about.  And, if you're with good teachers, they can teach you what they know.  And, if you have any kind of mindset to go into that major and the aptitude to pick it up, you'll get it.  Because that's what you really wanna do.  If you wanna be a lawyer, you're gonna be a good lawyer.  You wanna be an attorney or whatever.  Not because somebody forced you in here, because you want to be that.  Whatever major that they offer in these colleges and universities none of them are bad majors, they're all good majors.  Just because people look at being a lawyer, doctor, English teacher, and all that, as some kind of marquee major.  There is no marquee major.  The marquee major is what you like.  And, that's why they offer it.  And, they have theory to that.  And, enjoy yourself while you're doing it.  Because school ain't nothing but one place to make some money; that's all.  You at--you go get an academic trade rather than be a, you know, a carpenter or rather than be a plumber, or rather than put up some, some wall board or whatever, where you can make a lot of money.  So, you go to college.  Then you get you an academic trade, then you make money, and you get paid so that you can live the life you wanna live.  Or, you maybe into science, and you love science.  You may come up with some, who knows, you may do some inventions or something that can make some money for the world.  But, you gotta have a passion for it, you know.  You just can't have major because you, "Well, I'm just doing this major and so I--," whatever.  Okay.  But, if you could sprint off from that most majors where you really don't have to do a lot, you just kind of put 'em in, in you know, smorgasbord, it's allied arts.  Allied arts.  Well, what the heck is allied arts?  That's everything.  It's really liberal arts.  You just, it's a lot of everything.  You could--if you got any intelligence, you can spring off of that.  But, what most African American youngster have to do, they gotta read.  I cannot believe that we got computers and all of that today, and kids don't have a clue who nothing is.  We didn't have that mess when we was growing up.  Well, we didn't know any better, we didn't have any computers.  But, this generation--see, in my opinion, the [U.S.] military draft made us better people.  Now, I'm not a military person.  I know what military's about.  It's about war.  It's about setting up for war.  But, the military gave you so many things.  Free education, free home, the right to buy a house when you got out, travel the world, see the world, be a leader, become an full bird corner--colonel, an E-8, a top sergeant, or whatever.  See, if you look back in your history, the Moors civilized Spain.  The Moors civilized Italy, civilized it.  Historians know that black folks used to run the whole, man.  Used to be military powers.  They get nervous, baby.  They say, "Let's stop the draft.  We can't have these brothers running up in here."  Now, not all of us like the draft.  But, some of us did.  When we got in, we stayed in.  See, when you're in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] when--during my time in D.C., you had to take ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in the tenth grade.  So, all of our guys in Vietnam was squad leaders; all of 'em.  Because we already knew our rifle manual.  We already knew how to do this.  We already knew how to go trail arms, and a-ten-hut, and port arms, and right shoulder, left shoulders; we knew all that from the tenth grade.  I know it now; been fifty years ago, almost.  See, so, they say, "Oh, no."  Drug epidemic hit, epidemic hit, "Oh, they'll kill themselves in about twenty-five years," and that's what happened.  Now, their pants all down on their backside.  You see, the crack of the ass hanging out, drawers hanging out all on their pants.  Which is all a penitentiary thing, they don't know it though.  They don't know the origin of the pants hanging down.  It really is about the boys who got raped in prison.  And, their pants hung down because they took the belts from the boys because they were hanging themselves.  And, these stupid fools are emulating that.

Speaker 1: I don't knock the rap music.  It's cool.   That's an art form.  Most of the good rap artist; the Jay Zs and all these people, the LL Cool J, these guys are businessmen.  They rich as I don't know what, man.  Not these little funk balls running around, "Yeah, I can rap, man.  I can rap."  Man, we've been rapping for centuries.  Look at our people, man.  Look at our lineage in slavery.  Look at the code words that we used to talk.  That's all rap music.  Gospel music is rap music.  When you hear [HistoryMaker] Donnie McClurkin and all them, they rapping, boom, bam.  They been that for cen- ain't nothing new.  I tell these youngsters, "You the only thing knew, you born in the '90s [1990s] and '80s [1980s], you new."  Dumb as hell.  Read.  Do some independent study.  Read something.  I don't go in a room unless I look at the walls.  I see how good teachers are.  I'm a see what they got on the walls.  Half the kids, they ain't even look at the wall the whole year.  I did a quote from a wall one time when I was speaking to a group of kids excuse me for spitting, my mouth getting dry, they didn't know what I was talking about.  I said, "There is the word right there, son."  Don't even know it.  Now, I know there's some dysfunctional lives in the neighborhood, man.  I know they got some crack mamas out there.  They were born crack babies.  They taking Ritalin, and everything, man.  Dumping 'em in these public schools, talking about what they can and can't do.  I know it.  But, as I tell the youngsters, man.  "What choice you gonna make, brother?  What are you gonna do?"  You know what federal time is now, 85 percent.  You get thirty years, you gonna do thirty, you'll do thirty.  You want your life wasted away.  You know how much they pay on witness protection?  Three thousand a week, you know.  You gonna get fifty, or you gonna snitch.  I'd be in Arizona, my name a be John Brown (laughter), you know.  Now, I know somebody look at me and say, "Oh, you snitching?"  Naw, I ain't never did no snitching.  But, I'm just saying I made a choice not to get into those kind of things where I didn't have to snitch.  I'm not doing it, you know.  I call 'em dope fiend crimes, go around sticking up the 7-Eleven, going around killing somebody who ain't got no more than you have.  What kind of ignorance is that?  They crazy, man.  But, you know what?  They like being called crazy so I don't give 'em that.  I don't call 'em crazy.  You know who's crazy?  Me.  I'm the crazy one 'cause I ain't telling you what I'm a do, you know.  I've been lucky in this area where people respect me, and they see me and they don't hate on me because they always figure, "Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris may put it in his work, man, he in the hood all the time.  He around the way."  When I walk over here to the neighborhood malls and stuff they go like, "Man, you, where's your--you got, you got anybody with you man, you all right?"  "Yeah, I'm okay, man.  I grew up right around the corner."  Which one, you know--they just think that I'm this bigtime.  I'm not any of that.  I happen to have a high profile job.  But, I'm not all that.  I'm just a regular dude like everybody else.
Story_ID: 610469
Speaker 1: Yeah sir, when you look back on everything you've done 'til this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I think now because I--see, I think what's so important for people is how you treat other people.  I've had my ups and downs but I never treated anybody bad.  I can get just as cold as anybody else, if I have to.  But, I don't ever think it's necessary to have to.  Like I said, I use the word organic all the time.  I'm an organ- I can almost read people like I read a book.  I can almost tell how people are and I always--like in the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball], they pitch to your weakness.  I talk to your weakness.  I'll go with you on things that make you feel better about the things that you're thinking.  Because you've been taught to think the way we think in this world.  We--everything is learned.  All behavior is learned.  All I ask people to do is think.  So, when I talk to people all the time and they'll feel bad about certain things I said, "Have you ever learned to care about yourself?"  When you're in a relationship, the more you care about yourself, the better your mate is gonna feel about you, and vice versa.  Even if he or she has problems, if you're feeling good, they're gonna somehow feel good.  But, if they have their issues over--you know, outweigh that then they'll go back into their shells again and they need to find themselves the way they need to find them.  I have never had a relationship with any woman where I didn't have, make 'em laugh, have some fun, I'm not the greatest clean up guy in the world, (laughter), maybe that's, maybe that's a deterrent.  But, other than that, being cruel or disrespectful or trying to hurt somebody, it ain't in me, man.  Now, alter ego can be that way.  But, I don't want, I don't want him, I keep him out, that's the other Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris].  I don't want that.  Because that ego could show up at a time when I think he's necessary to show up, you know.  So, I keep him in reserve.  But, I think people--when you, when you take a person's pride and dignity from them, that's worst, that's as bad as taking a dollar out his pocket.  Because if you ain't got nothing else in the world, you got some dignity and some pride in yourself.  And, if people would just keep that and love themselves; you ain't gotta go to church for that.  But, that's all they tell you.  That's all church is.  To keep giving you the confidence that you need to know who you are.  That's all the Bible is.  It's a book that gives you foundation; the Koran [Qur'an], the Bible, Talmud, you name it, whatever it is.  It is a book to give you a process in how you should hopefully live your life, as written down by other men.  It's only their opinion, and if you're a thinker, that's how you'll do.  And, it'll be fun learning things, learning new stuff.  It's amazing, man, when you expose people to things.  I love doing that.  I love telling people, a twenty-one year old.  Twenty-one year old kids don't know anything.  When you tell 'em something they go like, "Oh, I never thought of that."  Well, how could you?  Last week you was twelve years old.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You weren't thinking of nothing.  But, when you become a mentor to somebody, and you ain't gotta be following them around all the time.  When they ask you something, just hit 'em with that--hit with the right, the deal, the hardcore truth.  Tell 'em the truth.  I guarantee you, you'll have them calling you twenty years from now saying, "You know what, you told me something, man, that's--."  Let me tell you something, I've done over five hundred speeches, well actually over a thousand speeches, many, many, places.  And, I've have people come--, "Man, you spoke at my elementary school.  You spoke at my junior high.  Man, you spoke at my graduation."  One lady saw me in the store one day, said, "Mr. Harris, how you doing?  I know you don't remember me, you spoke at my ninth grade graduation."  I said, "Oh, how you doing?  What are you doing now?"  "Working on my Ph.D."  I said, "Good gracious.  How old are you know?"  She said, "I'm twenty-eight."  See, three things you can't get back: time, opportunity, and words.  You can't get 'em back (laughter).  And, on that, I can't get that good time; that was good time to see that young lady develop like that.
Story_ID: 610470
Speaker 1: That's why I always tell people, "Man, watch what you say, man, you can't take that back."  Especially, if you think you love somebody or you like somebody, don't be saying nothing to hurt their feelings now.  Unless they're forgiving people, you can't take back what you said.  I didn't mean to say that.  Well, you did at the time, but now I will accept your apology though.  That's when you're human, man.  When you're a human being, you know.  Now, alter ego takes over, you hurt my family, you do something to my people, I can't forgive you.  You kill somebody in my family, you know how people be talking about in--you can't bring 'em back now.  In the court, "I forgive you."  Unh-uh baby, I hope you rot in the jail that you getting ready to go to.  Or, I hope you fall on something and maybe hit you up under here and choke you half to death 'cause you killed my son, my daughter.  You hurt somebody in my family, that's, that's alter ego.  But, anything else, I can kind of pretty much put up with it and say, "You know what, I forgive you."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, when you hurt my family, I can't forgive you.  Now, I don't care what you said about, "Well, you know, I didn't have no mother and father."   I don't care nothing about none of that.  You kill my daughter, or my son, I can't even say on camera what I'm thinking, you know.  That's the other side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the 700 block of Howard Road, and 5th [Street] and Alabama Avenue, and some of the dudes I grew up with that didn't take the time to stop.  They did what they did, and I ain't never done that, but I'm capable of doing a lot of stuff if it ain't right.  But, I don't wanna be in that.  I don't wanna go to jail.  I don't wanna, I don't wanna do it.  I don't wanna be nasty and bad and wrong; I don't wanna do all that.  So, I didn't do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, so, that's the choice I made.
Story_ID: 610471
Speaker 1: Tell me this, when you look back on everything you've done 'til this point, again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Honesty, fairness, being--and loyal.  I'm loyal to a point where I'll actually hurt myself.  But, if I know you tricking me, already got you.  If you chump me, I've already checkmated you all the time.  I call it reverse projection.  You know, my wife, my second wife, who used to criticize a lot.  She used to always say, "You know, you ain't So and So."  I knew she wasn't talking about me.  She was talking about herself.  (Laughter) I already knew that.  So, my skin, I got a tattoo on my wrist here, only I got a lot of tattoos.  But, this one right here is the best representer of all.  This represents how tough my skin was, right there.  Because you can't hurt me, man.  Only me can hurt me.  And, only my family can hurt me.  You talk about me, you can't hurt me, man.  I can't help how I look.  I can't help who my daddy [Pleasant Harris] and mommy [June Puckett Harris] was.  I can't help the color of my skin.  I can't help my height, my hair, nothing.  So, what you're saying to me, why would, why would you think you're hurting my feelings?  In D.C. [Washington, D.C.] we call it joning.  I don't know what they call it around the world--the country.  But, in the black hood it's joning.  By said, "Man, don't even jon on Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris].  He don't even get his feelings hurt."  Why?  Because I validated myself real early in life.  I'm not a jealous person.  I'm not uptight.  I'm not jealous of nobody's woman.  I never was jealous of my own women; never.  I think women wanted me to be jealous just because that meant, I cared.  Well, I do care.  But, I'm trying to give you your space.  I'm trying to give you what you're not gonna get with other the learned behavior people that think they supposed to be in your face every second.  My wife, used to go away on trip to Bahamas whatever.  I say, "Man, did y'all have a good time, if I couldn't go?"  That's all I wanna know.  I ain't asking no other questions.  I might hear the truth (laughter).  So, I said, "Hey did y'all have a nice time?  Good."  I ain't never had no beat up looking wife.  So, I know somebody said something to 'em.  But, that's, you know, I don't own 'em.  When they go away, they come back.  "I'll see you when you get back," you know.  I always was a good boyfriend and a good husband.  Maybe I wasn't a great husband.  Maybe that's why they left me.  I don't know.  But, it wasn't 'cause I mistreated anybody.  So, my legacy is, that--if you talk to any of my wives, they'll tell you, "Nah, he had some shortcomings but it wasn't--he was okay."  Maybe it was something missing.  Could've been.
Story_ID: 610472
Speaker 1: But I understand everything.  I try to understand just about anything that's humanly possible about a human being.  Look, I even had a friend talk about me one time (laughter), and they--I'm so connected in this town [Washington, D.C.], you can't talk about me, somebody gonna tell me.  So, I walked to him and I said, "You talking about me, man?"  "Nah, man, I ain't talking."  I said, "Yes, you did.  You talked about me."  But, here, here's the deal, now, if you're threatened by me, I can go in the other room and we don't have to talk at all.  Or, we can squash this right now.  "I'm a ask you a question, did you talk about me?"  He said, "No."  I said, "I believe you.  It's over."  He talked about me.  But, now me and him are like this (gesture).  "I'm a find out who told me?"  "No, you can't.  You'll never find out."  Because the people he told, didn't tell me.  Somebody else got it from them (laughter).  So, only one he could know or go to and say, "Did you tell [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris so and so?"  They gonna say, "No, I didn't tell 'em."  "How did he find out then?"  They not gonna tell.  So, we're friends now.  I know how people can get upset, and jealous and threatened.  Especially, me.  My job, my second job was almost appointed by a guy name Vincent Gray, who's one of our, one of our city councilman.  He wanted me on the second job.  Not that I didn't quality for it.  I qualified for it.  I went in, interviewed well, filled out my application.  We have the things in the government call ranking factors, filled them out perfectly.  But, I was gonna get the job anyway.  Why?  Because, I'm Glenn Harris.  I paid my dues and I made contributions to the community and that's where he wants me, so he put me in.  And, they knew it.  So, the guy was talking about, "Man, you talking about (unclear)."  Don't talk about me, man.  Don't talk to me about no Vincent Gray 'cause he gonna call me and tell me.  So, here it is, when you find out how thorough I really am, you gonna like.  You know why?  Because I don't talk about people, man, unh-uh.  Unless they say something about me.  Then I'm a say something back.  I'm a be a man about it.  Not no fighting and all that gangster stuff.  I'm just gonna be a man.  When I was away--I'm--when I was working at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], I had over five hundred students a year work for me.  Five and six graduate assistants.  None of 'em will say anything bad about me.  You know why?  'Cause I treat 'em like human beings.  I'm not gonna threaten your job every time I see you.  You fifty-seven years old, I'm talking to you and you gotta pay your house note and I'm a threaten your job.  I'm your boss.  I'm not here to threaten your job.  I'm here to tell you how you can get better.  How we gonna do this?  We gonna get better with this.  I'm not in there, in no corporate setting, sitting back talking about, "Our jobs are--." I don't wanna hear that.  Who--what worker wants to hear that?  If you--if I give you an assignment, you don't wanna do it, you have the right to tell me that you don't wanna do this assignment.  Now, you gotta do it now.  But, I'm not gonna get mad at you because you say, "You know, Glenn, I don't wanna do this."  I said, "Well, here's the assignment, this what you gotta do.  Okay.  If you don't wanna do it, just tell me, sit down and tell me why you don't wanna do it.  I'll listen to you."  I'm not gonna write you up for insubordination because you're a grown man or a grown woman and you wanna express your opinion to me.  It's not fair.  It's not right.  But, if you don't do that job, now, then we got a case.  'Cause I asked you to do it, or I told you to do it because I'm your supervisor.  You might not like it, but somebody gotta do it.  You gotta do it.  So, I'm picking you.  Maybe for experience, maybe because you're next in line.  But, I'm not gonna fire you.  I'm not here to take your job.  So, don't worry about your job.  Worry about our relationship, how we can work through this.  I'm not here to tell about--I'm sick and tired of sitting in corporate meeting and all they talk about, "You know, this accountability, your job is on the line."  "Man, I'm sixty years old, man.  Don't tell me about no job on the line."  I'm scared to death talking about somebody's job.  When people get fired, they know why they got fired.  But, don't just fire somebody and you treat 'em nasty, they walk in with a sawed off shotgun and shoot everybody in the whole office.  That's how I think.  I'm think like, hold it.  Y'all corporate dudes, y'all must ain't seen nobody walk through that front door that ain't making $3 million a year and you just took his job.  And, his family out there.  He got nothing to live for but them.  "You don't get it, do you?"  I went to GEICO [Government Employees Insurance Company] one time, you heard of GEICO insurance?  I was a guest speaker there one day.  Got fifteen hundred [dollars] for that.  And, I did, I did a mock thing and I told this guy who was sitting down there, he told me his name.  Look just like the brother [Matthew Hickey] here running the camera.  He was this nice guy, sitting there.  Told me his name.  I say, Jerry, I'll say.  I said, "Jerry, supposed I told you, 'Get your keys and get outta here.  I want you to get your keys, bring 'em to me, give me your drawer and get out of my office.'"  He started getting pissed off.  I said, "Man, it's just hypothetical."  But, you see what I mean, when corporate comes down and tells you something like that.  I said, "You wanted to hit me, didn't you?"  He did like this, "I did man, I'm sorry."  "No, you don't have to apologize. I'm just giving an example."  We're human beings, man.  We ain't treating nobody like no human beings in this world.  It's not fair.  It's not right.  You treat people like human beings, and you'll get better results outta anybody when you kind of understand their plight in life.  Everybody's plight ain't the same.  Every church I ever spoke at, when I spoke and the way I spoke it, all those pastors were doing me like this (nods head), 'cause they know the deal, man.
Story_ID: 610473
Speaker 1: Tell me about your community activities.  You're involved in a lot of different community activities here in the city [Washington, D.C.], so.  This--
Speaker 2: Man, I've been to boys clubs [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America] for bar mitzvahs.  I've spoke at national groups, churches, I'm no big deal.  It's my words.  "Glenn [HistoryMaker Glenn Harris], can you come by and inspire our kids?"  It's 'cause I'm on TV.  If I wasn't on television, it would be no big deal.  I've done community stuff before, but when you're on television, it's bigger than life, man.  People don't even know I work at Channel 8 [NewsChannel 8, Washington, D.C.].  They think I work at ESPN.  They said things, "Yeah, he on the sports channel."  It ain't no sports channel.  I listen to you every day.  I only come on three days a week.  I used to come on every day.  But, now it's three days a week for the last four years.  But, see they take a promo--they may see me on a promo.  "Hi, I'm Glenn Harris, don't forget to watch 'Sports Talk with Glenn Harris' ['Sports Talk'].  Hey, you're opinions, call me, I'll be there," or something like that.  "I saw you on television.  Man, I saw you yesterday morning."  I ain't been on in the morning, man, in twenty years.  But, they don't know it.  They just see you on TV.  Now, they might have run a promo in the morning.  But, they think it's a show (laughter), they don't know.  Most people don't have a clue, man.  Fans, when they talking about sports--they don't know what they talking about.  They don't know no insi-  "Man, I think So and So ought to be playing."  "Are you at practice?"  Do you know what the guy knows and what he doesn't know?"  "No."  They just want him to be playing.  I understand it.  So, I just say, "Yeah, okay.  Well, that's, that's, just good," you know.  But, don't talk about somebody you don't know.  Like the guy talked about Jon Gruden the other day to one of the sports guys on a national radio show.  "He's a bum."  Wait a minute, don't say that about Jon Gruden.  You don't know Jon Gruden.  Don't say he's a bum.  You wanna say he's not a good coach.  Don't say--this man is a family man.  This man is a good man.  Jon Gruden is a good man, and a class man.  Just like Tony Dungy is.  Just like Lovie Smith is.  These guy are good guys, but we don't know.  We don't know what's happening.  Warren Moon was the nicest guy in the world, 'til his wife [Felicia Hendricks Moon] got him wrong.  He went right upside her head.  We don't why he did it.  We weren't there.  You know how some relationships can get.  Sometime you got to go upside somebody's head.  I'm not trying to do it.  But, people do it.  Because you don't know what pushed a person over.  You don't know.   I got a friend just now, Todd Bozeman, the coach of Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  He just freaked out, last night--the night before last.  They lost a game.  He went in a restaurant.  It's in the paper today, in The Post [The Washington Post].  Todd?  Todd coached at the University of California [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  They blackballed him for ten years because of recruiting violations.  He gets a job at Morgan.  His first job in ten years.  But, then, why is Todd changed?  He used to be a real Christian guy, straight edge.  Now he's different.  Father died; maybe that affected him.  I don't know why.  I know Todd don't need this.  But, you know what?  I don't care what he did, I'm his friend.  I'm a say, "Man, I don't know what you did.  I don't know how.  But, I got your back."  I told him that in California.  I told Eddie Jordan, that coach of the Bullets [Washington Bullets], the Wizards [Washington Wizards], "I don't care you win no games, man.  You graduated from Rutgers University [The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and you from the hood; and, I love you man, you my friend."  James Brown, I don't care if James Brown don't do nothing right on television, I still like him.  I still like Gus [Gus Johnson].  I like all of 'em, you know.  And, I know some of 'em are in there because they're ordinary sportscasters.  Some of my white brethren, I know.  But, I like 'em anyway.  They good guys, you know.  They didn't hire themselves.  They got hired because of, hey, whatever (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 610474
Speaker 1: Tell, now is there anything I have not ask, before I ask my last questions?  Is there anything I have not asked you that you think you need to address before I ask the last one?
Speaker 2: Nah.  I guess not.  And, this your show, man.  So, you--I can't think of it--
Speaker 1: Nah, it's your interview.  It's not really (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I know but if I was on the other side--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You can't cover everything.  I mean, you, all you could do is the best you can, you know.  You can't--I mean, a person's life is so diverse, man, you--there is so many little small corners and crevices that you can talk about.  We ain't talked about my dark side yet (laughter).  But, nah, but, I can't trying to get into that part of me, (laughter) though.
Speaker 1: The alter ego.
Speaker 2: All of us--
Speaker 1: Keep (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  All of that's the other side, you know.  The--all of us, we got a little freak in us, we gonna like, you know, that's a little street rap there (unclear).  But, you know, we do, we do, all of us do, that don't nobody know about.  And, sometimes we let it go.  Sometime we don't.  Maybe write a tell all book that, you know, you pay us a lot of money, we'll tell it all, you know.  But, I'm a wait 'til I'm ninety (laughter) so if they make fun of me then I don't care (laughter), you know.  But, no, we all have that side to us.  All of us have some kind of side but we say, "You know what?  I can't telling nobody what I just did," (laughter) you know, so.  Hey, that's just a human thang, you know, so.  That's another part.  We've done so many things in our lives, whether they're up or down.  And, we got secrets that we ain't gonna ever tell.  We said, "Nah, I don't think I'm a tell this.  I don't think that people are that understanding," (laughter), you know.   But, maybe one day somebody'll be that understanding and know what you know, and you'll, and you'll say, "Yeah, man, I did that,"  (laughter), you know what I mean?  And, you won't feel bad about it.  But, but the world isn't ready yet.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Some people will probably tell me, well, I don't care how they remember me.  I know what I did, the best I could.  All I could say is, I did the best I could, whatever I did.  I was strong willed.  I said what I felt.  But, I was fair.  I was a fair guy, you know.  I always give everybody sort of the benefit of the doubt to be a, to be a imperfect human being.  'Cause we ain't perfect.  And, I always wanna make sure that even though a person isn't perfect, I understand that person.  Even to the point of, of the dark side.  But, when you start hurting other people, if you gonna be the dark side, if you wanna be a criminal, or you wanna play the game, mess with the people in the game.  Don't mess with the people outside of the game.  Because you're a stick up boy, don't go stick up my grandmother, who ain't in no game.  What pecking order to you get by killing her?  Or, going upside somebody's head in a 7-Eleven.  Or, robbing somebody, you sticking a pistol in their back getting two dollars from 'em, talking about, "You know what time it is?"  Nah, man, that ain't right.  That's not right.  I don't like that.  All I'm saying is that I wanna be a fair person, and I'm a give you the ultimate benefit of the doubt.  But, when you start hurting people, killing people, I can't forgive you for that, man.  I can--I'm unforgiving when it comes to that, you know.  And, but, I love nature, man.  I love taking pictures.  I love sunsets.  I love suns, I love going outside for twenty minutes and say it's an exhilarating day, but it's cold, I'm going back inside.  I'm a person that I'm so validated in myself that I can sit and look at television for forty-eight straight hours.  They said, "Man, doesn't that dull your brain?"  Nope 'cause I can go to sleep when I get tired of looking, if I want to.  Or, I can wake up and go out and get in my truck and drive away.  I can't even afford the truck I'm driving--well, yes I can.  But, I'm driving it 'cause I want to, 'cause it was my dream truck and I got it.  And, I got two jobs and I'm working every day.  And, my son [Jason Harris] said, "Pops you always doing something for somebody else.  Man, do something for yourself, man."  So, I'm stretched out, but I don't care.  As long as I pay this house note, keep this roof over my head with this cold venue here that we're in (laughter) right now.  I don't know what's wrong with this heat down here, but we're freezing.  But, that's all I want, man.  I'm very, very simple, man.  And, easy to please; low maintenance.  That's [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris.  Really.  And, I didn't even realize that you even knew all this stuff about me.  And, I know one of guys recommended me and all of that.  But, I didn't even know, you showed me a list, I didn't even know all this.  I didn't know any of--that you knew all this about me.  And, when I started getting my scrapbooks together, and one day I'll show you guys if you ever got an opportunity to see all my scrapbooks and letters, and thousands of letters and recommendations and accommodations and awards, I didn't even know I had done all that.  And, I had it stacked up in a closet.  And, I said, "Let me put this in a book."  Seventeen scrapbooks.  I call it my life in bits and pieces.  You just, all you gotta do is just keep going, man, things gonna happen, you know.  But, when you don't love yourself, and you don't validate yourself, then you got another journey to take that might take thirty years.  So, I tried to get out early, man.

Speaker 1: And, I'm disappointed about a lot of things that happened, man.  I didn't get married to get no divorce.  But, I also understand that nothing is forever; nothing.  They ask me, "What have you learned by being married three times?"  Nothing is forever.  Marriage is not forever.  That's what they say it is.  But, people are different.  And, when you finish your mission in whatever relationship you have, it is time to do something else.  It really is.  And, soulmates, little overrated.  But, a soulmate, a true soulmate is the only one that can keep you forever, because you'll believe in that person like they believe in you.  And, you'll be validated together.  But, most people are not like that.  And, that doesn't mean they don't love each other.  Doesn't have anything to do with that.  It means that we're different and we go like this (gesture).  But, what we do is we don't break up in a mature way, we break up in a war like way, which we've been taught to do.  "Who you going with?  You out with somebody?"  Probably not even having nothing to do with that.  It ain't about how you love somebody, good or bad.  It's what you're willing to accept.  Because even a lot of people stick around abusive relationships because when you're with somebody long enough, you become that person.  Whatever they do to you is okay.  Because you've been with 'em so long.  And, we lazy basically as people, we don't even wanna start another relationship.  So, we stay in the one we with.  That's reckless and terrible, some women getting their butts whipped; some men getting their butts whipped.  And, they just don't wanna leave.  It's that--man, "I got all this around here, I got invested, I don't feel like going nowhere."  But, if you got courage and you don't look back, you can take a walk, man.  But, in our society, it's hard to do it because we haven't been taught that.  We've been taught to tell white lies, we been taught to be deceptive, and allusive.  And, I ain't never wanna be like that.  I have (laughter) 'cause I'm human.  But, I didn't wanna be like that.  Because we always afraid we're gonna hurt somebody's feelings.  But, you know what it is, our feelings are gonna get hurt anyway (laughter), so.  But, maturity, not because we fifty-seven, sixty, whatever, it's maturity, period.  You know how you see some young people with old souls?  Some--they're exceptional.  They've matured to the point where you say, "God, man, at twenty-five years old, he couldn't be that mature."  But, they are, you know.  And, I also like conversation.  I tell youngster all the time, even a hoochie want conversation.  Talk to people.  Talk to people.  Find out what's what.  You'd be surprise how you can change a person over if you just talk with them.  That's all they wanna do is hear what you gotta say.  But, have something to say.  And, the word, I don't know, don't get it all the time.  'Cause if you don't know, you become boring after a while.  And people go like, "He don't know anything.  I guess I'll see you later, so."  All that in a nutshell as you can get, as you look at this, I guess you can start breaking it down and editing some things and making it sound like it made some sense.  I appreciate y'all doing me, man (laughter).
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, really.
Speaker 1: Yeah, man.
