Story_ID: 669597
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history. This is probably gonna be the hardest part of it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, always is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--yeah, it always is. I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Annie Mae Ward [Annie Ward]; Annie, A-N-N-I-E; Mae, M-A-E; Ward, W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: All right. And what is her date of birth and place?
Speaker 2: I don't have that information on mind right now, but she only lived to be about fifty-three years of age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And died in the 1960s.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And, where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born also in Lunenburg County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what can you tell us about your mother's ancestors? How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I've attempted to develop a tree, and she came from the Turner family [ph.]. The Turner family has a much longer history as I have been able to determine, and their roots will go back into northeastern North Carolina, but they moved here, into Virginia, the later part of the, I would say 19th century, and spent most of their time in Charlotte County [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Now, in Charlotte County, okay. What kind of work did they do?
Speaker 2: They were basically farmers.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there any stories that are passed down from your mother's side of the family about what life was like in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, certainly life was tough because they were poor people and none of them had a formal education, including my mother, and we were an intact family. The grandmother (background noise) I remember very faintly on my--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay. Was your mother's maiden name Turner?
Speaker 1: Ward.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was Ward, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, her mother married a Henry Ward [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --and so she took the name Ward and so, from that point on, we have the Wards. You know I have five--four brothers, five boys, four brothers, two are deceased [Clarence Ward and Frank Ward] and three of us are alive [HistoryMaker William E. Ward, Samuel Ward and Bernard Ward].
Speaker 2: Okay, are you--I'll ask you about them later, but in terms of the ancestors here, you say they were farmers and life was pretty tough.
Speaker 1: Pretty tough, domestic farmers, sharecroppers working for others, never (unclear) on us, and the--in the old southern tradition, you know black families that worked on farms ultimately were given some squatter rights and although all of the members of the family had now either died or moved away, I do have a brother who lives there in their home--(audio disturbance) home site.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Perpetual living rites.
Speaker 2: Okay. And the old, old place is in Charlotte--
Speaker 1: Charlotte County, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right (audio disturbance). Did your mother have (audio disturbance) any stories about growing up that she shared (audio disturbance) with you?
Speaker 1: She didn't share a lot of stories and that's the missed part of my life. We didn't do a lot of discussing of, of that. I know she was a hard worker. She did a lot of domestic work. She also worked on the dairy farm, but prior to that I don't have a lot of history.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now, did she have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 1: No, no education.
Speaker 2: Okay, none? Okay. This is something that happens rarely when we're doing this. She had no--none?
Speaker 1: None. None, none, none.
Speaker 2: Okay, no education. And--now is--did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew--well, I got to know my uncles well, and aunts, and to a degree, faintly remember my grandfather, Henry Ward.
Speaker 2: Okay. So you really don't know much about them other than--
Speaker 1: No, because during my early years, my formative years, I lived in the town of Keysville [Virginia]. My mother worked for a family, the Pettus, P-E-T-T-U-S, family, a white family, as a domestic, and so we lived there in town. I shared a room in their house.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. So she had (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I had very little, I had very little contact with--during the early days with my paternal parents, grand- or grandparents.
Story_ID: 669598
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: No information at all.
Speaker 1: None?
Speaker 2: No information at all.
Speaker 1: All right, okay. (Pause) So nobody, nobody talked about him, or--
Speaker 2: No information at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I mean, I've tried.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I'm not trying to be evasive. I've tried to find out and my brothers have tried and the oldest brother is now dead. He had more family history than any of us, and so, no I don't. I really don't.
Speaker 1: You've got four brothers?
Speaker 2: I have four brothers, two are alive [Samuel Ward and Bernard Ward], two are deceased [Clarence Ward and Frank Ward]. And we always lived apart I should add too, the brothers, two of us lived together, two of them lived up on the farm, and then the other one lived with another caretaker, family.
Speaker 1: Okay, you say even when you were growing up you didn't, you weren't around your brothers?
Speaker 2: Not that often, rarely that we'd get together, maybe for some holiday or something of that nature, we would all go to the home place, and my oldest brother and the other two brothers who are now alive. We bonded more so in later age, in later life. The two living brothers, now, we have a very close relationship, but during those early years it was a very distant relationship, not by choice but because of circumstances.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, do y'all have the same father, do you know that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: In some instances, yes, others maybe not.
Story_ID: 669599
Speaker 1: But you lived with your mother [Annie Ward] most of the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I lived--always lived with my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did, did you consider yourself the lucky one, I mean, to live with her?
Speaker 2: I, looking back, I would think so. I guess I was the chosen one. The family with which my mother worked and lived adopted me and throughout my developmental age, they always supported me both in education and otherwise. And at age eight, when I lost my eye and was getting an artificial eye because of an accident--
Speaker 1: Now tell, tell us what happened, what happened?
Speaker 2: This is one of the rare times when all of the brothers and cousins were playing together down at the Ward family's at Lunburg--at Lunenburg [Lunenburg County, Virginia], and we were out in the field, a corn field that had been cleared, and some figured it's the way I fell on the cornstalk that jammed into my right eye. And for a day or so, my mother and others didn't know what to do. She walked all the way to Keysville, Virginia and the Pettuses came and carried me to Southside Hospital [Centra Southside Community Hospital] in Farmville, Virginia, where they removed the eye, replaced it with an artificial eye.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, they did that right away?
Speaker 2: A couple days later, as I recall and as the stories were told.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that s- that sounds like a horrible experience to be--
Speaker 2: A horrifying experience.
Speaker 1: --to be eight years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 669600
Speaker 1: What we normally do is start you know with your first childhood memory. Now, do you have a, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The earliest childhood memories would be growing up in the town of Keysville [Virginia] in, in the Pettus house, and you know, I was cared for, and my mother [Annie Ward] cared for me and they developed an affinity for me, the Pettuses. They didn't have any children, never had children, and they always took me under their wing, particularly Mrs. Pettus. As I grew older, she helped me with my lessons, taught me, helped to teach me to read. And playing with other kids in the neighborhood, and where we lived, basically the kids I played with up to about age twelve, except when I went to school, with white kids.
Speaker 1: Okay now, okay so you, you actually went to school with white children.
Speaker 2: No, no, no. I did not go to school with white children (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay. You didn't.
Speaker 2: No, but in the neighborhood, because in the low part of town where we lived was all white.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you played with all the white kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. But this was a black mother and her son living in the house, in a white household and all the kids around, naturally, were white kids.
Speaker 1: Now, that's something that, well correct me if I'm wrong, it wasn't that uncommon in those days for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not that uncommon.
Speaker 1: --a woman to live with the people she worked for.
Speaker 2: Oh no, no. Not that uncommon, no, no. It's a, kind of a southern, I guess, phenomenon in many instances.
Speaker 1: Yeah in cities there's maid's quarters on--a lot of the houses have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah. And remember this is a small southern town, only about four or five hundred people, and the rest of the areas would be all rural areas, farm lands and what have you. And Mr. Pettus owned a dairy farm [Pettus Dairy Farm; Four Locust Farm, Virginia], but he lived in the town and so as a kid growing up, my brother and I worked on the farm, spent a lot of time on the farm. I can remember delivering milk early in the mornings to families. At that time, it was a dairy farm and they would bottle the milk in glass bottles, and we would stand on the side of the pickup truck and run to the porches of the houses and deposit the milk bottles in the containers and pick up the old dirty bottles. So I grew, I grew up on the dairy farm, kind of in the town, but I grew up on the dairy farm, which was very fascinating and interesting. I did not enjoy the hard work. My brother, Bernard [Bernard Ward], who grew up with me in the same household eventually, enjoyed hard work (laughter), enjoyed farm work, and I became the houseboy. My friends who remember that day and time, always called me the houseboy.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I learned to wash dishes, how to clean clothes, you know.
Speaker 1: So you had by--I guess, would you say that you had a more comfortable life you know because your mother lived in the Pettus household?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. I think that's a fair, fair statement. A more comfortable life than three of my brothers [Clarence Ward, Samuel Ward and Frank Ward] and most black boys and girls growing up at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Now was, was--
Speaker 2: With some exceptions in the town of Keysville. The black undertaker had a nice, naturally a nice business and a nice family and, I guess, the school principal, a couple of the teachers, but I had some certain--some advantages that most kids didn't have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A protected environment if I may, if I may say so.
Story_ID: 669601
Speaker 1: So you went to school, I guess in the, in the colored school in Keysville [Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, definitely a colored school.
Speaker 1: Okay. What was the name of it? Was it named for anybody?
Speaker 2: The first, first school that I went to was a little elementary school in Lunenburg County [Virginia], which was not far from the Pettus farm [Pettus Dairy Farm; Four Locust Farm, Virginia], although we lived in Keysville, we would come to the farm every morning because my mother [Annie Ward] milked cows and so forth, and then I would walk down to the school in Lunenburg County two or three miles. It was a one room schoolhouse, grades one through I'd say five or six. So, all these kids, grades one through five or six, in the same room, which in my mind was the most demeaning and uncomfortable I guess position growing up at that time. I didn't last over a month. I just stopped going, told my mom that I didn't want to go, and so I lost a year and they--
Speaker 1: You were about six then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I'd say five or six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, my mama didn't have the knack to push me and the Pettuses apparently were not that, at that time, pushy. But the next year, I entered Bluestone Harmony boarding school [Bluestone Harmony Academic and Industrial School, Keysville, Virginia]. Bluestone Harmony boarding school--
Speaker 1: Bluestone, okay.
Speaker 2: --was a school occupied and operated by the Bluestone Harmony Baptist Association [Bluestone Harmony Baptist Association and Ministries, Keysville, Virginia]. See, at this time in the South, the better schools in many instances for black kids, were schools that had been established by church associations, because the black schools were inferior, poorly subsidized and even many of your better teachers were in these church schools, church sponsored schools, so that the various churches subsidized the schools. It was a boarding school, although I walked to the school. It wasn't that far from where I lived.
Speaker 1: Was this a black Baptist organization (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A black Baptist, a black Baptist association, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And it's called the Bluestone--
Speaker 2: Harmony.
Speaker 1: Harmony.
Speaker 2: Association.
Speaker 1: Association. All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I have a picture somewhere of the old building that still stands.
Story_ID: 669602
Speaker 1: Before we get you too far in the school [Bluestone Harmony Academic and Industrial School, Keysville, Virginia] I want to go back and maybe ask you this question. It's kind of, kind of a general question about growing up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the place you lived in and can you tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Sights, and sounds, and smells. Well, the sights would certainly be the main street there in Keysville [Virginia], which was a busy street at that time because Keysville was a thriving little country town. It's dead now, so it was an exciting town. Sights always probably on Saturday--eventually by age six or seven, I guess age nine or ten, maybe twelve, I started working in Mr. Pettus' brother's store as a little stock clerk or what have you. Eventually, I became a clerk, a waiter or what have you. So that was my first meaningful job. So then, I got an opportunity to see greater interaction between white and black, because on Saturday everyone, poor white folk, poor black folk, would come to town to shop in these stores in Keysville and usually always on credit, and so I helped you know to wait on these people, and sometimes--that was always a pleasant experience, though some of the white customers at times were a little, a little mean may I say, but nothing that I couldn't confront or handle, nothing that crushed me, in a sense. I never had a crushing experience in my white environments.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the way you say it, infers that some people did.
Speaker 2: Oh certainly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, in those little towns you had the white town cop, who was very brutal towards blacks; particularly on Saturday, you'd find the black who would come out of the little black restaurant, bar, what have you, drunk, and they would just beat him up. One day it was, it was probably the most horrifying scene I witnessed in my life, a very young man, this white town cop beat this black guy on his head while he was bringing him out of the bar area across the street, and arrested him and so forth. And that to me, I guess later on became one of the scenes that, in the back of my mind, that began to radicalize--made no sense. So those are the kinds of, you know, childhood experiences, but as I said earlier living in the Pettus household, I to a great extent had a shield of protection because most white folks knew who I lived with, and the Pettus family was a well respected, it's a large family of land owners, retailers.
Story_ID: 669603
Speaker 1: How would you describe your personality then at that point?
Speaker 2: My personality?
Speaker 1: Yeah, as a kid growing up.
Speaker 2: I've always been a happy go lucky type. My birthday's December 1, 1933, I'm a Sagittarius, whatever that means. They say it's friendly, easy going, happy go lucky type of person. That was, that was kind of my personality. Once I entered school [at Bluestone Harmony Academic and Industrial School, Keysville, Virginia] after that first failure experience, I got real serious about school and Mrs. Pettus made sure that I remained serious about school. She made sure I did my homework and if I needed help she would help, or if there was something that she couldn't do, she would ask someone to come in and help me and get the tutoring I need, and (cough) so it was, as I look back, a pleasant you know childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like most boys who daydream, they would dream about places they would want to go and to travel to, things of that nature.
Story_ID: 669604
Speaker 1: Naturally growing up, I don't, heroes were--number one naturally, Joe Louis. I can remember as a young kid, once we all drove on a truck twenty some miles to a barbershop in another town to listen to--or to see I think, a Joe Louis fight, and we all stood around this barbershop looking in the window and what have you. Joe--I don't remember who he fought at that time. It was a kind of an, you know where everybody, "Rah, rah, rah, Joe Louis." Otherwise, my heroes were the Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers on the TV, white cowboys, but you, you knew about Joe Louis, so that was very, very interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Joe Louis was, the other, the other point I guess is that he was a big hero in those days, I know, but he was the first black champion to emerge after Jack Johnson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh sure, yeah Joe Louis (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did, did you know anything about Jack Johnson in those days?
Speaker 1: No. I didn't, no didn't know anything about Jack Johnson. Somebody may have mentioned it but it made no, it had no relevance. No, it was just, Joe Louis was the world's champion and he was beating up all these white men, you know, and everybody wanted to go and see him fight and listen to him, and then later on Muhammad Ali. I was still, you know, in high school [Central High School, Charlotte Court House, Virginia] and growing up and Muhammad Ali, and--excited about young Cassius Clay.
Speaker 2: Now, now did your family have--did the Pettuses have a radio at home?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah. They had a radio and they also had television, I think. I know, eventually they got television.
Speaker 2: But during the Joe Louis days when he was fighting, were you, you were (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This would be the '40s [1940s]. This is mostly the '40s [1940s], I suppose.
Speaker 2: I think he started winning in the late '30s [1930s] into the '40s [1940s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, in the '30s [1930s]. I think he first fought, fought Schmeling [Max Schmeling] in '33 [1933] or '36 [1936], somewhere around there, yeah just before the Olympics, '36 Olympics [1936 Summer Olympics, Berlin, Germany] which Jesse Owens starred. So, yeah. It was during that time period. It was before Jackie Robinson in '47 [1947], and actually in '47 [1947], Jackie Robinson became the hero, the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers]; that's why I'm still a Dodger fan. When race--
Speaker 2: Well, you were in high school then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When it comes to sports, I'm a race fan. You know I look at those teams that are initially integrated; Cleveland Browns when you think about Marion Motley and all those who are great football players, and Bruce Willis [sic. Bill Willis], and then basketball, you know, because of the Knicks [New York Knicks] when they had Sweet, Sweet, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Sweetwater Clifton [Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton].
Speaker 1: Sweetwater Clifton--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and guys like that. So, you know, even today, I kind of reflect on that, on that period. I remember in high school once, our coach took us down to Richmond [Virginia] to see the Harlem Globeclotters- Trotters [Harlem Globetrotters] play, one of their exhibitions. That was one of the most fascinating games I've ever seen in my life. You know, at that time these guys were floating through the air and doing all these crazy stunts with basketballs and so forth. It was really exciting for a country boy because--first to go to Richmond, second was to visit a campus, a college campus and it happened to be Virginia Union [Virginia Union University], an all-black campus [HBCU], and here again, my global view at an early age begins to expand and certainly every time I experience one of these visitations to a college campus, I remember in high school we went to A and T University [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], a kind of a senior visitation, and here I saw this big, beautiful campus in North Carolina. I always wanted to go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.]. I had never been to Howard, I had heard of Howard. I wanted to go to law school. These were part of my--my dreams, you know, my visions and all those things as a kid.
Story_ID: 669605
Speaker 1: I just wonder though when you were describing a fight, if you had ever listened to a Joe Louis fight with the Pettuses, or is that something that black folks did on our own?
Speaker 2: No, no. That's the kind of thing you'd go and find a car with a radio on it or what have you. Interesting, next door to where I lived, as I got older, the Pettuses moved from one house to another [in Keysville, Virginia] and so we no longer lived in the structure, the same structure that we had earlier. We live in a little separate quarters and a little separate building in the backyard, but there was a used car, a car dealership next door. We would go into--those happened to always be open in these cars, back in the rural area and we would find a car and kind of--radio--
Speaker 1: So you'd just open the car door and get in and turn on the radio (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Open the door, sit in there, turn on the radio station and listen all night too, it was a, it was an old black station out of Memphis [Tennessee], Randy or something like this.
Speaker 1: 'Randy's Record Shop' ['Randy's Record Shop Show'].
Speaker 2: You remember that?
Speaker 1: In Gallatin, Tennessee, I think, yeah.
Speaker 2: Or somewhere, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Randy's Record Shop,' yeah.
Speaker 2: --Louis Jordan music, and all that stuff, and we sat up there half the night listening and listened to the fights whenever there was a fight, and so forth. So there were always ways, you could always find ways to entertain yourself.
Speaker 1: That's something that's surprising to me coming along later, then--I thought for some reason--I know radio didn't really, didn't become commercial until 1920 or something, but I thought that by the '30s [1930s], at least by my father's generation and by your generation, everybody had a radio, but that wasn't true, was it?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when--I, we did have a radio in the house, one of those old brown radios, but I don't know when we got that, and my mama [Annie Ward] much rather listen to, you know, religious music, spirituals, and what have you, and--in the night time. To get with your buddies and sit in the car was more fun than being in your house with your mother and your brother [Bernard Ward] listening to a, to a fight, so we would sit in the car.
Story_ID: 669606
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just talking about the access to radios and information in those days and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and most of, most of the southern towns, and certainly in my town of Keysville [Virginia], you would usually find a radio in the barbershop or, you had little privately owned, black owned businesses, a little all purpose store, a little corner grocery store or what have you, and sometimes they would let you come in and listen to the radio or what have you. So, it was not a totally isolated world growing up, you know, in places like Keysville. It did have some access to the outer world.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you all have a telephone?
Speaker 2: (Cough) The Pettuses did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to worry about that, essentially?
Speaker 2: (Cough) No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Back in those days the telephones oftentimes were ones that were shared by more than one (cough), one resident. (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Is that what they call a party line, right?
Speaker 2: A party line, yes, certainly. I know you can go--and I'd be in the house by myself sometimes and I'd pick up the telephone and I'd hear some other people in town talking, going on and on and on. Realized--and I don't think they realized I was listening; of course, I realize it was probably illegal now but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) There's no, there's no way they would know unless you made some noise, right?
Speaker 2: Right. They wouldn't know, but you know kids do stupid things (laughter), even in that, in that world (laughter).
Story_ID: 669607
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about boarding--now you went to a boarding school. Now this is a--did you actually leave--live at the boarding--?
Speaker 2: No, I did not live there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had kids from as far away as Washington, D.C., and Norfolk [Virginia], and so that also would be another part of my expanding horizons, about these kids coming from D.C. and from other urban areas, telling us about their world, about D.C., and so forth. And they had a little degree, I guess, of northern sophistication or urban sophistication that we country boys and girls didn't have, and oftentimes (cough) we kind of looked up to them.
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you just describe the campus of the boarding school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it had a, as I recall, the principal lived on the campus. You had a dorm- a couple dormitory buildings and a major classroom--two, I think two classroom buildings at that time, and so you're separated by grade, which was good. You may have two grades in one class, but you're usually separated by grade, which made learning more meaningful, more exciting. You had good teachers, tough, stern teachers at that time. These teachers had gone to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] for the most part. I don't know if any went to Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]. Many of my high school teachers went to Virginia State, but at that time at Bluestone [Bluestone Harmony Academic and Industrial School, Keysville, Virginia], which was grades elementary through, I think, eighth grade. I remember going to the high school [Central High School, Charlotte Court House, Virginia], which was the public high school, in grades eight or nine, I forgot.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you have a, a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I always enjoyed history and geography. Geography was an escape because there you would read about places, faraway places, China and Paris [France], you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Italy, Rome.
Speaker 1: Did they teach any black history in school in those days?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's (unclear) to me, that the teachers were black, so I was kind of wondering (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. No, no. I didn't get that into black history until I got to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University] in college and that's when I was first indoctrinated or introduced to black history, and we'll talk about that later on, I guess, but yeah, no black history. Not even the churches, not even the church I went to, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know about any, did you know about some of the black historical figures when you were growing up, like Booker T. Washington, who he might be--
Speaker 2: We had the Negro History Week [Black History Month] observance and certainly, you know, the teachers would put up the bulletin board. Keep in mind, back in this period of time, in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], black teachers and black principals in particular were reluctant to, to upset the system, you know, because their supervisors and their principals and superintendents were always white, who would come in and, you know, and they wouldn't push that envelope but so far.
Speaker 1: So, even at Bluestone, which was Baptist, they--were they supported by public funds or something, and had--
Speaker 2: No, no public funds.
Speaker 1: Or did they have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From the church, from the churches in the association.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. So there were white churches in the association.
Speaker 2: No, no. All black churches.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: The Bluestone Harmony association [Bluestone Harmony Baptist Association and Ministries, Keysville, Virginia] was the coalition of only black Baptist churches in Southside Virginia and you had a school in Chase- Chase City, Virginia, and you had the one in Keysville [Virginia]. They had two in my part of the world, geographical part of the world that I know of, and, but they were supported by, by the various churches.
Story_ID: 669608
Speaker 1: Had it not been for the black church during this period of time, many, many black boys and girls would not have had access to any type of education.
Speaker 2: So there wasn't any public--was there--
Speaker 1: Public schools are just so inferior, I mean, to, to see some of the buildings, you know, that were provided at that time. No materials. Very few you know college trained teachers in the world because they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So the--yeah, the first school that you went to, you were describing it as being over crowded and--
Speaker 1: It was a one room building with a potbelly stove in it, and if you walked down there in the wintertime, your little hands are freezing and you'd all stand around this potbelly stove, and you know if you get too close to a hot stove and your hands are already freezing, they thaw and they start aching and that kind of a thing. And here's this teacher with grade one, grade two, grade three, grade four, grade five, in each corner all spread around. And naturally the big boys and kids, they'd be making fun of the little ones over here and all that, and I said, "Wait a minute." I just froze up and said, "I don't wanna, I don't wanna go to school. I don't wanna go to school." And they said, "Okay." And so that ended that (laughter).
Speaker 2: That sounds pretty--now this is a public school, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This is a public school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a Lunenburg public school.
Speaker 2: This is an example of what kind of a public school colored people would have to--in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, exactly. I mean, I've done studies and I've done presentations on the colored schools. I have some in my files at home showing you know the condition of these schools. Later on, northern white philanthropists began to subsidize under the development of black public education. The Jeanes fund [Anna T. Jeanes Foundation] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, Jeanes Supervisors, right.
Speaker 1: --the Rosenwald Funds [Julius Rosenwald Fund] and those funds. But I don't think any school in my county or Lunenburg County [Virginia] received any of those funds. I don't think they did, that I recall. I know my wife [Rose Ward] has done some research on the, on the Jeanes fund, but I don't think they got any.
Speaker 2: Right, I just found out about Jeanes fund I think a couple years ago.
Speaker 1: That's a fascinating story to be told and you may--in your interviewing you may find some old Jeanes fund teachers still around or something like that, you know.
Speaker 2: They had people employed as Jeanes Supervisors that would go around to a certain set of schools--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --to keep the curriculum up to a standard.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yes indeed. Yeah.
Speaker 2: This is all like, you know, an effort to try and make something out of basically no money (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No money, I mean, no resources. I don't know how we learned what we were able to do, and my high school experience [at Central High School, Charlotte Court House, Virginia] was radically different.
Story_ID: 669609
Speaker 1: When I got to Central High School in Charlotte Court House, Virginia--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I think grade, grades eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve--yes, grade eight, much--a modern physical plant with a gymnasium, running water, cafeteria, nice classrooms, et cetera. So, that must have been, I finished high school in 1953, so it's been--grades eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve--what's that? Four or five years there? So, I must have been going to--started in Central High around '48 [1948], somewhere like that, 1948, yeah. After World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Now, now what was the difference here? Now this, this is colored school too, right?
Speaker 1: Colored school all the way, yes.
Speaker 2: And so what happened where this school had resources and--
Speaker 1: I don't know the full history of that, but the county began to upgrade its school system; here again separate but equal. And this school was a good school. They had a middle school across the street and the high school on one side, and I have a picture of the high school somewhere in the file I can show you later. It's now closed but, at that time, all the black kids from throughout the county [Charlotte County, Virginia], high school kids, came to this central high school, and maybe that's why they called it Central High, because there was only one high school in the central part of the county and all the kids were into the, all the high school kids that's where we went. Had a shop, technology shop, and also agricultural--wood shop, or something of that nature. I was never interested in shops. I was never interested in the mechanical side of education. My brother [Bernard Ward], he was good in that type; I was more into the, I guess the humanities and things of that nature, and the only reason I took a shop class was because I was required to do so. I didn't do very well in it. I had to cut some wood carving or something like that--so that was that experience (laughter). Get me back to my history, to my geography. And I was a good student in mathematics until I got to trigonometry or something like that. That's when I began to dislike math (laughter). But I did--I was a good high school student.
Story_ID: 669610
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite teachers in--coming up in grade school or high school [Central High School, Charlotte Court House, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: In--well, let me take you back to my elementary school. Mrs. Ruth Blue, B-L-U-E, Ruth Blue [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now is she related to the Blues at Bluestone [Bluestone Harmony Academic and Industrial School, Keysville, Virginia]? Or is there any relation?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay. Her name is Ruth Blue.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mrs. Ruth Blue is my first grade teacher, and her husband [G.W. Blue] was the principal at this private you know church school. And she was my first teacher and she always had a lasting impression on me. Kind of a rote teaching, you know, you had to memorize a lot of stuff. You had to stand before the class for the spelling bee, you had to stand before the class and read, and I remember one little book--I used to tell this story when I was teaching, Winky the monkey ['Winky,' Myrtle Banks Quinlan], and she would say, "William [HistoryMaker William E. Ward], come up and read today from the book." And I would read and read, and I got so damned tired of reading every day I memorized the whole book, Winky the monkey with a red cap, and so forth (laughter). But she always cared for me, and until she died about ten years ago, I would always go and visit Mrs. Blue back in Keysville [Virginia]. She lived to be ninety-seven years of age and a great impression. In high school, my math teacher was a tremendous impression on me, a Mrs. Benford [ph.], who was the wife of the principal, and there were several others. I had good high school teachers; here, again they, a number of them were college graduates from Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] and some from maybe Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] or Morgan [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], but most of them came from Virginia Union. But these were college graduates and very impressive, very attractive people, mannerly people, but demanding, caring, compassionate some passion, and so on. I had a good high school experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: The tragedy of my high school experience was the fact that those who did not make it, 140 some students entered the eighth grade with me, twenty-seven finished, five went to college, and three finished college, out of my high school class. That was a tragedy of black education at that time, most of the kids who grew up in that county [Charlotte County, Virginia] did not make it through high school. Many of them just migrated into the northern urban areas; New York [New York], Baltimore [Maryland], D.C. [Washington, D.C.], what have you, ended up with meager jobs, and things. That's what happened to one of my brothers [Samuel Ward]. He migrated to New York and lived there about thirty years, working menial jobs and what have you, and then he--since returned to the farm site there, but he lived there by himself because there's no farming. My other brother [Bernard Ward], the one who is closest to me and who lived with me, is a retired military person and living in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The other two brothers [Clarence Ward and Frank Ward] are deceased.
Story_ID: 669611
Speaker 1: Now when you were coming along, did you have access to the black newspapers?
Speaker 2: No. Never saw a black newspaper. I'm thinking that--
Speaker 1: I wondered, because you were in a white household, for the most part, and your mother [Annie Ward] didn't really, I don't know if she read that much or if she--
Speaker 2: She tried to, but she couldn't.
Speaker 1: She didn't have any education, so I just wondered if you encountered any of the papers.
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No. The only black people we ever saw on TV was 'Amos 'n' Andy,' or some buffoonish type characters such as that. Black newspapers? No, no. I don't recall, don't recall.
Story_ID: 669612
Speaker 1: You were interested in history in high school, and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) History and geography. And, I had a fondness for math and most other subjects, but when I decided to go to college I had to declare a major and so I declared history as my major.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did, now you were a good student, so how did college come about? Did you--did your--did you kind of always, when did you start thinking that you were going to college?
Speaker 2: Well, I think Mrs. Pettus always sowed in my mind the idea that, "We want you to go to college. I want you to go to college." I don't know if he, Mr. Pettus, cared a whole lot or not (laughter). He probably wanted me to stay and work on the farm [Pettus Dairy Farm; Four Locust Farm, Virginia]; although I never did much work on the farm. My bother [Bernard Ward] did. But, so they began to explore, she did, and he assisted her in some options. I did get a hundred dollar scholarship to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], but for some reason I didn't want to go to Virginia Union because by senior year in high school, I heard about Virginia State College [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], had never been there, but I heard about--you know, larger school and all of the amenities it offered and what have you. Didn't have any money, didn't know how I was going to pay for my education. Mother [Annie Ward] certainly couldn't do it. The Pettuses would help a little bit, but they found an opportunity for me, and that opportunity was through the Virginia vocational rehabilitation act--the Virginia vocational rehabilitation fund or act, and that was money for kids with some degree of handicap. And they found the person in Lunenburg County [Virginia] who headed up that program, and we met and he [sic.] said, "You think you could help me because of my artificial eye?" So, for the most part that program paid for all of my undergraduate degree, for four years, with some assistance from my mother or the Pettuses. And I always worked on campus, because at that time, you know, most students worked on campus. I went to Virginia State University in September of 1953, and left in May, 1957. I never left campus for four years. Yes, I would go home and visit family, but I worked on campus during the summers, during the school year, in the cafeteria or what have you. In the summers we would clean up dormitories, a group of us, and so that became my home. My extended family was at Virginia State University, a whole new life, you know with kids from all over the country, Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], D.C. [Washington, D.C.], New York [New York], great teachers. It was a little tough at first for me to make that transition from high school academically to college. But eventually I, you know made the transition, finished in four years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So are you saying that you--were you--do you think that Bluestone [Bluestone Harmony Academic and Industrial School, Keysville, Virginia] did a good job at preparing you?
Speaker 2: Central certainly did a good job at preparing me.
Speaker 1: Central High, oh yes. Central.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Central High School [Charlotte Court House, Virginia], high school. Bluestone gave me my foundation, and certainly you know with Mrs. Blue [Ruth Blue (ph.)] and other teachers there, but I think at high school is where I really began to excel. Then, when I got to Virginia State College, the first couple years were tough for some reason; I don't know. Did well in my history classes, but the English class, the math class and some biology class, those kind of classes. I guess I couldn't quite get, get my hands on them, and that's why living on campus during the summers, I was able to take some courses ahead of time to make sure I got out in time.
Story_ID: 669613
Speaker 1: I eventually wanted to do something extracurricular on campus so I had always wanted to play football. We didn't have a high school football team [at Central High School, Charlotte Court House, Virginia], and I knew that I could never play college football, especially with the one eye. I did play high school basketball. The only option for me in terms of a sports participation in college was one that was not a team sport; individual sport, track. So I joined the track team (laughter). I was too slow to run sprints, so I ended up on the long distance team. I ran the mile; not very good, but being on the track team enabled me to sit at the training table because track is a year round sport, indoor/outdoor, and if you're at the training table that means you get a good meal every day. You travelled in indoor, I know the Pioneer games in New York [New York Pioneer Club, New York, New York], and the Quantico Olympic games [Quantico Relays]. And so you know I was in college at the time that Elias Gilbert and J.C.--J.C. Calhoun [sic. Lee Quincy Calhoun] at North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], world champion sprinters. And Barksdale [Bob Barksdale] the world champion Olympian, Olympian high jumper up at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. So participating, you know, at the same time that these Olympians were participating. The sprint sensation was Dave Sims [sic. Dave Sime], a white boy from Duke University [Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, fast. I had seen all these guys run at the Penn Relays [Penn Relay Carnival] and so forth. So, here again, the expanding--my universe is expanding, my worldview is expanding and all of this. Great teachers at Virginia State University [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]; particularly Dr. James Brewer, Dr. James Brewer, B-R-E-W-E-R. He was a black, black historian and a black scholar, one that specialized in black history. He wrote 'The Confederate Negro' ['The Confederate Negro: Virginia's Craftsmen and Military Laborers, 1861-1865']. His top work was 'Confederate Negro.' Also studied under Dr. James Hugo Johnston [James Hugo Johnston, Jr.], Dr. James Hugo Johnston, J-O-H-N-S-T-O-N. He wrote 'Race Relations and the Old Side of Miscegenation' [sic. 'Race Relations in Virginia and Miscegenation in the South, 1776-1860']. He himself was a very, very, very fair black man whose father [James Hugo Johnston, Sr.] was white and if he walked in here today if here today, if he were alive, you would think it was a white man, but he taught Virginia history and I got to know him well, and he carried me one day down into the archives there at Virginia State and showed me some history and so forth. And a number of other great, great teachers there, so I finished in 1953.
Story_ID: 669614
Speaker 1: Did they talk about the history of Petersburg [Virginia] at all? Now, that's one of the surprising things I, you know, from being in, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, sure, Petersburg. Petersburg, at that time, was a thriving little town, southern town. It's dead now, because once the tobacco companies moved out and all the commercial businesses went down in Colonial Heights [Virginia] and so forth. But at that time Petersburg had a nice little black business corridor, thriving stores on Sycamore Street, and all that's now just about boarded up, but Petersburg had good schools and was an integral part of the university life. You had black theaters, black restaurants, so we would go over to Petersburg.
Speaker 1: Did, did they ever talk about it being the scene, I guess, of the last battle of the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, well sure, we all (unclear). The craters, the craters and yeah, all of that, and Lee's [Robert E. Lee] last stand. The thousands of soldiers, the black soldiers, who died because they would always be sent into battle first. Grant [Ulysses S. Grant] would send the black soldiers and they would be fired upon and as the white soldiers reloaded, the white Union, Union soldiers would then attack, retreat, black soldiers attack. And by that time the white soldiers, southern soldiers had reloaded and so thousands of soldiers, black and white, died there, but then Lee was forced to retreat to Appomattox after the Battle of the Craters [sic. Battle of the Crater]. You know, they have a Civil War battlefield there, it's an interesting site, another history there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wondered, because I think in the other, the rest of the country, unless you live in Boston [Massachusetts] and have seen the Shaw monument [Robert Gould Shaw Memorial]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or you live in Petersburg where all that history is, a lot of people grew up not knowing that we even had anything to do with the Civil War. (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh god, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Until they made the movie, 'Glory.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, right. Major, major--
Speaker 1: A lot of people became aware of it then, but, I mean there was information but the average black person--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --knew nothing of it for years.
Speaker 2: A lot of history in there in Petersburg, post, post Civil War, you know, one of the first black newspapers was pioneered by a black guy from Petersburg, who ultimately came the sponsor, I guess, of what became Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, now Virginia State University [Petersburg, Virginia]. So, Petersburg leadership, black leadership, made significant contributions prior to and post Civil War. A person there in Petersburg you may want to interview sometimes is Dr. Florence Farley [HistoryMaker Florence Farley], been around a long time. Dr. Florence Farley.
Speaker 1: F-O-L-L-Y?
Speaker 2: Florence, F-L-O-R-E-N-C-E; Farley, F-A-R-L-E-Y. And I can dig up the number before we leave (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) F-A-R- oh, Farley, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I'll give it to you before we go.
Story_ID: 669615
Speaker 1: I read that Petersburg [Virginia] is a, is a stronghold of the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] as well. Did you notice anything like that when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, not--no, not when I was in Petersburg, no.
Speaker 1: And there's a tension (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Southside Virginia, yes, where I, where I came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I never experienced any Klan activity in Charlotte County [Virginia] or--later on in life when I read about Farmville [Virginia] and that total area there, even prior to the civil rights struggles, there had been significant racial terrorism in that part of the country.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about the time that you were coming out is when, I guess, is that about the time that Barbara Johns had the student strike in Farmville (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, sure, right. Yeah, yeah. That's after Brown, after '54 [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and during that period when they closed down Mo- Moton High School [Robert Russa Moton High School, Farmville, Virginia].
Story_ID: 669616
Speaker 1: So but you see--this period, you're saying it's a period of more political awareness on your part, and--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, certainly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) black history--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, certainly at Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]. Yeah, a lot of that, particularly the influence of Dr. Brewer [James Brewer], who taught the black history course and, taught the course, and he was always impressing upon us the importance of black history. I did a paper for him on the Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands], which was an agency established after the war [Civil War] to assist blacks in the transition from freedom--from slavery to freedom. And we also had speakers of national note who would come to the campus, you know.
Speaker 1: Who came?
Speaker 2: Archibald Carey [Archibald Carey, Jr.], for example, was a famous preacher out of, I think it was Chicago [Illinois] if I'm not mistaken. A lot of artists, a lot of black artist would come and perform, maybe Duke Ellington and others who would come and perform. So, here again, you're getting exposed, and then we would oftentimes do some exchange with the students form Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] or professors from Virginia Union, particularly in the field of history. They had some good people there who had done some research. So--
Speaker 1: Did you major in history at Virginia State (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah. Always majored in history (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you get--oh, no, I guess he was, Woodson was dead by the time--
Speaker 2: Carter G. Woodson was gone (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he had passed away in 1950, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Woodson had died long before then.
Speaker 1: But did you get a chance to go to any of the association meetings when you were a student?
Speaker 2: As a student, no. I'm trying to think. Maybe--no. Because I don't think they ever met in--Richmond [Virginia] was the closest area. I became affiliated with the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] once I, you know, finished college and in particular once I got here at Norfolk State [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] as professor of history. That's when I became associated with a lot of these organizations and what have you.
Story_ID: 669617
Speaker 1: We were talking about the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and being associated with that later on, but it wasn't, I wasn't really--they didn't try to get, really, students involved in--when you were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not, not, no they did not.  The interest in, now that you mention that, I'm surprised that we were not invited to, to maybe take some students to one of the annual meetings, but maybe it was because of lack of resources on the campus, then.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking that might be it because it's so many, I think, of the principle people around.  I mean, Benjamin Quarles [Benjamin A. Quarles] is at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Quarles is at Morgan State (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Roland McConnell [HistoryMaker Roland C. McConnell], and some of the--
Speaker 2: The other guy, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the people at Howard in those days--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Great people, all over.
Speaker 1: All of them involved in it.
Speaker 2: And, the guy who wrote the New England Negro ['The Negro in Colonial New England, 1620-1776,' Lorenzo Greene], who was that? Not Quarles, I can't think of his name now.  I can remember Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] visiting the campus once.  I think that was when I came back to work on my master's [degree], let me see--
Speaker 1: Now--well how did you--how did the--what were your feelings about the Montgomery Bus Boycott?  Now, you would, you would have been, I guess, a junior in college?
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah.  We--in Petersburg [Virginia], I finished in '57 [1957].  Things were just beginning to warm up and heat up in the South at that time on college campuses and what have you, and I left for six months after finishing in May of 1957, went to New York [New York] looking for the promised land, I couldn't really find anything.  I didn't want to teach, didn't know what I wanted to do. I got a job at B. Altman's department store [B. Altman and Company] as a shipping clerk or something of that nature, moved in all my family, extended family to the North, you know the migration story of families moving north and moving in on family members who had moved earlier, and so forth, and kind of rotating out of the bedrooms (laughter).  I lived on--where'd I live? 54th [sic.] and St. Nick [St. Nicholas Avenue], 44th--no, 54th and St. Nick, way uptown, 144th [Street] and St. Nick, up in Harlem [New York, New York].  Yeah, and I had a brother who had gone earlier, a cousin who had gone much earlier, an aunt who had gone much, much earlier, so we all kind of had an extended family living there in New York. But that was no life because I was making no more than fifty-five, sixty dollars.  I said, "Here I got a college degree and I can't find anything." And I really didn't feel, feel that comfortable being in New York living on kind of a, you know beggar's salary.  Anyway, I came back to Virginia, called Dr. Brewer [James Brewer], and said, "Look, I think I wanna come back, work on a master's and then look at teaching."  Came back, and he helped to find me some money and people helped me, went back to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] in January '58 [1958].  Got a master's in 1960, but started teaching in public schools in 1959 in Portsmouth at I.C. Norcom High School.
Speaker 1: Now who was I.C Norcom [Israel Charles Norcom]?  I know, I know--
Speaker 2: I.C. Norcom?
Speaker 1: I know he was a black educator (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was the famous educator in Nor- in Portsmouth, Virginia for many years, still some family members over there. And I taught at that high school from about '59 [1959] to '62 [1962], then I went to Baltimore [Maryland] and taught a year at P.S. 181, which was the Hamilton Houston elementary--middle school at that time.
Speaker 1: So they--Charles Hamilton Houston elementary (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Charles Hamilton Houston middle school [Charles Hamilton Houston Junior High School]. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The famous law professor--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: From Howard University.
Speaker 1: Who taught, who organized Oliver Hill [HistoryMaker Oliver W. Hill] and (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, part of that whole group, Oliver Hill and others, yeah.  That school named after him, then I came back to Norfolk [Virginia] in '63 [1963], took a teaching job at the middle school here, Rosemont Junior High School in '63 [1963], five years there, and then came here to Norfolk State in 1968 as an assistant professor of history, and, well the rest of it is history, you know, because I spent the rest of my professional career here teaching at Norfolk State University [Norfolk, Virginia].
Story_ID: 669618
Speaker 1: You mentioned Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] appearance at--
Speaker 2: At, at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you were at grad school, at Norfolk State [sic.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, at--at Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Virginia State, (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Unclear) way back.  I remember him coming on campus once, and just a brief appearance. And all those students, we went to hear him speak and very excited about him, but I had not gotten caught up in the momentum as such, or the fervor of the movement. And I know the students of subsequent years became very, very active.  They boycotted stores in Petersburg [Virginia]; a lot of that went on, a lot of the kids who were there.  But by that time, I had left, gone to New York [New York] and then taken the teaching job and kind of drifted away, I guess, from activism or from even getting involved initially in the activism.  My activism came later in Chesapeake [Virginia] as an adult in the '60s [1960s].  I kind of missed, (laughter) I missed the revolution I guess, in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Or the early '60s [1960s]. Did--were--people were going--
Speaker 2: Oh, the early '60s [1960s] was hell (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And marching and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Marching, yeah, into Mississippi, the bus rides, you know, the whole '60s [1960s] here, turbulent period.  All the major marches, you know, '61 [1961], '62 [1962], '63 [1963], and '64 [1964], burning Mississippi, and then before that you had, you know, Albany [Albany Movement] and all those things.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, did you go to the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: No, I missed it.  I was teaching at that time [at Rosemont Junior High School, Norfolk, Virginia] and we didn't get there, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense it was a big, you know, it was historic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  You know, as I reflect back, I should have, should have gone to that, because that's a major part of the history that we missed.
Speaker 1: I don't know, sometimes I wonder, you know, when something is getting ready to happen, if you have a sense it's going to be as important as it--you know before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know I think--yeah, yeah exactly, exactly. But I mean, I remember after Martin passed, and I was in Chesapeake, I was very active in the second, quote Poor People's march [Poor People's Campaign], Joe Lowery [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph Lowery] and his people, they decided to kind of carry on the Poor People's march and they came marching through Chesapeake, and that's when I remember assisting Joe Lowery and his group and marching with them as they continued on to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 669619
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968]--now how did you feel in regards to politics in those, in those days?  I know some people in--I think, unless I'm wrong, I guess about 95 percent of the black folks loved Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: But not everybody thought they could be nonviolent and--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  It was certain that Malcolm had become by--you see, Malcolm was killed in '65 [1965], but Malcolm had captured the imagination of a large number of young people by '65 [1965] before he died, and particularly on college campuses; the Black Muslims [Nation of Islam], the BSUs, black student unions and what have you.  Even the Panthers [Black Panther Party], I can remember for a while here in Norfolk [Virginia] and even on the campus [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] we had a cell, Black Panther cell, and although they didn't call themselves Panthers, they kind of hid themselves on campus through the black student union.  Now, we call it the Baptist Student Union (laughter) but that was the--
Speaker 1: It's now the Baptist Student Union?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The Baptist Student--the BSU, Baptist Student Union, that was the black student union.  They had their own room, all their books and paraphernalia, and what have you. And they were doing some interesting things here in the city and on the campus and revolutionizing.  A lot of the kids left here and went to work with Barak- Baraka [Amiri Baraka] in, up in Newark [New Jersey] and different parts of the movement. And then the Black Muslims. We had speakers, eventually, I became the chairman of the black history MLK observance and Black History Month programs. And see, throughout the '70s [1970s] and into the '80s [1980s], I was bringing black speakers, you know, in every year during Black History Month. And I had a little money, at that time, the school had money set aside for my programs and I was always able to get speakers in, you know, Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks], James Baldwin, [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, just a number of people.  I even forget half of them now.  I was able to bring in Mayor Stokes [Carl Stokes] and later on his brother [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes] and people of that note; Malcolm X's young daughter, which was not the most exciting one but--because she didn't even remember Malcolm but, you know, my friend, Karenga (laughter).
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he told me, "Don't call me Ron anymore."  I forgot and called him Ron.  He didn't--, "Don't call me Ron."  I thought okay, Ron (laughter).  Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture]; I mean, all the revolutionaries, Giovanni, [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni a couple times here.  So, we had 'em all here on campus and I remember I had Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] here once, and that was a show.  You know, Adam with his black outfit and his medallion, you know.
Speaker 1: Was that before he--
Speaker 2: That was after he had been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) left the [U.S.] Congress or?
Speaker 2: That was after he had been--
Speaker 1: Censured or something?
Speaker 2: Censured and I think he had been removed from Congress.  I'm trying to think at that time.  He was removed from Congress in what, '68 [1968] or '69 [1969]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [sic. 1967], yeah.
Speaker 2: Something like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about it.
Speaker 2: Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] took--yeah, gosh.  That's right.  About that time, but he was still on the speaking circuit, so he came.  So those were exciting years, bringing those speakers in.  Some, some were, I thought would get me fired, because they were just kind of way out there and Wilson [HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson]--well Brooks [Lyman Beecher Brooks], president, first president of the university, very conservative, and Wilson was much more cautious too because he was working his political deals in Richmond [Virginia] and he didn't want to upset the applecart and stuff like that.  I mean, he was supportive but, he said, "Bill [HistoryMaker William E. Ward], you know, you've gotta make sure that these guys don't cause a revolution on the campus and things get out of hand."  But, those are exciting periods and at the same time, I was becoming involved in local politics at Chesapeake [Virginia].  There was a period I would say during '60 [1960] to '68 [1968], basically I call it my dormant period.  I was not, I was not really an activist or a participant. I was doing my job as an educator.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how do you, I mean--
Speaker 2: I was just, just--I was, my wife [Rose Ward], we were raising kids [Michael Ward and Michelle Ward Woodhouse].  We had bought a home in Chesapeake.  She was a Norfolk girl, very much into all the social programs and social circle, sororities, all the different social groups, you know, a dance every weekend, a party every weekend, all that kind of a bit. Kind of the bougie life, you know, that all of a sudden I had found myself in, or thought I was in, anyway.
Story_ID: 669620
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968] was the year that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: King was assassinated, Malcolm [Malcolm X] '65 [1965], King '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Kennedy, Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Kennedy a month after--
Speaker 2: Robert, Robert Kennedy.
Speaker 1: --or two months after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Right.
Speaker 1: --Dr. King, in May or June of that year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Dr. King in April, which would have meant that school was still going on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did, how did the campus [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], how did you react and how did the campus react to the death of Dr. King (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that, that was certainly--I don't know, I guess that many black people felt like throwing a brick at something.  I can remember, I was in my car leaving Norfolk [Virginia] or either coming to Norfolk; probably leaving Norfolk going home and all of a sudden it said Dr. King had been assassinated or something like that, and all hell broke loose in the Berkley section where I lived initially.  My wife [Rose Ward] was from that section of Norfolk and they were just going wild there. And we know what happened around the country, and at that time I said, "Look, I need to, I need to become involved.  I need to start doing something more positive with my life."  I'm doing positive stuff, I'm teaching, but the community was calling me at that time.  I had moved into Chesapeake [Virginia] in '63 [1963], a new city, only five years old, a typical southern rural town.  The Washington Post one time called it a typical southern rural town with dirt roads that lead nowhere.  Now, Chesapeake is the third largest city in the Commonwealth of Virginia (laughter) with 240,000 people. And we can talk about that political story later on, but there was an organization formed in the late '60s [1960s] called the Chesapeake Men for Progress [New Chesapeake Men for Progress, Chesapeake, Virginia] and some of my friends invited me to become a member and--
Speaker 1: Now, this is a black organization (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A black, black male organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I became--
Speaker 1: Chesapeake Men for Progress.
Speaker 2: For Progress.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I became a member. And--
Speaker 1: Was it a direct result of Dr. King's assassination, you think, that--
Speaker 2: I, it was a, it was just an outgrowth of activism taking place in the country, black people beginning to organize. And a large number of black professionals had moved out of Norfolk into Chesapeake.  At that same time, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] had had one of the largest rallies in Chesapeake in either '67 [1967] or '68 [1968], and so these black men saw the need to organize to become a part of this new city. And we realized on the way that if we were going to become a part of it, to become included was through organization.  And so, in joining the organization for some reason or another they asked me to become president, I guess it was '69 [1969].  I became president of the organization and I became a little more aggressive, and because we would have an annual banquet, and at that time naturally the white politicians wanted to come and--because they saw here, either saw a potential of capturing a body of new votes or controlling a body of new votes. And so at one of the banquets we had, I said, "There's a new breed of cats in town, and we want to be a part of the system.  We're not gonna accept the crumbs from the table anymore.  We wanna be on the school boards, we wanna be--," all that--I was kind of out there.  I had my Afro back at that time, long hair.
Story_ID: 669621
Speaker 1: It says in the outline I have that you, you began to do political organizing, and, and I asked you off camera (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --if you had, you know, formal training, Alinsky [Saul Alinsky] style training, any of that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Never heard of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: The only training I had was in 1970, two vacancies occurred on the Chesapeake City Council.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, the organization [Chesapeake Men for Progress; New Chesapeake Men for Progress, Chesapeake, Virginia] saw an opportunity to run some candidates because there were gonna be two special elections; one white man had died, the other one had resigned.  Two special elections were to be held on January 4, 1970.  Dr. Hugo A. Owens [Hugo A. Owens, Sr.], who is now deceased, an old civil rights activist in Portsmouth [Virginia] and also in Chesapeake [Virginia], announced he was going to run for one of those seats.  He came to me and asked me, "Bill [HistoryMaker William E. Ward], why don't you consider running?"  I said, "No, doctor, it's not the time."  We went to the organization and there was a man in the organization--and everybody said, "Well, let's appoint, ask W.P. Clarke [W.P. Clarke, Sr.] to run."  W.P. Clarke was an independent agent for North Carolina Mutual--Beneficial Mutual Insurance Company [sic. North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina].  So, he didn't depend on the white establishment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly. I was thinking that as you were saying that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, here's an independent--a black dentist, independent black man, insurance executive.  We ran both of those men.  No one knew anything about a campaign.  No one knew what the hell you're supposed to do, and they said, "Well, Bill Ward, now that you've become the president, and so forth, we want you to be a campaign manager." (Laughter) Be the what?  At that point in time, I had been caught up in all this whatever, and I said okay.  So, I organized the campaign for those two men.  We won both of those special elections, and they had to run for reelection in May because the general election would take place in May and we won again.  But, going back to how I organized, naturally appeal to the black base--the black churches.  I went to every black church in Chesapeake.  We had no money, doc and, and--Mr. Clarke had a little money that they could contribute and we just--with a group of men from this organization--and the number one guy with me throughout my political life has always been Charles Brockett, a good Kappa brother [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], young guy, energetic, but as militant, and if not more so, than I was. And we worked together and we drafted--I even designed my own campaign posters for these guys, went to the churches, and the black women in these neighborhoods throughout Chesapeake and the preachers, they rally a two hour call to get the vote out and so we got them to work at the polls. And on election day, January the 4th, it was a cold, wet day, both men won.  The whole world had turned upside down in Chesapeake; in fact, in this part of the world.  And so, from that point on, those two men were reelected over and over to city council; Clarke died in 1977, and kind of jumping ahead a little bit.  Before we get to 1977, in the meanwhile, I had become even more involved and active in Democratic politics, kind of moved from the street, I guess, to the party.
Speaker 1: So, let me go back for a second.  When was that first political victory? When you got the two seats on the city council? What year was that?
Speaker 2: January 4, 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: January 4th, 1970. That's when I first successfully (video disturbance) campaigned, or assumed the campaign management for Clarke and Owens, W.P. Clarke and Hugo Owens, the first two blacks elected to the Chesapeake City Council in a new city.  The city was only what, seven years old at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And these two men were reelected over and over, and interestingly they formed a black, white coalition in '74 [1974], a Democratic coalition, the first time in this part of the country, if not in the South.  A white man, white female and two black men ran and won, and as a result of the coalition, Dr. Owens was elected vice mayor, and the white lady, Marian Whitehurst [Marian Perry Whitehurst], was elected mayor in '74 [1974] and they served in a dual capacity until 1980, when she retired and Clarke retired in '82 [sic.].
Story_ID: 669622
Speaker 1: Getting back to Bill Ward [HistoryMaker William E. Ward], during that next ten year period, from '70 [1970] to seventy- to '80 [1980], '70 [1970] to '80 [1980], I went into the graduate program at Clark University in Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: That's in Worcester, right?
Speaker 1: Worcester, Mass.  And one summer, Clark--here again history major (audio disturbance), sent some students to Africa and they asked me to go along as a kind of an elder, older guy, kind of a chaperone. But we went to Ghana and spent the summer in Ghana studying at the University of Ghana [Accra, Ghana], but also visiting throughout the country.  It's an exciting year to be in Ghana, because it was the year they brought Kwame Nkrumah's body back to Africa for burial and we had a chance to visit with his mother [Elizabeth Nyaniba] at her home during that, during that time period.  We stood in (audio disturbance) line hours and hours and (audio disturbance)--view his remains.  I can remember that day. Long, long hot day.
Speaker 2: His body had been--like he--
Speaker 1: His body had been in Guinea.  Sekou Toure [Ahmed Sekou Toure]--
Speaker 2: Sekou Toure, that's right.
Speaker 1: --who was the president of Guinea, had kept his body, although that's where he lived, I think, and maybe he died there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was living in Guinea.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: He was ousted in a coup while visiting China--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in, I'm not sure, I can't think of the year, but he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he wasn't killed but he was ousted--
Speaker 1: No, no, no. Cancer--
Speaker 2: They took the country while he was out of town.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he spent the rest of his life in Guinea, writing and working with Sekou Toure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture]--now did you, was he, was he there for that event, because he was very close to Kwame Nkrumah and Sekou Toure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, I'm not quite sure.  I know he--I'm sure, I know Carmichael did live for a while in (audio disturbance)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's about the same time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think there was a period, period he was there.
Speaker 1: It was at the same time, probably.  But also in Ghana, I had the opportunity to visit the gravesite of W.E.B. Du Bois.  Here again, another enlightening, another, you know, kind of expanding my, my intellect, my horizon, my activism, because I had naturally become acquainted with Du Bois by that time and more so later on in teaching here at the university [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].  But that was an exciting period of time.  We visited all African cities.  One of the things that was disappointing to me and my study in Ghana that summer, was when we got to Kumasi [Ghana] where the gold mines are (audio disturbance)--as we went down into the mines and the closer we got to the gold, we saw fewer and fewer Africans.  When we got to the gold itself, they were all English, Europeans, and a few African guards with rifles, and the gold, as you know, was being shipped back to the Bank of London [sic. Bank of England], so here again the rape of Africa continued in terms of this precious material and resources.
Speaker 2: Now, how could they have explained that to you to make you understand that that was--that made sense?
Speaker 1: Well, you have to understand the post colonization of Africa.  Europeans turn over political authority to Africans, but they never really turn over the economies of the African countries and that's part of the problem today and why so many African countries are de- destabilized, is that the economies are plugged into the European economies; South Africa, the diamond mines and so forth, still controlled by Rothschild, and the, the Beers [De Beers] and others, wherever you go, the old colonial systems still are somewhat intact, broken down a little bit. And once the colonial systems broke down then the tribal systems, in many instances, were not capable of replacing them on the European model and, as a consequence, you have internal strife.  Nigeria is a classic example; the largest country and richest country in black Africa, but here again you've got different tribal factions.  It's either Hausa-Fulani, which is Muslim versus Protestant groups, you know Igbo and others. And so, anyway, that was another experience, and--my African experience.
Story_ID: 669623
Speaker 1: In 1977 or '78 [1978], I forgot, I had an opportunity through a grant that we had received here at Norfolk State [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] and several other black colleges [HBCUs] to go down to Jamaica and study for a while at the University of the West Indies in Kingston [Jamaica].  And at that time, Michael Manley was the president of Jamaica, and here again, Jamaica was experimenting with its version of socialism and kind of indoctrinated--not indoctrinated, but kind of exposed to, again, Caribbean socialism and the kinds of plights and problems and struggles of the Caribbean.  So, here again, all these things--but let me back up. In 1972, in 1972, I--my inner circle, Baraka [sic.] and these guys, convinced (laughter) me to run for [U.S.] Congress.  Now remember, I'm here at Clark Univ- [Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, wait a minute.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Can't let this pass. You say, you say your inner circle now.  You were listening to Baraka.  Was there a formal relationship between you two?
Speaker 1: No, not Baraka.
Speaker 2: Now, who was this?
Speaker 1: My local inner circle.
Speaker 2: Oh, your local inner circle.
Speaker 1: Brockett [Charles Brockett], Brockett.
Speaker 2: Brockett, Brockett, oh.
Speaker 1: Brockett--
Speaker 2: Brockett, okay.
Speaker 1: --and other black leaders throughout Southside Virginia and the 4th Congressional District.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Now I understand.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Florence Farley was a part of that circle up in Petersburg [Virginia].  I had established a relationship with her and so in 1972, I decided to run for Congress. Now--
Speaker 2: Well, we may as well pause here.  We'll keep this--see he's gotta do a pause.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It gets a little crazy in the '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 669624
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about the--I asked about the National Black Political Assembly, if you were associated with that, and you said you--not really.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go to that, but at that time--the theme of that was no permanent friends, no permanent allies, and I think Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was there and old--Hatcher [HistoryMaker Richard Hatcher] and some others. And out of, out of that national meeting came a number of black elected officials or a number of African Americans running for office.  In 1972, as a segue, I was bitten by the bug, or enticed may be a better word, to run for [U.S.] Congress in the 4th Congressional District.  There was a vacancy at that time, and the Crusade for Voters [Richmond Crusade for Voters], which was the dominant black political organization here in, in this part of Virginia, had tentatively endorsed a white candidate and some of us felt this was our time, and so, "Who are we gonna run?"  They said, "Well, Bill Ward [HistoryMaker William E. Ward].  He's young, you know, he's known now.  He's gone to the state Democratic committee and had forced the old guard Democrats to walk out and all kinds of things like that up in Roanoke [Virginia]," and--so anyway, I ran but it was too late to file, so I ran as a write in candidate.  Five candidates running for Congress; Democrat nominee supported by some of the black establishments, Republican nominee, then two white independents and myself. And so here we are running across the 4th Congressional District, which is one of the largest districts here in Virginia, the one that John Mercer Langston, the only black man before--I mean in post Reconstruction to be elected from, back in the, the 1880s.  He served one term.  Anyway, I ran as a candidate and I came in I think third out of a five man race as a write in candidate.  Well, you know, that naturally taught me and others, you don't run as a write in candidate, although Strom--who was it, Strom Thurmond, or someone had run as a write in candidate in the South at one time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory ran for president, but that was more of a publicity--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Write me in.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so anyway, I lost and back to Clark University [Worcester, Massachusetts] and continued my, my studies. In '74 [1974] I--
Speaker 1: Oh, now, you were a chairman of the department, I think.
Speaker 2: No, that's later.
Speaker 1: That's later?
Speaker 2: That's much--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --much later.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That's much later.  I was teaching [at Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], but that was, that was it.  I was on a sabbatical at the time, but here I am on sabbatical, receiving half salary and some other stipends, come home to run for Congress, which is how crazy I was, because a lot of the times (unclear), people will come and say, "Hey, Bill Ward, you're really stretching it here."  I ran for Congress, lost, went back to Clark University, continued my, my work.
Story_ID: 669625
Speaker 1: But in the summer, I finished my residency at Clark [Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts] in '73 [1973], came back home, caught up in the politics of the City of Chesapeake [Virginia] and the state Democratic committee. In '74 [1974], my dates may be wrong, but I think in '74 [1974], I was a Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] delegate to the New York Democratic National Convention [1976 Democratic National Convention, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: That would be '76 [1976] I--
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976], that's--'76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: A little bit before the election.  It would be '76 [1976], yeah.  'Cause he, he was elected in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976], okay.  Yeah.  Democratic--I was a candidate for Jimmy Carter to the New York--the New York Democratic Convention.  That was my first national Democratic convention.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were a delegate for Jimmy Carter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Delegate for Jimmy Carter.
Speaker 2: What did you know about him, then, I mean, he surprised so many people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, not a whole lot, but you know, he--I had become active in the party and we wanted to make sure there was some black representation and I think, at that time, the party had adopted a, a, well for lack of another word right now, quarter system whereby it would guarantee X number of slots to minority candidates, delegates rather, at that point.  I think there was a way, I forgot how many the 4th district [4th Congressional District] was allocated, but I got one of those, one of those slots at the time. So, I went to New York [New York] and certainly that was another tremendous experience to be there in New York with all the politicians from all over the world.  I think at that time, I may be wrong on my dates here, but I'm trying to think, was--the black mayor at that time?  Maybe not.  Maybe he was--
Speaker 2: Mayor of what? Of--
Speaker 1: Mayor of New York.  I think it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins]? No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I don't think Dinkins was in the--
Speaker 1: No, Dinkins was later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I remember being in New York at a conference and being on the elevator with Dinkins and all of that, but that was later on.  It must have been another mayoral conference we had there in New York, something of that nature.  But anyway, I was there and then I came back and, you know, I was excited to have been there.
Story_ID: 669626
Speaker 1: And I ran for city council, I think, in '74 [1974].  That's where I'm getting, getting my--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) my dates are a little confused here.
Speaker 2: So, that was prior to working with the--
Speaker 1: Prior to the convention [1976 Democratic National Convention, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Prior to the convention, I ran for city council, and I lost that by five hundred votes, and so forth. So I said, "Well, I'm not gonna run for anything else again."  Spent all of my time concentrating on my work at Norfolk State [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], and so forth. For the next two or three years, I helped to get Clarke and Owens [Hugo A. Owens, Sr.] reelected and kind of took a back seat. But then in '77 [1977] Clarke died and, and we [Chesapeake Men for Progress; New Cheesecake Men for Progress, Chesapeake, Virginia] worked to get somebody appointed to finish his term.  His wife agreed to do that, so for a year or year and a half, Mrs. Clarke [Florine R. Clarke] served as the council appointed replacement for her husband, William Clarke [W.P. Clarke, Sr.].  So, in '78 [1978], she said, "I'm not gonna run again," and that's when we all looked around and said, "Well, Bill Ward [HistoryMaker William E. Ward], you gotta be the one.  You gotta go for that seat.  We gotta keep the two blacks on council." So I ran in 1978, had already created the model for the most part, and that is you work with your base, work with the black churches and the black neighborhood bosses, and so forth. And haven't been active in the Democratic committee over the next--over the previous seven or eight years.  I had gained some white support like that.  And so on election day in '78 [1978], I came in sixth, with the five, five seats, five vacancies on that--at that time. And when they counted the votes on election night, Bill Ward came in number six, and everybody said, "We thought you were gonna win." And I wasn't that far, I forgot how many votes I was behind.  Two days later when they counted the votes in the official canvas, they discovered at one precinct that at one machine, votes had not been counted for Bill Ward.  So, they found 123 votes at a southern city--near the southern precinct in the southern part of Chesapeake [Virginia] and moved me from the sixth place loser to a third place finisher. And so I was declared after a recount and all that, to be the winner, which knocked off one of the white winners by--and his closest competition had been about two votes or something like that. So anyway, I was finally elected to Chesapeake City Council in 1978, and served in that capacity as a councilmember until October 1990, when I became mayor.  So, during the twelve years as a councilmember, I began to build up some support, you know, in the larger community working with the mayors at that time, and all the mayors were Democratic mayors and councils were primarily the Democratic council.  Chesapeake didn't begin to shift until the '90s [1990s] to become a Republican city and now it's primarily Republican controlled.
Story_ID: 669627
Speaker 1: You were elected vice, vice mayor in '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and you became mayor in kind of a, what seemed to be fortuitous fashion to me but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, the--okay, the mayor who was elected in 1990--no, I'm sorry, '88 [1988], '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight [1988].  David Wynne [David I. Wynne] elected in '88 [1988], was forced to resign in '90 [1990] because of some irregularities.
Speaker 1: It was a fraud conviction that was overturned, though--it says here. I don't know what (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  But he was forced to resign.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Council [Chesapeake City Council] then, I was vice mayor, council then appointed me mayor to finish out his two years, and then I was elected on my own and--
Speaker 1: How did you, now this probably came as kind of a surprise. You were vice mayor, but nobody expected you to become the mayor, did they?
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  I mean, all of this (snaps fingers) happened so fast.  The mayor is supposed to resign, and we met in closed session and the Republicans are the ones who were, had to control the vote and they said, "Well, Bill Ward [HistoryMaker William E. Ward] is vice mayor and he should be mayor."  One Democratic friend who had hoped to be mayor was in Texas, so he wasn't there for the vote (laughter). And so they made me mayor, went on the floor and everybody voted, you know, in the affirmative and so I was elected mayor.
Speaker 1: Well, how did the community respond to that?
Speaker 2: Well, the community was, the black community naturally was overwhelmed.  There was no hostility, opposition from the white community, because by this time I had established myself as a, as a representative of all the people, as a councilmember.  And the reason I was elected over and over as a councilmember, '78 [1978], '82 [1982], '86 [1986], and '90 [1990], was because I had begun to gain white support, and my white support came from the Democratic committee, which was still strong. But it was also coming from the business community, which always, after '80 [1980] or '82 [1982], was kind of the basis of my support in terms of my financial support, so I was able to raise sufficient funds for my campaigns as mayor and also as a council member after, say, '82 [1982] and certainly after '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: So, when you were elected, did you have to, I don't know how much time it takes to be mayor of Chesapeake [Virginia], but did you have to change your working hours or stop teaching [at Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, well, see in Virginia, all mayors are simply--it's a strong mayor--it's a weak mayor form of government.  All Virginia cities.  The manager runs the city on the day to day.  He's hired to be the chief operational officer.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: The only strong mayor we now have in Virginia is the mayor of Richmond.  When they revised the charter and Doug Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] was elected, he became the first strong mayor in the city--in the State of Virginia.
Speaker 1: So, when you have a city manager form of government like--
Speaker 2: The council (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) (unclear), the city council the--
Speaker 2: The council hires the manager.  He has a responsibility and he's in charge of all of the departments.  He hires the department heads and he's, and he's in charge of the budget and everything.  So, basically the mayor in the weak form of government is simply presiding the office of the council and kind of the visible head, he speaks for the council. It's how you use that position as mayor, whether you remain an invisible mayor or visible mayor.  I became very much visible because I was always attending events, always speaking, taking on positional issues and what have you.  And so, as a result, when I ran in '82 [1982]--or '92 [1992], after having finished out the previous mayor's term, people had become comfortable with me, although each time I ran for mayor, I always had opposition, the Republican opponent.  But each time, I was able to get 51, 52, 55 percent of the vote and defeat this, it was always a one on one.
Story_ID: 669628
Speaker 1: In terms of 1968, I know it was the time when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died and also--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the convention of 1968 [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois], the presidential election, a lot of the, that's when the former Dixiecrats, a lot of them switched to the Republican Party, and did that happen in Virginia?  How did that happen here?
Speaker 2: I think it happen- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause some of the people--
Speaker 2: I think it happened, I think in Virginia it happened four years later--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --more so, as opposed to '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Because I know that's when Governor Wallace [George Wallace] switched to Republican--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wallace, right, right.
Speaker 1: Well, first he was Independent, then he became a Republican.
Speaker 2: But, but Virginia--the big switch in Virginia took place, I would say, four years later, in the '70s [1970s].  I can remember going to a state Democratic convention in Roanoke [Virginia] and I think it was '72 [1972]. And I know that the 4th Congressional District--ultimately what happened in that district meeting, I emerged as kind of the spokesman and there was a white walk out.  We had a number of black delegates and white Democrats who wanted a change in leadership in the district, so we kind of took over the 4th district leadership, and some of the other districts they were able to do, so the 2nd district [2nd Congressional District] here in Norfolk [Virginia], and the 3rd district [3rd Congressional District]--2nd and 3rd districts, the 3rd district was one that Bobby Scott now represents, which is Newport News [Virginia], Hampton [Virginia] and parts of Richmond [Virginia].  2nd district is Norfolk and Virginia Beach [Virginia]. So we had a large number of black delegates showing up at those state Democratic meetings at that time.  And so we were able to wrestle the leadership away from the existing stronghold here, and the 4th district has always been controlled naturally by the Byrd machine and Mills Godwin, and that group and others who had come out of the old Byrd machine.
Speaker 1: Sen- Senator Robert Byrd?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, not Robert but Harry Byrd [Harry F. Byrd, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Oh, Harry Byrd, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Harry Byrd. Robert Byrd is West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a powerhouse out there.
Story_ID: 669629
Speaker 1: The 1970s was an exciting decade where things began to stabilize.  And in the, in the '80s [1980s]--here again, Chesapeake [Virginia] began to grow in the '80s [1980s], began to attract multinational businesses, residential units were come in, popping up.  The population was growing at 3 and 4 and 5 percent, and then when I became mayor in 1990 for the next ten years, during my tenure, we continued to expand.  I began to travel internationally and nationally to attract multinational businesses.  I spent several trips into Japan, which was very lucrative for us, also in Europe and other parts of Asia, Taiwan, wherever we could--and also in this country, also I did a lot of travel. So all of this began to add to my persona as an aggressive weak mayor in a sense, and we were able to get some things done.  We were able to get federal funding and approve and upgrade some of the old black neighborhoods, old traditional Chesapeake, rural Chesapeake, which was a county until '63 [1963]. Had two populations, us and them. And the us, the black people, all lived in little villages throughout the city, and so we didn't begin to integrate the city until the early '70s [1970s], and today it's much harder to determine your base if you're dependent solely on your black base, because it's no longer restricted to these, quote villages, just because it's a highly integrated city.  There's 354 square miles, we have fifty-five voting precincts, black people live everywhere, all candidates, all officials are elected at large.  I was always elected at large, never from a ward system, never from a precinct system. And that's the interesting part about my political life is that the demographics of Chesapeake has always remained stable, about 22 or 23 percent African American and 77, 76, 77, 78 percent majority race.  So, for any candidate or any person, and any minority candidate to win, he or she must be able to build bridges, and that was one of my campaign themes, building bridges.  Another one was promises made, promises kept.  So, I always try to represent all the people, and in the neighborhoods, you know, I was always there.  Wherever invited, I would appear; white churches, black churches, and ultimately I developed a good support base in the white churches.  I had five white ministers who would meet with me on a monthly basis to pray once a month in my office.  We would meet and they would pray with me, for me. And the National Day of Prayer, I had no problem in participating in that and taking on leadership in that, and, so and then I established a sister cities program, which got us into Brazil.  I've been in and out of Brazil four, five, six, seven times, and we have a sister city in southern Brazil, in Joinville and Santa Catarina state.  As a result of my first trip to Brazil, which was a business trip, I was able to bring Varga Brakes [TRW Brakes Brazil] to the City of Chesapeake.  First trip to Japan I was able to bring Yupo [Yupo Corporation], which is a large Japanese Company. Oji-Yuka paper company [Oji-Yuka Synthetic Paper Company; Yupo Corporation], $100 million investment.  So, you'll see some of the pictures I have here on the back table, the governors of Virginia, particularly George Allen.  The Republican governor always came down and presented me a big check, a state incentive, a state investment check to bring a business here.  So these are the kinds of exciting things that we were able to do during, during my tenure.
Story_ID: 669630
Speaker 1: There was a, a controversy with the police department I have a note about in 1995, what happened, some kind of an inquiry into the police department in Chesapeake [Chesapeake Police Department] that you were involved in--
Speaker 2: Nine- in nine--?
Speaker 1: Ninety-five [1995], yeah.  There was a, it says here that you opposed an inquiry into the police department, but the circuit court called for a special grand jury or something to, to investigate something the police department did.  You don't remember that?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sure about that one.  There's always some, there was always some, some issues that, you know, I don't know if there had been a complaint against the police department or what have you.  I know at one time, the police chief had come under fire and I think I supported him, but I don't know if that's the answer to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't know.  It's kind of a sketchy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --piece.  It doesn't go into detail about what it is.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, if you pull some stuff off of the web or from the newspapers, there may be hundreds of (laughter) stories of controversies, like (unclear) city, probably one of the most (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well how is that--earlier you talked about, you know, watching them, what the white law enforcement officials do to black people on weekends--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the town you grew up in [Keysville, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: How--were, were those issues when you were mayor of Chesapeake [Virginia]?  How the police treated people of color? Profiling? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You always got complaints about being stopped, about being harassed.  There was one case in the community I originally lived in here in Chesapeake, Fernwood Farms. Two young girls, lived a sheltered life, and for some reason one of them had become emotionally upset or what have you, and she was in the street with a knife and the police was called and they approached her and they asked her to drop the knife, and she didn't drop the knife and they fired on her. So that really enraged the black community, particularly the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], which took this up. And I made some comments at the city council meeting [of the Chesapeake City Council] that the police may have overreacted and--or something like that, which really upset the police people, you know, naturally you say anything--they had always been very supportive of me and the public safety people, and I always supported them, so that was an incident and the NAACP pursued it. And you know police investigations always exonerate the police 99 percent of the time, you know, and so they said, "Well, instead of tazing the girl," which was about a ninety-nine pound little girl, "they shot her." But it was not--she was not severely wounded or anything.
Speaker 1: Did they kill her?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no.  She was not severely wounded.  But that wasn't--one of the incidents.  Otherwise, racial--race relations in Chesapeake had been relatively good. No, no large scale incidents. And I always, myself, tried to bridge the racial divide.  I always did whatever I could do to bridge that divide between the black and white and a lot of people, a lot of people from the majority race always, you know, I think praised me on that and felt comfortable with me because of my ability to do that.  I always felt, I always felt comfortable as a black person in a white environment.  I mean, even back in the early days when it was really crazy in the City of Chesapeake, I would go to a meeting, into places where black people were there and I'd venture and oftentimes I went with whites who invited me, but you know, it's what you have to do.  You know, Chesapeake being a southern town, you know, the ways of getting into a white community is through their picnics and their barbecues.  They love barbecues, they love country and western music.  We have a spring festival called the Chesapeake Jubilee, and there we have--Friday night is black music night, Saturday is mixed night, and Sunday is country western night (laughter).  We have these annual--the Kiwanis [Kiwanis International] and the Shriners [Shriners International] and the Ruritans [Ruritan National] all have their barbecues and their picnics.  I always go to those, get ticket and go, and eat pig and drink beer with the boys and all of that, so bridging--building bridges.
Story_ID: 669631
Speaker 1: When you won reelection was it by a great, was it--how, how big a margin was it?
Speaker 2: As a councilmember, my margins were always good, you know, 50, maybe 60 percent.  Councils are always tight because here again, it's one on one. For cou- I mean for mayor, they were always tight, one on one. For city council, I used to run on a ticket of the individuals.  It would usually be myself and four white candidates, and maybe two blacks and three white candidates.  Usually I would be the only black on the ticket and when I became mayor, I would be the head of the ticket, certainly. And I was able to carry white candidates with me.  So, you know, it's how you build those bridges, how you build those relationships.  That's what politics is; a lot of compromise, a lot of relationship building, and certainly campaigning, how to raise money (laughter), as you know, coming from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I mean, the, as the mayoral candidate, each time I was able to raise an excess of $100,000.  The city council elections are always, I was able to raise whatever we needed, forty, fifty, sixty thousand dollars, that kind of thing.  Here again, I was the favorite son of the business community.  You don't raise money--I hate to say it, from the black community, a few dollars from the church, but, you see, back in the '70s [1970s] when I first got started, we would raise money through little fish fries and picnics and barbecues, and stuff like that. Do a lot of work, very little money.  My theory of fundraising is you go where the money is, you go where the money is.  Even as a fundraiser for the university [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], you go where the money is.  The foundations, the banks, you know.  You don't go ask people who don't have any money.  You go and ask them to support you, yes.  You don't ignore them and you don't forget your base; at the same time, you have to make sure, and that's one of the problems we have had in the most recent city council election.  The candidates, the Democratic candidates, were not able to raise any money.  We lost three incumbents in Chesapeake [Virginia].  We lost the school board incumbent, and two city council incumbents. I'm talking about African American incumbents.  Now, at one time, we had four African Americans on the Chesapeake City Council.  It was a nine person council, nine person school board, all four elected at large.  Now we have a seven to two ratio in the city council, all Republican and two African American Democrats.
Story_ID: 669632
Speaker 1: The university has always been supportive of my political aspirations and my role in the community, which has been most helpful.  Were it not for the community support and my family support--I must not leave out my family--because I've been almost thirty years out--involved. But getting back to the university, it was certainly a juggle, because once I became mayor [of Chesapeake, Virginia] particularly, I would have meetings, you know, and have to attend--I tried to always arrange my community meetings off schedule, off schedule. But I was off and on the campus, I had a reserved parking spot here on campus so I could just come out and get to the city if necessary and back.  I had good departmental support and staff there.  I was only chairman [of the department of history] for, I think, about three years, maybe four years at the max, and that was towards the end of my tenure as a professor here at Norfolk State University [Norfolk, Virginia].  I retired in 2000, which really freed me up for the next term, 2000 to 2004, my last term, to really be full time mayor.  I was able to do it, but it was run, run, run between the two worlds and having to change, you know, your mindset, going from the classroom to some community meeting, Ruritans' meeting [Ruritan National], Rotary meeting [Rotary International], or what have you.  You always just have to be programmed into it.
Story_ID: 669633
Speaker 1: Let me say a word, if, if time permits, about family.  My wife [Rose Ward] is a professional educator, Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] doctorate, and so she had her own life, her own professional life and her own social life.
Speaker 2: When did you meet your wife?
Speaker 1: I met my wife at Virginia State College [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and she was from Norfolk [Virginia], and so I met her there when I was matriculating for my master's [degree].  She did two years here at Norfolk State University [Norfolk, Virginia] and finished at Virginia State.  Originally, Norfolk State University was a two year school and Virginia State was the parent school, so many of the students back in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] would transfer into Petersburg [Virginia] to Virginia State.  Anyway, we met there and then I came here to teach at I.C. Norcom [I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia] and she taught in Portsmouth [Virginia] and we got married in 1960.  We are celebrating our fiftieth anniversary this month, May the 6th, 2010. And we have two children, a boy and a girl.  Both are professional educators.  My son [Michael Ward] is a principal of an intermediate school in Chesapeake [Virginia]. My daughter, currently Dr. Woodhouse [Michelle Ward Woodhouse], is a dean of the school of humanities [sic.] at Tidewater Community College [Tidewater Community College Virginia Beach Campus, Virginia Beach, Virginia].  We have one grandchild, the daughter of my daughter--I mean--of my daughter, that's my grandbaby, a fifth grader, eleven years old. And my son lives out in the country with cats and dogs and a horse and animals, so that's my family. But my wife has always been supportive, I have to give her special credit because the success of any politician is the support and willingness of his wife and family to give him that space, that time.  I probably overdid it because from 1970 to 1980, I was on the road either out of the country or at Clark.  There were some incidents I would have to go back to Clark University [Worcester, Massachusetts] to work on, to write, I couldn't write at home.  I was too busy in the community, and so I finished my doctorate in 1977, although I started in 1970.  I did three years of residence and then in the summers I would go back and finish up the writing on my dissertation.  So, so families are very important, and I'm sure that other politicians you have interviewed would indicate that, or they should have because they would not be successful, would not have been successful were it not for family.
Story_ID: 669634
Speaker 1: So, you, you were mayor from '96 [1996] to 2004 [2004]? That's a--
Speaker 2: Mayor, mayor from--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --nineteen ninety [1990] to, for fourteen years.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To 2004. Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that makes you the longest serv- still, you're still the longest serving mayor of Chesapeake [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Longest serving mayor in the City of Chesapeake and the longest serving member of the council in the City of Chesapeake [Chesapeake City Council].  It's twenty-six years. And then we have some guys on there now who almost have twenty years of service, and so forth and they, they beat my record, but I was there for a long time.  Keep in mind the city was formed in 1963, so the city is only about what, forty-eight, forty-seven years old, something like that.  So, almost a quarter of a century of the city's history I was an integral part of the city.  I still play a role in terms of the New Men for Progress [New Chesapeake Men for Progress Educational Foundation, Inc., Chesapeake, Virginia] or the old Chesapeake Men for Progress, and then the New Men for Progress.  I'm still active in the community.  I'm the president of the Great Bridge Waterways historical society [Great Bridge Battlefield and Waterways History Foundation, Chesapeake, Virginia].  We are trying to build a visitor center on the site of the Battle of the Great Bridge, which was fought December 9, 1775, in which William Flora, a black soldier, played a significant role. Vice president of the Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeast Virginia, Chesapeake, Virginia], I'm a member of the Hampton Roads [Virginia] public television, WHRO [WHRO-TV], a number of other organizations I am active with. And then I'm here now as a legislative liaison for Norfolk State University [Norfolk, Virginia], so I still have a very active life.  I'm probably over involved for someone seventy-six years old, and--in relatively good health until just a couple weeks, but for the most part I feel good.  I enjoy life.  I enjoy doing what I do.  I enjoy people, and that's key to any public servant's life.  You must like people.  You can't be afraid of people.  You have to be able to wade into the crowd, into the mob, to hug and embrace people.  So many politicians don't have that whatever it is, that knack, to do that, and I would--and an aspiring politician who has an opportunity to view this interview, I would say you have to have a fire in the belly.  You have to have the willingness to commit, overcommit.  You can't pimp on the people. You have to--they have to believe you.  They have to believe in you.  They have to believe in your leadership, in your willingness.  You have to make a lot of sacrifices.  But--this is my sermon for this, for this part of the interview.
Story_ID: 669635
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done and--you did as mayor, what would you consider to be your, the singular accomplishments and the highpoints?
Speaker 2: Of my mayoralship, it was certainly the ability to attract some fifty some international and national businesses to Chesapeake [Virginia].  We had the largest number of international businesses in the City of Chesapeake, about fifteen countries with some fifty or more international businesses; a large number of Japanese businesses, European businesses in Chesapeake.  I always said my mission or my goal was to build a city.  Well, we in part did that and it's, I think, the jewel of Hampton Roads [Virginia].  It's a thriving city, it's a prosperous city; $140 million, I'm not a part of the $140 million in reserves, but I mean, I helped to build a foundation for what the subsequent councils [Chesapeake City Council] have been able to maintain and to continue.  We have a AAA bond rating, although--that we were able to establish, we have a great school system, forty thousand kids in our public schools [Chesapeake Public Schools]. People moved to Chesapeake because of the quality of life, job opportunities, safe community and tremendous educational system, so a well managed system, a securer system, a city that's livable.  We won many national awards because of this, and so forth. So I, that's a part of my legacy I'm proud of.
Story_ID: 669636
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done, is there anything that you would do differently if you could if--?
Speaker 2: Well, sure we all made mistakes, make mistakes.  I made some mistakes along the way politically and certainly ignored my family sometimes more than I should have, but they've done well, so I, you know. As I mentioned, my wife [Rose Ward] is a professional educator and my kids [Michael Ward and Michelle Ward Woodhouse] have done well, are doing well, they're living well, enjoying their lives. And so, you know, I think for the most part I'm comfortable with what I've been able to do given the poor black boy being--coming from rural Southside Virginia with limited opportunities, but with a lot of support.  Just an ordinary individual with extraordinary success.
Story_ID: 669637
Speaker 1: Now, there was a story that's in the outline about an actual physical conflict with one of the Republican campaign volunteers or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at one point. What, what, what happened?
Speaker 2: That was towards the end of one of those stupid things that probably I did.  4th Congressional District, there was an election to fill the vacancy of a deceased congressman, Norman Sisisky, and Louise Lucas, black state senator, was running for that position on the Democratic ticket. And Randy Forbes, who is some kind of a friend, in fact I have a plaque there that he presented on the floor of the [U.S.] Congress, a resolution. He ran as a Republican candidate and he's the current winner.  Anyway, Tom DeLay sent his army in here to support Forbes and these guys were aggressive. Came out to the conference center in Chesapeake [Chesapeake Conference Center, Chesapeake, Virginia] and they were ripping up Lucas' signs and placing their signs in front of her signs, and I went out to confront them and there was a little confrontation there. But we ultimately settled in (unclear). And here again, my good friend, famous lawyer downtown in Norfolk [Virginia] represented me and we just agreed to, you know, to resolve everything with a handshake.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is the same Tom DeLay, former congressman from Texas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right. The whip man.
Speaker 1: He's the architect of the Tea Party movement now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's very active there, Tom DeLay, on indictment, though, in Texas, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, him and Dick Armey, I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dick Armey is very active with the Tea Party movement, and all of that.  We have not had, as I have been able to determine, uprising of Tea Partyers in Chesapeake [Virginia], in this most recent city council election. And one of the problems in our incumbent laws is--because of poor black turnout.  Chesapeake is 230,000 people, 110 or 115 thousand, over 50 percent of the people are registered in Chesapeake.  The voter turnout (audio disturbance) at this recent city council election was 14.6 percent, and in the black precincts it's probably 8 or 9 percent, but the Republican Party was able to get its base out and to elect a slate of four people to city council and to the school board.  So, that's what happened there.  Black people don't vote in local elections here in Chesapeake and in this region.  I mean, they poured out in great astronomical numbers for Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and the presidential elections, even gubernatorial elections.  For some reason, we have to educate the masses of black people, and the masses of people, to the importance of local government.  Local city councils and board of supervisors have as much influence on your daily life as the Congress or even the state government.  It is the local government that determines the tax rate that would be imposed on your real estate or other moneys that would be spent for your schools and your roads and your sewers.  We are the people; the mayors and city council are the ones who determine most--all aspects of your life from birth to the grave, determines where the hospitals will be built, determines where the cemeteries will go (laughter), determines where the police will be concentrated, where the dollar for every aspect of your daily lives, but people don't understand that.  They defer to a very small group to make decisions that determines their lives. And that's, that to me has always been a great disappointment in my--as far as I'm concerned, to be able to convince people of how important local government is.

Speaker 1: Hope this isn't redundant, but we always ask this question in this way: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, that they would become more engaged politically, that, keep in mind, the myth, the myth of achievement as Brother West [Cornel West], Dr. West in his book, 'Race Matters,' race still matters in every aspect of life as it relates to African American people.  We have to understand that just because we have an African American president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], it's not time to relax, it's not time to go to sleep.  One of the things too, and we didn't get into this, but I guess it's just as well, is my disappointment in the black church today in terms of providing the leadership that it used to provide in terms of social action movements.  We had very little of that.  The churches today are in competition with each other to become the megachurch and in many instances the deification of the minister. And so we've lost a lot of the old time religion, the old time of church activism, many of the churches today, in this area here, in Chesapeake [Virginia] and in the greater Hampton Roads [Virginia] area.  I see that absence or that, I hope we can return to the church as a center of social consciousness and social activism, and one that educates people for today's life, for living today, you know.  I have no problem with heaven and preparing for the afterlife, but I think we can make life here a little better.  I think this is my heaven, to live here as well as I can, or it can be my hell, and it is hell for many people.
Story_ID: 669639
Speaker 1: There was one thing I wanted to ask you about that's not really one of our--I'm almost done, only about three questions to go, but I did ask you about--now, you were here when--you weren't mayor though I don't think when John Muhammad [John Allen Muhammad], the sniper, was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, very much.  I was mayor and, when the, when the judge and the sheriff decided to bring the trial here--
Speaker 1: For Lee Malvo [Lee Boyd Malvo]--
Speaker 2: --for John Muhammad in Virginia Beach [Virginia] and the younger--
Speaker 1: Lee Malvo.
Speaker 2: Malvo, the young kid, over to Chesapeake [Virginia].  I protested.  I told them I didn't want it here in Chesapeake.  I thought it was going to be bad for the city. "Oh, it's gonna bring in, you know, national attention. We can prove how great we are, we can protect it," and all this, and I was afraid we were going to have our own slaughter of just masses of people coming, but--so we spent thousands of dollars in repairing and putting in an infrastructure for all the national and international media and what have you. People calling me, wanting to get permission for a vendor tent and all of that (laughter), but I went on national TV and all looked at me saying I had concern.  But my concerns were, I guess, overstated because the trial went well.  I had a couple friends on the jury and I went one day to go over just to visit.  The sheriff invited me over.  I went in, a young innocent boy, a handsome young kid, I mean, you just ask yourself how can a kid, you know, a smart looking young kid, how could he turn and become so evil?  That's one of the tragedies of this today, is our youth that scares me.  I hope in some kind of way we can reach out and save these young black men and redirect them, the same kind of thing you found all over America you'll find here in Chesapeake, you'll find here in this community as well, young misguided black men in the Chesapeake jail, which is probably, we spent more money to build a jail in Chesapeake than we did city hall [Chesapeake City Hall, Chesapeake, Virginia].  City hall was called the Taj Mahal, but the jail was built for 950 inmates and we've got 1250 in the Chesapeake city jail [Chesapeake Correctional Center, Chesapeake, Virginia] right now, and 90 percent of those are African American men, seventeen to twenty-six years of age, a whole generation of black men, a whole generation of leadership, a whole generation of contributors lost to society.  That's kind of a bad commentary to bring this interview towards the end, but I would hope that those of you who get a chance to look at this interview will look at some of the things that I've tried to say and glean from it some ray of hope and some kinds of ideas as to how to move your lives and to help your communities and to do what you can do.

Speaker 1: Be a public servant, be a public servant.  That's all I want on my--let me tell you one final story, Larry [Larry Crowe].  One of the most controversial projects in my whole tenure as mayor was the Chesapeake Conference Center [Chesapeake, Virginia].  I realized we needed a symbol, a physical symbol in the city, because we don't have a CBDG [community development block grant].  We don't have a community develop- we don't have a central business district, just a sprawling, urban, suburban city, as I said, 354 square miles, so we don't have a quote downtown.  We have nodes.  We have many commercial nodes, residential communities and commercial nodes.  Well, Greenbrier [Chesapeake, Virginia] is one of our nodes, our largest most developed commercial node, and so we have a conference center there that we built. I felt it was necessary bring in conferences and to give us attention, and we self financed it and, I mean, the vote was 5/4, the councilmembers [on the Chesapeake City Council] was opposed, the city opposed it, press opposed it, they all gave me hell, and this whole battery of stories opposing it and what have you.  Well, it was built and it became a model of success for other cities because prior to that, we were the one with a conference center.  Now, every city in Hampton Roads [Virginia] has a conference center, lodging more expensively built, although we are still doing tremendous business and everyone uses it, the people who opposed it, primarily the Republicans.  The Republicans who opposed it used it and incidentally, next week they are going to name the ballroom the William E. Ward Ballroom, ironically, in the building that at one time was part of my curse, I guess.  So, you know, that's kind of where we are today.
Story_ID: 669641
Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Public servant; a man who loves his people, his community, a man who always tried to give back.  He was a public servant to the community, to the university [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], and wherever and whenever called upon to serve.  That's why I'm still as active as I am and just to be remembered as a public servant.  To those to whom much is given, much is expected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much for sharing your story with us.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of, of me with two of my political supporters. George Whitfield is now deceased, a farmer from the southern part of the city, one of my early, early supporters, particularly when Chesapeake [Virginia] was all Democratic. This is Linwood [Linwood Nelms], always a great friend and member of the housing authority. We used to travel a lot when I was a councilmember and liaison to the Chesapeake Redevelopment and Housing Authority. We toured all over the country too, and that was one of the things that I pride myself on with the redevelopment efforts.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: All right, this is with one of my former campaign workers, a young lady who--Betsy [ph.], worked for me in one of my campaigns, not as manager but as an assistant, my community person and she had her own business at one time. And so many of these people, we no longer--I don't see that often now. I have a core people who stay with me throughout all of my campaigns, but this young lady, she has raised her family now and is semiretired.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is, here I am with a group of Japanese businessmen from one of the many Japanese companies I was able to invite to Chesapeake. And this is, I think these are representatives of the Yupo company of Japan [Yupo Corporation], a paper company. Chesapeake was able to attract about fifteen Japanese companies.
Speaker 2: Here I'm, here I'm presenting the key of the city to the presidents at one of the Japanese companies. His name, I don't recall at this time.
Speaker 1: One of the thing I always enjoyed was participating with groups and particularly kids. Here's a Walk America, March of Dimes program [March of Dimes Foundation]. As you can see, I'm there preparing to march with them in 1992. I also participated with the Relay for Life. I'm a prostate cancer survivor, and that was always a project I always supported.
Speaker 2: There I am with the former mayor of Virginia Beach [Virginia], Meyera Oberndorf, a dear friend, and two of her friends. I always had a great relationship with the other mayors in the, in the region. We met once a month in the mayors caucus, and we got along well although we divided into seven cities near Hampton Roads [Virginia], but we did have a pretty good relationship.
Speaker 1: Here I am with one of many ground breakings. I'm with the redevelopment housing authority people at that time, great, great friend of mine now deceased, Clinton Grandy, former member of the housing authority, former chairman.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Here's a picture of my wife, Dr. Rose Ward. We first met at Virginia State University [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] many years ago. We are now celebrating our fiftieth anniversary, May the 6th, 1960. She's been a strong supporter, great influence on my life, made many sacrifices because of the many, many years of absence and out late at nights and involvements in the community and what have you.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: My high school graduating class, Central High School, Charlotte County, Virginia [Charlotte Court House, Virginia], 1953. I think there was twenty-seven of us there, and only about five of us went to college. This young man is now a lawyer, I see him once in a while, a very successful young man. And this young man is a retired principal, and there I am in the back. Others I don't recall offhand.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a (cough) this is picture of my mother, one of the two pictures I have. She died at age fifty-three, and a very loving individual, hard working, loved the children and did everything she could to help me.
Speaker 2: Give her full name too.
Speaker 1: Here, again, is the picture of my mother, Annie Mae Ward [Annie Ward], who reared five boys. Two--three of us are alive now [HistoryMaker William E. Ward, Samuel Ward and Bernard Ward], two are deceased [Clarence Ward and Frank Ward], very little education, but was a hard, hard worker. Most of her life she was a domestic worker.

Speaker 1: Here I am with former governor, George Allen, who was presenting the governor's incentive check to me for one of the many companies we were able to attract to Chesapeake [Virginia].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Here I am with vice president--former Vice President Al Gore at the White House [Washington, D.C.] and one of the many visits to the White House as mayor.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Here I am at the farmers auction in Chesapeake [Virginia] during our annual jubilee [Chesapeake Jubilee], and we are auctioning off livestock that the young boys have raised--and girls, throughout the year. Always an exciting event, one that I always participate in.
Speaker 2: Here I am with former President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] on another visit to the White House. As mayor we were able to visit the White House at least twelve, thirteen times.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Here's a picture of me being sworn in to city council [Chesapeake City Council] by the clerk of the court at that time, Leo Hart [ph.].
Speaker 1: That was back in the '80s [1980s], right?
Speaker 2: In the 1980s.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my family; myself, my wife, Rose [Rose Ward], my daughter, Michelle Woodhouse, Michelle Ward Woodhouse, and Michael Ward. I only have the two children. Rose, Michelle and Michael.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a collage presented to me of a series of pictures during my retirement from the local newspaper, The Virginian-Pilot; 1978, when first elected to a city council to my retirement in 2004. Incidentally, I'd like to point out that the business community gave me an all expense trip to Europe that summer. We spent the summer in France, Rose and myself.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Another framed collage given to me by a friend of a front page story from The Chesapeake Clipper, 'The Mellow Mayor: Healing the City.' This was early in my administration as mayor, the first, first term.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): While you were still mellow?
Speaker 1: While I was still mellow. Yeah, while I was still mellow.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Not so mellow as the years went by (laughter).
