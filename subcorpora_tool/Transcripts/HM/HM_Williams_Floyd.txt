Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as sort of a warm-up.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Probably not well, maybe, Salmon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: I do like blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: When it's warm, March, April and May.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, because I don't really take vacations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I like to say that "People don't care about how much you know until they know about how much you care".
Story_ID: 24248
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but I'm going to ask about them separately, and then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Lee Edna;  L-E-E, E-D-N-A.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what's her first name?
Speaker 2: Lee, L-E-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Edna?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  E-D-N-A.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And, what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh!  Oh!
Speaker 1: Well, don't worry about it, if you can't remember it, it'll come to you at some point.
Speaker 2: Excuse me.  Anderson.
Speaker 1: Anderson?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is 1921, October 31st.  I knew she was born in Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was born just across the river   from--
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: From Kansas City, Missouri.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Not so far back.  I know my mother's mother, her name is Willia, W-I-L-L-I-A; Willia Hensley. Of course, she's now deceased, and you said you would ask about my father in another part.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  So,just kind of stick with your mother's side right now until we exhaust it, and then we'll  go to your father.
Speaker 2: And my mother's father, he is John Anderson, born in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you knew your grandparents, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had time and opportunities to interact with both of them before they were deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did they tell stories about their parents at all, or where they came from?
Speaker 2: The--no--actually my--well I guess they did, but I don't remember much about that, because Willia Hensley lived in San Francisco, and we only saw her a couple of times.  And that was different with my grandfather, John Anderson; he lived in Kansas City [Kansas]. So I saw him on a more regular basis--actually he lived in Kansas City, Kansas, but he came to Kansas City, Missouri, and we also had a chance to see him during the year to make visits there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your grandfather do for a living?
Speaker 2: As I recall, he worked at a packing house.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how he wound up in Kansas City, coming out of New Orleans?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your mother say about growing up?  Did she grow up in Kansas City, Kansas, or in Missouri?
Speaker 2: Well, probably both.  I knew that she lived with--of course, my grandfather, John Anderson, was living in Kansas City, Kansas, and I believed she lived right down the street from them.  And she did come to Missouri at a later point in the early 40's, as I recall, and then she went to--this was during World War II [1939-1945].  She went to California to regroup her life because some very difficult situations when we were put in a foster home, my older brother and I.  And then she came back and rejoined--rejoined as a family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have a chance to finish high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or go to college?
Speaker 2: Not college, but she did finish high school.
Speaker 1: Do you know what school she finished?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Gosh!  I think it was Lincoln--I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: You think it was Lincoln High School?
Speaker 2: Actually, I'm not sure.  I thought I was going to say Lincoln, but I'm not sure?
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'll just put a question mark behind it.  I mean it's something that--if somebody was trying to follow up on this, it's better to have a hint than not any clue at all.  So, because you think it's Lincoln, it's better than saying, we don't know anything.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So.  She may have finished Lincoln [High School].  But she did finish high school.  Did she share with you what her aspirations were when she was a teenager?
Speaker 2: Well, she was quite interested in singing as a little girl.  She did a lot of singing.  And, of course, music was always--still is part of her life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But as she grew older, and as we were older and so forth, she spent the last thirty years of her life going to be--training to be a real estate agent.  And then she became a real estate broker.  So that was the--one of the major things that she did in her life--the later part of her life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After raising eight children.
Story_ID: 24249
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about why your grandmother went to San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, my grandfather and my grandmother were divorced at a--when they were--quite early so tha--their lives separated because of that, because we have some relatives that were also some musicians in the San Francisco area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, who were these relatives?  Can you tell us about them, who were musicians?
Speaker 2: Members of the Hunt family.  We had uncles that were musicians.
Speaker 1: That is H-O-T?
Speaker 2: H-U-N-T.
Speaker 1: H-U-N--Hunt?  Okay.  Hunt family.  What kind of music did they play?
Speaker 2: Well, basic background is jazz and blues.  About all you can play in the various clubs.
Speaker 1: All right.  So they were already out in San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some were already in San Francisco, and some relatives were in Chicago [Illinois], that I don't know very much about.  But I went to high school with Marshall and Ronald Hunt; they were my cousins, of course, and they were--we were musicians in Mr. Davis' Marching Band.
Speaker 1: They're members of the same Hunt family who went to--
Speaker 2: Yes, same family.  Younger members, of course, because many of them are deceased, we're going back seventy-sixty-five to seventy years.  But Marshall Hunt played the trumpet.  He and I were the best trumpet players at--in Mr. Davis' Band, and he went on to play with Count Basie before he was killed in a Radio Shack robbery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he had a fairly long career, I guess.
Speaker 2: Actually, we were young then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--I guess he graduated from high school, and might have played some gigs in the California area, then he got a big break with Count Basie, and then they asked him to be a manager of the Radio Shack.  They were trying to put a Radio Shack in a black community, because they had been in all the white communities, and that was quite an honor for him, but it was tragic, because a young boy came in there on a bicycle and robbed the store and killed him.
Speaker 1: Was this in San Francisco?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Either San Francisco or Los--I think it was Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, are there a lot of musicians in your family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My basic influence came from my older brother, Norman Williams, obviously because, living in the same house and growing up together.
Speaker 1: Now, what did he play?
Speaker 2: His first instrument was what was called a C melody saxophone.  I mean, they don't even make that anymore.  I think my mother bought him a C melody saxophone.
Speaker 1: Now, what is a C melody--now, is it a--now, we know the soprano, I think it's the smallest one and you got an alto and a tenor, you know--
Speaker 2: Alto is more standard, of course, than the tenor is the next in size and then the baritone is the largest one.
Speaker 1: Right.  And where would the C melody fit in?
Speaker 2: Well, they don't make those anymore.  I guess that used to be tuned with the piano, with the key C, but with the alto saxophone.  If I remember, there are six steps difference; that is, if I play a C on a piano, the alto would have to play an A with is six steps above to get the same tonality.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So the C melody" saxophone went out many years ago, probably didn't--I guess it was like one of these cars that comes and stays on the market a year or so and just part of no more.
Speaker 1: So it was a novel ideal but it didn't catch on?
Speaker 2: No.  The standard of course is a center of the alto saxophone, the tenor and then the soprano, I meant the baritone.  But then later, when, you know, people like John Coltrane, made the soprano saxophone quite important.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering now, was there a C melody saxophone for all those different sizes, I mean for the C melody tenor as well as the--
Speaker 2: No, no, that wouldn't--you wouldn't hear that, it's just called a C melody saxophone.
Speaker 1: So it's the size of an alto, or about the size of an alto?
Speaker 2: Probably about, yeah, closer to the size of an alto.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your brother played C melody saxophone.  Did he keep playing music?
Speaker 2: Well, he eventually went to--his main instrument was the alto saxophone, because in the band, I guess, all of the instruments had to be--you couldn't have a C melody and an alto in the band.  So he played the alto saxophone the basic part of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Various recordings and night clubs.
Speaker 1: Who did he record with?
Speaker 2: Well, he had his own band.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess at one point, he had three different bands in San Francisco.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, back to your mother.  So she finished high school.  Was she involved--she was a singer, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah. She sung, and then she learned some piano. Actually, she went back to learning piano later in her life.
Story_ID: 24250
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: I just know his name as Floyd, F-L-O-Y-D; Williams.  That's my biological father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Was he older than your mother [Lee Edna Anderson], much older than your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I would be probably be--not a whole lot older but--
Speaker 1: By 1925 or so, I mean 1918?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That might be a good guess, 1918, 1915 or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was your father born, do you know?
Speaker 2: I have no idea, because I have a vague recollection of him back in the 1940s.  But he just kind of vanished off the face of the earth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you say vanished.  It raises some questions in my mind.  Are you saying that there was no conflict you knew of between the two them?
Speaker 2: He's just this type of man that, I guess, impregnated my mother and took no responsibility; just left us as children, left her as a young mother.
Speaker 1: So, is he the father of all your siblings?
Speaker 2: No, no.  He's the father of me and my older brother, Norman Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I remember some years later, I asked his mother, who was my grandmother, had she heard from Floyd, and I was surprised that she hadn't even heard from him.  So not only did he walk out of my mother's life, but he walked out of his mother's life.
Speaker 1: So there was no--well, you know, from what you're saying, I mean, you didn't see him growing up at all?
Speaker 2: I might have seen him a couple of times, I think I vaguely remember him taking us to the store to buy some candy, probably around near the end of the war [World War II], maybe 1944, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You would have been about fourteen?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was around five or six years old then.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: I believe that's the last time I--my last recollection of him.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So you were born almost in 1940, so you would have been about five then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Basically, what I got from him was my name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he a musician?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I heard that he was a honky tonk piano player.  In fact, the last that I heard--somebody said they saw him at a boat playing the piano, must have been around--in the middle of 1940s or so.
Speaker 1: So you knew his mother in Kansas City [Missouri?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Her name was Myrtle Williams, a very beautiful lady with a very positive Christian influence on all of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know much about the rest of his family?  Do you know where they came from?
Speaker 2: No, I have no idea.  No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Do they have any stories of coming from anywhere other than Kansas City?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't know.  They lived in Rosedale, Kansas. And I remember what it really was to get in the garbage truck with my grandfather and go around to these different farms and collect garbage in those filthy stuff, but we were just kids and it was just exciting.
Speaker 1: So, your grandfather was a garbage man?
Speaker 2: He was a garbage man, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: We could just call him Mr. Williams.  I'm not sure what his first name is.  I certainly should know that, but I don't know.
Story_ID: 24251
Speaker 1: Do you know if your dad [biological father: Floyd Williams] had a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: No.  I wouldn't have clue about that.  My real father is Mr. Lawrence Rollins.
Speaker 1: Now, this is technically people would call stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Uh-huh, but he's the man that married my mother [Lee Edna Anderson] when she had five kids and stayed with her, I think about thirty-five or thirty-six years until his death.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: Lawrence, L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E; Rollins, R-O-L-L-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's the one that really brought stability to my mother's life and to us five kids, and then there were three more children that Mr. [Lawrence] Rollins and my mother bore; the second generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was you and your brother then when you mother got with Mr. Rollins; there were three more?
Speaker 2: Actually, my brother and I--my oldest brother Norman Williams, and then I had a sister and a brother by another stepfather, and then the youngest boy, I believe his name is Billy, by a third father.  So my mother had five kids by three men--three different men.  So we grew up--the five of us.  And then the fourth man was the man that really became her husband, and brought up us five and the other three that they had--that they bore.
Speaker 1: That makes eight all together?
Speaker 2: Eight, all together, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you know where Mr. Rollins was born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Texas, but I don't remember what--exactly what city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was an all-around construction worker, carpenter, bricklayer, painter.
Speaker 1: So he was a general contractor?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, a very outstanding contractor.  And, of course, my youngest brother followed in his footsteps; the youngest among the three that my mother had when she married him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a--we always ask this, and I guess we could ask about your father and your stepfather.  Is there a story about how your mother met your father, your biological father?
Speaker 2: That I don't know for sure. No, I don't know how they met.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother met your stepfather, Mr. Rollins?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.  I know that my mother went to a lot of clubs to hear jazz--to hear music and so forth, and the photograph that I have on the table there, they;re at some clubs, so that might be, but I don't know for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did Mr. Rollins play any instrument?
Speaker 2: No.  He was not a musician.
Story_ID: 24252
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you think about your parents' looks, their talents, their aptitudes, their habits, temperaments, of your mother [Lee Edna Anderson], your biological father [Floyd Williams], your stepfather [Lawrence Rollins], who do you think you take after most?
Speaker 2: Probably my mother, because, obviously, she raised us continuously.  I have wonderful thoughts of her; she's still living; she's ninety-one--she's ninety years old, she'll be ninety-one October the 31st, a couple of weeks from now.   And I have wonderful admiration for Mr. Rollins, who really is my father, because most men wouldn't marry a woman with more than one child, let alone five children, and then stay with them the balance of their lives, and be a good example of what it means to be a hard worker and to provide for one's family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have very positive and wonderful thoughts about my mother and my father, Mr. Rollins.
Story_ID: 24253
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you name your brothers and sisters for us from beginning to--I mean and tell us where you fit in?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The oldest one Norman Williams, I mentioned him, the saxophone player, then I'm next in line then my sister Karen Woods, and then after her is Johnny Woods and then Billy and then Diane, but the last three are Rollins.  I should have said Billy Franklin.  The last three are Diane Rollins, Sharon Rollins and Craig Rollins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So when you grew up, the household consisted of your mother [Lee Edna Rollins] and the children?
Speaker 2: At least the five of us, not the latter three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because you all had pretty much grown up, and then the latter three?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They--I think Diane was born--I remember changing her diapers probably around 1950 or so, during the days of "I Love Lucy".
Speaker 1: Okay.  By that time, you were about ten or eleven, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was nineteen--yeah, I guess I'm getting confused here.  I graduated from high school in 1957 so I was in my mid twenties, of course, not ten.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  That would have been in the 70s (1970s), right?  I mean the 60s (1960s)?
Speaker 2: What I'm saying is Diane was born, as I recall, around the 1950s.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, something's not right.
Speaker 1: When you were saying 50s (1950s), I think you should be saying 60s (1960s), I think.  Around 1960s, you would have been--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that makes more sense, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you would have been twenty-two then or twenty-one then?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from college in 1962, about a year late, so I was about 22 years old then.
Story_ID: 24254
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I do have some early childhood remembrances.
Speaker 1: Oh.  I'm sorry, did we finish going through all your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, the eight and the--eight children.
Speaker 1: So we talked about all of them, we named all of them?
Speaker 2: We named all of the children.
Speaker 1: I could not remember.
Speaker 2: In chronological order.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yes, the question is, do you have an earliest childhood memory, first something that you really are conscious of?
Speaker 2: It would probably be--I still remember when we were--my oldest brother and I were put in the Niles Home; that was like a foster home, when my mother [Lee Edna Anderson] had some personal difficulties and went to California.  I definitely remember that stay.
Speaker 1: How long were you all there?
Speaker 2: Probably about, at least a year or so, as I recall.
Speaker 1: So you were in someone else's house, or something?
Speaker 2: It's a home for children.  So there were other children there as well.
Speaker 1: So it was an institutional kind of place?
Speaker 2: Yes, an institution.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Okay.  So was that a rough year?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, emotionally, but it wasn't so rough that we were ever scarred from it or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how old were you when you went to this home?
Speaker 2: My guess is probably about three or four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you went, did you know who your mother was, before you went, or did you have a sense?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I think I learned later that she was in California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were too young to even have a sense of who--
Speaker 2: I probably didn't know what California even meant at the time.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 24255
Speaker 1: All right.  So, was there a name for the neighborhood that you lived in, in Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Just, well, not a name, it was called Ninth Street, and we grew up on Ninth Street. I do have recollection of how difficult that was.
Speaker 1: So you grew up on Ninth Street?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it's Ninth Street, but a whole block of different addresses.  We lived in the basement of some very old apartment, and we lived in the basement; that I do remember, and the thing was when the toilet would overflow, it would flow into our kitchen.  We would have to clean waste material out of our kitchen.  We had a kitchen which was a bedroom for us--the five of us.  Like we had a roll-a-way bed, roll-a-way-bed, and then there was a little partition, it was not a bathroom, but a partition with a pot, where we used the bathroom, and then there was one bedroom where my mother [Lee Edna Anderson] and father [Lawrence Rollins] stayed.  Of course, we had rats, and we slept with dogs and cats, cats to keeps rats at bay, but we just loved animals, but roaches too.  But we--we didn't think of roaches as being bad; that is, they would get into cookies and that type of thing, and we would just push them aside and eat the cookies.  We didn't know any better.
Speaker 1: So was that unusual in those days for people to have roaches and stuff?
Speaker 2: No, that was not unusual.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was real ghetto before, I think, the word ghetto came up in World War II [1939-1945] in Poland.  So before they called it ghetto--we had--we lived in the ghetto.
Speaker 1: So this was an all black neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know a lot of cit--so there's no name for that side of Kansas City?  I know in some cities, the West Side, or the East Side or North Side, you know, it has a name?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't particularly called any geographical side.  Ninth and Park was, I guess between Brooklyn and Park, those were the two blocks that was interposed between Ninth and Park and Ninth and Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Now, is this a brick apartment building?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably brick apartment building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandparents never lived with you, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No. No, just my mother and my father.
Story_ID: 24256
Speaker 1: All right.  What were some of the--we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, police cars rushing down--police cars and ambulance cars.  There was an incident where they had some Italians that lived, not lived, but they had a grocery store, I believe, at Ninth and Brooklyn, and it was some kind of gang activity, or maybe not gang, but Mafioso; a great big shooting at that time, ice cream trucks, we were certainly be attracted by a bell, somebody selling ice cream.  In those days they had--we had ice boxes, so the ice man would come down the street with an ice truck, and bring the ice to the ice box; the sound of kids playing and so forth.  And I do remember too, other things tragically.  My brother fell off of one of the porches at that time, and it was one of the saddest times in our lives, but fortunately, he recovered, but we had another young man name Robert Bruno that came home one day trying to get into his apartment, and I guess his mother [Lee Edna Anderson] had locked the door, so he tried to crisscross one of the balconies, or something like that and fell, and of course, he died; one of the earliest deaths that I remembered.
Speaker 1: How high a building did you live in?  You were in the basement, but how high was the building?
Speaker 2: Of course, his bedroom was around the corner.  It might have amounted to about the second floor.  It might not have been that high, but it was concrete that he fell on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you relatively close to downtown Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: No.  Ninth and Park was not so--well, I mean nowadays things are much closer, I mean, with a car, probably about twenty minutes away.
Speaker 1: I was thinking like Ninth Street sounds like it's pretty close to downtown, you know, if they start counting downtown?
Speaker 2: You know, but when we would say downtown, Kansas City, I think we be talking about Oak Street or Magee, if I remember, Walnut Street.  I mean you had to take a bus to get that far down--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Magee Street.
Speaker 1: So we can't judge it by Chicago [Illinois] or some other, you know, where there are streets, you know, where numbers start downtown?
Speaker 2: Right.  I don't know anything about Chicago.  I've been there a couple of times, but not the layout.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So other sites and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Firecrackers, I mean, because they were illegal, but people would go to Independence, Missouri, to get firecrackers; just children playing. Obviously, we had a lot of children.
Story_ID: 24257
Speaker 1: What about music?  I know it's so many musicians in your family and Kansas City so famous for music.  And you know, there's that song about Twelfth Street and Vine, and all that. Was that all mythology?
Speaker 2: Well, no, that's real.  Eighteenth and Vine.  Yes, I mean, I can remember, of course, everybody knows about Charlie Parker, but not too many people know about Leo Parker, who played the baritone saxophone, and they--of course, we were too young, but I have some basic recollection of them playing, I guess, places like the Blue Room or just Eighteen and Vine is just a very important place for jazz, including Jay McShann, a few other people.  And I'm not sure about Harlan Leonard, I think, one of the first people that Charlie Parker played with was Harlan Leonard, I'm not sure that was in Kansas City [Missouri], I'm not sure about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, of course, when I became seventeen years old, that was much later now, I started playing with Lee Brown's band and (unclear) was playing in some of the night clubs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll get to that in a little while.  So when you were growing up, what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well we did play--there was a telephone wire, not a hoop, but a telephone wire, that was just a certain distance from the building, parallel to the building, just wide enough for us to play a lot of basket ball, we did a lot of basket ball playing.  We did a lot of--we lived near a funeral home, so we would do a lot of playing like ghosts and that type of thing, probably what most young kids do, just a lot of foolishness, running around, and so forth.
Story_ID: 24258
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did you start school?  What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school was Benjamin Banneker [Elementary School].  I remember, in fact one of the photos I will show you later is when I was a third grade student, and I remember my teacher's name; her name was Mrs. Carrigan, and I had the pleasure of seeing her probably about ten years ago before she passed away.
Speaker 1: Now, were the schools segregated in Kansas City [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: No.  They weren't segregated until when we had the Supreme Court decision in 1954 [Brown vs. Board of Education]; yes, they were segregated in 1954. So I went to Benjamin Banneker and then R. T. Coles [Junior High School], as a high school student, and then came the Supreme Court decision, and that's when we went to Manual High [and Vocational] School.  When I we, I mean I went there; some of the other students went to other schools because of their location, where their homes were located.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the second school you mentioned?  You mentioned Benjamin Banneker?
Speaker 2: R--
Speaker 1: R?
Speaker 2: --just capital R, capital T, Coles; C-O-L-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  R. T. Coles.  Was that junior high school?
Speaker 2: That was a junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a mathematics aptitude in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Absolutely not.  In fact, I do remember we only had to take one--kind of a disgrace, but we only had to take one mathematics course.  I took that in the ninth grade under a man named Mr. Bass, and that was the only course I ever failed in high school.
Speaker 1: So, this is a ninth grade math course?
Speaker 2: Only one course for high school graduation.
Speaker 1: Was this a general course, general math?
Speaker 2: General math, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't that I wasn't intelligent, I just--the only thing that kept me in high school really was music, playing the trumpet.
Speaker 1: Now, we already know that you know that you are pretty sharp in math, but in those days though, you weren't getting the exposure?
Speaker 2: In fact, I didn't get it in college, I mean, that is to say, I didn't--I started studying mathematics in my junior year in college, which is extremely late.
Speaker 1: Now, I want to get you all the way to college, but I was just wondering, you know, what your initial exposure to math was like?
Speaker 2: Well, that was it.
Speaker 1: So, in grade school, you didn't get--would you say your math instruction was decent in grade school?
Speaker 2: Oh, Yeah, I mean we learned, basically, it was just arithmetic, but that was important.
Speaker 1: So were you successful at arithmetic in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I never failed any course, but I'm saying that the only course I ever failed was in the ninth grade, I guess that's junior high.
Speaker 1: Now, were you a good student in grade school?
Speaker 2: Probably average.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Actually, I liked to draw.  There's kind of a story behind that.
Speaker 1: Are you a decent artist?
Speaker 2: Oh, not--no, no.  At one time I thought I was.  There was a guy name Howard Taylor that was a very good artist, and this is really going back to the third, fourth or fifth grade, so we--I thought I'd try to be an artist like he was. Of course he ended up in prison, and was killed as a young man in prison.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know.  So, were there any teachers--a Mrs. Carrigan.
Speaker 2: My third grade teacher.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So she taught all the subjects, right, in third grade?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Well, she taught the third grade, yes.  And we didn't a spec--you had specialized subjects later on, I guess, in junior high school.  I remember my English teacher that I have a photo of later on who was a very important part of my life.
Story_ID: 24259
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, because, I guess is when we got out of the Niles Home [Kansas City, Missouri], my mother [Lee Edna Anderson] put us in this Sunday School at Second Baptist Church.  And I've been in the Sunday school every since, you know.  I'd say probably sixty-nine years, something like that, and I teach Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you a leader in Sunday school, a youth leader at church?
Speaker 2: No, just a student.  I think that was part of my chance to learn the piano, initially.  I mean to actually read music, not just to hear music and play.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you start playing--when did you first start playing the piano?
Speaker 2: Well, I really started in the eleventh grade, because I started trumpet in the Ninth grade.  I learned music by playing the trumpet, and as I said, my cousin, Marshall Hunt, was the best trumpet player, and I was the second best, but then I switched after I made the Allstate Orchestra, I switched to the piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what drew you to the piano?
Speaker 2: When we moved to, I guess it was 28th and Tracey, there was a piano there, and there was a man named John Patton; he came by and played some blues, and I was just fascinated.  I asked him to teach me the blues changes, and it was amazing. Six months later, I was playing blues in the night clubs.  John Patton was a famous organist, by the way, who played with Lou Donaldson, and when he passed away, maybe about ten or fifteen years ago, they did some radio programs about his life and his music.
Speaker 1: That's P-A-T-T-O-N?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: John Patton.
Speaker 2: And he was a extremely important man in my life too; teach me how to play the piano because that's what got me to college.  I mean, I didn't know it then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He's a well-known organist?
Speaker 2: Organist, yes.
Story_ID: 24260
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were learning how to play the piano in church, and you were playing in clubs, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In church, I learned how to read music, because we had to read the hymns, but jazz more or less came natural, because my brother would listen to Charlie Parker and Bud Powell, Howard McGee all day long, everyday, just about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in those days, even when your generation was starting to listen to rhythm and blues [R&B] and rock and roll, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I never liked it; never let it influence me.  No.
Speaker 1: Somehow I knew that was coming. (laughing)
Speaker 2: And I don't like it today, either.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you avoid that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, to me jazz was very intellectual, and very--much more challenging, and we had to play rock and roll.  We would play--started off, but, you know, as you say, when people got drunk, then we would play jazz later on during the night.  Well, yeah, I played rock and roll, I played blues.
Speaker 1: Those were the days of--the early days of Bo Diddley and Fats Domino.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  1950s.
Speaker 1: I was wondering, do you know Elvis Pressley in the late 50s (1950s)?
Speaker 2: Of course, he's more of a copycat of the black musicians--black blues musicians.
Speaker 1: But you were focused on jazz.  And Charlie Parker, he died?
Speaker 2: 1955.  Around 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you would have been around fifteen, I guess, then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was around fifteen or so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, about fifteen.  Right.  So, did you and your brother like, follow his career, sort of in magazines?
Speaker 2: Still do that today.  I have DVDs; just go back and reminisce about his life.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you--could you hear Charlie Parker on the radio?
Speaker 2: Well, we heard him on these 78 records.  That's what--that was our initial exposure.  And then later after the 78, they had the 33, these are great big records.
Speaker 1: LPs?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And then the 45s, they don't--obviously, they don't make those anymore, but initially, the 78 records.
Story_ID: 24261
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in high school, you were pretty much--thought you would become a musician, is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, because the only thing, that really kept me in high school was music.  And Mr. Davis was a man that insisted that we learn music, not just play, you know, to have fun, but to also play those John Phillip Sousa marches.  You had to read music.  So that was a very nice thing that--a nice discipline that he put us through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any teacher that emerges as sort of a mentor in high school?
Speaker 2: I would say, certainly, a Mr. Leo H. Davis and Mrs. Myler Banks, and I'd like to say Dr. Wheeler, because he was the one that made the arrangements for me to go to college, and we stayed in touch up until the point of his death.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have to work in school when you went to high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I worked at a bowling alley.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do there?
Speaker 2: Picked up pins.  I mean that was a hard job. laughing)
Speaker 1: Those were the days before they had the automatic pin-setting machines?
Speaker 2: I mean, it was trivia the first hour, but give it two or three hours later, running after those pins, I mean, I shouldn't complain, it was one of the few jobs--I didn't do very much work, but that's one of the jobs that I did.
Speaker 1: Did you actually set up the pins?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  We were in the back of the--yeah, we were in the back, and then, of course, it rolled the bowling ball down and knocked the pins down, and then we would have to scramble to get the pins, and then set them up again, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, before they had automatic pins?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, before they had automatic pins, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In that job, did you ever have any--I know how sports can be.  Did you have any negative interactions with the bowlers, I mean, themselves?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't actually see them.  Probably--we were back there three or four hours; and, of course, different sets of bowlers.  Somebody might come and bowl a half a hour or an hour or so.
Speaker 1: I was wondering.  I know how some people in sports blame anybody involved in their failure to do something.
Speaker 2: No.  No problems there.
Speaker 1: So you never had to absorb any of that.  Okay.  Now, when you were in high school, now, were you involved in clubs or activities?
Speaker 2: No, because I was, and still am, mostly a loner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was Manual [High and Vocational School] an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Yes, because it was--the Supreme Court decision [Brown vs. Board of Education] came down in 1954, so we entered--it was basically a white school and Hispanic, I guess.  So we had to register there as black students.
Speaker 1: How many black students graduated with you, do you think, and how big was the graduating class or what percentage of them?
Speaker 2: Probably, that's hard to answer. Most of my buddies, I believe, graduated.  I think the rate was probably better then than it is now, in some situations.
Speaker 1: By what percentage of the school population, I mean of the--well, say the graduating class you came out of, what were the black students?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably, I don't know, 30 percent or so, maybe 30 to 40 percent, maybe.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good size group, you know.  That's a pretty good size group of people.
Speaker 2: I do have that year book there.
Speaker 1: Now, did you take advantage of the music scene in high school?  Did they have like venues for the touring musicians, people like Sam Cooke and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have that, no.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't see any of those musicians when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Come to town?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was too young; I have to be careful when I say that.  I was too young to go out in night clubs, but as I said, when I was 17, my mother [Lee Edna Anderson] let me go into night clubs to play, and with the promise that, you know, I wouldn't drink or smoke, and I did keep that promise.
Speaker 1: So playing music then that provided you a pretty decent side income in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, I mean, I would get five dollars, I mean, that was decent.  I mean, a gig, was maybe five or ten dollars, you know.  And for me, that was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: It was different.  Well, it had a different value then, five or ten dollars, was worth a lot more than it is today.
Speaker 2: And to make $25.00 over a weekend, that was a--to me, that was a very favorable thing, also, just a chance to play it, of course, as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you say you were shy.  So your favorite subject in school was music then, I take it?
Speaker 2: That was my favorite subject, yes.  That was the thing that really kept me in high school, because I might have flunked out otherwise, I don't know.
Story_ID: 24262
Speaker 1: Now, who is Dr. Wheeler?
Speaker 2: He was the guidance counselor.  He was a brick mason when they taught brick masonry at the high school, and he rose up in rank.  He became the superintendant of the schools in Kansas City, Missouri; the first black man to be that--to hold that position.  He became very well known, and very respected in Kansas City [Missouri] with his work in the educational system.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is--he actually integrated the school too, by coming over to Manual [High and Vocational], yes, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, they brought some black teachers over there, and I noticed you called him Dr. Wheeler, he had a PhD?
Speaker 2: Yes, he got his PhD from my alma mater, Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri] as did my English Professor--my English teacher. Excuse me, she didn't get a PhD, though, and she got her bachelor's degree, Myler Banks, the name I mentioned a few minutes ago.
Story_ID: 24263
Speaker 1: So Dr. Wheeler helped you get into college, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I must say that it was, I guess, the last day of high school, he came up to me and asked me did I want to go to college--would I like to go to college, and I more or less said no, because I thought--I mean I was so naive, I thought after thirteen years of school, I didn't need to go college, but I also thought that college was for rich people or Caucasian students, so it was not anything on my radar scope, and I think he had to convince me to take a music scholarship to go to Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri].  And I'm glad that he did convince me.  I mean, I certainly would not have gone to college had it not been for his prompting.
Speaker 1: So he had to convince you to take a scholarship?  He had a scholarship for you, and you still, well.
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't so much the scholarship, it was just about college.  I mean the word college, you know, growing up, I mean, we just--we didn't have any peers--I didn't know anyone in my family who went to college.  None of my friends ever went to college.  We had no examples of people going to college.
Story_ID: 24264
Speaker 1: Okay.  Had you ever been out of Kansas City [Missouri] much, or you know--
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  No more than--no, not really; no more than going to Kansas.
Speaker 1: --just going out in the suburbs of Kansas City?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, my grandfather--well, I had two grandfathers; one that--in Kansas City, Kansas; my mother's [Lee Edna Anderson] father, and then my mother's mother's husband, (unclear), the one that was the garbage man; yes, so, those were the trips to Kansas that we made.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I get the Kansases mixed up.  You were talking about just going across the river from--
Speaker 2: Kansas City, yes.
Speaker 1: --Kansas City, Missouri, to Kansas City, Kansas?
Speaker 2: Kansas City, Kansas, or Rosedale, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, Lincoln University--so he got you a scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yes, to study music.
Speaker 1: Any other reflections about high school before we take it--
Speaker 2: I thought about a man name--might have been the only doctor in the classroom, a man named Dr. Williams that taught science class.  And I remembered being so utterly impressed with him, because--of course, he was a doctor, and we didn't--never had a doctor teach us before.  Not only would he be so erudite in his knowledge of science, but he would talk about current events; talk about China, that type of thing, and we never read the newspaper; we never kept up with the news.  I try to get my goddaughter to do that now.  So he's a very, very impressive man, to me.
Speaker 1: Now, did you keep up with the Civil Rights Movement [1955-1968] when you were in school?
Speaker 2: No, I did not. I, obviously, knew about Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.], and we did understand about integration, but we didn't keep up with the details of it.
Story_ID: 24265
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri], this is 1950--
Speaker 2: 1957.
Speaker 1: '57 (1957), okay.  1957.  This is around the time that Sputnik [the first artificial Earth satellite] went up, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it went up in either '57 (1957) or '58 (1958).  I remember because I was invited to give my 50th anniversary, excuse me, yeah 50th anniversary graduated from high school.  I was invited to be the speaker, so I was trying to recall some of the events; I made some notes on that, that's the reason I remember that.
Speaker 1: You know, this is, this is--
Speaker 2: I meant to say 50th reunion, high school reunion; I was the key note speaker for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So '57 [1957], Sputnik caused a lot of politicians and pundits to say that we needed to increase math and science education in the schools.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, I remember Krushchev was the premier of Russia at that time; he had promised to bury us.
Speaker 1: And his shoe on the UN desk.  Now, I don't even  know if that was manipulated or not, but I know he said something, and then they said that he said he was going to bury us; it was a commercial, a TV commercial they used to show.
Speaker 2: Nikita Krushchev.
Speaker 1: So, people were afraid he was going to actually bury us.  And so, here you are at Lincoln University during this time period, and you're in the band, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right at the end--well, similar, we met a lot of people that had been part of the Korean War [1950-1953], and they were veterans, GI Bill attendees, at Lincoln University.  So that was the last war after my high school years.  So they didn't call it a war, they called it a police action in Korea.
Speaker 1: The Korean conflict.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Some of the war vets were in school with you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On the GI Bill?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were any of them musicians?
Speaker 2: Not--I don't remember, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, who is your music professor at Lincoln?
Speaker 2: I'm just about to draw a blank. Dr. Fuller, a very distinguished scholar.  He was in charge of the music program.  Mr. Penn was the band leader.  But, I switched from the trumpet to the French horn and to the flute, and I think the last instrument I played was the flute in his band, but then I got rid of the trumpet and the French horn and the flute, and put my concentration on the piano.  So my teacher was--I had Mr. Kembrow as my piano teacher and Miss McSwane.
Story_ID: 24266
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at some point, I guess, in this story, mathematics comes back up.  How did mathematics reenter your life?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's interesting, because as I always say, I had been so naive even going back to when I went to play the trumpet, because I saw my brother's saxophone with all kind of notes on it, and I saw the trumpet with three notes, so I thought it would be easy to learn to play the trumpet.  Not noticing it was three vowels, but I was so naive, I didn't know the difference.  But anyway, I got interested, for some reason, in [Albert] Einstein's theory of relativity [special relativity] and I thought, if I could master mathematics, I could master Einstein's relativity theory.  So that was one of the things that really prompted me.
Speaker 1: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but in those days, the epitome of genius was Albert Einstein?
Speaker 2: And even nowadays, yes.  I mean, the theory of relativity is the pillar after [Sir Isaac] Newton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and that was something that, you know, everybody, you know, could quote, even though they didn't know what it meant, E equal MC square [E=MC^2, where E is energy, M is mass and C is the speed of light], right?
Speaker 2: That's the special theory, but the--I have much more interest in the general theory, which is not--which is much harder and which people wouldn't understand.
Speaker 1: How were you introduced to the theory of relativity?
Speaker 2: I came across a book by Lincoln Barnett, a man name Lincoln Barnett.  I have it over here someplace.  It's called, "Dr. Einstein and the Universe".  It's somewhat amazing because I don't read, I'm not much of a reader.  Somehow that book inspired me.  I'm just saying if you could learn just a little bit of algebra, you could understand this point.  He just carries you on and on; you could understand a little bit of trigonometry, you could understand this point, and if you could understand--learn a little bit of geometry, you could understand this point; just led us on and on.  And it was kind of a thin book to read, so one of the few books that I've read.  I don't read many books.  That book really inspired me to learn about Einstein's relativity theory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then because I'd heard all these magic stories about a poem that--there was a lady name Miss Bright who could travel faster than the speed of light.  She went away one day in her (unclear) way, and came back the proceeding night.  So things like that spurred my imagination.
Speaker 1: I've never heard that before.
Speaker 2: I understand now how she came back; how she went one day and came back the proceeding night, I understand it now, on the basis of special relativity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you take a physics course, or anything?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As I said, I got a very late start.  My freshman and sophomore years, I studied music.  I mean, I continued to study music.  So, in my junior year, I started with algebra and trigonometry.  I just doubled up everything, and physics, as well.  I just became crazy.  I started studying--
Speaker 1: You didn't take algebra until you were a junior in college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's what I'm saying, I got such a late start; I should have had--I mean nowadays, you have calculus in high school.  But that was a--quite a different time.  So my first course was algebra and trigonometry at the same time.  Then the next semester, I took analytic geometry and--I mean introduction to calculus, and I took two more calculus courses.  There's a three calculus course sequence.
Speaker 1: This all as a senior?
Speaker 2: As a junior and a senior.  But you see, I went--I believe I went an extra year and a half; it was five and a half years to graduate from college because of the very late start.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you doing well in these courses?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I mean, I was a changed person.  I meant, the first time in my--well, I was very good in music, of course, but it was the first time that I had another subject that fascinated me the way that jazz music did, and I knew I had to double up, because I was going to be a master of Einstein.  Again, that was naivete, but it prompted me, you know.
Story_ID: 24267
Speaker 1: This is really fascinating that you would, you know, at this late stage, get so involved in math, and these are really intense courses.  Who were some of your mentors?
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. Talbert was the main person, because I went to him as a--getting ready to become a junior in college and asked him would it make sense--would it be possible that I could get a major in mathematics and get all these subjects in?  And he was saying to me that if I really wanted to do it, he would help me to do it.  So I had a lot of my courses with Dr. Talbert.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's my main mentor--
Speaker 1: Anybody else?
Speaker 2: --at Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Anybody else at Lincoln?
Speaker 2: I was trying to think, the young lady that--I can't think of her name; I'll get back to her name, but we'd tease her because she would write on the board with one hand and then be erasing with the other hand.  She taught us trigonometry, if I recall.  But most of my courses were with Dr. Talbert.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  By the time you were--you were there until--
Speaker 2: '60--(1960)--
Speaker 1: --'62 (1962)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I graduated in--yeah, 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was five and a half years, as I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in 1962.  And what were your prospects, did you--how were your grades?
Speaker 2: Outstanding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In mathematics and physics.
Speaker 1: So, did you intend to go to graduate school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had to keep on going if I was going to understand [Albert] Einstein's theory [of relativity].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you didn't think, "Oh, I'll just teach high school" or something now?
Speaker 2: No, I had to go to get a PhD.  In fact, my mother was against it because one of the disagreements that we had that--I think, after I got my master's, she didn't want me to go back--she didn't think it was necessary that I go back to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did Dr. Talbert help you arrange graduate school?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, in a sense that obviously, he was the main person to write letters of recommendation getting into graduate school.  As you know, letters of recommendations are quite important.
Story_ID: 24268
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went to Washington University in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Washington University in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: That's primarily known as a writer's school.
Speaker 2: Journalism but also medicine, the Nobel Prize winners in medicine in journalism, well not in journalism, you don't win the price there, but a very good school for medicine and journalism.  I'm going to say mathematics as well, and physics because, Nobel Prize winners in physics as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Arthur Compton, as a matter of fact, who is a man that also--I mean his life inspired me because he's--his Christian writing and being a great scientist, as well.
Speaker 1: And he was located at Washington University?
Speaker 2: He was the chancellor at Washington--
Speaker 1: Chancellor?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He won the Nobel Prize for the Compton--so called Compton Effect.
Speaker 1: So had you thought about which graduate school you were going to apply to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I was naive.  I thought I wanted to go to the University of Chicago [Illinois], and it's good that I didn't.  I would have flunked out of there very easily.  I was flat--I was turned off flatly about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so Washington University, this is in the fall of 1962?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Fall of 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I suppose you were sort of isolated there.  There probably weren't many black students.
Speaker 2: I believe I was the first black student there in mathematics.  I know there was a second one that followed me name Henry Williams.  I think I was the first black student there in the Department of Mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you the only one in the Department?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was the only one there all the time I was there.  That didn't matter.  It's just wonderful support from the professors there; it was just very wonderful.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those professors?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I could name Allen Debonet, Professor Guido Wise, one of the most important ones was Allen Nussbaum, he was probably my most important mentor there; William Boothby, Earl Lazzerson, Robert--I might have said Robert McDowell already, James Jenkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a person that you--that helped you the most?
Speaker 2: I would say, in the early stages, was Professor Allen Nussbaum.  And then later, I left Washington University to do my research under the direction of Professor Ray Kunze at the University of California, so he was obviously a big person in my life at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were at Washington University for three years?
Speaker 2: Actually, I think it was two years for the master's, and then I left and went back to teach at Lincoln [University], and then I went back to work on the PhD, so it was a long process.  About--I think it was a ten year--it was a ten-year process, all together.  It took a long time to get the PhD.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 1962 to 1972.
Story_ID: 24269
Speaker 1: Right.  You earned your PhD in 1972?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I wasn't really the best student at that time, because graduate studies, that was a different world.  So I could not say I was one of the best students there.  In fact, I did flunk the master's exam.  And then came back.  I got married and regrouped and went back and passed the master's.  I never would have gotten the PhD without the master's, of course.
Speaker 1: What was your--were you ever attempted to give up, or say "Oh, I can't do this"?
Speaker 2: Well, it was hard because the--you know it's one thing to take the course work, and I thought I knew the material.  The exams were harder.  I guess it's like going from high school to college; it's a different level.  In undergraduate school, I was good at working problems, but when you go to graduate school, you don't work them, you have proof theorems; you have to prove something; go through the actual reasoning and the proofs, and that was another level of intellectual ability that I had never been able--yeah, had never had to cope with, a different type of learning.
Story_ID: 24270
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell us about your dissertation.  What was it about?
Speaker 2: If I can remember the title was, "The Reduction of Tensor--The Reduction of Tensor Production Through a Complex--The Reduction of Tensor Products with Principal Series Representation of Complex Semisimple Lay Groups".  I think that was the title.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what does that--can you explain it in simple terms for those of us who are challenged by higher math?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  It's extremely technical, like any other PhD thesis.  The so-called principal series representations and you can form a so-called tensor product of those as more complicated object.  And then you like to reduce that structure and that's the (unclear), a whole lot easier, just a few lines, so that you give a pretty nice answer in that--in that generality.  I did it for a class of objects that are called a complex in the simple Lee groups.  Generally, I mean before then, it has been done for particular cases, but I worked on for general theory.
Story_ID: 24271
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so, 19--
Speaker 2: '72 (1972).
Speaker 1: It was 1972 and--now, you must have been pretty good, because you were hired to lecture at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], right?
Speaker 2: I was very fortunate, after I had left--after I got a PhD, I applied for various schools, and I actually didn't apply to MIT, but I got an offer for them, and I just jumped at it; it couldn't have been anything better for me.  It was of the great fortunate events of my life to get that honor to be able to teach there.  Just to be there, even if I weren't teaching.  I did teach, but to be around such great mathematical minds.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the--who would have been like one of the mathematical luminaries that you were looking up to?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the man that mentored me there, he's Professor Bertram Kostant, world class mathematician, by all standards, and they just put a volume out about his collected papers and the like.  And I've traveled to Canada to, I think it's his 70th birthday celebration and so forth, in his honor, for him to give me a copy of--personal copy of conferences that have been dedicated to his honor.  Yeah, Bertram Kostant, K-O-S-T-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: K-O-S--
Speaker 2: K-O-S-T-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: --T-A-N-T.  Okay.  Kostant.  Is this your first time outside of the Midwest?
Speaker 2: Well, I did go to California.  I went  to--I followed my thesis advisor to California to do my PhD work at the University of California at Irvine.  And then--that was a new experience, being out of Missouri, and then going to Massachusetts, to MIT.  That was a new experience as far as living in different states.
Story_ID: 24272
Speaker 1: So you were in St. Louis [Missouri] during the Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.] assassination?
Speaker 2: Yes, we can remember the day that it happened and also [President] John Kennedy's assignation.
Speaker 1: You were still in Kansas City [Missouri] when that happened, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: No.  I was in St. Louis, at Morris University when doctor--I mean when President Kennedy was assassinated.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Any reflections about those events that you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember that all of us, when I say us, I mean us students gathering around the radio at the Mathematics building, just horrified and listening to the radio, trying to get as much information as we could.  We didn't have a television; that was the place where we studied.  It was a lot of sadness, it really was.
Story_ID: 24273
Speaker 1: Okay.  So MIT, in 1972, you're in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Cambridge, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, right across the river from Boston.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was during the time of bussing of people and stuff?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  South Boston, I mean I met some of that when I came to UMass [University of Massachusetts].  South Boston was erupting and very invicted--very in--what's the right word--hatred for blacks and so forth.
Speaker 1: All right.  So MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] now--well, how were things at MIT?
Speaker 2: It's a closed university, matter of fact, so of me that science and study drove everything.  And as I said, all of the professors there were very friendly.  And Professsor Kostant kind of took me under his wing.
Speaker 1: Were you married by this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was married and at MIT.
Speaker 1: So, did you meet your wife at--
Speaker 2: No, actually I met my wife when I was at Lincoln University, I think as--I don't want to say professor, but as a teacher.  Yes.  Yes, I met her as a teacher at Lincoln University.
Speaker 1: So, you were later married when you moved to MIT?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were married in 1966, and divorced, I guess, right after I left MIT.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had like one son?
Speaker 2: One son named Emel Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said that Dr. Kostant was very important to your development as a Mathematician, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, because my--because I wrote my thesis with Prof. Ray Kunze, but when I got to MIT, I entered a completely different--I went into a different direction all together, that's what all this cohomology theory is about.  I read a very famous paper of Professor Kostant, and that was my initial introduction into, so called cohomology theory.
Story_ID: 24274
Speaker 1: Tell us what that's about, cohomology theory?
Speaker 2: Again, everything is technical.  I think in a way, one can develop local results a little bit harder, but then you like to extend it to global results, but there are obstructions to doing that, and these obstructions could be measured cohomologically.  So certain cohomologic classes, as we call them, they measure, to some extent, the possibility or even the impossibility of extending local results to global results.
Speaker 1: What does cohomology mean?
Speaker 2: Well, it's something that's called homology, H-O-M-O-L-O-G-Y, that's one theory, and then there's a dual theory, D-U-A-L, called cohomology, and their both essentially equivalent; it's a matter of taste.  It's like a dictionary, that is to say, if you understand homological results, you can dualize them and get an equivalent language, cohomological results.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In of your first research papers that was published in '78 (1978) was Cohomology of the--Cohomology of Semisimple Lie Algebras With Coefficients in--
Speaker 2: In A Verma Module.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That might have been the first--of course, my thesis became a book, but I don't remember the order, but that was certain one of the first papers I wrote, and it was based--it was inspired by my reading Professor Kostant's papers.  It contains--Verma is the man's name; he's an Indian.  Matter of fact, I met him when I was in India.  So that explains what Verma means, that's a person's name; just like Lie is a Norwegian name; a man's name.
Speaker 1: And what's Lie's full name?
Speaker 2: Sophus, S-O-P-H-U--I believe it's S-O-P-H-U-S, Sophus Lie.
Story_ID: 24275
Speaker 1: You were saying over the break that you've published over 90 papers, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've published at least 90 papers; that's certainly CV that I sent, except the CV that include four or five later papers. But I also written about 100 reviews, because the American Mathematical Society or even the Physics Society has asked us to take a paper, referee it sometimes or to review it so, even though I don't list that on my CV, if I did, I would have--I think I would have about 200--200 publications.
Speaker 1: Okay.  1975 you joined the University of Massachusetts [Amherst]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that take place?  Did you apply there, or did they come looking for you?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  I think I applied--actually, I applied at a couple of places; University of Iowa, but since I was in Massachusetts, and since I had moved from California all the way to Massachusetts, I thought it would be easier if I just took a job here in Massachusetts, and also the Chairman of the Department at that time, his name is Robert Blatner, he worked in the field that I worked in, so it was nice to come here to work with him.  Actually, I didn't work with him, because after I got here, he went back to California, more or less retired.  At least-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Also, I must say too that I was attracted by coming here by seeing Max Roach on TV, and I made it one of my--first things I did, I went to his office and played the piano for him.
Story_ID: 24276
Speaker 1: So, Max Roach was here on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes, at that time, Max Roach and Archie Shepp.  Of course, I know Archie pretty well.
Speaker 1: So Max Roach and Archie--I have to ask it again, Max Roach and Archie Shepp were here on the campus and you--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: On the faculty, yeah, on the faculty, yeah.  I mean they didn't stay, but they helped to promote jazz here, and in the summer, "Jazz in July" program, they helped to set that up with Billy Taylor and other people.
Speaker 1: So did you get a chance to play jazz with any of these greats?
Speaker 2: Let me put it this way, I did the play the piano for Max Willis, and then I played with his students, but it was not a gig though, it was just very--very much informal.  And then one day, I met Archie Shepp, and I played the piano while he was playing the flute.  We were at one of the buildings down there.  But I didn't play with them; I did play with, I believe, his name is Charle-- Charles Magee, who played the trombone.  So the picture that you saw with the young lady with the flower, the Billy Holiday, that program, so the trombone player was one of the regulars with Archie Shepp.  So I had a chance to play with the trombone player of Archie Shepp's, professionally, but not with Archie Shepp, professionally; only just on an associate basis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, throughout your career, as a mathematician, have you maintained your musical--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, because my main--I don't do it so much now, but I was playing with John Root's orchestra, a man named John Root. We played here in Amherst and some of the local places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I also played with a lady named Clara Renus.  She might not be known, but heard her--heard she's been recording, and I heard one of her recordings, I believe last month, "Just Please Look Back" to think about the times when she would come to my house, and we would play together.
Story_ID: 24277
Speaker 1: So you and Hans Fletcher, I mean Fischer--
Speaker 2: Hans Fischer.
Speaker 1: --Fischer, yeah, published a paper together in '79 (1979) called "Complex-Foliated Structures. Cohomology of Dolbeault-Constant Complexes", is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dolbeault Kostant.  That name--of course, Dolbeault is a name, also a French mathematician and Kostant is the mentor that I mentioned.  His whole name is Bert Kostant--Bertram.  Professor Hans Fischer, he's a Swiss mathematicians; one of the first persons that I worked with, jointly, when I came to the University of Massachusetts [Amherst].  We also traveled together to Germany to give lectures and so forth.
Speaker 1: What was your first trip outside of the country?
Speaker 2: Liege, Belguim.
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: I would say '76 (1976), because every year for thirty years, I made--I was invited to give a lecture overseas.  Well, I mean, two or three invitations, but I did that thirty years straight, year after year, so the first one would have been, I would say 1976.  It would be on my CV, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was Liege, Belgium?
Speaker 2: Liege, Belgium, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now in 1983, you received a grant from the National Science Foundation.  Some major research instrumentation grant to continue your research on Lie Theory, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's everybody.  Everybody gets grants; anybody that doing what they should be doing.  I think somebody put--I wouldn't have even--I would not have even put that down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Interesting, there's a note here; it's a quote from you.  Yeah, it says that getting the award boosted my confidence and ushered me into the mainstream of mathematics.
Speaker 2: Well, it just meant that I was doing what you're supposed to be doing.  I didn't want to be sounding like a lot of people got a PhD and then they just get stuck working in the--they don't go very far from the center of their research, and you've got to learn what other people are doing, and I was able to do that certainly with Professor Kostant's help.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I don't want to skip over anything, but, let's see, in 1988, you were a visiting professor at Sooney (sp) Stony Brook, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  That was a nice honor.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did I skip over anything important from "93 (1993) to '98 (1998)?
Speaker 2: Every year--of course, every year I was lecturing in some country, and I think one year I was   both--I was holding a position in the Physics and the Mathematics Department in Brazil and then the trips to Russia and twenty other countries, I guess.
Story_ID: 24278
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you explain the Lie Theory for us?
Speaker 2: It's a little bit difficult.  I think one of the basic ideas is symmetry.  A lot of--or maybe most mathematical problems can be very difficult, but if you can see some symmetry, you can exploit to simplify things quite a bit.  And it was done by a young Frenchman named Guilwy in a certain field, and then Lie wanted to do the same thing; do something that was analogous in the field of difference of equations.  That's where the substance started; to exploit symmetry of the situation and then make the problem much easier that way.  So that was his great idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's called Lie Theory because of his name, Sophus Lie.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he simplified--
Speaker 2: Taking advantage of symmetry.  For example, the hazards that atom has a certain symmetry under the action of a so-called group, and that means that if you--that means that you can get solutions of the so-called cylinder equation, and let the group act and that gives you new solutions, so that's a very powerful technique to exploit symmetry of any situation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's so much symmetry in nature, that's the reason that one has a lot of success.
Story_ID: 24279
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I got a note down here that you, in 1990, you were a visiting professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan.  But this is like--you're saying you travelled all--every year, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I did four trips to Japan; that might have been one of my first trips to Japan.  Actually, I spoke at, I think about seven universities.  I made the tour of Japan at the various universities going from   Tokyo [Japan]--Tokyo as far west as you could go to Hiroshima.  So, Sophia University, Hiroshima, Tokyo University; several of the--it's all in the vitae.
Speaker 1: Any of these travelling experiences--which one was your favorite one of all the travelling experiences?
Speaker 2: Probably, India and Russia, maybe, because the universe is such a different universe that they live in.  But I liked Japan because the students are just so bright, I mean, they don't even come here.  In the mathematics department, you know, I was here thirty years, I think, before we had our first Japanese student, because their universities are better than ours to some extent, unless you're talking about Harvard [University] or Princeton [University].  So they have such outstanding young students there, it's amazing.
Speaker 1: As you traveled around you know--I know there's a lot of discussion today when people discuss stem education in the United States as to whether STEM education in the United States is comparable to the other, I guess, modern nations of the world.  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I can speak from a very limited perspective.  I did have a chance to speak to the students involved in the STEM program at--in Springfield, and I saw a very, very great program there with the sixth and seventh graders going into science and really trying to drive it home.  So that's my somewhat limited experience there.  But I would say, too, that for example in Japan, it's so much pressure on students to go to college, I mean, not to finish college, but to get to college.  And it's so much pressure that a lot of them commit suicide.  So it's a very sad situation, so I would think that it's good to have principal that there should be a balance there.  And many times when their Japanese student get to college, where the war is won, a lot of them will certainly relax, and then they may not be as good since they don't have all that pressure on them from their parents.  What we do need as a nation to really--we're lacking in our science, we're at the bottom of the barrel, to some extent, because the role models are more, you know, like athletes, politicians, and especially our minority students, they don't see a geneticist as a role model.  For example and astronomer, you know.  They see Michael Jordan before they see anybody that's a biologist.
Story_ID: 24280
Speaker 1: Okay.  2001 when you went to Russia, you went to Brazil, well '97 (1997) in Russia, 2001, I guess due to theoretical physics in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Is your work basically the--are you still working on the same--
Speaker 2: No. About fifteen years ago, my interests switched again.  I think I earned international rep--excuse me. (sneezed) I earned an international reputation in Lie theory, but then I switched into mathematical physics, so I think I can say I've earned a international reputation in both areas; so most of my work now is being in mathematical physics.  And the reason I went to Brazil I was--I made three trips to Russia, but after the fall of communism [1982-1991], it became very, very rough, maybe even before the fall of communism, the professors, they were treated just like a ordinary cab driver, anybody else that had no special status.  So many of the scientist left for places like Brazil, and I was working with Professor Andrea Bytsenko, a leading Soviet physicist.  He went to Brazil, and then that's when I started going to Brazil, to work with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At one point, in 2004, you were working on--you published research on Solito's Non-Linear Sigma Models and Two-Dimensional Gravity.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Solitons.
Speaker 1: Yes. Solitons.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So all that work, I said fifteen years or so, all of that work then later worked last ten or fifteen years has been in mathematical physics.  So that was one paper out of said 90 that I written or published.  That was called Solitons Non-Linear Sigma Models and Two-Dimensional Gravity. There seemed to be three different subjects that are unrelated, but I was able to relate all three of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At some juncture you got involved in genetic theory?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: What's the title of it?
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  This is my eyes playing tricks; it's geometric theory.  The title of this one is "Localization of Equilvariant Cohomology from Compact and Non-Compact Group Actions".
Speaker 2: Yeah that was "Localization of Equivariant Cohomology Theories".  That was a paper that I wrote first with Andre Bytsenko, the Russian scientist, and we did a second paper with a new graduate student that we had from Harvard, not student, but a Professor that we hired; we did two papers on that subject.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems that--you were named professor emeritus in 2005?
Speaker 2: End of 2004, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you retire at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, I retired from teaching.
Speaker 1: From teaching.
Speaker 2: But not from research.  In fact, I took on--in fact, I already had a PhD student, when I told her I was retiring, she asked me would I continue to work with her, and I said, yes, of course.  And then I took on another PhD student after I retired.  And now I have a PhD student in physics, not--those were my--I was the principal investigators for those students, but I'm on two committees with other students now.  So the research is full time since I've been retired.  It enabled me to get away from the teaching, and then to really focus on the research, and on my ministry.
Story_ID: 24281
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you a pastor of a church?
Speaker 2: I'm a pastor, no, not of a church; associate pastor of a church, but sort of a pastor admittedly, local nursing homes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Goodwin Memorial Church; it's a Methodist church, but I'm a non--I'm non-denominational person.  The name of the church is Goodwin, G-O-O-D-W-I-N, Memorial.  Also, Goodwin is a man's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, during your career, did you do more research than teaching?
Speaker 2: No, I did both.  Yes.
Speaker 1: But did one predominate, you think?
Speaker 2: No, because, actually to get tenure, there are three criteria; teaching you had to be--you can't be slacked in your teaching, you had to be a good researcher and in the third it's service to the university, and that's for everybody.  So I worked very hard as a teacher, well beyond the call of duty; I was glad to do that.  But then I reached a point where I wanted to focus on my ministry, and also just be a researcher.  I got tired of the students coming in arguing about partial credit and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Do you have a teaching philosophy?
Speaker 2: I think I do. "To be sure that I see my students as individuals--as stud--as persons", and that's, in part, for many reasons, because a lot of times when they'd come to the office; I had a lady that came to the office, I thought she was coming for mathematics problems, which she was, but she told me about her father that was driving down the highway and, let's see, he went through the windshield, and the car kept on going, something like that, it was just horrible; he survived though.  But students come to the office a lot of times and they are--students whose parents are quite well off and maybe jet setting someplace in Europe, and then they find somebody that will listen to them.  So they really are human beings first and students secondly.  And another aspect of it is when a student will come in and--some of my best students will come in with a lot of fear and trepidation, but they turn out to be the best students, because they gotta really dedicate themselves because they know that the teacher will help them along the road.  So I get very personal with some of the students.  And believe it or not, I even had a student asked me to pray when they found out--they would say, "Are you really a minister.  How can you be a minister and a scientist?"  I say, "Yes, I'm a minister."  And now and then a student will ask me to even pray for him.  So they really are people with a lot of baggage, lot of young people who are dealing so much that goes on in the world, and then try to learn the material, as well.
Story_ID: 24282
Speaker 1: Now, were you a member, or were you active in the National Association of Mathematicians?
Speaker 2: Yes, I won--yes, my latest award is to be--create a fellows program, The American Mathematical Society.  So for the first time, they will induct a group of fellows; that's never been done before, so I received that award.  I also received award from The National Association of Mathematician, and then I'm also a member of the MAA, Mathematical Association of America.  So I've had a chance to be invited to give a major address at all three of these mathematical associations.
Speaker 1: Okay. Have you been involved, I know you probably have been, but what has your involvement been in terms of recruiting more minority students?
Speaker 2: Well, I could have said that when I was talking about the stamps program, of course that didn't involve recruiting, but I was with--same with--I guess you did interview with--excuse me, you interviewed Don St. Mary, he and I and Nate Whiteker and the others, I know I served ten years with the New England Board of Higher Education mentoring students, meeting with high school students and recruiting, we asked that they do some recruiting, bring some to the University of Massachusetts [Amherst].  But also just letting them see that there are people of color that do hard--hard science as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you ever attempting to get involved in administration?
Speaker 2: No.  That's my--that's the reason I admire Don so much, he's been there thirty years, thirty-five years; such a wonderful--the best administrator department head that I've ever seen.  And I must say that my thesis  advisor, Ray Kunze, whom I mentioned, all of his students have been department chairs and deans for that matter, but not myself; I have no administrative ability.
Speaker 1: Well I mean--I think when Dr. St. Mary said that he admires your freedom to do research, you know, too on some level.  So were you basically kind of guarding that kind of freedom?
Speaker 2: Well, I just saw people that were very good at it, and people that wanted to do it, you know.  It was a long time I should have known better before I had volunteered to be on just various committees like hiring committees.  I was more or less told that, you know, you've been here all these years, you haven't been on a committee, you better get on one.  So I did, my last couple of years there.  But there are a lot of people that are very good at the administration. All of my--all of Ray Kunze's students except myself.
Speaker 1: But you'd rather be in the research?
Speaker 2: Well, doing something that I know I can do.  I'm not very much good--I don't know how to be an administrator, I could learn, but I don't have the interest in it?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you still consider yourself shy after all these years and sort of like to yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm not--I'm sort of a loner person and a lot of shyness, yes, I do, think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, after retirement, you continued to do research, and when you look back on your research, now, and we have the names of some papers here, but when you look back on your research, what would you consider to be the most important research that you've been able to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in Lie theory, one of the most famous mathematicians that are alive today, you know, I mentioned Professor Kostant, but there's another name,  Robert Langlands, and he has all these theories and con--we call them conjectures; things that he thinks should be true, because he has such incredible insight, and of all of these major problems that he's posed over so many years, I was able to solve one of them.  I don't think I got enough credit for it, but I did solve one of his conjectures.  I think that's my greatest--one of my greatest contributions to Lie Theory.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of briefly tell us, I don't know if it's possible, to briefly tell us what you actually did?
Speaker 2: It does relate to so-called cohomology theory.  The certain multiplicities, spectro theory multiplicities, and he wanted to give a cohomological interpretation of these so-called multiplicities.  He said he thought with--geometrically what they should be, and then I was able to prove that.  And I must say that my proof of his conjecture did rely on work of another mathematician named Wilford Smith.  So Wilford Smith did a lot of heavy lifting, and I was able to take some of Smith's work and put it together to give a complete proof of one of Langlands' conjectures.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's Lie theory.  I think in the field of mathematical physics, I'm very proud that I was able to introduce the so-called Zeta Function into black hole physics.  It really gives a perspective that had never been there.  I mean physicists have a lot of complicated expressions.  They just result by this hardcore computation.  But then to be--to see the meaning of those expressions, to see them in a coherent way, that's one of the things I did some years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on everything you've done at this point, is there a major thing that you wish you could do over again or change?
Speaker 2: You mean in mathematics?
Speaker 1: In your professional life?
Speaker 2: One thing I've always regretted, I mean, it may not mean that much here, but I did write a paper once and omitted the name, I guess it was two mathematicians.  When my paper was published, I relied on some of their work and in the list of references, I didn't put their paper down.  I've always regretted that.  It was just something you never do, you never do.  If I could live that, I would certainly be sure that their name would be the first name that I put down on that list.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I also regret I was giving a lecture in Germany once, and the same person, Wilford Smith that I had mentioned, he's always been a very powerful mathematician that I found intimidating sometimes, even though he was very friendly, he asked me a question from the audience and I almost froze a bit and I ended up saying I didn't know the answer to the question.  But if I had thought just a minute or so, I would--I did know the answer.  I just kind of froze when he asked me that question out of the blue, and I could kick myself from freezing up like that in not being able to give the answer.

Speaker 1: What drew you to the ministry?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, when I was probably four or five years old, when we got out of the Niles Home, one of my earliest remembrances, is my mother [Lee Edna Anderson] taking us, probably about a block and a half to Second Baptist Church, so I grew up in Sunday school, became a Christian, I guess, when I was around twelve years old.  And one of the few persons, I'd never really strayed from it, you know, most young people grow up in the church, and then they got to college, and they maybe in high school get away from it, get away from the bible and the teachings, they do their own thing, which I understand, but I'm one of the few that have--I always stayed on the straight and narrow, and then being in the church all my life, probably around 1985 or so, I remember a lady coming up--I played the piano, so the piano is up by the pulpit, the lady came up, walked right passed the minister and came up to me and said, "Could you come to my house and do some counseling with me and my husband, we're about to break up."  So, I said, "Yes, I'll do that."  But then later, I thought, "Why didn't she ask the Pastor."  Then I had a lady that called me up about 1:30 in the morning, she said, "Floyd, I want to say goodbye to you," and I more or less said, "Well, have a nice trip," you know.  But--because I was dragging, I didn't know what was going on.  Then it hit me that she was about to commit suicide, but she had already taken her pills.  So I rushed out the door, went--rushed down to Village Park, and the police stopped me and told them what was going on, and then they called the fire department; they rushed her to the hospital; I saved her life, essentially, what it was.  So I had a lot of people coming to me, asking me questions about counseling and confiding things in--with me.  I was already doing the work of a minister, and I just didn't have the license.  That was one of the things that led me to be a minister.  And I was so influenced by my pastor, L. A. Magee, in Kansas City, Missouri, even though I didn't see him that often, he was a very powerful influence in my life, and we would go with him to visit the sick and pray for the sick, and that type of thing.  So eventually I felt a call into the ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Working outside the church, not so much inside the church, but outside the church.
Story_ID: 24284
Speaker 1: Here is a question we always ask.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American Community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm concerned that so many of our--not necessarily African Americans, but in particular, African Americans, are on food stamps or on welfare, including my goddaughter, that just graduated from college, got pregnant, and we had been anticipating her getting a job and, and her major was communications, and for twenty years, I've been, you know, supporting her mother, and welfare, and I just reached the point where I'm just more or less enabling her rather than supporting her.  So I stopped supporting her mother, financially; now, to see her going after food stamps.  So--so many people that grow up, and again, not necessarily African Americans, I'm very concerned that they think that the government is supposed to provide for their needs.  One of my godchildren that just got out of prison complains about working.  My wife was 125 pounds working in the country, you know, picking cotton.  He's a big strong boy and thinking that, you know, people owe him a living.  And then I'm obviously concerned about half of our--more black men in prison than in college.  I've worked in the prison that--I continue to work in the prison, part time, and I just see cycles where, in the home there's a mother but no father, and then this cycle being repeated, that's a great concern to me.
Story_ID: 24285
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us something about your family?
Speaker 2: My family?
Speaker 1: Yeah, your family.  Now, you have a son, I know.  You were married at a certain point in time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you have a son that's grown, and he's in communication, right, I believe?
Speaker 2: Right.  He's in film making.
Speaker 1: Film, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm very proud of him.  He came--well, his mother raised him--I was with him six years before I was divorced, and his mother took out the matters, and did a wonderful job, bringing him up as a good Christian man, as well, and trying to keep--be sure that he had a good relationship with me.  I'm always grateful for that, and then my relationship with her, as I told you, is a very, very good relationship.  But, my home, growing up, I think was very positive, because my mother [Lee Edna Anderson] very much cared for all of us, and even now, at age ninety, she still treats us like children, a little bit too much care sometimes, but all that's very positive.  So it contrasts all of the poverty, the circumstance of the poverty with the rats and roaches and waste products streaming into our little kitchen in the basement with the amount of love and support that I've gotten from my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said you have a goddaughter?
Speaker 2: I have about fourteen or fifteen godchildren; I've lost count.  But the one that I've grown up with, I met her when she was three in Amherst [Massachusetts], I just graduated from college, and I'm glad to have had a positive role.  I've taken her with me; I took her to--when I was about to speak in South America, Chile; I took her with me, and she was only about thirteen or fourteen years old then, and I took her to Boston [Massachusetts]; that picture that I showed you last month.  So she's been one of my best friends.
Story_ID: 24286
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back on everything that you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Probably having a positive influence on children, as I said, I've worked in the Sunday school. I didn't say since when, but I started in 1961, my junior year in college.  So, working with young kids and been in Amherst [Massachusetts] long enough to see many of my high--many of my Sunday school students grow up.  Not all of them have been successful; some have ended up in jail, but many of them have gone to college and have jobs and so forth.  I think the best--one of the best things that I've ever done is to just work with high school, grade school, preschool children, and even adults as well, senior citizens, because most of my work now is in the nursing homes.
Story_ID: 24287
Speaker 1: There are quite a few young people that fail at math, and that keeps them from doing a lot of things--
Speaker 2: Yes, I failed myself.
Speaker 1: --that they want to do.  They might have the intelligence or probably have the intelligence to do, but they fail at math, and some people say it's because they poorness of the instructions, some people say it's because of the lack of focus, you know, on math or lack of role models in math.  Do you have any thoughts about that, as someone who actually did fail in math at one time?
Speaker 2: I do have thoughts about it, and I don't think it's very much to do with intelligence.  Anybody, any young person, no matter what their race is, they have the intelligence to learn mathematics or any other subject.  But you're right, a lot of the studies (unclear) down to poorly-trained teachers, and also not enough role models, as I said earlier.  Mathematics is generally something that's stereotypically hard; it need not be hard, it's the language.  I mean I would find--I mean I struggled trying to lean German; I still don't know it, but with the right approach, it's a language where I could  learn it, and where I could learn to love it like any other subject, but it's not on the main menu of topics, you know, like sports and other topics.  So role models or not enough good role models period--not enough role models period, poor teachers and cultural things that go in the home where you don't have a parent that is into studying, or making the kids study.  You know when parents read to children, that's such a powerful thing in getting them motivated for learning, and a lot of that doesn't go on in homes because so many other problems are pressing, you know, bills, being on welfare and just being beaten down by society; women are being beaten down by men that are no good; the list goes on and on.
Speaker 1: Do you see any--do you see the country moving towards a remedy for any of these problems?
Speaker 2: Well, I think generally speaking, with problems that have really multiplied since I was a student; the Newark England Board of Higher Education and so many other similar programs that changes the tide to some extent, it has certainly changed the tide for women, in fact, in our department, we could boast about 40 to 50 percent women, but it has to change the tide for black young men, as well.  The President [Barack Obama] talks about that, but a lot of promises that the President makes are simply not kept, so we still lack behind many of the countries overseas that a lot of progress still has to be made there.
Story_ID: 24288
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I have not asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Of course, I wouldn't mind playing one or two songs on the piano, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, we can do that.  Let me ask my last question first, and then we'll do the songs.  So, the last question is similar to the legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a good mathematician, not as a black mathematician.  I would like to be remembered as a servant; all the teaching that I have done, I consider myself a servant; I've been served myself; tried to serve my students, and then I would like to be remembered for my influence on families, young people, well, I should say families period, because I work with all ages; I'm working with a girl now that's four years old, and I'm working with a lady that's 97, well she's 98 now; so I work with all groups.  I'd liked to be remembered for my humanitarian efforts as a Christian minister that mainly works outside of the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Thank you, Larry.
Story_ID: 24289
Speaker 1: All.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, I'll play two pieces.  Let me see.  "All the Things You Are" and then the last song that Louie Armstrong recorded in 1972, "What A Beautiful World".  (playing the piano)
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're rolling.
Speaker 2: Myler Banks, she was my English teacher.  She will be 99 years old in October, I thinks it's October the 20th or so, and she told me she's still driving, provided she can get a place to park, and she's still attending church.  And then Dr. Willis Bird was my--one of my physical chemistry teachers and a very nice role model for me.  That picture was taken in 2011 when I was inducted into the Lincoln University Alumni Hall of Fame.  That's a picture where I took my goddaughter, and the little young girl, I think she's seven years old; I took them to Boston with me to the University of Massachusetts at Boston for a conference that I spoke of--spoke at.  That's a picture of one of the god families that I support for the last 20 years; the whole family there, with the mother in the middle.
Speaker 1: What are their names?
Speaker 2: Owen is the mother.  Lennie is the on the left, Corina, the next and the little boy.  Of course they're grown up now.  His name is Chrisnoff and the girl on the right is Tasheka, who's the one that I spent more time with than anybody.  That's a picture with me and my son when I first brought him to Amherst; he studied at the University of Massachusetts after leaving California.  That's the announcement of a concert that I did with Bill Williams in North Hampton, Massachusetts; one of my great singers.  That's a picture that the Kansas City Star did when I was invited to lecture in Germany and India.
Speaker 1: Can you name these from top to bottom?  (laughing) (showing four pictures of Floyd Leroy Williams)
Speaker 2: That's one of the few adult pictures that I have.  That's my former wife, Carolyn on the far left; my son and his wife, Emil Angenett, and that me on the far right.  And that's me playing a--one of the compositions that I wrote for the wedding called "Sacrament".  Of course that's me on the far left; that's my uncle on the far right, and that's one of my uncle's friends.
Speaker 1: What's your uncle's name?
Speaker 2: Oh my gosh.  Carl.
Speaker 1: If you don't know--
Speaker 2: Actually, his name is Silvan, but he doesn't like the name Silvan, so we call him Carl; my mother's brother.  And that's his wife, Loreen, on the far left, me in the middle; and my mother's sister, Edmonia, on the far right.  That's a picture that I took in San Francisco, I have no idea who the gentleman is, one of my uncle's friends, and similarly, I don't remember who the other two persons are.  And that's another picture in San Francisco, going to visit my uncle.  That's a picture that I took in 2005, we were celebrating 100 years of Einstein's relatively theory in India; I was one of the speakers from America.  That's a picture of one of the jazz pros that I was celebrating the music with Billie Holiday.
Speaker 1: Start top left and go clockwise.
Speaker 2: Okay, at the top left, that's a picture of my family, celebrating my mother's 80th birthday.  That's a picture of my mother and father when they were quite young; when they first met.
Speaker 1: Your stepfather or real father?
Speaker 2: My stepfather, Lawrence Rollins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of the five of us that up when we were children.
Speaker 1: Can you name everybody?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is Billy, Johnny, Karen, Floyd, Norman and my mother, who's cut off there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Earliest first picture we ever took, I guess.  Wow, I don't even know who that is.
Speaker 1: Okay. Forget that.  I'm sorry, you, like many people, consider your stepfather to be your real father.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's my mother and Lawrence Rollins, when they first started dating.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my brother Norman when he won a jazz--a best jazz album award.
Speaker 1: Didn't we see four of those already?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much the same, yeah.  That's a picture of the Russian scientist that I brought to America, one of my godchildren's mothers.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you didn't bury us.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me and my uncle Carl, again.  You see that saxophone there.  That's a earlier, well, I guess, when I first started teaching at the University of Massachusetts.  That's just a picture of my mother's mother, Willia Hansley, her memorial service.  That's a picture of my aunt, Edddie, or Edmonia on the left, and my mother, Lea Edna, on the right.  That's a picture of my father--my mother's father, John Anderson and his daughter, my mother's sister Edmonia on the left.
Speaker 1: These are better than the other one we saw.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes the one that we saw earlier.  Look at Billy frowning.  (laughing)  That's was shown before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is very small.  That's a picture of my sister, Diane and her husband.
Speaker 1: Do you know her husband's name.
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh.  Mike, Michael.  That's a picture when I was invited to represent the United States when I went to Belgium.  Yeah, that's a picture of my third-grade class and my teacher Mrs. Carrigan, and this is me and this is--that's Sylvia, the prettiest girl in the class, and this is Bertha.  And that's about all I know; Roy Boykins, I think that's Roy.  About all I know.  That's a problem that we had at church--yeah, some kind, I don't remember; the same lady that was doing the Billy Holiday program.
Speaker 1: Should be the last one.  Get the little one out of here.
Speaker 2: This is my high school graduation picture; 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
