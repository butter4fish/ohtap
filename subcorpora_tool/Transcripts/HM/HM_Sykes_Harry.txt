Speaker 1: Well, not elaborate.  Name of the things--
Speaker 2: Well, Okay.  I never knew my mother's father [Lewis Sykes].  He and my grandmother [Luberda Moore]--he passed away at--when I was five.
Speaker 1: Sir, what I'm asking you to do is just to name some of the jobs you've had?
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: That's all.
Speaker 2: I was a--helped farm, farmed on my father's [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] farm.  I was a painter at Mississippi State University [Starkville, Mississippi].  One of the dormitories during the summer.  My first job actually.  I was making 25 cents an hour.  Most laborers at that time make 10 cents an hour.  They would make one dollar a day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think you're taking me back too far, I just wanted your major occupation in life--
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: You've served on city council--
Speaker 2: I served--okay.
Speaker 1: for the City of Lexington [Kentucky].
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: You were a basketball player with the Harlem Globetrotters.
Speaker 2: Yes. (Simultaneously)  I was, I went over in, in--through education after I moved to Maywood, Illinois at the age of sixteen.
Speaker 1: I think, well, I think you're, you're still not getting what I'm asking you.  I'm just asking you for your occupation.  What you just retired from.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's all I'm--
Speaker 2: You want me to back-up. Okay.
Speaker 1: And, I--we're, we're gonna get to the rest of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, this is just the preliminary.  I want you to tell me, you retired from doing what?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm retired from the state government as the Affirmative Action Coordinator for all contract led by the State [Kentucky] over $250,000.  I went to the State in 1978 and retired from there in 1993.  Prior to that, I was-when I left city government in 1978, I was assistant to the, I was Assistant to the-I was Assistant Social Service Coordinator and before that I was-I can jump from there to 1963 when I was elected and come back to this point, if that's--
Speaker 1: Yes.  You served on the city council (simultaneously)
Speaker 2: I was the first black to be--to serve on the City Council of Lexington.  At that time, Lexington was--the former government was city government with three commissioners and, I mean I'm sorry, four commissioners and the mayor.  And, that was called the City Form of Government.  And we had a separate government, kinda government, which had a judge and three commissioners.  And, I--then you had to run--
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm--you're getting to deep into it.  I just wanted the name and occupation.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was, Okay, I was City Commissioner from, from '63' [1963] through '71' [1971].
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  And you named the rest of it, I think, so.  That gives us some idea.  You were president pro-tem (unclear) mayor pro-tem?
Speaker 2: Mayor pro-tem in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you gain that title by getting the highest number of votes of all the commissioners, all contestants for that--for a seat on the council.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, okay.  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Today's date is, is December 10, 2002.
Speaker 1: And, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in my living room in Lexington, Kentucky.
Story_ID: 74241
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, before we get into depth, there're five kinda "People Magazine"-ish type questions that we always ask.  And, they just require a short answer.  And, the first one is:  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite Food?  My favorite food is, I like steak but my favorite I think is Prime Rib.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year, I tend to lean toward the spring of year.  You've come through winter and spring--this a new--like a new start.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Since my retirement, I go to Houston [Texas] every Christmas because my daughter [Paula S. Brown] is there.  So, I tend to think that the reason my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, if you're talking about--I talk to young people a lot.  And, the favorite thing I tell them is to--if this is what you're asking--my favorite saying is telling them is that "you have only your mind to--and you need to develop that mind.  And, you need to stay in school.  And, you need to not get hung up on, you don't like the teacher."  I say "the teacher has prepared himself and you're trying to get something from him.  So, you got to develop an attitude that I'm gonna learn all--everything I can from him so I can move on."
Story_ID: 74242
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's talk about your family background.  How far can you go back with your family?  I mean, can you go back all the way past slavery or to--I mean can you--do you have stories from relatives about what life was like in the 19th Century, or like in the 18th Century?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I can touch on a lot of that.  As I've said, I was born in 1927 and after--I never did know my grandfather [Lewis] Sykes.  I only know--all he is, is a name.  His name was Lewis Sykes.  My grandmother [Luberda Moore] was born in [January] 1864 to parents named Moore.  Out of Moore, her parents was from Virginia and I believe, Boston [Massachusetts].  But, I didn't, didn't know--just know that by name through the Census.  And, Luberda Sykes reared--raised eleven children.  She had two sets of children.  Turner set and then Sykes sets.  There were five Sykes boys at--was the last of her brood.  She was born in 1964 and I know very little about how she managed it.  She, but, she had the Turners.  One became a minister and my father became a minister and his brother--one of his brothers became a minister--one of the Sykes boys.
Speaker 1: Can you spell your grandmother's name? Luberda.
Speaker 2: Luberda.  L-U-B-D--L-U-B-D-A, D-A--B-U-R-D-A [sic, B-E-R-D-A], I'm sorry.  Luberda.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 74243
Speaker 1: Then my father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] married my mother.  Marie Hall--  Marie Hall Sykes.  And, her parents were Professor Y. A.; Y for Young, Young A. Hall.  He was an astute mathematician.  And, he had a one room school house where he had maybe 20 or 25 students.  And, I had one--I have one photo of him sitting in the door, besides a window with all the children out in the play area.  And, he married my grandmother, Polly Ann Hall.  And, they produced a family of 8 or 10 children.  My mother being right near the elder part of that family.  Young Hall had brothers and sisters and I've not fully know how became--they became, became land owners.  I--This is just a guess.  It might have been that having served in, in Service there was some legislation passed that you get forty acres and a mule or something to that affect.  But, he had three brothers, Milton and Alex Hall.
Speaker 2: Now, they were living in--
Speaker 1: Starkville, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Starkville, okay.
Speaker 1: And, my father taught his--after he married my mother, he purchased a farm.  Part of Milton's farm, which caused us some friction there because the son of Milton Hall was named after my grandfather.  And, he didn't, he didn't want my father to have this land.  But, nothing became of it 'cause it was all, you know, on the up and up.  And, that's when my father started a farm to try to feed his children and what have you.
Story_ID: 74244
Speaker 1: Now, so, your father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] was born in Longview, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, then he--how did he come to Starkville [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Just through whatever means of transportation they had at that time--
Speaker 1: No.  What--I'm talking about the reason why?
Speaker 2: Oh, the reason he came was to (laughter).  I think the reason he came was to marry my mother [Marie Hall Sykes] and they decided to make that their home rather than take us back to, to--
Speaker 1: Longview.
Speaker 2: Longview.  I think that, that developed and I suppose the courtship, and had this opportunity to purchase a piece of land without any problem there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you give me the full name of your father and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Alright, his full name is Pinkie Kirk Sykes.  P-I-N-K-I-E K-I-R-K Sykes, S-Y-K-E-S.
Speaker 1: So, did he like the name Pinkie?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  There was never any knowledge--anything to my knowledge that, that showed he did not like it.
Speaker 1: Because (simultaneously) is P.K.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, he always uses the initials, P.K. Sykes.  And, at what time during--I don't know when he became a minister.  He went into ministry.  And, well--as long as I can remember so I don't know exactly when.
Speaker 1: Did he attend school when he was younger?
Speaker 2: He never went beyond the eighth grade.  Neither he nor my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact in my family, I was the first to go to college.
Speaker 1: Alright now, did you father--he was ordained at what denomination?
Speaker 2: He was a Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, did he have his own church?
Speaker 2: He had several churches.  He had one which he was would go to first and third Sunday and the other one he'd go to second and fourth Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So. (Telephone ringing)  Okay, alright.  So, how did that work out?  You must have--
Speaker 2: But, he was in (telephone ringing)--he's in the pulpit every Sunday of the month.  But, had it divided, had it worked out where he alternate during the week.  I mean, from Sunday to Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember the names of the churches?
Speaker 2: I don't--they were not in Starkville so I don't remember the names.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 74245
Speaker 1: Alright.  And, so what kinda person was your father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] and what do you remember him by?
Speaker 2: I remember him being very--a great disciplinarian and he was, he was--his work ethics were good.  He--when he, when he bought this, this land, he had bought two mules to, to farm the land, Nell and Queen, and they--when they died, he got another pair of mules, Kate and Doll.  Kate and Doll turn out to be the greatest pair of mules in the community.  They even--they would hold pulling contests and every time Kate and Doll win.  They win so often, they became famous in the center of town.  They drive down the street and people of all races, just look up and say "Kate and Doll."
Speaker 1: So, they--he had the most famous mules in the community?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What did they look like?  I mean, I'm just--
Speaker 2: They were just ordinary--black in color and they were, they were such interesting creatures, that you'd think they could talk to each other.  And, you could talk to them.  You could say "gee" they'd go one way, you say "haul", they'd go another way, without pulling the rein.  This is the kinda rapport you develop with these mules.  My father used those--they, I credit them, the mules, for supplying our livelihood.  My father take them--use--plow--plant corn and cotton and we raise--he raised all the vegetable for a garden and just everything you can think of.  Then beyond that, he had to--another ten acre--he eventually bought another ten acres which was timber.  And, he would put us out there to cut this timber so he could load the wagon and take it uptown to sell it for a dollar and a quarter.  And, he would make--he could make three, three loads a day.  He'd go up and leave my brothers--older brothers and myself, I don't know, I don't know how much I was doing, but we'd cut another load, when he come back and pick it up and he'd take it uptown there around the college, Mississippi State College.  We were about maybe three miles south of Mississippi State University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what town is that in?
Speaker 2: That's Starkville.
Speaker 1: Starkville?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And, he would--he could make (unclear) you know, go up three times a day and you would make--that means you'll make $3.75 per day.
Speaker 1: Three dollars and seventy-five cents?
Speaker 2: For hauling the wood.
Speaker 1: Was that pretty good in those days?
Speaker 2: You mean, what--
Speaker 1: Yeah, was that pretty good in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, that was better, better than average for where we was.  You'd get a dollar a day, you work ten hours a day, you get a dollar.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  So, that was much better.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  And, then there's unity-- U.S. 82, Highway 82 was going through Starkville and he had on--he and his mules to pull a scraper to do what bulldozers, what they use (telephone ringing) bulldozers for now to move the dirt and prepare the roadway (telephone ringing).  You had a scraper and he'd get behind and scoop the dirt up to move it to other places.  That was the kinda thing and-- Kate and Doll lived 'til about 1942 or there abouts.  'Cause he got another pair of mules after that and they never, they never came close to Kate and Doll.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Story_ID: 74246
Speaker 1: Did they [his father's mules, Kate and Doll] have any other characteristics that were unusual other than the capacity to pull and then understand?
Speaker 2: Well,--
Speaker 1: Or, did he [Sykes' father, Pinkie Kirk Sykes] treat 'em special, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he made sure that they were the finest dresses--harnessed mules and he was meticulous in keeping his wagon in shape.  In other words, not raggedy, and if a wheel was not right, he'd have it prepared.  The singletree [yolk] was needed to pull; he'd make sure it was strong enough to do it.  And, 'course when you're talking about a pair of mules, you got a doubletree [yolk] and then each singletree is where each mule--and they, they'd pull together.  And, he used the snake, the snake logs out of--for lumber mill.  And, any time someone got hitched up to a log and couldn't move, they'd come get Kate and Doll.  And, those, those mules get, (unclear) get going, com'on, yeah, get up.  If they couldn't move it, as if they said, let's go down, they drop the knees and then get the log started and they get up and pull on where they wanted to do.
Speaker 1: They would drop to their knees to pull some things?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  To get it, to get it started.  Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Two interesting mules there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, like I say, I just thought they was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good story, that's a good story.
Story_ID: 74247
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was--
Speaker 1: What was her name and can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was a--well her real name which she never--wasn't that she was shame maybe she just never, never used it.  Parkay P-A-R-K-A-Y Marie M-A-R-I-E Hall.  So, she dropped the first part and just--everybody would just call her Marie or Mary the way the southern accent was used.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, and you said--and her father--mother and father as I mentioned just briefly was Young [A.] Hall, Young and Polly N. Hall.  And, when she, my grandmother was a midwife.  She, I think she delivered all of us when we were born.  My mother had 13 children.  My mother and father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] had 13 children.  The two oldest Robert and Willi, William died in infancy.  And, the next boy--the next one was a boy, Vivian and the next one was Wallace and then they had a girl, Marion, then me and right on down the line.  That was 11 of us, 11 of us lived to 2000.  The first, the first death in my siblings' life was my sister [Margaret S. Stenson] in 19--, in 2000, February.  And, as I said before there was 11 of us so there's 10 of us still lives as we speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How old was your sister when she died?
Speaker 2: My sister was 60--66 I believe.
Speaker 1: Now, did you mother go to school or she never went passed eighth grade?
Speaker 2: She never went passed eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And, her father was a teacher, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  And that--I don't know how to explain that.  But, I always had a keen interest in mathematics, and you learn later on, I attended Kentucky [State University in Frankfort, Kentucky] out here after they, they desegregated.  And, went to Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana] in Big Ten and on to the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota].  But, I guess that would come later.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, right now, could you kinda reflect back on life, you've told us somewhat about it--oh, before we go into that--what year was your mother born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in 1900 [August 20, 1900].
Speaker 1: And, your father?
Speaker 2: My father was born in 19--, 1897 [February 1897].
Story_ID: 74248
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now can you reflect back and give us an idea of some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up in, at least in Starkville [Mississippi]?  'Cause I know you moved later on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Well, in Starkville--the heart of Starkville was about five--we were about five miles away. We go--and the way we get there, we simple go up through the campus of Kentucky--the University of Mississippi--
Speaker 1: Mississippi State [University]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, then go on into town.  Well, one of the thing was that the sound of the wagons and people coming in and hauling various products to sell.  The, the farm was, was beautiful, you'll have the--you had raised everything under the sun, sort-to-speak, which supplied us with our meat.  My father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] raised hogs.  And, during the cool of the fall, we'd slaughter them for meat and we'd even hang them up.  We had a tree, we'd heist [sic, hoist] 'em up in the tree to cool out during the, during the night before he prepared to cure them.  And we would cure them, he would take salt and put them in salt and they stayed for so long to cure the ham to keep it from, from spoiling.  We had cattle.  Once in a while, he'd have beef killed to have it canned for meat.  We had dogs, which we use for hunting.  And, we hunted everything, again, out there.  We hunted rabbits, coons, possums, squirrels.  And, when they talk about smells, you go into the woods at night, depending on whether it was--the moon was out shining bright or otherwise, we would go out into the woods and just sorta smell the fresh air.  And, you can't turn the dogs loose and let them go to find a possum.  And, there's a certain sound that you, you knew when they had, had treed a possum or a coon.
Story_ID: 75329
Speaker 1: Now, there's a certain sound a dog makes, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  When they, when they start chasing the animal they go--quite there, the bark is rapid.  Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  And, then when they run them up a tree or a tree (unclear) Ooooo, ooooo (laughter).  But, that, that's it.
Speaker 1: That's good, that's good.
Speaker 2: So, did you--so you hunted a lot, your brothers and father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My father was particularly, he had me fishing with him all the time.  He liked to fish and he and I would go fishing.  And, I can remember very vividly, I hooked a turtle on my line and pulled him up and he was too large to pull out.  I pulled him out of this creek.  We were on a creek.  My father was about ten yards up the creek, or down the creek, and he looked up and says, "Oh, hold 'em, hold 'em," and my father started running and told me to--to help me get the turtle out of the--on the bank.  He said "hold it, don't--just, just hold it, just hold it."  And, I got ambitious, figured I was gonna pull him out by myself and the line broke.  My father was running so fast, he just went right down in the creek behind it.  You know, he didn't, he didn't catch it or anything, he just merely--he was coming to, to get under the turtle and throw him out on the bank.  So, when he got there to go down, the turtle when down under and he just went slid down in the, in the creek.  We would, we'd catch fish and come home and give 'em to my younger brothers and sister to clean and they hated that, (laughter) but they loved to eat 'em (laughter)--pheasants we hunted.  And, the--there was no, no luxury money laying around to keep it, so you'd buy maybe four or five shells at a time.  I had a double barrel shotgun and as I said, "I would go out and get some rabbit for dinner."  I had five shells.  I came back with four rabbit and one shells.  Knocked everyone over that, that came by.
Speaker 2: So, you had to make 'em, count.  Make every (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Make every shot count.  And, you wouldn't, you wouldn't shoot a sitting rabbit, it was a sitting sportsman code that you went by.  You jump him up and let him run and give him a chance to get away and then you cock--throw down on 'em and knock 'em over.  That was, of course, that was the way we communicated with the other kids, trying to figure--show them who had the bragging rights.  Who would shoot best and this sort of thing.  We had neighboring farm which we would play with the kids.  We'd race each other and that kinda thing, run all the time.
Story_ID: 75330
Speaker 1: We had pecans and walnuts that you get in the fall and had to store them up.  We had to get in the crops for the winter.  And, we--my father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] grow the corn, of course, we had to chop, use a hoe to tend--to get the weeds up till it grows up.  Then, when it comes harvest time, we--my father build a double bed to fill that--we'll fill it up to haul the corn in.  And, he had cotton and he'd take that to the mill to sale.  And, they had cotton gin which would strip the seed from the cotton and then they'd bail the cotton for commercial uses.  The seeds that came out of that cotton, they would pay about $6.50 for the seed from the 500 thread pound bale of cotton.  I can remember very--another time my older brother, oldest brother, Vivian [Sykes], he went to take a bale of cotton to be processed, seeded, and when he got there the seed dropped in a bin when you go there, and when he got there, there was somebody had been there and didn't, didn't take the seed.  So, he got about $13.  He figured he's rich (laughter).  In terms of--that was just--it came to him because he had two package of seeds.  Then, we--at certain times we--after we got all the corn harvested, they would turn the cattle in the field to eat the stalks and that served as food for them.  And, in order to have food for the cattle and the hor--and the mules, you cut hay at a machine, which cut hay and bale the hay.  We had a--had to--at that time you had a horse drawn baler, I mean a, reaper that picked up hay.  It just go down and rake it up and then take so much and then they had it level and they come up at least (unclear) let it back down and keep going.  And, then they had a pitchfork and get that hay up and then they bale--put it--they bales it in bales about a, oh, I'd say, what was that--about three, about three by two or something bale.  I don't know what they, what they weighted.  But, then you could sell the hay by the bale, by the bale or load.  Many times, we'd put baled hay on the wagon and hitch [his father's mules] Kate and Doll up and take it up to sell it.  That kept food--kept money coming in.  I can truly say that I cannot remember my mother [Marie Hall Sykes] and father and eleven children ever going hungry.
Story_ID: 75331
Speaker 1: And, my father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] was very interested in his family.  He had sisters and brothers living all over and he would, he would drive way back into the back woods to find his sisters; to see how they were getting along.  He even--doing the hard times of, hard times after the [Great] Depression and so forth, he had took turns bringing two children of his brother's to live with us where we already had eleven children.  He had, he had a brother, which was his half-brother, was a Turner, from the Turner side of O.J. Turner, his two oldest boys.  My father brought him to spend at least a couple of weeks with us and he was--pride himself in saying, "you boys eat all you want," you know, that kinda thing.  He'd go out to the smokehouse and get out a ham, which he had cured during the winter.  So, we had plenty.  And, then later on, he brought his younger brother, one of his younger brothers; two of his children to spent a couple weeks with us.  That was, that was many things that I remember about him.
Story_ID: 75332
Speaker 1: One--it was once and a while, he'd [Sykes' father, Pinkie Kirk Sykes] take me along with him to his church.  The local church where I joined church was just two miles from home.  Ebenezer was a little community with a one, one school room house.  We walked to school every day.
Speaker 2: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 1: Ebenezer Elementary School.  One room school house and one professor.  Professor Keels [ph.].  And, we would--when we get--it had a potbelly stove and I would get to school and he would have me organize a patrol to go out into the woods and get firewood to keep the school warm.  My father would get, would donate a load of, load of wood for the stove also.  And, those are the kinds of activities and civic pride which he, which he had.
Speaker 2: Now, how did you like school?  What kinda of a little guy were you when you were growing up and what did you think of school and how'd you do?
Speaker 1: I did fine.  Like I say, I like--good to get off of that farm for a change.  I had to get up and milk the cows and do your farm chores and then you could go to school.  You walk two miles to school, each way.  But, I only got a chance to do that 'cause, as I said, on the farm the planting starts right about the--March and the harvest in the fall comes down--goes on passed about down to November.  So, you got about four, four months which I could tend school.
Speaker 2: Now, did the school close for certain months?  Or, did they--did the school just keep going and whenever you can go there, is when you would be there?
Speaker 1: Well, the school kinda--it was in the farm area so, it would close.
Speaker 2: It would close, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  And, I can remember, when I got to fourth grade, the six grade students were having trouble with mathematics and I just got up, says, "Oh, that's not, that's not hard to do."  I started to, well let's see, well they say he--they just handed me a crayons and say you solve it.  And, I just went up there and solved it and the professor Keels [ph.] was amazed.  He says, "you don't need to be studying fourth grade mathematics, we're gonna move you to the sixth grade."  And, that was where I was when I left.

Speaker 1: Okay now.  Now, you say, when you, now why did you family leave Mississippi and how old were you when you left?
Speaker 2: Well, I tried to give you a sense of my father's [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] obligation, he was very protective of us.  He knew that--he kept us away from any, any confrontations.
Speaker 1: Okay. With--
Speaker 2: White people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's see, we had to--if you, if you were walking and you--on a sidewalk, you would have to get off the sidewalk to let them by.  That's, that's--you understand, that's kind of a--you had to control yourself.  My father, (unclear) that.  Well, at this particular time, one particular time, my father was well known in town with the mules [Kate and Doll] and all this and all that and how he handled his family--cared for his family.  He had my brother, Vivian [Sykes] with us, a load of something and my brother used a whip just to keep 'em going.  It wasn't cruel, you know, it's just his--when he wanted to use his--maybe pivot out a little bit, he'd whip.  Well, this white man came to my father, said "that boy beating them mules, he got no business beating them mules."  Daddy, says, "Okay, I'll, I'll take care of it."  "Well, what are you gonna do about it?"  He reached up and my father said, "I'll just take care of it.  I'll take care of it, he belong to me and the mule belong to me.  I'll take care of it."  He turned around to walk away and put his--grabbed my father and my father turned around and the next thing he knew he was getting up off the ground.  My father just, he just--he wasn't gonna stand for that and then he, and he--after he decked him, the crowd starting to gathering, my father went right on over to sheriff office and told sheriff what, what went on.  The sheriff came out and told him, say "Y'all break up and get outta here and know that Pinkie was minding his own business and nothing's gonna happen to him."  And, my father came home, he didn't have any problem, no--nothing like that--after that, but it dawned on my father that he should, should be doing more for--he could possibly support his family and give 'em an education if he moved to Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 75334
Speaker 1: So, he [Sykes' father, Pinkie Kirk Sykes] went to Chicago [Illinois]--he had gone to Chicago, put it this way, I'm kinda digressing here, just a second, to give you the picture.  He had attempted to--he had my uncle on my mother [Marie Hall Sykes], my mother's brothers had moved to Maywood [Illinois] and they was talking about what the opportunities would be if he'd come.  So, he thought that he would like to do that, but he went--took my mother and my youngest--my oldest brother [Vivian Sykes], this was before all of this.  Before he bought the farm [in Starkville, Mississippi] really.  And, he went to Chicago and he didn't stay a while, but he didn't, didn't feel that he was making any progress then.  But, my mother became pregnant with my second brother when he returned.  So, that's when he returned and started the farm and all.  And, had--like I said, had done all these things and decided that I could get a better education, he could better educate his family if he went to Chicago.  The war had--the Second World War [World war II] had come and employment was plentiful with men going off the Service so, my father and my two older brothers [Vivian Sykes and Wallace Sykes] went to Maywood and all of them got jobs.  And, he said as soon as he could get enough money, he was gonna send for his whole family to come there.  And, that's how I went to Chicago.
Story_ID: 75335
Speaker 1: And, during the summer [1943]--and I was sixteen and my father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes] talked to the proprietors of where he was working and I got a job there; American Can Company.  And--but, my father said he wanted me in school.  And, as I said before, I was about as big as I am now at 16.  I was 6'5" at least.  And, he says--
Speaker 2: Was your father tall, too?
Speaker 1: My father was about 6'2" or '3" maybe 6'4", I don't know.
Speaker 2: Your other brother's tall?
Speaker 1: I have one brother taller than I am.  My oldest brother [Vivian Sykes] is taller than I am.  He's like 6'9".
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm 6'7".  And, then I got the others are--I have another younger brother that pretty close to my height.  We all just--my mother's brothers were 6'5" and there bouts.  So, we got kinda genes on both sides there.  But, as I said before, at sixteen and had gotten on passed the sixth grade, they didn't realize that it wasn't because I was a dummy, I had used whatever time I had to get what I had and that's just far as I had progressed.  So, my father took me an elementary school, it was eighth through twelve there.  Eight, up to eighth grade; elementary, and nine through twelve; high school.  So, he talked to the principal and said, "well we need to give him a test, an examination to see if he can do work above six grade level."  And, when they checked my test score, they say, yeah, he's doing--he's, he can handle eighth grade.  So, they moved me into eighth grade and I was--you know, the eighth grade students was about little tikes as far as I'm concerned and the desk I had to almost sit sideways to get into the desk.  But, I entered and it wasn't any--wasn't too much--I like some of the mean things you see out today but they still had that element; which stand on the corner as we're going to school.  "Well, look at that big ol' boy going in there with those little kids."  But, I had had a dream.  What I mean by that, I just, I had an attitude that I wanted to better myself.  And, I was gonna, I was gonna proceed.  And, I did everything, you know, conducted myself in the proper manner.  As a matter fact, they put me on patrol.  I didn't have any trouble there because of my size (laughter).  And, so, then I went to high school and I could work full--
Speaker 2: How old were you when you went to high school?
Speaker 1: Seventeen.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Oh, well you caught up with everybody.
Speaker 1: Well, what I'm saying is, I--they skipped me to the eighth grade and I spent a year in elementary school, then I went to high school at age seventeen.
Speaker 2: So, you were a freshman at seventeen.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  And, the Can Company would allow me to work four hours a week--a day while I was in school.  I'd impressed them with my work ethics so they would take me on for four hours after school.  And, this was a God send because I used that money to help my father with--and as soon as my father got enough money together, he bought a house.  When we first moved there, we were living in three different locations.  He said, because of the size of the family. My father bought a house, was one of those persons who says, you know, "if you gonna do something, do it right."  And, then they moved us in this two story house that brought his family together.  And, I'd take my salary to help with the fam--with the take--provide for the rest of the family.
Story_ID: 75336
Speaker 1: So, when I went to school, the first thing I saw was, naturally the basketball coach.  He say, "Aww, you got to play ball.  You got to come play ball."  I told 'em, I'd like to, but I'm--I can't.  I've got to work and help provide for my family.  So, in 19--, when the war [World War II] ended, naturally the urgency of supply for the troop diminished and then they [American Can Company] laid off all the part-time help, which I was in that group.  And, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, 'cause I immediately went to the basketball coach, say, "I'm available now, I can play."  I played football, basketball, football and it was a high jumper in track.
Speaker 2: Then, you went to Proviso High School?
Speaker 1: Proviso Township High School [Cook County, Illinois].  And, I signed up for the college, college preparatory course.  And, and I--it raised some eyebrows there.  But, after I got into it, studied Algebra and Chemistry and Physics, I made the honor roll.  I was still playing sports and I went all the way through and played, all over--played through my time at high school.  And, it just so happens a guy who was--who had left school after he finished Eleventh grade.  But, when he came out of Service, I had reached the Eleventh grade.  So, we were there together and we graduated together and his father was a--had ties with Kentucky State University [Frankfort, Kentucky].  And, he was sent down for summer training for football.  And, when he got there, down to Kentucky State which is Kentucky State University now, he saw the basketball coach and told him, say, "I got a, got a home buddy whose an excellent basketball player and gave him my height and all that, and I was sent a scholarship unseen.  And, I came to--that's how I got back to Kentucky, got down to Kentucky, Kentucky State.  My wife [Geraldine Higgins Sykes], was here in Lexington [Kentucky], finished at the old Lexington Dunbar Junior Senior High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School].  She was--we met there as freshman and after so long we starting going together.  Maybe our sophomore year, I don't know.  But, at any rate, we kinda paired off there.  And, I pointed out that played with--graduated Dunbar on the same team, we played together four years.  His name was David Whitney, who is now coaching Alcorn State University.
Speaker 2: That's in Alcorn, Mississippi?
Speaker 1: Alcorn, Mississippi.  And, it just so happens that he has a contract to play the University of Kentucky on January the 2nd in Rupp Arena here in Lexington.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.  Now, what position did you play in--
Speaker 1: In, in--
Speaker 2: in college?
Speaker 1: I played, I played Center the whole time in college.
Speaker 2: Those are the days--now we have like a lot of guys--men who are seven feet tall playing Center.  But, in those days, you know, Centers were--
Speaker 1: Well, I was--
Speaker 2: 6', 6'7"?
Speaker 1: I was the man then, so-to-speak.  We didn't have any--a lot of--there were a few 6'9" people coming on, but they weren't well coordinated and that sort of thing.  One of the great [Harlem] Globetrotters, which I'll get to later probably, was [Nathaniel] "Sweetwater" Clifton.  He went to DuSable High School in Chicago [Illinois].  He was 6'8.  And, incidentally, he was one of the first to break the color line in, in professional--in the NBA [National Basketball Association].
Story_ID: 74257
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky].  What kind of a school was Kentucky State?  And, what, what--who was the president?  You know, tell me about the president.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, the school was an agricultural school.  And, at the time I entered I believe there were about 5,000 perhaps in attendance, that's the strength of it at that time.  And, the president was Dr. [Rufus] R. B. Atwood.  And, of course, the funding had to come through the legislature and so he had to develop a relationship, a rapport with the legislature in order to get money to--for the need of the school.  And, he was one person who fell in sort of disarray with many, many black was the fact that he would turn some of the money that they gave him back in each year.  But, the greater understanding there was that he was maintaining a rapport and he should get more money next year as he, as he developed his strategies, he would--and wanted to ask for money to perhaps build another school building, another classroom, or a dormitory, and so forth and so on.  When I went there, there was only one dormitory and would build a new dormitory named after a casualty in World War II.  So, we had--didn't get two dormitories til, til--during my time there between 8--1948 and 1952 [1949].
Speaker 1: Now, who was the casualty in World War II?
Speaker 2: His name was McCullin.  I don't know--remember the first name.  But, he had a brother, came out of St. Louis [Missouri], Jeep [ph.] McCullin.  Who attended Kentucky State at the same time we did.  And, we had a--I came to--I wanted to study something in the line of mechanical engineering.  I was preparing myself all the time, I told you I was studying college preparatory courses.  But, when I got to Kentucky State, they had a math class and Professor Jones was an excellent mathematician and--but they didn't have a full blown Mathematics Department.  So, since I was on a basketball scholarship, I decided I would major in Physical Education.  And, then take all the math that was a, was available and make that my minor in Math.  And, of course, my colleagues couldn't understand that, they say somebody gonna study physical education and take math as electives."  But, I did and I even, I even took accounting and when I got ready to graduate, you have to go out and practice teach.  It was teacher's training was in vogue at the time.  So, when I got ready to be sent out for my last study, they sent me to Lexington Dunbar to do my practice teaching and I, I taught--they split it up, I taught half physical education and the other time I spent in Mathematics and Algebra under the head of the Math Department an Dunbar, Ms. Aisha Taylor [ph.].  And, I was one of the few people, I don't know, how it was a lie, but (unclear) would say that, I was the only person that they knew that got an "A" under Ms. Aisha Taylor as a training.  But, I graciously accept that, that's fine.  But, upon graduation, by that time, my wife and I were, were regulars.
Story_ID: 74258
Speaker 1: And, digressing, just a second (clears throat), even in Mississippi, I told my buddies, a gang, "One day I'm gonna play with the Globetrotters," and they just laughed at me.  I just wanna throw that in because for the next (clears throat), next point I'm gonna make here.  We finished out--
Speaker 2: Wait.  I was gonna ask you how the team did, so I guess you're telling me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, in my--in college we, we won several--we had many battles with Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee].  We won championships; we won at least two Midwest Conference championships.  And, I can get back just briefly with, with that rivalry we had on the color level which was with Tennessee because they proceeded me in going to the Harlem Globetrotters and I eventually ended up playing with the guys I comp- I was competitors against at Tennessee.  But, I, I will get back to that when you--when I talk about the experience with the Globetrotters.  But, moving on with the education, I had played my last game with the college in about March.  So, didn't wanna--didn't go near a gym after that, you understand, just--didn't keep in shape in terms of running or jogging or anything, training in anyway.  And, I found out the Globetrotters was gonna be in Louisville [Kentucky] at the arena there on Seventh Street at that time.  And, I told my wife [Geraldine Higgins Sykes], I say "How would you like to go see the Globetrotters?"  And, she says, "Fine."  So, we got signed out from Kentucky State, got permission to go.  We went up to Louisville and we saw the Globetrotters.  But, I've got to digress just--another one here because when I was home in the sum- during the summer, I'd work at night and go to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association] in downtown Chicago [Illinois] and, and meet up with all the other college players who was home from all the big time colleges, NYU [New York University] and with Clyde--Clara B [ph.], great basketball coach had to--born out of Chicago.  But, anyway, to make a long story short, they would be at the gym to workout in basketball.  Many Globetrotters who were still tough as leather but this--begin to age and retire and they would be there just keeping in shape, something to do.  And, we would choose up teams and have knockdown, drag out, every day; we'd just play and play.  Well, I said that to, to augment what I was gonna say about these Globetrotters.  You know Abe [Saperstein] always carried two teams.  He'd have a preliminary and then the Globetrotters for the main event.  So, we were standing up there with--the wife and I are getting ready--wasn't wife at that time.  We was there at the entrance to go into the arena and the team was coming in and all of a sudden, almost like as if it was a staged thing it wasn't, I understand that.  They say, "Sykes," and I looked around in amazement and just about every one of the guys that was, the makeup of that particular preliminary team, were guys I had knocked heads with at the Y in Chicago.  So, they say, "Come on and play with us."  And said, "We got a uniform for you, we got--we can get some shoes from the Globetrotters and so you come on."  I say, "No." I begged the offer, said, "I'm not in any shape."  They said, "Aww, please come on, all you have to do--you don't have to play the whole game, you just come in as spare."  Put me out there as a starter, and didn't take me out the entire game.  My tongue was hanging out, figuratively speaking.
Story_ID: 74259
Speaker 1: So, was that, was that the name--that was the Washington Generals you were on, or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: What team were they called?
Speaker 2: No.  Maybe playing against the Washington.  I was with the Kansas City Stars.
Speaker 1: Kansas City Stars.  Okay.  That was the team the Globetrotters were playing that night?
Speaker 2: Naw.  That was the preliminaries--
Speaker 1: Oh, preliminaries, Oh (simultaneously) he had two teams?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) was owned by Abe Saperstein to have enough to have two--a double header.
Speaker 1: Oh, Okay.  But, he also owned the other two team too, that y'all played, right?  Or, did you play somebody different?
Speaker 2: Well, that was, that was, that was many different teams during my time.  There was a Washington Generals owned by [Louis] "Red" Klotz and the Philadelphia Sphas, there was a Hawaiian team put together.  I'm sure Abe had some interest, but to have somebody organize those team wherever they were to come to play.  This was the Kansas City Stars that played the preliminary in this game.  And, the coaches that would guard the Globetrotters at that time, was one of the original Globetrotters, was a big man who was a trickster and the ball handler for the original Globetrotters, which was formed in 1927 [sic, 1926].  His name was, I have a mental block right now, but anyway I'll go on with the story--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was coaching the team.  And, after this game, he came in the dressing room and said, "How would you like to play with the Trotters?"  There's another shock.  I said, "You kidding!"  He say, yeah--naw--yeah, he say just give me--put your address here and we'll contact you 'cause we gonna be in Chicago [Illinois] at Evanston Gym before we go out on tour next, next fall.  And, so I was--went back to Maywood and worked during the summer getting money together to, you know, make permanent home here in Kentucky.  And, sure enough woke up one morning and there's a letter from the Globetrotter.  And, it said, "We're going to be practicing at the Evanston Gym this week, Monday through Friday, we'd like for you to come for a trail."  And, oh it must, it must have been 200 people showed up for that trail.  We practice on Monday, we practice on Tuesday, and at the end of the day on Tuesday, they came to me and says, "They wanna see you in the office."  So, I say well this is it, they getting ready to cut me.  And, I went in and they say "We getting ready to send a team out on a tour up through Michigan and Minnesota and Canada, and we want you to go home, pack your bag, we wanna take you with us."  That's how it started.
Story_ID: 74260
Speaker 1: So, we [the Harlem Globetrotters] took off and went up thought the Upper Municipal Michigan and up through Minnesota and looked at grasshopper farms and that kinda of thing.  It was just, was just an adventure.  Went into Manitoba, Winnipeg.  Winnipeg, Manitoba up in Canada.  Played up there for several games and then returned through Minnesota, through Albert Lea.  Coldest time, coldest I've ever been in my life.  It's 35 below degree, 35 below and the blowing sleet storm.  I didn't--I never wore a hat.  But, I went out and bought a tam up there in Albert Lea, Minnesota (laughter).  But we--and, this was in the fall of the year, about, it's earlier than this, maybe October.  It was snowing rough up in there.  So, but, we would only be out about three weeks and go to return to Chicago [Illinois].  Well, Abe [Saperstein] had--he constantly promoting.  He had developed a Western Unit, which I was traveling there and he was trying to develop a Southern Unit and make [William] "Pop" Gates, one of the all-time greats with the originals, the coach there.  And, "Pop" Gates had told Abe, he wanted me to be his--on his team.  So, when I left Chicago, I left with the understanding when I came back I'd be joining the Southern, the Southern Unit.  Well, when I went down the date that I was pulled into the office there in Chicago, they say, "you're not going with the Southern Team," says, "they got you going with the East."  That was [Reece] "Goose" Tatum.  That was the big team.  Big in terms of, they played to the larger crowds.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, you know--
Speaker 1: And, but the other--
Speaker 2: Marcus Haynes, and
Speaker 1: Marques Haynes, "Goose" Tatum, [William] "Rookie" Brown who had made the movie ['The Harlem Globetrotters'] in 1951 with--
Speaker 2: Dorothy Dandridge.
Speaker 1: Dorothy Dandridge.  Let's see, female lead part.  And, that was the group, I, I ended up with.
Story_ID: 74261
Speaker 1: And, we had some interesting time, we were well received most of the time.  But you still knew in some places, that they enjoyed what you brought to the table, but you couldn't--didn't have a place to eat after, after it was over.  And, all the instances were white and many instances we traveled in the Southern areas, were no blacks allowed to see the game.  And, a person might say, well, "why would you put up with that?"  We'll in order to move forward sometime, you have to step back, a step until you get it right.  We were called "the ambassadors of good will."  And, we had people laughing everywhere we went.  That began a culture change.  You never would change them all, but the people that you come in contact, would present you as being decent.  We would drive to one--we'd finish a game one night and get in the bus and drive a couple hundred--two hundred miles to the next big city to play.  We stop along the way and they say, "We can't serve y'all."  That's up in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: That's in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 1: That was in Pennsylvania.  And, that--those kinda things, we had, but we had mostly good relations.  We went down to Miami, Miami in Florida and they--Miami being progressive, they had a beautiful motel with swimming pool for us to stay in.  But, they wanted us to stay in--on Miami Beach in one of the biggest hotels over there.  As I say before, this, this is how things in different area were, were beginning to become progressive.
Story_ID: 74262
Speaker 1: But, we were, we were there when the [Brooklyn] Dodgers were in spring training.  They had Jackie Robinson and we, we'd crisscross with, with many famous people.  Traveling with the Globetrotters we had Abe [Saperstein] as an entrepreneur; had Satchel Paige travel with the team.  Not to play, just sat on the beach and everybody know, that the great Satchel Paige and he and "Goose," [Reece] "Goose" Tatum were pretty good friends.  And, I just, you know, just mingle around and one night I interest things, everybody--nobody knew how old "Goose" was.  He asked Satchel Paige, "How old are you?"  And, "Satch" told him.  And, he said, "Well how old am I?"  And, that--cause was never--that's just between we--in the locker room.  When I met Althea Gibson, she was part of our tour at one time.  Abe brought her on, she had just won the tennis--one of the first blacks to win a tennis championship back in the '50's [1950's].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wimbledon, I think [French Open in 1956, both Wimbledon and U.S. Nationals in 1957 and 1958].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wimbledon.  Right.  And, she traveled with us as a, as a half-time promotion--
Speaker 2: Attraction?
Speaker 1: Half-time attraction, yeah.  And he set up a tennis, tennis court right on the basketball court and she'd have a competitor on the other side and hit some balls, you know.  And that, that went over quite well and he had other, other half-time entertainment as we went but that's just a few that I was naming there.
Story_ID: 74263
Speaker 1: Getting back, I left Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky] going to (laughter) Harlem Globetrotter story but after I graduated from the--while, while I was--after I graduated from Kentucky State [1952], I went over to the Globetrotters for a couple years.  What did it with my wife [Geraldine Higgins Sykes] and I got married [July 1, 1951] and my son [Harry E. Sykes], my oldest son was calling my--his granddaddy [Pinkie Kirk Sykes], "dad."
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  So, you weren't around him enough?
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, I said "No, this isn't for me."  I love it dearly.  I love to go on all of the places I'd gone, Mexico, and all those place.  I said, "Naw, I'm--there ought to be something else to do."  I applied for a teaching position at the old [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [in Lexington, Kentucky].  And, to show you how things work out in your life.  The teacher that I practice taught under in Mathematics was retiring.  She recommended to the Board of Education that I'd been the one who's appointed to take her place.  So, I became the head of Mathematics Department at Dunbar High School.  And, while there, the superintendent gave me a stipend to organize the Junior High School.  This was a school with seven through twelve grades.  That's why they, that's why I refer to it as Dunbar Junior High--Junior Senior High School.  And, told me to be the organizer of the Junior High School Program so that the youngsters would have some kinda recreational outlet.  And, I was to play--scrounge around and play anybody who would play me.  And, we went as far as Maysville, Kentucky over on the [Ohio] river, east of Lexington here for--to play Junior High School basketball.  Well, the decision had come down for desegregation in 1954 [Brown v. Board of Education] and that's when I went into--I came off the road in '54' [1954] and started teaching.  After I got my team organized, I think in about 1956, I applied for membership in the Bluegrass Junior High School Athletic Association.  Because of the court decision, they could not deny my interest.  But, they weren't required to play me unless they wanted to.  So, it's difficult for me to even get, get teams in the league to play me.  There was a stipulations that they had to be--had to play (unclear) at least six game before you could qualify for the championship.  Well, I got the University, University High Junior team coach--
Speaker 2: The University of Kentucky?
Speaker 1: At the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky].  They could not stand in negative publicity for being flagship of Kentucky and then denying youngsters the opportunity to participate.  And, the Lexington Catholic High School coach gave me two games.  And, I got two games from one other school, braved the tradition and came on in, and I won two championships with that team.  First two years I was there.  And, I make a point 'cause I didn't stay in teaching.
Story_ID: 74264
Speaker 1: I went--well, during that time, I went to University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky] during 1957 to study mathematics, additional mathematics.  I got a General Electric fellowship to study math at Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana] in 1968.  I got a National Science Grant in 1959 to study mathematics at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota].  So,--
Speaker 2: Okay, so Purdue is at '58' [1958] not '68' [1968]?  '58' [1958]?
Speaker 1: '58' [1958].
Speaker 2: And, then Minnesota--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: at '59' [1959].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, if I said '68' [1968], I'm going to fast in trying to get as much as I can in here.  And, when I got to Minnesota, they said, "You're not a graduate of Minnesota", they said, "it would take--says "A graduate would--he could get his Master's in two years."  But, a non-graduate it'll be three years.  I told 'em, I had only one year.  I took eighteen hours of mathematics in the field of Curriculum and Instruction in Math.  And, I spent an extra summer there, so it was a full twelve months.  I got my Master's in 1960.  And, packed my family up and brought 'em on back home.  We were in a--we, we didn't see much of each other.  I would study night and day while she [Geraldine Higgins Sykes] watched the kids.  We had four children at the time.  The baby wasn't born, 'cause he [Kermit A. Sykes] was born in '64' [1964].  But, I had three at that time, we had four.  The baby--the son--the big one standing behind my daughter over there, Kevin [Sykes], he was a baby at the time.  And, we--I was fortunate enough to get an apartment right on campus because I'd had difficulty even in Minnesota as liberal as they claim to be.  I found lodging.  One of the most wretched things I found there, was when I went to, as a--not more than two or three blocks from the University campus, this house was for rent.  And, I went and applied and said, "I'm a--I'm a student at the University and I'd like to-" they say "Well, we'll have to, we'll have to ask our neighbors whether you can-" and I did not get the apartment.  But, I got one, as the Lord would have it, I got one closer to the University, right across the street from the football field.  And, of course, it wasn't the (unclear) Suites or anything like that, but it was, it was livable.  And, what we did, I have a friend of mine out in New York which helped me--help really clean it up and prepare for me to take my family up.  So, after I came back--
Story_ID: 74544
Speaker 1: So, you come back to Lexington [Kentucky] after you finish your degree at the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, start--and as I said first taught at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School.  And, one of the things that even then, the students were so much better than what I could see today.  The kids are just throwing their lives away so, in my opinion.  Now, the kids would protest my math class, respectfully they do it.  I didn't have any problems.  They either come in here and get this work, or you'd be marked accordingly.  So, I taught math, trigonometry and all the high maths, 'cause I was the head of the Math Department.  And, one of the things, I constantly said to them, other than what I say to youngster now in developing their mind, I told them that, "it is better for you to work hard for four years, than to spend your life a bum."  And, this was sort of a constant motivation that I was trying to put forth.  I say now, "You can't wait and expect a quality job to show up and then tell them wait 'til I go and get ready to come back.  You got to be ready to seize the opportunity when it presents itself."  And, this is what I--this is how I tried to motivate my class.
Story_ID: 74545
Speaker 1: And, while I was coaching, and all through high school, you could not eat in a restaurant here in Lexington.  The job were practically nil except menial employment.  You couldn't go outside of a certain area for, for living quarters or for a house.  And, all of that was, was part of the culture here in Lexington.  We still had outdoor privies within the city limit.  We had a whole section right, close to plant Martin [Lockhead Martin plant?] here that had outdoor privies and no sanitary sewers.  And, the city would do nothing.  We had streets--no sidewalks for students out of Smithtown, which is just about two blocks, there blocks from Dunbar High School.  I guess the kids had to walk in the middle of the street to get up there. So, I said all that to give you a setting for the climate at that time.
Story_ID: 74546
Speaker 1: So, I couldn't enter a bowling alley [in Lexington, Kentucky].  There's no facility for bowling for blacks.  So, a--two gentlemen got together and formed a corporation to build a bowling lane right up here on Georgetown Street.  Sixteen lane, Brunswick bowling house; beautiful thing.
Speaker 2: Now these are two black men?  Or--
Speaker 1: Naw, two white men.  White managers, you know.  But, and they came to me to manage this bowling lane.  And, I thought it over and I said, we'll, I initially denied, I mean, declined that.  And, I said to myself, kinda during a self-assessment, I say, "How come these kids at--you have to step out to advance in whatever area you're interested in and I say, "Now, here's an opportunity I can show them what I've been trying to explain to 'em.  'Cause they would tell me in class, I ain't never gonna use this stuff.  The only thing I'll ever be able to do is to work on the garbage truck or be a school teacher.  Is say, "Well, you don't think every much of a school teacher now."  Now, I didn't say that.  But, you know, that would be the impression you could get.  So, I say, I will show that there's more to this than what you're thinking.  While I was at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School], that's another point I hadn't made here about the social climate, a long time high profile, black minister, First Baptist Church, had tried to get the business people on Main Street to admit blacks to their establishment.  And, they said, "Well, the blacks is all satisfied."  They, they don't--they ain't even int--they don't--they ain't interested in doing anything on Main Street.  So, he says, Oh, you--says, "I'll show you what to buy."  So, he told his congregation to stop shopping on Main Street.  And they did.  Then, in 1960--'62' [1962] or there about, we had CORE who had come to Lexington to try to integrate the luncheon counters [1960].
Speaker 2: That's the Congress of Racial Equality.
Speaker 1: Congress of Racial Equality.  And, to no avail.  And, so we organized at my church, where I'm attending right now--still attending as Trustee there now, Pleasant Green [Missionary] Baptist Church, Pastored by the late W. A. Jones.  And, then there was a Reverend A. B. Lee, Albert B. Lee, Pastored a congregation over on Chestnut Street.  We got together and said, we are march--we show our discontent by marching downtown Lexington.  And, the strategy was, we would form a group at Pleasant Green Baptist Church and one at [Greater] Liberty Baptist Church where Reverent Lee was and synchronize our watches to start the March and meet downtown.  One coming up one side, and one going down the other side.  Well, when--in preparation of this march, I tried to get the teachers at Dunbar, said "Let's join this," this is a step forward.  But, I only got one to join, so--but that was alright, I could understand they, they--the culture in which you were working in.  They had a job and they didn't feel that they could, you know, participate in that way.  So, one teacher who had taught me at Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky], she taught Biology there at Kentucky State and she had--in the school system we were then--now co-workers at--Ms. Georgia Rook [ph.].  And, she and I joined this march, marched up and down downtown and that's how we got 'em to back off and open the lunch counters.
Story_ID: 74547
Speaker 1: But, in nineteen sixty, about '64 [1964] thereabout, one thing I had not mentioned in my quest for being at city hall was, the newspaper editor wrote editorials against my (unclear). I wasn't qualified, I just had returned, like I said before, with a master's [from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis].  But, he said I wasn't qualified to be in there and--
Speaker 2: This was '63 [1963] right?
Speaker 1: This is--yeah.  So, I says, "Okay, we'll see about that."  And, the paper--the owners of the paper, they had colored notes in it.  Blacks were not, were not worthy of getting news like everybody else.  They have a little column in there and he justified that saying, "Well that's a job that a black, black has."  So, she'd write a little column and put a little death notice in there and that sort of thing and that was about, that was about the stint of any news about the black community.
Speaker 2: Colored notes.
Speaker 1: Colored notes.  The only time you'd mix--if there's a, if there's a shooting or something, you'd get big headlines on that.  But, anything cultural or anything about the black trying to better himself, no kind, no news of that.  So, and he wrote this editorial saying that I wasn't qualified and he would endorse the pleasant candidates, the mayor and four commissioners.  So, he's in--he's gonna be the boss of the town so to speak and they tell the people who they gonna vote for.  That's five people.  Well, in order for me to win, I had to knock off one of these four commissioners.  So, I developed a strategy which they didn't have any idea that--at least he would--didn't think it had enough gumption to it.  I told my voters as I was organizing, I say, "Now, if you go ahead and vote for four--you have--you had the right to vote for five if you want.  But, every time you vote for a commissioner, you are diminishing my chances by taking a vote, all you're doing is keeping the vote int- level."  We had only about 20 percent of the electorate, were black.  So, I say, "The only way we gonna make an entry here is, I get all the--a majority of registered voters to vote--go in there and pull one lever and come on out.  And, to make a long story short, it was successful.  My number was D25 and got to the place where, people, all the people would do is say, "D25," and any time they meet on the street, anywhere, "D25."  And, I knocked off one of the, one of the boss man's pet project people.
Story_ID: 74548
Speaker 1: Alright, then after I got in [to the Lexington, Kentucky city council], I had sidewalks put over, I had my, I had the grant writers, write for grants from the Federal Government and we put in sewers and assisted about paying and helping the people who could not pay for it, who was--wasn't, they wasn't against improvement, it's just they weren't financially able to handle it.  So, we got a grant and put sanitary sewers there.  Another area of town, Speigle Heights, had curbs and sidewalks and sewers put in over there.  So, that is the activity and of course, I would get, get press on that.  Then in 1963, I had to re-run--run again.  So, then they came to me to run with them again.
Speaker 2: You were elected in '63' [1963] so, the next time you ran was when?
Speaker 1: '65' [1965].
Speaker 2: '65' [1965] okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 74549
Speaker 1: I declined to join the mayor [of Lexington, Kentucky] and his group as a group.  I said I was gonna run independent [in 1965].  And, I was re-elected the greater majority because I had shown myself to be what I said I was gonna be.  I was gonna work on problems of the whole community.  And, that meant where, where the whites and whatever color.  And, I had gained many more votes from the white community then I had gotten initially.  So, I came back, I think I, I believe I got about 7,000 votes or so.  I came in second, second or third place.  In 1967 to--I decided I would, would join the team with Mayor [Charles] Wylie as the mayoral candidate.  I joined that team and I explained to the--to my electorate that in order to advance the cause, we had to--it wasn't our selling out by joining, I was going to be a greater force to get more, get more cooperation to get things done that need to be done.  And, I won.  I was the top vote getter.  And, became mayor pro-tem.
Speaker 2: Is that '67' [1967]?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  So, then I had to run again when we had a break in social (unclear) in the electorate system, electoral system.  We had a person who had been commissioner all along with me, by the name of Tom Underwood.  And we had to, in order to raise some finances to do all the projects, sewers and things like that, we put on a sewer service charge.  And, he campaigned that was a tax; that we were taxing the people.  No, it was a service, it was a service charge.  It paid for only the amount of sewerage that ran through.  But, he built his campaign on that.  Telling the people that when he--if they elect him, he would, and his group--he had a coalition working with him, that they told the people that if you vote for me, I'll remove the service--the sewer service charge.  We tempted to tell the people frankly that this was not--it was not possible to have a budget to take care of the needs of the City without having proper service charges to go along with it.  But, they bought into his propaganda.  And, that was the worst two years.  Obviously--I was the only one re-elected.  And, he had two of his men elected with him.  Two people who, he hadn't mold but two of them.  So, he got--he became a majority although he wasn't the mayor.  So, it's Mayor Wylie and I against three.  So, everything that he wanted done, he was in charge.  You--he disrupted our Civil Service by changing the laws on Civil Service.  Where he would put a crony in above them and that's--all of these things.  Out of all our moving, the road and equipment became in disrepair.  At one time, we had a police car's wheel (unclear).  And, the people just had seen what--seen the mistake in what they had done.
Story_ID: 74550
Speaker 1: And, [H.] Foster Pettit, a local attorney, got four, four men in a group and said, "We gonna run and put the city [Lexington, Kentucky] back in order," if the people have seen the error of their way.  And, he ran and won as Mayor of Lexington [1972].  I had put my name in again, I said, "I had been on for four, four terms [1963-1971], it's time for me to move on and maybe give some other youngster and a chance at--I wasn't just a fixture there, to run and it happened another black ran in my place and won on the council.  But, I ran for mayor and Tom Underwood ran for mayor and Foster Pettit.  So, it was a three man primary.  And, we both defeated Tom Underwood, just got rid of him all together.  People voted us, and we got to go into a runoff and I lost in the Mayor's race by 4,000.  The final, which was good.
Story_ID: 74551
Speaker 1: But, in the meantime, about that same time after that administration [H. Foster Pettit] starts going [1971], things were such, in such tight straights, they needed to talk about, start talking about merging the government [the City of Lexington, Kentucky and Fayette County].  Like you said, the type of government we have right now.  We had a well-known civic man by the name of Penrose Ecton, was the chairman of The Committees to Study Good Government.  And, he--and the Committee chose me as vice-chairman; The Committee of Good Government.  We've made a study of the county and city and made our recommendation.  Wrote a Charter, of how it would work, at this present Charter we have now.  Fifteen commission--twelve of 'em in districts and three at large and a mayor.  That's what we have now.  And, we wrote the Charter, it's been tampered with since that but, no one has raised a cry about that.  We've, we thought it prudent to have the Charter, the CEO to be responsible for the Council.  And, I think the next mayor after the merged government, did some lobbing in legislation and got it change where the mayor had the power to appoint the CEO instead, and that's where we are now.  The mayor will be appointing instead of the council.  But, it was our best thought at the time we wrote the Charter was that that would be the--that would balance the legislative and--
Speaker 2: The CEO would be like the City Manager, or something?
Speaker 1: Yes.  It would be the city manager, the chief administrative officer, which handles all of the day-to-day activities, the employees, or what have you.  'Cause I served has a--if I might just through this out--after, after the--this had to go to the vote--we had to put this to the voters and the voters voted on it and it passes overwhelmingly for the new government to begin in 1974.  So, in the meantime, there was city manager problem that--for the last administration and the city manager saw the handwriting on the wall and left town.  They appointed me--the new administration of Foster Pettit.  The man who had beaten me, appointed me as the acting city manager for the remaining term of the election city government.
Speaker 2: Oaky, so that's in '60'?
Speaker 1: That was in '60'--it happened about in '62' [1962].  About 15 months prior to '74'.  There was about 15 month's left--
Speaker 2: '72' [1972].
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1972.
Story_ID: 74552
Speaker 1: And, I was the city manager [of Lexington, Kentucky Urban City Government in 1972].  And, then in the new government there had to be another election for the mayor and the 15 councilmen.  New--a whole new slate of people.  [H.] Foster Pettit won again to head the Metropolitan Government. And, then they appointment me the Chief Administration--Acting Chief Administrative Officer.  And, I had charge of smooth--making a smooth transition from, from city government and county government to Urban County Government.  The Civil Services were different.  I had to make a--to make a transition to keep every--to keep both the county and city employees in harmony.  We had to do it in such a way that it wouldn't be a protest and equalize the--some of the city employees had greater salaries than their counterpart in county government.  We had better fire protection in the city.  Better police protection in the--police department small in the county.  So, we were able to work through that by making the fire chief of the county, assistant chief to the fire chief in the city.  So, it all worked out smooth in a harmonious way.  They brought the policeman in county in line with the, with the--I was responsible for--until all of that came.  Then, they wanted to go out and get a permanent chief administrative officer.  And, they passed an ordinance that I would not be allowed to apply for this job.  I've done all this, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals told them that was, that was discriminatory and was not--would not be allowed.  So, to try to save face, they did say I could apply, but I think the mind was already made up, the handwriting was on--if they had already passed that I couldn't even apply, how much chance would I have by them choosing me as chief administrative officer.  They're saying, they want a professional man.  I say, "well what have I've been all this time?  That whole time I've been serving for eight years on the council, acting city manager and chief administrative officer up to this point.  And, the budget has never been in the red."  I was hands on--and then they went out a chose a man from New Orleans [Louisiana], chief administrative officer and then put him under me to learn the ropes (laughter).  How much sense does that make, but anyway--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that happens often.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, he lasted about a year so forth so.  But that's, that's just a part of the community we live in.
Story_ID: 74553
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty eight [1968] was about the year that you started the Urban League, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I started working on it back in about in '64' [1964] or '5' [1965], (unclear) fundraising.  And, the interesting thing about, about that is paper was against that also.  The late Whitney Young [Jr.], Director of the National Urban League was invited by University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky], under the administration of Dr. [John Wieland] Oswald.  And, he had spoken and extollen [extolled] the need for an Urban League in Lexington.  So, the paper did have coverage of that and editor of the [Lexington] Leader who, the late Fred Wachs agreed to meet with Whitney Young, sit down at breakfast after the University of Kentucky speech that he made.
Speaker 1: Now, Whitney Young was from Kentucky too, right?
Speaker 2: Whitney Young, yes.
Speaker 1: Originally from Kentucky?
Speaker 2: He's originally from Kentucky.  His father is buried right over here in Greenwood-Cove Haven Cemetery [Lexington, Kentucky].  And, when he--when Whitney passed, he was brought here and buried next to his father, but his wife later had his body resumed [sic, exhumed] to take back to New York.  But, yes, he was--his father Whitney Young, Sr., was the matriarch [sic, patriarch] of Lincoln Ridge.  It was up there in Shelby County [Kentucky], between here and Louisville [Kentucky].  Where (telephone ringing) a community which not, which did not have a school (telephone ringing) for blacks with farm-- sent to Lincoln Ridge and tuition was paid.  That's how the money was funded into Lincoln Ridge for--to send the black students to Lincoln Ridge and these small counties which didn't have a high school for blacks.  And, Whitney Young was the head master of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sr.
Speaker 1: So, after Whitney Young, Jr. spoke here and there was a movement to set up an Urban League (simultaneously)
Speaker 2: The late Fred Wachs said that, I'm too, "I'm too old to change, said, maybe this would be a good for the new generations."  I don't know, but he say the backhandly and endorsed it.  So, they set about a way to raise funds to organize an Urban League here.  I was made chairman of the fundraising committee.  I enlisted the help of--through Dr. Oswald of the University of Kentucky and his--and the University's fundraising skills and we talked to the Community Chest about funding the Urban League.  And, they told us that we'd have to operate for two, for at least a year before we will be eligible to be funded by the Community Chest.
Story_ID: 74554
Speaker 1: We set a goal of $25,000 that had to be raised to just fund, just to establish an office with the director and secretary, at that time.  And, we were given--we set it, trying to make a deadline for six months and I raised the $25,000 or better about, in about three months.  And, then I made the application with the National Urban League to be chartered by the National Urban League.  Met in 1968 in Indianapolis [Indiana] at the Urban League meeting with Whitney Young, Jr., and we were granted a Charter by the National Urban League in 1968.  And, we setup office here and our first director was Walter Brown.  And, [HM Porter] P.G. Peeples was hired as an aide and we had a secretary and that was the office staff at that time.  Walter, Walter, Walter Brown moved on it was about a, about a year.  He had not cultivated a great rapport with the community anyway.  So, what we said that--P.G. Peeples, we hired P.G. Peeples as the director.  And, even as we speak, he is still director and has expanded greatly since, since that initial time.  The--many of the horse farms and other people who give to United Way, gave certain--made certain gifts for the Urban League.  IBM, who had just, who had come to town in the late '50's [1950's] gave, initially gave $5,000.  That was a big boost to get it started and get publicity it was necessary to have others give.  I have some pictures of local clubs made up of American Americans who presented a check (unclear), the churches and all that.  I got full cooperation and it's just really a pleasure to work in that kinda environment.  And, then see the corporations (unclear) come in there.
Story_ID: 74555
Speaker 1: Okay sir, now what was some of the major issues that the Urban League [of Lexington-Fayette County] worked on?
Speaker 2: Major issues was, employment, housing, education, and public accommodations.  And, we had a forerunner to the Urban League, we had what was called a Committee on Religion and Human Rights.  And, that made me chairman of that committee.  And, we had a people from all walks of life as members of that committee.  So, they was an outgrowth of this committee and many, many white friends who worked for me in my first interest into politics to be elected [in 1963].  And, the University of Kentucky [Frankfort, Kentucky] had a young group, University Students for Sykes and that way--the impression which I had developed through my working with, in a harmonious way with people of all races.  Then, once, once the office got started, as I just said, that--those were the main issues and that was those same issues we were working on as the Committee on Religion and Human Rights.  That march that I talked about that went down one side of the street and went in town, they opened doors there.  And, many of the things that might be attributed to having started an Urban Leagues was, when I was in City Hall, a black couldn't get an apartment anywhere because they get denied, turned away.  Well, I used my position as commissioner to invite all the apartment owners, there were just a few who owned all the major apartments, invite them into City Hall for a conference.  And, I told them of the displeasure of blacks and the treatment they were getting.  And, asked them if they wanted to be responsible for disruption of our city from people who were tire of being treated as second class citizens.  And, then I posed a question to them.  They--I said, "What do you have against renting to blacks?"  Well, they say, "We rent to black, we relinquish all of our white customers."  I said, "Okay, fine."  Where would you--the people leave if all of you open your doors and all of your people vacated, where would they have to live?  And, that kinda got their attention, started looking at each other.  I say, "Now, Jimmy you all can make this a smooth transition.  It may become rough beyond what I can handle."  I say, "I suggest that you--I'm not even gonna set the time, I say, "you among your--it was about four of them out there, they had four major people there.  They say, we will--they chose two weeks to say--just to make an open announcement, no fanfare, just to (unclear) is over.  And, it went like clockwork, no problems at the open house.
Speaker 1: So, nothing happened?
Speaker 2: Nothing happened.
Speaker 1: And, all that fear.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All those years.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Well, of course, I think the realization that, you know, the fear that--fear tactic used since they've--I'm a lose my cut--my tenants if they don't want to be in--stay in the same building with whites.  I had the same problem with the Fire Department had--not had a black until I raised that issue as a councilman.  I got the first black appointed to the Fire Department.  Young man by the name of Drake.  Who's gone all the way through down and retired from the Fire Department.
Story_ID: 74556
Speaker 1: When I went into City Hall [Lexington, Kentucky], there were no black in the Police Force above a lieutenant.  No, above a sergeant.  And, I raised that issue and they said that (telephone ringing) Sergeant [Jim] Perkins was qualified but he didn't get the job (telephone ringing).  They had people who had better--scored high on the exam. So, I told them that--now here's a man we have loaned out as an undercover man for other police units in other states, and if he's smart enough to go out there and do that, he can handle anything we got here in City Hall.  I say, we've got to expand our police force anyway.  I say, you're at three men that passed the exam, let's create a sergeancy and that'll be no one to go in it but Perkins, 'cause he's already passed the exam.  That's how he (unclear) and then he moved to Lieutenant to Captain before his retirement.  And, then all the other backs have come on as we speak.  We have a black Chief of Policeman now and that--
Speaker 2: What his name?
Speaker 1: [Anthany] Beatty.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Let's pause for one second.
Story_ID: 74557
Speaker 1: Back to what we were talking about, though.  We were talking about fair housing in Kentucky and the Urban League [of Lexington-Fayette County], you were mentioning how that came to be.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, the Kentucky Junior Assembly under the leadership of Governor [Edward T.] Ed Breathitt, was discussing passing over a housing law for all the State of Kentucky.  And, as the city commissioners, the former governor, which we were under, we didn't have the thought to pass an open housing law here in Lexington.  But, the county [Fayette County, Kentucky] judge did.  The county--that's the way the char--the charter is setup.  He could.  But, all I--what I did, I raised the issue of us, as city commissioners, just to sorta set the tone to pass a resolution encouraging our good wishes on general assembly to go forward.  They said, we--they gave all kinda reasons for not doing it.  We don't have the--I said, we not--all we doing is just encouraging the legislatures, it's time to move on with the business of the state.  And, I said, "And, I'm not leaving this room until we make a decision on this."  Well, we had our set meetings every Thursday at 11:00.  Well, about 12:00 we were still in that room because I would not budge.  Well, somebody got the bright idea, and threw me a curve.  Says, "Well, we got one more meeting before the general election--the general assembly has to vote on this.  We can--we got all week to get our resolution together.  And, we'll come back next week and we'll--we can get that right on down to the governor's office."  Well, come next Thursday, I showed up and I was the only one, of the mayor--and every commissioner was absent.  Didn't show up.
Speaker 1: So, no decision could be made?
Speaker 2: No decision could be made.  So, I went down and called the news--and had a news conference.  And, I said something to the effect that, I say, "It is unthinkable that the people who swore to work for the City of Lexington all had an emergency at the same time" and I put emphasis on that.  And, headlines came out, and news came out reporting this thing and, so, those who were responsible were quite sheepish walking around from that point on.  I had to--if you can call it smooth, anything smooth, smooth sailing when I had made some suggestions, they sat down and listened like the people are supposed to listen.  Sit down and discuss it like, like civilized people and come out with a decision.  You don't have to always agree but at least we can respect the other man's opinion.  And, through that we were able to move forward.

Speaker 1: Now, you had discussions with Adolph Rupp about the University of Kentucky [Frankfort, Kentucky] basketball team?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  The most popular high school graduate student at the time played at Seneca High School at--in Louisville [Kentucky].  George Unseld and Westley Unseld; brothers.  George was an older brother and Westley just had come out of high school as the top rated player and I tried to talk Rupp into just surveying the possibility of offering him a scholarship to come play.  He'd be a good candidate for--to break the color barrier on the University of Kentucky.  And, Coach Rupp told me point blank that he was not ready to hire any--bring any blacks to his team.  He usually--
Speaker 1: What word did her use?  I'm just interested in what word he might have used.  He didn't say blacks, did he?  (Simultaneously) Do you remember what he said?
Speaker 2: He said, "I'm not ready to use any colored boys on our team."  He says, "and I will not be responsible for him--taking him into Mississippi where you don't know who's in the audience with a gun."  That's the other thing.  And, I won't be responsible for--
Speaker 1: So, the implication is those state--Mississippi say is more dangerous than Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Mississippi and Alabama.  So, I says, "Okay."  Well, but the pressure at the Urban League came and they started making contacts about getting--make the University more representative of the state, half black.  Well, the football team had went and recruited two guys [in 1966].  Nate Northington out of Louisville [Kentucky] and Greg Page out of--from the mountains someplace.  And, that part of integration came but had a strange twist.  Greg got injured in training and died [1967].
Speaker 1: And, he died?  Really?
Speaker 2: And, of course, it was concerns about this happened to a black.
Speaker 1: What happened to him?
Speaker 2: Well, he had an (telephone ringing) aneurism of some sort.  It-- It was fully investigated and there were no, there was no indication that anybody had done anything out of the way other than just a regularly.  So, the University rattled around and Nate played and then that went on.
Story_ID: 74559
Speaker 1: And, of course, Urban League wanna know what, what the basketball team's gonna do.  And, Coach [Adolph] Rupp had about a year left before he reached retirement; mandatory retirement.  And, so he went to--had a boy by the name of--
Speaker 2: Is that Tom Payne?
Speaker 1: Tom Payne out of Sene--not Seneca.  One of the high schools in Louisville and they talked to him and they gave him a scholarship to come to Kentucky.  And, he played several years and went pro.  He was one of the early--he was one of those who's eligible to go as early entry into the NBA.  And, from that point on, Coach Rupp retired.  And, his assistant, Joe B. Hall took over the reins and he recruited several, not necessary several, [Dirk] Minniefield who played ball at one of the white high schools here at Lafayette.  He was recruited to play for the University.  Jack Givens, who was there when the University of Kentucky won the championship held in St. Louis [1978] when Jack Givens scored 44 points [sic, 41] and they beat [University of] Arkansas [sic, Givens scored 41 points when they beat Duke University in the finals].  Well, he now--that coach was later--he's at Oklahoma State [University] right now.  He was later--he followed Joe Hall when Joe Hall retired.  He came to Kentucky for several years before he went on, moved on.  I don't, I don't fully recall exactly what the terminal was, but anyway there's something not quite right and (unclear) and all.  As Eddie Sutton--they had these great boys at Arkansas, Moncrief--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, Sidney Moncrief, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, [Ron] Brewer.  And, there were three of 'em.  They were about all about 6'4 and they had quite a team.  They gave--they pushed Kentucky right down for a while, but Kentucky were (unclear) and won the championship.  I was watching that game, me and my wife [Geraldine Higgins Sykes] and I.  And, after that of course you know, came Rick Pitino.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a lot of success under him and then--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And his assistant, [Orlando] "Tubby" Smith.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 74560
Speaker 1: Now, I'm never asked---been able to ask him, but how did he get the name "Tubby"?  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Well, he's from a family of about, I don't want nobody to jump on me about saying I'm exaggerating but maybe 16, 17 children.  I'm not sure, don't, don't hold me to that.  But, they say that down the room, left was the tub and that's where "Tubby" would crawl under and go to sleep (laughter) and the name "Tubby" followed him (laughter).  His name is Orlando.
Speaker 1: (unclear) 'cause he's not fat or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.  He's not, he's not fat at all.  Orlando "Tubby" Smith.  As a matter of fact, he came to visit me when he first came, or I invited him really, I told him I had visited [Adolph] Rupp and was interesting seeing a smooth transition and I invited "Tubby" out and we sat in the living room here and had a good conversation.  I wish him success on his (unclear) this year.  And, then after, he got--after Kentucky had success under "Tino," someone came calling on "Tubby" to coach for them.
Speaker 1: But, they--it hasn't been easy for him, has it?  Because, he gets threats (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You see there are those people, you don't know, it's hard to explain please of that mentality.  The man went out and won third place in the (unclear) Tournament.  And, some person got on this call-in show and says, "The University of Kentucky need to get rid of 'Tubby.'"  He ain't--of course, he had just come off of wining third place by beating another team rated by seven in the country, Gonzaga [University in Spokane, Washington].  You know, how do you figure this?  What kind of mentality you coming out of with a statement like that.  Is it just bigoty, bigot?
Speaker 1: Bigotry?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It sound like it.
Story_ID: 74561
Speaker 1: We were just talking about the--some of the difficulties that [Orlando] "Tubby" Smith has had as coach, not as a coach but as a--trying to, I guess, be a black coach of this traditional, you know--
Speaker 2: Flagship University.  Yes, yes.  Well, the man, I don't know, I guess one ingredient was the fact that he came in and he won his first year, you know, so where do you, where do you go (laughter) you reach prefect--
Speaker 1: He won the NCAA College Championship his first year as coach.
Speaker 2: His first year as coach.  He had been successful at Tulsa and had gone to University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] and had been successful there.  And, Rick Pitino decided to move on to the Pros.  C. M. Newton went (unclear) and they got permission from the University of Georgia to interview "Tubby" for the top job.  They came in and met with the Athletic Board, who incidentally [HM] Coach [Sanford T.] Roach is a member, and Coach Roach made the motion that we hire him as a coach and was readily seconded and unanimously passed.  I was there when this happened  And, he came in [in 1997], he came in like I said and did a marvelous job.  Of course, with all of that, it only intended to put more pressure on, with the Olympics going on, he was getting calls to participate there.  He kind of, might have, delegated a lot of authority for recruiting from other people.  Might not have--that could have had something to do with some of the recruits that didn't work out.  But, he had done a marvelous job, he recruited the top high school player out of Indiana and the boy died of a seizure in his last game up in, up there in Indiana.  So, but, they still blaming him, says he can't recruit.  He lost another top boy during that time who was out of Wisconsin at the same time.  He turned out to not to be the character they needed here.  He'd get in trouble there, so that didn't pan out.  But, then in the last year [2001], he had a, just a horrendous disruption.  Every time you look up, one of the finest players, I say, one of the finest players that's on the team right now, I said one now, is Finch.  Finch came in as a, not highly recruited as a national product, but he was a good ball player from right, I believe it's, is it Decatur [sic, Columbus], Georgia.  But anyway, it's very close to Atlanta.  Came in and got his chance to get on floor and was a hard nose player all the way.  Did a fine job.
Story_ID: 74562
Speaker 1: Now, you--when you--after you started an Urban League [of Lexington-Fayette County], you said you worked for the State of Kentucky as an Equal Opportunity Officer?  (Simultaneously)
Speaker 2: No.  I was, I was hired at Kentucky to head up the Personnel Department in the Department of Natural Resources.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the Personnel Director and I held that position until such time the government changed.  It was really political.  And, they brought in new person, who wanted to restructure the Personnel Department there.  So, I went--I applied to go to the Finance Cabinet.  And, I went to the Finance Cabinet and served in the Department of Compli--Contract Compliance.  And, the state had a, had a policy that, any person doing business with the state in the amount $250,000 or more, had to respond to the Affirmative Action Program and have minority participation in their workforce.  And, I had responsibility of monitoring all of that.  As a matter of fact, the new Dunbar High School, we talked about the old Dunbar and there's a new, now that look like a college campus, well the state participated in that project to the tune of thirty-five million dollars.  I would come to Frankfort and check the contactors and make sure that they were--had enough participation in building the new Dunbar.  They built a big prison up in the, up in the eastern part of the county.  I think it was another $35 million project.  I would drive all the way up through there and, you don't have too many people going in these mountains, but I'd go and check on that job.  And, I'd go out to Magoffin County.  And, we had work done at the Eddyville State Prison [Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: Is that Western Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Western Kentucky.  I'd go and monitor those.  It's all over--wherever the, wherever the work was being done.  If it's more than $250,000 contract involved, I was handling that.
Story_ID: 74563
Speaker 1: And, you did that [State of Kentucky Department of Contract Compliance] until about 1997, right?
Speaker 2: I, no, I retired from State Government in 1993.
Speaker 1: '93' [1993].
Speaker 2: '92' [1992].  '92' [1992].  (unclear) died in '93' [1993], didn't he?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I retired in 1992 and I've been living the life of ease.  I'm just kidding (laughter)
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: But, I've--I work with my church.  I'm a trustee at Pleasant Green Baptist Church.  We have a ten unit apartment, I manage that for the church.  I--every Saturday that I'm in town, we have a tutoring program for any kid in the school system who's having trouble with any subject.  We invite them to come spend a couple hours with us on Saturday.  And, every Saturday I'm in town, I tutor in Mathematics at Pleasant Green Baptist Church.  My wife [Geraldine Higgins Sykes] works in the program also.  I'm just jumping around here a bit, you stop me if --
Story_ID: 74564
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's--so you're retired right now but so I wanna ask you, what are your hope and concerns for the black community now at the moment?
Speaker 2: I hope they, I hope from a--as a revitalization in the school system, the young people are being passed over and I'm not here to point fingers at any one group.  I think there's a joint responsibility here; the home, parents, and teachers.  We do have evidence that the teachers who would care less about their interest in salary.  And, I don't want to go too far with that because there's a lot of good teachers out there, but they just don't--can't handle the kids.  The kids think that the world owes them something and they do not have cooperation from the home.  And, it's just a, it's just an impossibility that you get anything concrete and their live is being washed down the drain.  So, for the black community, I--they're in the process of looking for a new superintendent.  Their working under, have an eminent, have a superintendent now who is--came out of a small system and he's doing, doing a good job, but I think that they need to get a superintendent who's going to be more demanding in terms of getting train--having seminars for the teachers; how to deal with people who are not of the same race.  And, understand a bit of the culture.  And, on the other side of the fence, have the parents being involved with their children with the school; who the teacher is and what they doing, and having these conferences.  That, to me is one of the big drawbacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 74565
Speaker 1: And, of course, we just had an election here [Lexington, Kentucky] and we have a new mayor.  And, Teresa Isaac won about 51 percent margin, I mean won about 51 percent (telephone ringing) of the vote.  And, she'll have the responsibility of running (telephone ringing) the city.  There's a big--she ran on a-- One of the platforms she ran on was purchase of the Kentucky [American] Water Company.  And the Kentucky American Water Company said, "It's not for sale," which is starting out on a lie.  They offered to sale to a German Company.  It's already offered for sale, but they--when the City started talking about purchasing, they said, that, they said it wasn't for sale.  Well, the city has the power of eminent domain and they can, they can purchase it at, at face value.  Now, the Kentucky Water Company is RWE, which is a German Company.  It immediately jump out and says--starts putting out signs, "No Government Takeover."  Have some bimbo on television, "If it ain't broke, why fix it?"  The city never did say anything about fixing anything.  At--that's the kinda scare tactics their using.  The city said, we will pay the value of the Water Company.  So, they hired a consultant to give them the--what the Water Company is worth.  Now, I don't know the outcome of that or how it will be.  But, it's my, my contention, and I may not even live to see--long enough to see it happen, but I am all for the purchase of the Water Company.  And, they scare tactic they're using, saying the city don't have the expertise to run this-government can't run a water company.  Well, sure we've got enough people, enough intelligence to run a city of this size with million dollar, millions of dollars budgets to hire a competent person who's been trained in water systems.
Story_ID: 74566
Speaker 1: And, they're saying that the taxpayers [of Lexington, Kentucky] going to be paying all this money out.  Well, the bonds--the truth is told, which it won't be from that side of the fence, this water company will be bought by bonds.  Lower interest bonds.  No interest is paid on them.  The revenue that comes from water company customers, will pay off the bonds over a number of years.  The University of Louisville [Kentucky] owns its water company, 'course it's larger than Lexington, but they just returned something like $107 billion--$107, no $17 million I believe, I may be wrong on that, but it's a good, good piece of revenue being returned for the city to use for its employees, to beef up its police force or whatever.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They--that's how lucrative it is.  It's a German owned company [RWE].  It comes down to whether or not you would have local ownership or someone over in Germany taking the revenue over there, paying big salaries over there.  Years ago, the coal companies went in and bought them minerals rights to mine coal out of Kentucky.  Strip mining and so forth and then went on back, took all that money and made mill--paid millionaire salaries to board members and so forth.  And, Eastern Kentucky is one of the, one of the areas of Kentucky that's in dire straits.  Now, that--they've taking out the resources and water is not a commodity; water is a resource.  The good Lord made man and the one thing man cannot live without, is water.  Water is a resource.  And, it's not to be battered around and try to get the--drain the citizens with big water rates to take out of the community.  Keep it in the community and serve your own people.  That's what government is all about.
Story_ID: 74567
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask you, out of being involved in so many different things, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I see my legacy as trying to make a difference when times were really, really tough and being a part of a transition to a better life of all the citizens.  And, of course, this water [Kentucky American Water] thing is one which fits into that category.  I would say a legacy, whether it's a legacy of mine or whatever government  entity, if they can put--if they would--can get the people who is supposed to be serving and gonna be taking an oath here (telephone ringing) in a few in--next month, and they gonna be working in the best interest (telephone ringing) of the citizens.  I can see no better thing to have a water company which is gonna have resources that's gonna remain in the community and be used to upgrade the water system and even maybe the locks on the Kentucky River, in future times.  This not gonna happen overnight.  It's just that--I don't mean just to say this as a done deal, you know, type thing.
Story_ID: 74568
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Well, with the water and going all the way back to you being the first black person on the [Lexington, Kentucky] City Council and trying to get blacks for the--jobs for the blacks people in government and establishing the [Lexington chapter of the National] Urban League and so many other things you've done, I mean, this is a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be one--remembered as one who cared about someone other than himself.  Well, that's it. I-
Story_ID: 74569
Speaker 1: Did you father get chance to see you--did your parents get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: No.  My father [Pinkie Kirk Sykes], I lost my father in 1954--'50' [1950], yeah '54' [1954].  He was fifty-six years old.  I was on the road with the [Harlem] Globetrotters somewhere in Arkansas when he died.  And, I flew--came to Memphis [Tennessee] and flew out of Memphis to go home to his funeral.  So, (excuse me) he lived long enough to see me finish, finish school and play with the Globetrotters before, yeah.  But, my mother [Marie Hall Sykes] she lived 'til 1992.  She was ninety-two years old.  She was born in 1990, I mean 1900 and passed away in 1992 at age ninety-two.  So, she's been gone from here about eight years.
Speaker 1: And, you've got like, you've got children; five children?
Speaker 2: I have five children.  Four boys and one girl.
Speaker 1: You've got some twin grandchildren.  (Unclear)
Speaker 2: and my youngest son (Simultaneously)

Speaker 2: Right.  My wife is a twin.  She--Geraldine and Pauline Higgins.  They were born October 16th.  My--our youngest son has twins born October the 16th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of course, my sis--my wife has lost her sister, her twin sister, who passed away in 1998 and we're in 2002, so she's been gone about four years.
