Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family first, and then your father's [Leo Conley] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother is Emma, E-M-M-A, Ruth, R-U-T-H, Conley, C-O-N-L-E-Y [Emma Slaughter Conley].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is July 15th, 1927.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about your mother's ancestors?  How far back can you trace her side of the family?
Speaker 2: I know a little bit about my great-grandmother and great-grandfather.  Just very little.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us a little bit about 'em.
Speaker 2: My great, my great-grandmother was Lina Taylor and her husband was Sidney [Sidney Taylor (ph.)].
Speaker 1: And what did they do?
Speaker 2: They were--what, what I know about them is that they lived on a small farm over in a place called Lovejoy, Illinois.  Lovejoy, Brooklyn, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, Lovejoy, Brooklyn?  Is there a hyphen between them?
Speaker 2: They are little towns that are very close to each other (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Brooklyn is probably the more prominent one that--where I know they lived, Brooklyn, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Was Lovejoy, Illinois a name for Elijah Lovejoy?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is the same.
Speaker 1: That's that white abolitionist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, abolitionist.
Speaker 1: Whose paper was--
Speaker 2: Whose, whose newspaper was destroyed several times.  And he was actually run out of St. Louis.  He had a newspaper here.  Run out of St. Louis mostly for his abolitionist and, and free, free--his right to free press, right of free press.  But also because he was involved with abolition in general.  Thought that was just not the right thing to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there a story behind your great-grandmother and great-grandfather living in a town that's named after an abolitionist?
Speaker 2: I'm not aware that there's a connection.  I think that they--that they just came up from the South and ended up there as black people often did.  Came south [sic. north] because some other family member was living there and that's where they settled.  I don't know that there's a connection at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So there, are there any stories about life in Lovejoy that, that are passed down?
Speaker 2: No, I, I really don't remember anything.  We didn't talk a lot about--my mother even didn't know a lot about their life in, in Illinois.  I knew my--got to know my grandparent--great-grandparents more when they moved to--when my grandfa- great-grandfather passed and my great-grandmother moved in to live with my grandmother [Mary Taylor Slaughter] here in St. Louis.  And that's when I got to know her.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was she like and what did she tell you?
Speaker 2: She was a wonderful spirit.  A very petite woman who was very tough.  And I had the impression from her, I was very little, but I had the impression from her that she could handle herself well.  She's very quiet, but when she spoke, you listened.  She did not have sisters and brothers that I recall.  So I get the impression that she was used, very accustomed to having to fend for herself.
Story_ID: 544762
Speaker 1: Now what about your grandparents?  Did they, did they--were they the first generation on your mother's side to move to St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I think they were.  They--and I was a little bit older when I knew them.  I think I was in elementary school [Waring Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] when I started to understand the relationships of, of, of parenting and parents and, and ancestors.  And I got to spend more time with them.  They lived very close to the school that I attended as a, as a, as a youngster.  In fact, we could walk from their house to the school.  Also I just spent a lot more time with them.  My grandmother worked--she was--my grandmother was born in Durant, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Dugrant?
Speaker 2: Du- Durant, D-U-R-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: Durant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we always said Durant is what she always said.
Speaker 1: Durant, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Durant, Mississippi.  She and my grandfather got married, they came to St. Louis.  He--she, my grandmother was a twin.  But the, the, the twin, the sibling had passed when she was--at birth I believe.  My grandfather I understand was an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That, that's unusual for those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, small families, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Grandparents usually have a lot of brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: That's true, and neither of them did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What I know about their departure, my grandfather's departure from Durant was that he was a pretty robust man, young man.  Had an altercation, if you will, with a, another white man.  And his mother felt threatened, felt he was threatened, and had him leave Mississippi for his safety.  So he ended up here in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: About, 'bout what year was that do you think?  This is your grandfather, so--
Speaker 2: I guess it would have been early '30s [1930s].  Probably I, I just don't remember the dates.
Speaker 1: Was after your, your mother [Emma Slaughter Conley] was born?
Speaker 2: It was before my mother was born.  I'm sorry.  It was before my mother was born, so it would have been much, much earlier than that, I'm sorry, and I just don't remember the dates.
Speaker 1: Maybe in 1910 or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm thinking--probably yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to remember actually when my grandfather was born and I just don't remember offhand.  I used to have it written down.
Speaker 1: If your mother was born in '23 [1923].
Speaker 2: My mother was born in '27 [1927].
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven [1927], okay.
Speaker 2: And I think, I think it would have been early teens [1910s], yeah.  Yeah, 'cause my, my, my grandmother was young when she was born, so yeah.
Speaker 1: That sounds about right. Nineteen teens [1910s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry.  I just don't remember the dates, early teens [1910s], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that was a hot time for conflict.  I mean a lot of lynchings in the South in those days.
Speaker 2: And I think that is exactly what his, his mother was fearful of.  He was a young man who was not going to be quiet.  Was not going to bow down and she could see it brewing with that incident and I think she said, "You gotta go because you're not gonna be long for this world if, if you don't."
Speaker 1: So are there any details about the stories that are passed down above and beyond what you just told us?
Speaker 2: Just basically that.  That, that you know he, he got basically ran out of Mississippi.  If he was gonna be safe, he'd better leave.  And so his mother made sure that he got out of there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so he came to St. Louis?
Speaker 2: He came to St. Louis, he and my grandmother.  Raised a family.
Speaker 1: Now what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was Johnnie, J-O-H-N-N-I-E, Slaughter, S-L-A-U-G-H-T-E-R [Johnnie Slaughter].
Speaker 1: And your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Mary Willie [Mary Taylor Slaughter].  Taylor was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right so now what did they do for a living when they got here?
Speaker 2: My grandfather as, as early as I can remember, worked for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  And my grandmother was a, a dome- well I guess a, a hotel domestic.  She worked at a--as a maid in a hotel, in hotels.  And that's all that I--that's the only (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any specific one here in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: The Melbourne [Melbourne Hotel, St. Louis, Missouri] is where she worked for many, many years.  I think it eventually closed.  I can remember them talking about my grandmother having other jobs as a, a maid at different other hotels.  But that seemed to be pretty much--and maybe at a laundry.  But the hotel business seemed to be where she spent most of her time working.
Story_ID: 544763
Speaker 1: What neighborhood was your mother [Emma Slaughter Conley] raised in?
Speaker 2: My mother was raised in a neighborhood called Mill--the Mill Creek [Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've heard about that before.  Now where is that here in town (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it doesn't exist anymore, but it's, it was an area that was very close to downtown St. Louis [Missouri].  Kind of south of where highway 40 [U.S. Route 40] is now, and east to about--maybe as far as east as Jefferson [Avenue].  Went as far north probably as I would say Martin Luther King [Dr. Martin Luther King Drive], well Franklin [Avenue], or what is now Martin Luther King.  And as far west probably Grand [Boulevard].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it went through a number of transitions, including highway 40, 40 and the Forest Park Parkway, then just some, just I would say routine gentrification.
Speaker 1: Did those go through in the, in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: When they--as part, as part of an urban renewal (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Urban renewal, urban renewal.  And so many of the families who were in those neighborhoods just were displaced, basically.
Speaker 1: It's a common, common story in the cities, around the country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, in the name of progress, yeah.  It changed, changed a lot of lives, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother--what did your mother say about growing up?  How did she, she like the neighborhood and, and what did she like to do?
Speaker 2: My mother was the second oldest child, first oldest girl in her family.  So she was--she talked about being a very happy child, being, feeling very protected.  Feeling almost well off in a sense because her dad [Johnnie Slaughter] worked at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], which is a good job at that time for blacks to have.  It was a steady government job.  Had a good income and, and, and her mother [Mary Taylor Slaughter] worked after a while, her mother began to work.  And so they had a pretty good income and lived a fairly good lifestyle.  So she was a happy child, enjoyed life basically.  Loved her sisters and brothers dearly.  And they really respected her a lot.  She, she enjoyed going to school.  Loved playground.  Playgrounds were apparently a lot more prominent in the lives of young people than they are today.  But so a lot of time was spent on the playground.  She loved to dance.  Was a, a good dancer.  Enjoyed it a lot.  She danced at--she, she--Josephine Baker's nephew [Richard Martin, Jr.], who still lives in here in St. Louis, was one of the people who she learned to dance with.  He was a dancer also and she enjoyed that and she talked about that a lot.  She was a pretty free spirit.  Fell in love with her high school sweetheart [Conley's father, Leo Conley], married him and was married to him for over, almost fifty years before he died.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, so she finish- what high school did she graduate from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She went to Vashon High School [St. Louis, Missouri]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was right in the heart of the Mill Creek.
Story_ID: 544764
Speaker 1: And what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: For many years she didn't do anything because she ended up having eight kids.  So she was pretty much a stay home mom until the kids grew, the last of the children grew old enough that she could go to work.  She eventually went to work through what was then the Model Cities program.  Worked for Head Start, then worked for one of the community health, health centers.  She was a smart person.  We lived in the Mill Creek [Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri] until there was almost nothing there.  We were one of the last families to move out of the Mill Creek.  And so at one point my mom [Emma Slaughter Conley] actually became an entrepreneur and she would go out to the wholesale stores and buy candy and socks and gloves and anything that the kids in the neighborhood needed or wanted.  There were no stores anymore at that point, and so she set up a little shop on the corner and sold goods there.  For a while she was a school crossing guard.  She was active with the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] in our school.  She was a good mom.
Speaker 1: Sounds like kind of active mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean and I think there was an advantage for her.  If there's any advantage to having eight kids (laughter), being able to be home for a long, long time with us was good for her; she really enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 544765
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father was Leo, L-E-O, Conley, C-O-N-L-E-Y [Leo Conley].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 10th, 1926, St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your father's ancestors?
Speaker 2: Not very much at all.  I know, I do, I did know my great-grandmother [sic. grandmother], his mother.  Her name was Mary [Mary Conley].  Knew of, knew the name of, of my great-grandfather was--but I never, I never met him.  My mom [Emma Slaughter Conley] tells me that I was really little when he passed.
Speaker 1: This is your grandfather [Lee Conley].
Speaker 2: My grandfather, my dad's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your father--
Speaker 2: My, my dad's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's your grand, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Didn't, didn't know him at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what's the story about where the family is from?  Were they--is there any other place other than St. Louis that they talk about?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: As an origin.
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know much about that side at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so they didn't have any place else they called home?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Any discussion that I've ever heard or any time we've talked about that side of the family, it's been about St. Louis, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so what did your, your grandparents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was a domestic.  My grandfather didn't work.  And from what I can remember, he was ill and unable to work.
Story_ID: 544766
Speaker 1: What did your father [Leo Conley] say about growing up?
Speaker 2: My father thought life was pretty wild.  He enjoyed--he was pretty adventurous.  He was a handsome, dapper young man.  He enjoyed sports.  He went off to the merchant, I think they call it the Merchant Marines [U.S. Merchant Marine] in those--for a while.  I'm trying to--I, I think he was kind of again, a free spirit who appreciated family.  Again, we had eight sisters, seven sisters and brothers, so they had a large family.  He had three, two, two sisters and a brother, brother older and two sisters younger.  He--I remember him talking about the sister, one of his sisters who had passed when, when she was quite young.  She had passed and left two kids.  And part of what his mother [Mary Conley] had to do was to raise those two kids.  And I remember him thinking that that was a really, really proud thing for his mother to do.  To step in and, and raise the, the two children that his--of his sister.  He's a quiet spoken person, but someone who loved life.  He was always--I remember my dad always going to work and--or even not going to work--times when he was unemployed, always making fun times for us.  Not necessarily taking us to really expensive places or anything, but you know having campouts on our front porch, or barbecuing and making hot dogs and, and, and popcorn and inviting all the kids over to the neigh- from our neighborhood [Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri] to our house.  People could always come to our house.  Saturday nights were always big goings on at our house 'cause my dad was gonna either make chili mac or barbecue or do something exciting.  And we were one of the few people in our neighborhood, in our neighborhood very early on who had a TV.  So folks would gather, kids would gather at our house and we'd watch TV, watch wrestling and, and, and other things.  So it was, he was a family person, family man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was--now is there--now, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He had several jobs.  When, when I was growing up as a little kid I remember him working at--kind of a--like a wholesale, a hardware type place.  Then he worked for many years at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  His last job he worked at a, as a park ranger for the Saint Louis Zoo [Saint Louis Zoological Park, St. Louis, Missouri], St. Louis park.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting job.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My dad always, always wanted to be in some kind of law enforcement role.  I can remember him even being a--sending off through the mail for a private detective kit (laughter) and doing some private detective work.  And we always, as we grew up and began to get older, always laughed about him being a, a private eye (laughter).  But he enjoyed that kind of thing, so.
Story_ID: 544767
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Emma Slaughter Conley and Leo Conley] met?
Speaker 2: Well they both went to Waring School--
Speaker 1: That's an elementary school, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Waring Elementary School [St. Louis, Missouri].  Came out of the same neighborhood [Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri].  Met at school and my mom says it was love at first sight.  The only person she's ever loved, ever been married to, ever wanted to be married to.  I don't know that there was a specific incident, but they used to go dancing at school dances.  And just met and, and fell in love and were together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From that point forward, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, so did he come out of Vashon [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri] too?
Speaker 2: He went to Vashon too.  He did not graduate, but he did go to Vashon.
Story_ID: 544768
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' talents and dispositions and--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well my mom [Emma Slaughter Conley] says I take after my dad [Leo Conley] (laughter).  She says that I'm very, I'm quiet mannered like he is.  I am very detailed oriented like him, very fastidious like he is.  Very much a get things done and move on kind of person.  Not, not much fanfare is required.  Not much attention is required.  I'm just about getting it done and hopefully doing it well, and making sure that things are organized and, and in place.  That's kind of how my dad was, very quiet, very soft spoken, very unassuming.  But what he had to get done, he got done.  You know if he needed to take care of his family, he got that done however he had to do that.  So I think in many ways she's right, I'm probably a lot like my dad.  But I also think that I have some tendencies that make me a lot like my mom as well.  Some characteristics in that my mom was very much--well she had eight kids.  And there were some times when my dad didn't work.  And she was very resourceful.  She could always find a way to make things happen.  She was going to go somewhere or call somebody or read some information or do whatever was necessary to make sure that our family was well.  And she was very good at it.  You know 'cause like I said, she--when, when--during one period of unemployment when my dad didn't work, she you know, put out her little stand on the street and sold things on the corner, you know.  And that was kind of the way she operated.  She just always managed to find a way.
Speaker 1: So you have nine brothers and sisters.  There's nine of you (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have, I have four brothers and three sisters.
Speaker 1: Four brothers, three sisters, that's eight.
Speaker 2: Now I have three brothers, got one brother is deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, and where do you fall in that order?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest girl.  I have one brother older.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now--and you were raised in the same neighborhood?
Speaker 2: We were raised in Mill Creek [Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri] as well.  Actually, we stayed there until the end, yeah.
Story_ID: 544769
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: One of my earliest childhood memories is my dad bringing me home.  I mentioned that he worked in a, a kind of a wholesale store where they sold all kinds of things, stoves and refrigerators and other things.  And I can remember him bringing home one day a stove, a little miniature stove that actually cooked.  Now I don't remember how it cooked, whether it was by battery or something else, but it actually cooked and it had pots and pans and everything with it.  So my mom [Emma Slaughter Conley] gave me a handful of greens and I actually made greens on this stove and cooked it for my dad.  And he was so excited and so was I.  He was excited that I enjoyed it and that--and he actually ate the meal.  I remember that very vividly.  And I remember that, that night, him letting me braid his hair up.  And it was--and it stayed up all night and he wore it to work the next day.  This is kind of, kind of how my dad was.  This was a time when men did not wear their hair braided in public.
Speaker 1: When was that?  I mean this is like--what year was this like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This must have been--I know that I was still in, in grade school [Waring Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri] when this happened.  Yeah, I was definitely in grade school, probably not more than nine or ten years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1955?
Speaker 2: At least.
Speaker 1: Or '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Probably not much longer.
Speaker 1: He went to work with his hair braided up?
Speaker 2: He braided, I braided his hair and he went to work and my mom--I can remember my mom saying, "Leo [Leo Conley], aren't you gonna take those braids, those plaits out of your hair?"  And he said, "No, my baby did this.  I'm gonna wear it and they better not say anything to me."  Now I don't know if they said anything to him, he didn't tell us.  When he came home, his hair was still braided.  But that's kind of how he was.  That's kind of how he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That's interesting story.
Story_ID: 544770
Speaker 1: Describe your neighborhood for us and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I loved living where we lived.  Partly because we lived in houses, mostly--either two or four family flats.  So we didn't live in high rise apartments, we didn't live in projects.  They weren't real highly populated neighborhoods in that sense.  But, but they were often like brownstones.  They were sometimes connected.  So I could--it would, would be--not be unusual for me to open my window and reach next door to Miss Morton [ph.] who would give us hoecakes in the morning when she'd bake 'em.  You could easily do that, that's how close some of the buildings were.  It was a really tight knit neighborhood.  Everybody pretty much knew everybody else, or families knew some member of the other family.  It was--I grew up during a time, during a time of course when you didn't have to wait to be disciplined by your parents.  Anybody who say you doing something you shouldn't be doing, or saw you somewhere you shouldn't be, or heard you say something you shouldn't say, would correct you and more than likely take you home and you'd get corrected again, or disciplined again.  Most of the people in our neighborhood had large families, so there were a lot of children.  Almost every--seemed as though almost every time one neighbor had, had a baby, another neighbor was having a baby.  So we all seemed to have peers of our, of our--of equal age just because our parents always seemed to have babies at the same time.  It was kind of funny.  Sometimes we even had the same names or something similar.  It was a wonderfully, busy bustling place where there were businesses on the corner.  You could go to the corner store and Miss Olivia [ph.] would give you gum if you didn't have your money because she knew your mother was gonna send you--send it to her later.  Or it was a place where if you didn't have money, you could take soda bottles, cash 'em in and, and buy something from the grocery store.  It was also a time when the men sat out on the corner and played checkers and drank beer or whatever else they did at that, at that point in their lives.  But nobody bothered you when you walked past.  Nobody whistled at you.  Nobody tried to hurt you.  Everybody knew that that was Leo's [Conley's father, Leo Conley] child, or--and help her across the street--or that was Miss Pinky's [ph.] daughter, you know.  So it, it was just a good, wholesome family kind of community.  It was a, a place where, where we lived on Walnut Street, less than a half block away, the Royal American carnival [Royal American Shows] came every year and so it was a lot of excitement and we looked forward to that, and we could walk up there to the carnival.  And, and enjoy all of the sights.  And everybody went, you know we went as, as families.  It was a time when big snows came and no matter what time the, the snow accumulated, we'd go knock on doors and everybody would show up outside and make snowmen and have snowball fights and make hot chocolate and, and share.  It was a time when we were all I think very poor, but none of us realized it.
Story_ID: 544771
Speaker 1: Was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Music was in that, you know for a long time all we had was radio.  We didn't have the benefit of TV and I say benefit, but we didn't have a TV all the time, so radio was a big, was an important part of our--what we did.  We would often, you know, gather on a pallet on the floor and listen to 'The Shadow' and, and, and 'The Lone Ranger' and those radio shows.  And my dad [Leo Conley] always seemed to have albums, record, record albums.  In fact, I have some now that I just recently collected from my mom [Emma Slaughter Conley] that were his.  So he, he enjoyed music and so we--music was always there.  And you know it wasn't unusual for us to, to turn on the radio and, and all the kids be outside on the front porch dancing, singing, playing, whatever.  But music seemed to always be there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now you mentioned television.  Did, did you like movies too, or--
Speaker 2: You know there weren't movies--you mean going to the movies?  Yeah, but I was much older before I could do--go to movies.  In fact, I, I was--my parents were pretty strict with us.  And so we didn't do a lot of things outside of the hou- the home.  A lot of what we did was at home and was with other family and friends.  I was probably close to graduating high school [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri] before I started going to movies.  Probably the--just before my senior year in high school.  But I enjoyed going to movies.  I enjoyed particularly what I guess they call girlie movies, the kind that make you cry, the kind that are so sentimental and you know, have some real depth to them.  I enjoy those kinds of movies.  Didn't do a lot of it as a kid, as a kid, though.
Speaker 1: Now was, was your family very aware of the--I mean were they, were they, were they like excited when somebody black would appear on television?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  And we--of course we watched all the--you know Nat King, King Cole Show ['The Nat King Cole Show'].  Anything that, that had a black person, whether he was a star or whatever role he had in, in, in anything on TV, we watched.  Of course we watched Leslie Uggams and 'The $64,000 Question' and, and those kinds of things.  I mean you were just glued to the TV set to see--just the thought that there's a black person there.  And they were doing something positive, and they were doing it well.  You know that was, that was really impressive to us.

Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that your mother [Emma Slaughter Conley] knew one of the relatives of Josephine Baker who's a St. Louis [Missouri] girl you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who went away and didn't come back much after she went--
Speaker 2: Didn't--was not well received here and she was, you know, didn't do well when she was here.  Left here when she was about thirteen.  Went to--ended up in France and was much, much more happily, well received there.  But her--she has a nephew who still lives here in St. Louis, who grew up in the same neighborhood with my mom, took dancing lessons, lessons from Miss Francis [ph.].  And he, he's still--he still tries to dance.  But my mom enjoyed dancing with him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he's still alive?
Speaker 2: He's still alive.  In fact, he visited the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] just a couple of weeks ago.
Speaker 1: Well what's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Richard Martin [sic. Richard Martin, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he may actually be Richard Martin, yeah he's Richard Martin and his son and I ended up going to the same church, Richard Martin, Jr. [sic. Ronald P. Martin], who's also still here in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that, that--it's nice to have that family connection as well to, to Josephine Baker.
Speaker 1: Now did you know--who were some of the other personalities from, from Mill Creek [Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to re- I was such a young kid when I, when we lived there, that that--I don't know if they--the names stood out so much then as they--a little bit more now.  But, but--wow I just went blank.  I'll have to come back, I'm sorry. Just lost them all (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That happens to me sometimes (laughter). Okay.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Story_ID: 544773
Speaker 1: So what did you like to do when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: I loved to play house, play dolls.  I loved to play jacks and I loved to play quiet games.  I was ill for a while as a kid, and was restricted somewhat in my activities so I learned to play a lot by myself.  So those things, I like to read a lot.  I like to comb hair, like to braid hair.  Liked to dance, liked to roller skate.  Enjoyed swimming in high school [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri], was on the swim team.  Really enjoyed reading a lot.  And I think that's probably because I was always, I tended to be by myself a lot.
Speaker 1: Now what was your favorite reading material?
Speaker 2: Just about anything that, that had a happy stories, happy people doing well, looking good.  I mean all of the, the class- all of the typical Dick and Jane things from the early '80s [sic.], but certainly later on, more serious things like growing up in Mississippi [sic. Missouri], coming of age in Mississippi and things like that, the historical kinds of--things that told stories that seemed more relevant, more real, more real life kinds of stories.  And then began to understand the importance of reading and, and stories, and how they impacted people's lives and how those stories sometimes reflected your life, or lives of other people.  That's as I got older of course.
Story_ID: 544774
Speaker 1: Was your family following the Civil Rights Movement?  Did you discuss what was going on in the rest of the country?
Speaker 2: We always followed it.  My dad [Leo Conley] was always--the best way I can say it, my dad was always anti-white.  He was always suspicious of white people.  He always talked about the ways that white people had kept their feet on the throats of black people and that they never intended to see black people do well.
Speaker 1: Now was that, that unusual for those days for someone to feel that way?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was unusual for them to feel that way.  I think it was more unusual for them to say it.  And he--while he always taught us that you respected people for who they were, you were always careful of white folks because they did not mean you any, any good.  And if there was a way that they could hinder you, keep you subservient, then that's what they really wanted for black folks.  Yet he al- he never said to, to me or to any of my brothers that you should bow down or you should do any of those things that make you less than a person.  You are who you are and there's nothing wrong with you; you're fine.  Know that and do what you wanna do.  But he was always suspicious, always suspicious.
Story_ID: 544775
Speaker 1: Now what was your first art project, I guess?  'Cause you're, you're really a talented sculptor, so how--did--when did you start noticing any art skills or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know art, art in that sense--and I'll tell you the story about my rise to the artist role.  Art was always a part of what we did as, as kids, you know at home.  We did--always were doing projects because that was one of the ways to entertain.  And it wasn't ever any formal art.  My mother [Emma Slaughter Conley] was not artistic in that she drew or, or sculpted or anything.  But she was creative in that--in the arts and crafts kinds of things.  So we were always busily--that was one of the things we would do on any given day, or at school, or any time.  So if there was a project going on, we were more than likely gonna be involved in it, making--whether it was making Christmas ornaments or chains for a Christmas tree or, or paper dolls, we made our fun, so, you know.  I didn't--I never thought of myself as an artist.  Enjoyed and could--and like my mom, could be creative, could see art and like it.  Never thought of myself as an artist and still don't.  I, I just fell into doing art, just sculpting basically, because it was such a critical part of my being able to open this museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: So you didn't--did, did you start--did you sculpt when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Not as a kid.  Other than, you know, Play-Doh and things like that.  But I was pretty good at it.  I mean I made cute, well cute enough that my folks wanted to keep the little animals or the little dolls and things--
Speaker 1: Did you draw?
Speaker 2: I can't draw.  Didn't draw then except, you know, I could color.  Can't draw now, even.  Not in any way that anybody would appreciate.  But so I never even think of myself as having an art background in that sense.  But it was critical to this, this project.  And it really just sort of evolved.  Over the years I've always dabbled a little bit.  I've always painted, I've always--paint by numbers kinds of things.  Or even sculpted items that you would paint or you'd finish off and put it in the oven with, with clay dough or something.  But nothing serious that I, that I considered serious.  And then I started probably, I don't know, twenty something years ago, may longer, I started collected black memorabilia.  And I really became curious about how they were made.  Some of these ugly, stereotypical things, even.  And started to do some myself.
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna go back now to grade school [Waring Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri].  But, but that's interesting that you weren't really doing any artwork as a kid.  Not really intently.
Speaker 2: No, and not even thinking of art as something that was part of my being, a part of my life.  You know, if you had a project in school that was an art project, and I was--I did--'cause I was a good student, basically.  You know so I did--if we had an art project, I did an art project.  You know, if we were, if we were making something out of papier mache, then I made it, I did it.  But all--you know that's, that's what I should have been doing.  And I didn't think I had any particular talent.
Story_ID: 544776
Speaker 1: What was your grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to Waring.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you went there all--start to finish (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I finished Waring, graduated Waring, eighth grade and went to Vashon [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Waring Elementary School [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: See there's a pattern there.  All my folks went to Waring and then Vashon (laughter), then most of my sisters and brothers went to Waring.
Speaker 1: Now who's Waring named after?  Is that a famous black person or is it somebody else?
Speaker 2: No, it's not a black person, and I've forgotten, the story now.
Speaker 1: George Waring [sic. Oscar Minor Waring] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's George Waring, but I can't--
Speaker 1: It is, it is George Waring?
Speaker 2: It's George Waring, but I can't remember the story now.  I used to know it.
Speaker 1: I know he's a musician.
Speaker 2: Music, yeah, that, that, that sounds familiar.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's George Waring Elementary School.  And well did you have--were there any particular teachers that were significant in your life in those days?
Speaker 2: Miss Kellogg [ph.] must have been my first and second grade teacher.  She was just the dearest teacher.  It's interest--all of our, you know everybody had the same teachers 'cause we, we lived in the same neighborhood [Mill Creek Valley, St. Louis, Missouri] for years and so you already knew when you went to school who your teachers, who the teachers were going to be.  And you knew who were gonna be tough teachers and who weren't gonna be tough teachers.  But everybody talked about Miss Kellogg anyway, even though she was tough.  But they talked, always talked about how tough she was, yet how much she loved you.  And what a wonderfully intelligent teacher she was, and she was just that.  She was teacher and mother and disciplinarian and all of that, and she was good at all of it.  She didn't accept any--even at--I mean first, second grade, she was--she had high standards.  And you know I guess when we went to school at a time when teachers--it was more than just a job, you know.  Teachers took teaching seriously.  And many of the teachers lived in your neighborhood, and they all knew your parents.  So you either were going to do well or your parents were gonna hear about it.  And so Miss Kellogg was that kind of teacher.  She was just there.  She was--you couldn't get on her nerves.  She was your mother, but she was your teacher, you know she was your teacher, yet she was your mother.  She knew what you should be doing at first grade, second grade.  And she knew that you were a kid in the first or second grade, and that you behaved a certain way because of that.  Yet she expected that when you wrote, you did your penmanship, or you did whatever the activity was, she expected it to be good.  And she would take the time to, you know, help you with that.  But she always expected you to do well.
Story_ID: 544777
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I think I liked English or language, always liked language, English as it became, as you grew older.  Again, reading, still like, enjoyed reading.  I did enjoy--for a while I also liked--I guess we called it civics or government at that point in, in high school [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri].  I played a little while, I took lessons on a--violin lessons for a little while and I enjoyed that too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I regret now that I didn't follow that up because I, I did, I did enjoy that.  That's the only, only--except when I was in college I took piano lessons.  But that was the only time that I'd had any experience with music lessons and, and now I regret that I didn't do more of that.
Speaker 1: Is there a reason why you didn't, or is it--
Speaker 2: I think because I reached a point where you had to have your own violin, and my parents [Emma Slaughter Conley and Leo Conley] couldn't afford that.  And so that was the end of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I was.  I was a good student.  I was attentive and quiet and, you know, didn't cause any problems (laughter).  Yeah, I was a good student, yeah.
Story_ID: 544778
Speaker 1: What about high school?  Now George B. Vashon High School [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Vashon.
Speaker 1: They call it Vashon, Vashon (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Vashon, yeah.  Started at Vashon in 1960.  Enjoyed being at Vashon.  Again it, you know, it was a continuation of, of, of Waring [Waring Elementary School, St. Louis, Missouri], basically.  Now many--although it was a, a bigger school, there were more, more students there.  We were--'cause I was older, class work was different.  And the fact that now we were changing classes, you know, and was beginning to be a little more independent in, in terms of study, studying and, and, and performance.  I remember beginning to recognize that I was more on my own.  That the kind of nurturing that you had from Miss Kellogg [ph.] in the first grade or Miss McKnight [ph.] in the seventh grade, wasn't there so much anymore because you were growing up and you were expected to do more of that on your own.  Some of the teachers at Vashon were still teachers who had been there when my parents [Emma Slaughter Conley and Leo Conley] had gone there.  But I didn't know them on the same level that I knew the teachers that I'd known at Waring.  And they didn't have certainly the same kind of time to spend with students as the teachers did at the elementary school level.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you--now did you--when you were in high school, did you--did you take the college prep courses, or did you, were you aiming for college after high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah, actually I came out of Waring, Waring Elementary as what they call back then a Track 1-A student.  And so that meant that you had the ability to go to college, do college level work.  And, and so we went into a college prep class, program.  And I was really fortunate I think to have the experience of having a very young high school counselor.  He was Ernest Patterson who had come out of Carbondale, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Was he black?
Speaker 2: Black.  Young black man, he was twenty-four I think and had already gotten his Ph.D.  And he came on, he was my counselor and at one point my high school homeroom teacher.  And he was very--had come out of, as I say, southern Illinois, and so was very race conscious and, and civil rights conscious, and was committed to making sure that young black people had an opportunity to go to school.  And he worked with a, a group of us to make sure that we were prepared.  I mean we could go to his home, he had a wonderful wife who accepted us at her home.  He was a wonderful support for us and he--I think so many of us were in awe of him because he was such a young man who was teaching.  He had gotten his Ph.D., and had--was coming, was at, at Vashon and working, willing to work with all of us.  He eventually left Vashon and went to become the dean at--in Denver, University of Colorado [sic. University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] before he died there.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good story.  Usually we have so many bad counselor stories (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he was excellent and--
Speaker 1: --counselors telling the students they don't belong in college and take something else and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 544779
Speaker 1: So did he like have--lay out a plan for you or help you find financial aid and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: He did.  And not only that, he did other things that now I understand were preparatory for that.  He made sure that I took typing.  And I didn't think I needed to take typing.  After all, I'm not gonna be a secretary, I'm going to college.  He said, "Yeah but you gotta type term papers."  And that's the kind of basic stuff he taught you.  Yeah, but you've got to learn to type.  You're not gonna be able to pay somebody to type term papers and you're gonna have to do that.  So yeah, he made all of us take typing, boys and girls; male and female, we took typing.  He--and those were the kinds of things we admired about him.  He seemed to know, and that's because he'd done it.  He, he'd already been to college and he'd already gotten his, you know, he knew what you would need, and so he made sure we got it as well.  But we--he exposed me to other people who had been--other black folks who had been to college.  My folks [Emma Slaughter Conley and Leo Conley] had not gone to college.  I think they wanted us to go, but they had not gone.  He had, and he exposed me to other black women who had--people who had gone, Pearlie Evans became kind of a mentor because of Mr. Patterson [Ernest Patterson] who had, Dr. Patterson, who had put me in touch with her.  Pearlie Evans became the special assistant to Congressman Clay, Sr. [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.], and was his special assistant when--for the whole time that he was in [U.S.] Congress, basically.  And when he retired, she retired.  But it--then he, he, he, he paired me again with a woman who owned a, a beauty school.  And she taught me how to do basic business kinds of things; taking money and counting it and, and, and clo- and writing, doing books.  And just some basic things.  But she was again, a woman who had, had gone to college and opened her own business.  He exposed me to someone named James Hurt [James Hurt, Jr.] who was a businessman, small businessman, black man.  I guess you would call it a financial planner.  Again, someone who--so that we could see black people doing positive things.  But, but understanding all along that you had to be educated.  You needed to go to school.  You needed to prepare yourself.  And that--so while he was, while he was counseling and advising me about academic work, he was also making sure that there were some practical experience, and some exposure to people who had done well.  And I think that, that was important for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you active in clubs and high school activities [at Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.  I was, I was a cheerleader, I was on the swim team for a while.  I was on the, on the college newspaper [sic.] for a while.  I was on the student council, student government.  Ran for class president.  I was in the queen, king contest, was second runner up or something.  Yeah, I was active in, in, in most--in several activities, yeah.
Story_ID: 544780
Speaker 1: When you graduated, did you graduate with honors or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I just graduated (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just, I graduated and had a couple of scholarship offers.  One local and one to--wow, it's in Indiana, starts with a B.
Speaker 1: With a what?
Speaker 2: A B.
Speaker 1: B?  Butler?
Speaker 2: Butler University in Indiana [Indianapolis, Indiana].  I opted out.  I got married and had a baby [Erika Neal] and stayed here and went to school.
Speaker 1: Now did you meet your husband in high school?
Speaker 2: Met my husband in high school, he was at Vashon [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri], football player at Vashon.  Yeah, got married.  And could--but I still--
Speaker 1: Right after high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I still, still, I still hear it, hear in my head Ernest Patterson saying, "You've gotta, you've got to go to school, you've got to go to school, you've got to get a degree.  You've got to get a degree."  And so I just kept going to school part-time, I just kept going to school part-time and eventually got a de- got a degree.  Got my bachelor's [degree].
Speaker 1: Now where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to--first I went to Wash U [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  And it was a special program.  Actually Patterson had had--made possible for us to--for me and another student I believe from my class to get into.  It was a small class of us who were invited to come to what they call University College at Washington University, and they paid our tuition.  And we went to evening classes there.  And I did that for probably two years.
Speaker 1: This was 1964?
Speaker 2: That would have been probably sixty--that might have been '65 [1965] when I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, '65 [1965] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I probably did start there in '64 [1964] in the fall, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I did it probably for a couple years 'cause it was part-time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, that ended.  Then I transferred to Saint--to the junior college, and finished the junior college.
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: Forest Park Community College [St. Louis Community College - Forest Park, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Finished there with a, an associate's degree in communications.  Then I kind of dropped out, didn't do--didn't go to school I think maybe a year or so.  Then went back, got a job at Maryville University [St. Louis, Missouri], and took classes there.  Transferred jobs to Washington University School of Medicine [St. Louis, Missouri] and started back taking classes.  Eventually went to Saint Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri] got--and finished there.  So it was kind of a circuitous route, but I ended up getting my, my bachelor's from St. Louis U and then, then ultimately my master's [degree] from St. Louis U as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And meanwhile did you have more children?
Speaker 2: Thirteen years after my first child, I had a second child, second marriage and second child.  So I had my son [Tracy Williams] in 1978, and my daughter was 1966.
Story_ID: 544781
Speaker 1: What kinds of jobs did you have in the meantime (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I did probably just about anything that, that would pay money and was legal.  But also that was job related in a sense.  'Cause I figured if I wasn't gonna be a college student as such, you know, normal college student, that I had to always sort of be preparing to go up this ladder in wherever I was working.  So I--for a while when I was working at the Wash U medical school [Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri], I became a, an editorial associate 'cause I had my--I think by that time I had had my degree in--my associate's degree in journalism, communications [from St. Louis Community College - Forest Park, St. Louis, Missouri].  So I did a lot of editing on a medical journal.  And I started out there as a secretary.  But when I, when I heard about this opening on the medical magazine, I thought well I can write and I've been trained to write a little bit, and I can read.  And I asked about that, that opening and got that job.  And from that, I was able to, to--I stayed there probably four or five years.  And then I even got some freelance work for the VA hospital [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] working on a medical piece, a production of a, a pamphlet that they were producing.  So--and then I worked for a while for Manpower temporary services where I interviewed temporary workers and I sent--I matched them with jobs and sent them out to, to various employers.  I worked at Saint Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri] probably for the longest time of all, I worked there for thirteen years.  And I started there as an administrative assistant and moved up to director of administration in the School of Social Work [Saint Louis University School of Social Work, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  A number of different things.  Now, now that takes us now--all, all those careers.  Now were you, you involved in historical study or, or, or anything cultural during all this time?
Speaker 2: I mean it's, it's--without knowing or making any special effort, it's kind of always just been a part of my life.  I mean I was always going to events, activities, dances, plays, anything of that sort, that had a, a, an African American, a cultural reference.
Story_ID: 544782
Speaker 1: So okay now, tell us about some of your cultural interests and when did you get interested in, in these cultural activities?  We know that, you know, we had something in the states called the Black Arts Movement at a certain point.  As the Civil Rights Movement matured, we get--we went into the Black Power movement and the Black Arts Movement.  Was that--any of that a part of your life?
Speaker 2: It wasn't in that sense.  My, my parents [Emma Slaughter Conley and Leo Conley], as I said, were, were very strict and my mom especially would have me shy away from any movements as such.  We talked about it at home, we read about it.  But getting involved, other than from, from the standpoint of knowing that it was happening, that was it.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about the March on Washington?  Now you were I guess just getting ready to come out of high school [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri] when that, that happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) High school.  I thought it was amazing that that many people, black people, could come together in a place over issues like that and make a difference.  And I could remember seeing and hearing about it and wishing that I could have been there.  Just not that I even thought I understood it all, even at--graduating from high school.  But I wanted to feel the dynamics of all those people and be a part of that.  And I feel that I missed that, wished I could have, could have experienced it.  My, my mom was always afraid we'd get hurt, so she always kind of kept, kept me away from those kinds of things.  But you know you couldn't keep it away from you in high school when it's all over the, all over the, the school and people are talking about events that are happening.  Like when, when, when, when Mr. Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is shot, I mean you just can't--I'm out of high school by then, but you just can't, you can't--there's no way you can keep that away from your kids, or from anybody else.  You, you, you've got to know that there's something going on, some thoughts and feelings about that.
Story_ID: 544783
Speaker 1: How did that affect you?  Can, can you remember what you were doing when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?
Speaker 2: I don't remember specifically what I was doing.  I just remember feeling such a terrible sense of loss.  Because I guess for me Dr. King probably was the person who I recognized as someone who could make a difference in the lives of black people, and that he was suddenly gone.  I can remember my dad's [Leo Conley] constant admonishment that black, that white folks have no good intentions in mind for, for black folks, and that here was a man who did have, and who was making--put his life on the line to try to make some of those things happen.  And now he was gone.  And I--there was this kind of sense of now what?  You know, now what?  And I guess even then I, I realized that there wasn't anyone else like him on the scene at that time.  You know, there were the Jesse Jack- [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] but they just weren't the--they didn't come across to me as being a Dr. King.  So I just remember feeling a real sense of loss and what's going to happen to us now.
Story_ID: 544784
Speaker 1: Now did you get involved in--once you graduated from high school [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri] and you were in college, did you get involved in any of the activities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to some meetings.  I always went to meetings.  I, I listened and tried to learn a lot.  We had here in St. Louis [Missouri] a place called the black topographical center.  Little place up over a, a, a business on Dr. Martin Luther King Drive, which was back then Franklin [Avenue] or Easton Avenue.  And it was--I guess the best description was it was a resource center.  And you could go there at any time, almost day and night.  Lots of books.  You could read.  If you wanted to engage in conversation with other people about activities, civil rights activities, you could do that.  If you wanted to get advice, if you wanted to sit in on a, a rap session, that was the place that I eventually started to go and started to I guess learn and get more exposure to the black experience.
Speaker 1: Who ran topographical research center?
Speaker 2: The person I remember is a brother named Blackmon [ph.], who eventually went to teach at the University of Missouri at St. Louis [University of Missouri - St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  Don't remember his full name now.  And there were always a series of people there, but it seems to me that it was his idea to establish the center.  And I, I suspect that a lot of people probably contributed to keeping it going and making sure it was open and that there were resources there and that you could come in from time to time.  I don't know much more details about it, but I just know that whenever I was there, there was always somebody else there.  And there always seemed to be such an energy in the place.  People seemed to be so excited about having access to books.  Having access to other people and hearing other people's opinions, or talking about some event or activity that was occurring at the time.  And it was a very small place, probably not much bigger than this room in total.
Speaker 1: Now these kind of things weren't--these kinds of discussions I take it weren't taking place in church.
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all.  In church, at my church probably in particular is one that I can speak about.  It was probably very much like my mom [Emma Slaughter Conley].  You stay away from that because it's dangerous, kind of thing.  But you know in a sense when somebody tells you that, it almost makes you wanna do just the opposite.  You want to find out why they're telling me to stay away.  And I, I guess I understood.  I understood the concern about the dangers, I did.  But you still kind of wanted to know. You just wanted to know (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were some of the books that were popular, available at the topographical research center?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Of course W.E.B. Du Bois'--
Speaker 1: 'Souls of'--
Speaker 2: 'Souls of Black Folks' ['The Souls of Black Folk,' W.E.B. Du Bois].  Geez, you know I don't remember all of the books, but it was book of that genre that were all, that were there.  Even some of the Marxist kinds of books and alternative kinds of government styles were there.  And they were just there for your taking.  You could read them, you couldn't check them out.  You could read them there and leave them, or you could bring something to contribute.  And that kind of helped to build the library.  And I just don't remember all of the, the titles.  But they were all of that genre.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did they have lectures there?
Speaker 2: There were, I guess you'd call 'em lectures.  There were forums, if you would.  Sometimes very impromptu, sometimes I guess formal in that there was a, a notice posted that said a certain person was coming at ten o'clock on a certain day and he showed up.  Sometimes somebody just walked in and, and you know, he had the floor.  He had the attention of whoever was there in the building at the time.  So I don't know that there was a, a, a big push to bring in major speakers or anything like that.  In fact, I don't recall any notable speakers coming at any time that I was there, or at any time that I--or seeing anything, any notice of anybody of note or prominence was coming.  Actually, it seemed to be much more local.  And a lot of young people I would say, young meaning eighteen to maybe thirty-ish kind of people there.
Story_ID: 544785
Speaker 1: When would you say that you actually started becoming con- you know, conscious of black history where you wanted to do something about it and, and you know and who was your first teacher in that regard, or your first influence?
Speaker 2: I think I probably--and I'm not sure which of the two had the most impact.  But somewhere between Ernest Patterson who I mentioned earlier, and N. Webster Moore, who--both of whom I knew from high school.   Ernest Patterson being my counselor and N. Webster Moore being my senior advisor, high school advisor and history teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And N. Webster Moore, you always got some, some inkling, some splattering of history, black history from both of them, whether formal in the classroom or otherwise.  They were always going to talk about the black struggle.  So N. Webster Moore being the history teacher, certainly that, he, whatever he was teaching, he always brought in the black perspective.
Speaker 1: You think that was unique?  Was that unique that Vashon [Vashon High School, St. Louis, Missouri], I mean, do you think other schools were getting that kind of--
Speaker 2: I bet there were some other teachers who were doing it at other schools, but I think it was individual teachers who, who were doing it and not any formal intent by that school to do it.  I think it, it's because the teachers or the counselors, those individuals took it upon themselves to do it.
Speaker 1: Well did he teach anything that surprised you?
Speaker 2: Well at that point, just about everything surprised me because until that point, I probably heard my dad [Leo Conley] talking about why, you know, you have to be suspicious of white folks and, and his perspective about them.  But then N. Webster Moore started to give me, give us things to read and there it was in black and white.  Or he would write something, or he would show me somebody's dissertation, or he would make us reread the U.S. history and point out in the [U.S.] Constitution specifically where blacks were, were to be enslaved and for how long.  And you know those kinds of things, and it started to then be real.  So I think maybe he may have been the first person to really say, to get me to understand that, you know, there's some things that we need to do in our lives and if we don't make some changes, they're gonna continue to happen.  And it's an individual--it's something that you as an individual has to, have to do.  But again, being very--always cautioning to be careful what you do and how you do it and what you say and how you say it.  But also knowing, being able to back up what you say, have some facts, and that the facts are there; you can always find them.  I guess maybe that kind of whetted my appetite for, for history and, and wanting to do more.  Don't know that I ever made a conscious decision to do it.  Don't remember a point in my life when I said this is what I'm going to be doing, or this is what I want to explore.  I don't recall ever doing that.  It just seemed to kind of evolve.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first serious black history book, or--
Speaker 2: I guess I don't.  Most of them were serious because I--by that point, anything you pick--I picked up seemed serious, seemed important.  Even some of the later, some of the, the novels seemed important because I thought I saw them as a reflection of, of the history of the incidents of things that, that happened in people's lives.  I, I just remember, remember wanting to go and read more.  I just remember wanting and regretting that I hadn't been more active earlier in the Civil Rights Movement, even in St. Louis [Missouri], although St. Louis was pretty calm I, I guess by comparison to some places.  I wish I could have been there.  And when I would read newspaper accounts, or even expose--have exposure to a book or a lecture, I just remember like wow, if you weren't there, you just really missed it.  If I'm getting this excited about reading an account in a newspaper, how much more exciting could it have been to have actually been there.  And maybe if you were there, you could have done something different.  Maybe the outcome might have been different.  I--my memory just doesn't take me back to a point where I can specifically say a particular book or anything inspired that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 544786
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with a black history museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] (laughter)?  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: I think I mentioned earlier that I started collecting black memorabilia.  And what was interesting about that is I was collecting because I found, particularly some of the stereotypical pieces of black memorabilia, to be so relevant, such a statement of what society thought about black people.
Speaker 1: Now here did you notice these pieces?  Were they all around you I mean how (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it was interesting that they were kind of all around.  I mean my grandmother even had some of the little watermelon type figures, figurines you know, really black people with--eating the watermelon or some of those in her house.  My--it wasn't unusual to go to people's home and find those little caricatures sitting around.  And certainly you could still see them in, in the dime stores or ten cent stores and places like that.  So I mean they were always there.  Little black Sambo books ['The Story of Little Black Sambo,' Helen Bannerman].  They were just always there.  I was just--since they were always there, I guess I just always thought that, they were okay, they should be there.  So they were part of our lives.  As I grew older and started to really take an interest and realize how prominent they were in our lives and then began to understand a little bit more about what was happening in our society as it relates to race relations, I began to really realize how much those things were intended to represent black people in a negative way.  And so I would start to look for them if I would travel somewhere, if I'd go out of town somewhere.  Wherever--if I was driving down a road, it wouldn't be unusual for me to veer off the road into some little small town looking for something, or just to see what might be there, what might be different.  And so I started to read more.  If I find a piece, then I really wanted to find out about that piece.  You know if I found a, a black bank, I really wanted to learn about it; why somebody created it.  Why did they make it with a big, big head and, and big lips.  You know, why, why did--why?  And so I started to kind of track, trace, search, really those pieces, look out--research those pieces or, or documents that I would run across in a, a little off the way resale store.  That kind of was, was my I guess interest, if you will, in learning more about black history.  More about not just the history, but the implications of the history and the intentions of it.  So I started doing that and then I got really curious about making them because I, I found myself buying more and more pieces of it and paying more as the years went on, paying more and more.  Really curious that some--when I started, I could pick up a piece for, you know, three or four dollars.  Five years later it was ten dollars, you know and began--by then this is '70 [1970] or so.  And thinking well why is this stuff becoming so popular?  You know, it's--and it's becoming harder to find.  And it's costing more.  And that again, you know, just piqued my curiosity.  So I--that just made me want to learn more about it.
Story_ID: 544787
Speaker 1: What I was also finding as I would travel to these little places, or sometimes larger places, is that there were things--there were in other cities, people were acknowledging their black history, their black heritage.  And then sometimes some of the people they were acknowledging were people who had a Missouri connection or a St. Louis [Missouri] connection.  And it just seemed really, really weird to me that other people found it important enough to acknowledge those folks and here in St. Louis we didn't.
Speaker 2: For instance who, like who?
Speaker 1: Well I'm, I'm in Detroit [Michigan] one day and I go to the, I think the Langston Hughes house [sic.].  And I guess I knew this before, but it was impressed upon me that Langston Hughes had, had actually come out of Joplin, Missouri, you know.  And I thought wow, yeah I think I knew that, but it didn't seem to have the same relevance to me.  Then I'm, I'm, I'm reading more.  I come back home and I say I gotta follow up on that Langston Hughes guy 'cause he's got a Missouri connection.  And I'm reading that Langston Hughes wrote the poem 'The Negro Speaks of Rivers.'  When he's coming, when he's crossing the Mississippi River out of St. Louis.  I'm going like wow.  I wonder how many other people have just kind of glossed over that and didn't know it.  And I, I thought wow, that's important to me.  Maybe it's just not important to anybody else.  And it was that kind of thing that--being--in Indianapolis [Indiana], when I go to--Madame C.J. Walker Theatre [Madame Walker Theatre Center] there.  Again, a Missouri connection, St. Louis connection, spent time over at Poro College [St. Louis, Missouri] and--but nobody in St.--
Speaker 2: Is she [Madam C.J. Walker] connected with Poro?
Speaker 1: She got her training there.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Under Annie Malone (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Another black woman.
Speaker 1: When she came, when she came to St. Louis, Annie Malone is the person who took her under her wings, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's interesting, there's a huge Annie Malone exhibit at the DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History] in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Chicago, absolutely, absolutely.  The Poro College over here where Annie Malone--the college she taught and founded.  'Precious Lord' ['Take My Hand, Precious Lord'] the song, Thomas A. Dorsey wrote that over at Poro College.  You know and just those little kinds of things that, that started to crop up and I was going like wow.  We need to be sharing that in St. Louis.  We need to be telling our own story.  You know if other people think it's important, we need to be thinking it's important, and it is important.  It's important not only because these folks did what they did, it's important that our young folks know it.  It's important that they know, understand the stories, and that they see that these people sometimes, under circumstances that were not always the best, still did okay.  They did good for themselves and they did good for others as well.  And I think that's important for young folks to know.  So I just kind of found myself on a, I guess if you will on a mission to find out as much as I could about Missouri, people who had a Missouri connection to history.  Black people who had a Missouri connection to history.
Story_ID: 544788
Speaker 1: Well who are some, some of the other people that, that have this Missouri connection?
Speaker 2: Well there is, of course most people know about George Washington Carver.  But what I found when I started when--even after I opened the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well tell us what his connection is.  When you tell us about these people, tell us what their connection is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause a lot--we don't know.  I mean those of us not from here, don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, George Washington Carver.
Speaker 1: I, I think of him as Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 2: That, and most people do.  And I didn't realize that as much until I actually had the museum was actually open and other folks were going like he's from Missouri?  And I'm going like yeah.  Well he grew up in Missouri.  First thirteen years of his life he was raised out of--in Diamond, Missouri.  And actually I think that's where he got his initial introduction to the field of botany because he was out there in a, in a place where he could commune with nature and he started to enjoy plants and, and flowers and things and to do a little I guess maybe experimentation is not the correct word at that point, but to dabble at that point.  And there's a place, a monument in, in Diamond Grove [sic. Diamond, Missouri] and a George Washington Carver site [George Washington Carver National Monument] in his honor there.  But, but most, most of us relate him to Tuskegee.  There is one story that I love is the story of Elizabeth Keckley who was born, who came to St. Louis [Missouri] with her, she and her son [George Kirkland] were enslaved here.  She eventually becomes the confidant, I guess she's actually the maid probably, to Mary Todd Lincoln who's President Lincoln's [President Abraham Lincoln] wife.  But her story is such a beautiful story.  She buys her, her--gets her, her freedom and the freedom of her son and she goes to become the, the second, I guess the right hand to President Lincoln's wife, and is the only person who can make her gown for the inauguration because of her skill as a seamstress.  That's one part of the story.  But the other part of the story is that she does well for herself.  But then she takes her money and starts a school for girls, to teach black girls how to fend for themselves as well.  You know and for me, those are the important, those are the important parts of the story.  Not just that somebody did well for themselves, but they reached back and made sure they were helping others as well.  Another story, we've talked a little bit already about Madam C.J. Walker who grew up, when she came to St. Louis and lived very close to the same neighborhood as Josephine Baker over near the (unclear) area.  Just, just probably ten blocks from where we are now, over around Union Station [St. Louis Union Station, St. Louis, Missouri].  But she came her as a--and became a washer woman until Annie Malone took her in and taught her how to do, do hair and how to make beauty products.  Now she took it to another level and became a, I guess she'd say--I'd say she had great marketing skills.  And with her, you know she, she's said to have become the first black female millionaire as a result of her marketing skills with those hair care and beauty products.  Again, a St. Louis connection.  A Miles Davis or a Clark Terry.  Just people who--and for instance when we opened the Miles Dav- the Clark Terry exhibit, nobody knew Clark Terry was the first black band leader on 'The Tonight Show.'  He pre-dated Doc Severinsen.  And people didn't know that, you know.  And it, it--
Speaker 1: Well I didn't know it myself. Now you just told me (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know in and of itself, it's probably no big deal.  But when you think of it in the larger scheme of things that was pretty impressive.  I thought it was pretty impressive, and he came out of St. Louis, you know.  And I think that's important for people to know that right here in St. Louis there, there were some pretty interesting, exciting people who came from this region in spite of St. Louis being a slave state.  In spite of us having some ferocious, the same kind of Jim Crow laws that existed in, in the South, we had 'em here.  In spite of us having slave pens and, and all kinds of other discriminatory things going on throughout our lives, these people were able to do some things that were positive.  To reach some heights that hadn't been, been reached before.  And they were just people; they were just normal people.  There was nothing special about them.  And I think that's important for young folks to know.  You can do whatever you wanna do if that's something you choose to do.  You've got to be committed.
Story_ID: 544789
Speaker 1: Now how did you get on a track of creating a museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri]?  I mean who--how did that happen?  Now this is something that--well, now you've got all this information about these people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What good did it do me (laughter)?
Speaker 1: So how did you get involved in the--
Speaker 2: Well that was part of the inspiration.  Didn't do me any good to have it.  I mean I could say yeah, I know something you don't know.  But I guess I'm finding myself back at that place that says it only takes an individual to make a difference, you know.  And maybe I didn't understand it back there twenty years, you know when I was a teenager and a young adult.  But over the course of my life, I guess I began to understand maybe that's true.  It only takes an individual to make a difference.  So I could gather this information about black people and their, their struggles and their accomplishments and I could keep it to myself, or I could do something to share it with other people.  And maybe by sharing it, something, I change something or somebody.  And so without ever knowing that it was going to be a museum in that sense, I just thought I would--I started just going around talking at churches and schools and wherever anybody would listen, basically.  And went--doing a lot--I was working at Saint Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri], doing a lot of traveling, and I began more and more it seemed like everywhere I go, I was finding out more and more stuff about this St. Louis [Missouri] connection.  I said okay, this has got to be done.  Somewhere somebody's gotta take all of this stuff and put it in a place where folks can have access to it.  I thought that I would mention it to some folks and they would say yeah, yeah, that's a great idea; let's do it, and that didn't happen.  Well that didn't change my idea that I thought it was a great idea and somebody should do it.  So I remember being in Baltimore [Maryland] one day at a museum [Great Blacks in Wax Museum; National Great Blacks in Wax Museum], at the museum there.  And there were a bunch of buses, probably four or five busloads of young people visiting the museum.  And those kids were so excited.  They were asking questions, they were taking notes.  They weren't being unruly.  Teachers weren't having to say stop, don't do that.  I mean they were engaged in learning about black history.  And I remember thinking wow, now that is the way to teach kids.  That's at least the way to get them interested.  And I again, I came back home and I thought about it and said wow, if ever, if ever there was gonna be a, a museum, a black history museum in St. Louis, that's what it ought to be.  Well I still couldn't get anybody interested and almost kind of dismissed it, the idea that it would ever happen.
Story_ID: 544790
Speaker 1: Now what year was it that you had the idea for the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri]?  You went to Baltimore [Maryland] when?
Speaker 2: Oh I think that was in probably 1985 that I went to Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Now the Baltimore museum you're talking about is a wax museum.
Speaker 2: It's a wax museum.  It's a wax museum, probably twenty, twenty-five years old now.
Speaker 1: What's the name of it?  I know I've been there.  I've seen the name of it, I haven't been there, haven't been there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's, it's called--why they've changed their name recently.  I think now they call it the National, the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: It used to be Great Blacks in Wax Museum.  So that's what I think--that's was when I first ever entertained the idea of a museum-museum.
Speaker 1: Well why was the presentation of black historical figures in wax more appealing than say some other--you know.
Speaker 2: Because by that time I, I had been to a lot of museums, history museums, art museums, science museums, children's museums.  And aside from maybe children's museums, I'd even been to other museums where they had life size figures.  They weren't in wax, they were out of cast kind of stone or that grayish mono, mono color, white.  The wax figures looked so real.  They just looked so real.  And people seemed to really gravitate to them.  People really seemed to, to like them.  Even though some people thought the eyes were following them (laughter), or the figures had moved from one spot to the other, they just seemed, you know, really attracted to them.  And, and particularly the young people were attracted to them.  So once they were attracted to the figures, then they wanted to read the stories.  That was the key.  They wanted to read or hear the stories, and that was the important part for me.  They wanted to know more.  And so I just thought that was just such a novel way to do it.  That if ever St. Louis [Missouri] could have one, then that would be great.  And, and of course as I said my--I thought it was great and I think some other people thought having a museum was great too, but I just couldn't find people who were anxious or willing to, to help do it.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I kept reading and writing and researching and visiting more museums and thinking about things that I had in my collection.  And asking people again to help and just the whole just, just keep, you know, keeping the whole idea in my head.  Finally, I think I said okay, if folks aren't gonna help me do this, I think it's important if nobody else thinks it's, thinks it's important.  I'll do it and it'll work or it won't work.  But I--at this point I have to, I need to do it.  I need to find out.
Story_ID: 544791
Speaker 1: You were working at that point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was working full time and I was finishing my master's [degree] at the same time.  That final, that year that I really kind of--
Speaker 1: And your master's was in what? What was your--?
Speaker 2: My master's is in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I was--without knowing it, I was also in the process of founding a museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri].  And it didn't even seem like a, a big deal.  It just seemed to be happening.  I, I kind of got a few people together who would serve on a board.  None of the people who I needed to have to serve on a board, that they--that all the books told you, you should have.  I started going to classes, started going up to a lot of museum conferences taking classes outside of my regular courses at, at Saint Louis U [Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri].  Visiting museums and starting to visit them and look at them in a much more different way than I'd been looking at them in the past.  And decided, you know, hey I could--we could do this.  I got enough stuff in my house to, to start a, you know, I know a little, I know how to read, I know how to write, know how to research.  I could do this, and I just need a little help, you know, a little help and a little money.  And both of them were pretty hard to find at that point.  But there were a few people who said, "Well, if you want to do it, I don't know anything about a museum, never ran a museum, haven't been to museums very often, but if you think it can be done, I tell you want I can do.  I got a credit card and you can take my credit card and go get some drywall.  Or you can take my credit card and, and buy some, some concrete mix and I'll be on your board."
Speaker 1: So did you have a space then at that point?
Speaker 2: I didn't even have a space at that point.  I didn't--I started looking for a space after I kind of got this board organized, then started looking for a space.  And actually it was Erika who found this space and she just kind of described to me a building that she had seen driving down the street one day and she couldn't even remember what street it was on, and she just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now who is this?
Speaker 2: Erika Neal who works at--that actually is my daughter.  And she just described kind of the direction she had been driving to a meeting and we got in the car one day and kind of retraced it and she said, "That's the building."  And this is the building we settled on.
Story_ID: 544792
Speaker 1: How did you finance it?
Speaker 2: It's not financed, it's paid for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's an interesting story.  Well once, once it was clear to me that I was gonna be doing a mu- a museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri], I thought it was important, one--I guess I just kind of had this same black liberation theory that you need to own your stuff.  We need to own our institutions.  And so it was critical that I own the space; I didn't want to rent space.  One, I thought that was just throwing money away to rent the space.  I also didn't want to have the threat of somebody coming along a year later telling me I needed to move out because they needed the space, or imposing a lot of other kinds of restrictions.  So it was important to own whatever the space was gonna be.  And it was critical to have space that would allow us to grow 'cause I knew that I was going into this process without very much money, and without a lot of other resources for support.  So this space became available.  I thought it was all boarded up like you, like you typically see city buildings boarded up when the city owns them.  And I thought that's great, it's probably one of those that I can get from the city for a dollar or something cheap.  Well as it turned out, it wasn't.  It was still privately owned.  And I guess unfortunately for them but fortunately for me, they--the people, the couple who owned it were in bankruptcy.  And when I offered them a--made them a cash offer, they were happy with the cash offer.  We had of course get the judge to take the property out of the bankruptcy suit.  I offered them money for the building.  They turned me down the first time, but they also owned a vacant lot that's directly behind the--across from the museum and I said well I would give them the, the price they were asking if they threw in the vacant lots.  And they said okay.  And we settled, and that's how we got the property.  So when made the offer, I had no money to close with.  I didn't know how I was gonna close.  I didn't have the money to, to give them what I had offered them.  As it turned out, the, the, the man who--the husband was a construction worker who had to move to Florida to work.  I think it was hurricane, one of the hurricanes back in the '80s [1980s].  And he went down there to do some construction work and had to be gone for about four months.  And so he--they asked to change the closing date, which was just fine with me, and that allowed me to accumulate some money from wherever I could accumulate it.  And, and by the time they were ready to close, I had the money to do it.  So we got this building, and it was a vacant building for seven or eight years and was in total disrepair, total disrepair.  And so I decided what we would do, we'd just take the first floor.  Because by this time, as I said earlier, I had been going around lecturing and talking about black history and then by, by now, by this time again even mentioning that I'd like to have a black history museum.  And so it was becoming important to have a space where I could now start to show what, what--tell these stories.  Fortunately, I had taken a class at the end of my master's [degree] program I had taken a sculpting class, just for fun, one.  And also because I, I told you I'd dabbled a little bit with making miniature figurines.  And I'd never had any formal class.  So I just--it'd be fun to take a sculpting class and see what goes into making these things.  (Unclear) they cost a lot and I'd like to see what goes into doing it.  So I took a sculpting class.  And fortunately we had our final project was to sculpt a bust from a live model.  And so I did that.  It was a woman that was my final project.  It was a good, good project, got an A in the class, did well.  And then of course we got to take, take it home.  Well I for maybe a year or so later, maybe two years, I had this head of a white woman in a plastic bag (laughter) in my, in my kitchen.
Speaker 1: Now what year is this when you take the sculpting class?
Speaker 2: This is '92 [1992] probably.  Yeah, 1992.  And so I'm carrying on--
Speaker 1: And when did you buy the building?
Speaker 2: I bought the building in '91 [1991], '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Didn't move 'til '97 [1997], though.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you--did the sculpting class come before the purchase of the building?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they, all right so you bought the building after the sculpting, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 544793
Speaker 1: So did the sculpting class success have anything to do with buying the building?  Say, "Hm, I can sculpt the figures so I might," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was, it's strange that it did not.  I just took the class, one because it was December when I finished my master's [degree] program and I couldn't, couldn't--you know you graduate in May, officially walk in May.  So I just took another class.  And I, this time I said you know, I'm gonna take a fun class, and so I did.  Not thinking that I was going to use it, but I, I always kind of like to know things and so since I had gotten involved with these miniature figurines, I wanted to know how they were made, what went into it and if I could do it.  Never thinking I was gonna be doing any sculpting as such.  But when I started to go through--I had a whole list of probably twenty-five or thirty black history people and events that I wanted open, use to open whenever I got the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] open.  And I started to check out having them done, having them made.  And I think the cheapest price that I could find of anywhere where you could get a, a life size figure made was about five thousand dollars per figure.  And I didn't have that.  I certainly didn't have it to do for thirty figures.  So I had, I had to re-prioritize things and figure out who were going to be the figures that we opened the museum with, and how--and I had to select folks who I thought would give a, although a spotty history, would give enough of a overview of the struggle and the history, that it would make sense.  Because we ended up opening with I think six figures.
Speaker 1: Now what were the six?
Speaker 2: They were--and they were Dred Scott, Harriet Scott [Harriet Robinson Scott], Elizabeth Keckley, George Washington Carver, Hiram Young, William Wells Brown and Aunt Clara Brown.  There were seven.  Miss Elizabeth Keckley, Elizabeth Keckley didn't like her space.  And so she fell right after we put her up, she fell.  And each time I put her back up, she fell.  And so I lost her, her--she shattered.  So I had to take her out, so we opened with six.  And I didn't put Elizabeth Keckley back into the interpretive program for probably a year, year and a half when I redid her and put her, and put her up and she, and she was comfortable with her space.  But those six, and then we did, we did in addition to those six figures, we did a, an interpretation of the Middle Passage because even though St. Louis [Missouri] didn't have a huge slave presence, we had enough of a presence to be notable.  And so I thought that it was important to, to talk about how we got here.  We didn't just show up in St. Louis and we, we, we came through the Middle Passage like everybody else came.  Like so many others, others of us came.  So we did a, we did a piece on that.  And we did some local history.  We showed some slave pins and things like that to kind of complement and supplement the six figures that we did.  Those were the first six that I did.  And then you know I'd have to go out.  Sometimes they were easy to do--
Story_ID: 544794
Speaker 1: What I did was I, I mentioned the bust of a woman that I'd done in the class.  That was what I'd learned to sculpt on.  I took that woman and I cut off her nose and her mouth and I gave her new lips and new mouth and new cheekbones, and it became William Wells Brown.  And then when I got William Wells Brown, and I found, I was lucky enough to find a place here in St. Louis [Missouri] who I don't even remember the name, got--who could--who took that original piece that I had sculpted and made a mold for it.  And he didn't even know how to do the wax stuff.  We had to get together, he and I and the people on his team, to find a way to, to--a, a resource for buying the wax and then figuring out how to pour it and mold (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is it hard to figure out how to get the wax and the, the--
Speaker 1: Well we found company, a comp- we ended up finding a company that where you could buy it in large enough portions to do it with.
Speaker 2: Now is the wax--does it already have the color or do you add the color?
Speaker 1: No, it comes out--it's par- it's beeswax, which kind of is a tinge of yellowish.  It's not white like paraffin.  And it's a little bit more I guess resilient than, than paraffin.  So once we found a place for the wax, and he, he, he, he is a company that if I recall, they do make statues and, and, and trophies and things like that.  So they were used to the molding process, they just had not worked with--in wax.  So then they had to figure out of course a little--a way to formulate the wax so that it would, would mold.  But so they made a silicone--once they took the, the piece that I gave them and they made a silicone mold for it, and then poured the wax in it and let it set.
Speaker 2: Now what do you--okay let me go back to the--so what, what is the--do you sculpt the initial piece in clay?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, in clay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Then--
Speaker 1: It's a soft clay, I do it in a soft clay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You make a mold--
Speaker 1: And then they would make the mold.
Speaker 2: The mold is the--is the mold made out of plaster?
Speaker 1: The mold is made out of silicone.  It's kind of a rubbery silicone, two part mold that they pour the hot wax.
Speaker 2: Then they pour the hot beeswax in, in that mold.
Speaker 1: And they let it sit and it just sets until it sets, until it molds.  Take that off, and then I would get it back from them.  And then I would do the hair and the eyes and the--paint the, the skin tone and put on the lipstick and the, the eyes, insert the eyes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's cosmetics on the face.  I mean it's paint and then cosmetics and a combination of things that make the, the natural looking color (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  I try to get as close as you can.
Speaker 2: Now if you, you have a figure, say we got Clark Terry behind us.  And what's visible of his body or his hands and his head, do you have to sculpt the rest of his body out of wax, or how do you do that?
Speaker 1: No, no just the, just those things that are visible are wax, and the rest are a fiberglass, the rest of it is fiberglass.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right and you can find like a part for a trunk and a--out of fiberglass already.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you kind of try to look for it, you know once you decide what kind of pose you think or what--how you want the message to be, you try to find something suitable.  But you're also--now you just can't find any mannequin because you want to have the right stature, the right height, the right build for it.  As close as possible.
Story_ID: 544795
Speaker 1: So that's kind of how we evolved.  We got opened with those six or seven eventually and started supplementing each year with a couple, one or two every, every year.  I don't do all of them anymore, I do what--when I'm in a bind for dollars, and I really wanna get somebody in like a couple of years ago I really wanted to have Madame C.J. Walker and I did, I, I sculpted her and, and did the whole thing.  So it just depends on what, what the figure is, who the figure is and what our financial resources are (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you do--
Speaker 1: Sometimes we do one, sometimes we do three.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you've done most of these.
Speaker 1: I've done over half, more than half, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, but then you, you do contract them out to other people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whenever we can--if we can raise the money to do it, to contract them out.  But if we can't, then I'll do one.  And, and some--the way we do it, we try to ask.  It's a way of getting the community involved, is we ask the community to recommend a person that they want to have in the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] and then to help us raise the money to do it.  And that gives them some buy in to the, the museum as well and they can--
Speaker 2: You say it cost about six thousand dollars to do?
Speaker 1: Well actually if, if I do one it cost about six.  If, if I have one done somewhere else, it cost about--the cost of an actual figure probably, well I probably don't want to tell you that (laughter).  Yeah, 'cause I have to do fundraising, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's considerable.  It is considerable.  'Cause you know the ones that I do probably aren't as pretty as the ones that somebody else does.  But you know they're, they're, they're detailed and they are very much--they're very lifelike.
Story_ID: 544796
Speaker 1: Clark Terry was here for his unveiling and he couldn't believe it was him, you know.  He said, "How'd you do that?"  (Laughter) It's--we did the last one I did, worked on was Percy Green [Percy Green II].  That's the one we're gonna open in November, November 10th.  And I--since he's still living, I actually did a life cast.  He came in and we had a casting party.  And he sat in a chair for about two hours and let me put plaster all over him.  And that--rather than having to sculpt the original cast, we just had his--just took it from his, his actual face.  So that one's gonna be pretty exciting to see.  The end result of that one, and that's gonna open in November.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay now, now Percy Green, now who, who is he in relative to, in relationship to--
Speaker 1: Percy Green is--the short story is in 1960 'til about '65 [1965], they were building the Gateway Arch [St. Louis, Missouri] downtown and they had no African American construction workers on the site.  Percy Green was a member and founder of an organization called ACTION [Action Committee to Improve Opportunities for Negroes], very much into the Civil Rights Movement, particularly as it related to equal employment opportunities.  So when he realized that there were no black workers on the arch, he another member of ACTION scaled the side of the arch, went up the arch and wouldn't come down.  And they had to call the police.  He was, they were arrested.  But what happened as a result of that, is there was a work stoppage on the arch and they would not go back, could not go back to work, did not go back to work until they agreed to hire some African Americans on that project.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that was forty years ago.  And so in celebration of that, they--we're celebrating Percy's actions on that, that, that--he's also the person who sued McDonnell Douglas for race discrimination in employment.  He lost his particular case, but the precedent that he set bringing that case, has become a landmark decision in equal--in employment cases.
Speaker 2: He's like the, he's like Curt Flood in that regard (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, exactly, exactly.  Until he brought that suit--
Speaker 2: Curt Flood, he was the same, he's--I don't think, I don't think he's from St. Louis [Missouri], but he was a St. Louis Cardinal.
Speaker 1: He played for the Cardinals [St. Louis Cardinals].
Speaker 2: Who, who--
Speaker 1: That free agency stuff--
Speaker 2: Yeah, established free agency in Major League Baseball [MLB].
Speaker 1: Absolutely, and people don't even know why these baseball players get so much money now.
Speaker 2: And he lost his job (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He lost his job.
Speaker 2: While everybody else got paid.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Everybody else benefited some.  Wonderful stories that we--
Speaker 2: And so is, is he here?
Speaker 1: Percy Green is here, he's alive.
Speaker 2: Now is Curt Flood--
Speaker 1: I don't know if Curt Flood is still in the area.  He's not in the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: No, no.  Yeah, that's what I meant, in the museum.
Speaker 1: Right.  He's not in the museum, but he's on our list.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have an ongoing list of people that we hope (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He changed that for the, the NF- I mean the Major League Baseball Players Association.
Speaker 1: That's right, absolutely.  That's, that's what we intend to ask.  We intend to ask.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But sometimes you know those folks don't want you to know how backwards they were, you know.  And so they tend not to wanna fund you because if you start to tell that story, then they've got an egg on--they've got egg on their face 'cause they should have been doing those kinds of things without somebody having to bring pressure, but they didn't.  And, and that's just history, you know, that it happened, and you gotta face it.  'Cause that's part of what I believe is problematic in race relations now is that we don't talk about those ugly things.  We don't talk about those bad things that happened.  And so we keep sweeping it under the rug and we just keep hating each other because we don't share those stories and we don't admit to our own guilt.  We don't try to come to grips with it and say okay, it happened.  How do we fix it?  We don't do that.  And until we start to do that, we'll just continue to be divided.  And St. Louis is one of the most racially divided cities in the country.  We keep making that list, we're high on that list, something like second or third on that list.  So we've got to, we've got to face those ugly things that, that have been a part of our history if we're gonna grow.
Story_ID: 544797
Speaker 1: As we sit here today, what is the status of the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: The status of the museum is that we are now ten years old.  It's been ten years of struggle.  We can--we started without the benefit of major corporate or foundation support.  We continue to operate without the major, the benefit of major corporate or foundation support.  It's a totally grassroots organization.  We have a board, we're a 501(c)(3), not for profit organization.  Don't have an endowment.  So like many black museums, we're struggling for survival.  We just are thankful to God for being faithful to us in that He just makes a way.  He just provides for us.  It's not easy.  I--some days I don't have twenty-seven dollars in the bank and if it were not for my faith in God, I would have closed probably seven years ago.  But I just kind of wait and He comes through, either with an anonymous donor who comes by with a ten thousand dollar check, or with somebody.  Just recently we had our tenth year gala, celebrating our tenth year anniversary and was awarded a thirty thousand dollar grant to do some work on the building.  Last year we got a, a surprise twenty-five thousand dollar grant to work on the building.  It's hard to do it that way because you don't know when it's coming.  You can't really plan.  So we have to have faith.  The only thing that I know gets us through is, is faith and the knowledge that God gives us the ability to do the things we need to do to keep going.  And I can't tell you that I don't get frustrated and some days just wanna give it all up.  And, and have said to God if you wanted me to do this, you would have come through with something.  Just like you do in any other thing in your life.  You know you question God and, and wonder why He does, you know he allows you to go through some trials.  But then when I just step back and get out of the way, He comes through.  So now I'm not saying to you that that's, that I wouldn't love to have a couple million dollars and an endowment and, and about ten staff people and you know the money to support all of that.  Because that allows us to do programming in the way that it ought to be done, and at the quality level that it ought to be done.  But we don't have that.  So we do the next best thing.  We do one thing at a time.  When we do a project, it's paid for.  When I, when we do an exhibit, it's paid for.  We bought the building, it's paid for.  So that the worst that can happen is that they can turn off our lights and our gas and our water.  But they can't come and take anything from us.  I mean it closes down with no lights and gas and water, but I figure at this point if we can't find somebody who can help us keep the lights and gas and water on, that people really don't appreciate what we do.  And I think people do appreciate what we do, and that's why every now and then somebody will come by with a ten thousand dollars, or somebody will say take the credit card and go pay the water bill.  I work full time, this is all I do full time.  It's not possible to do this and do it well and do another full time job.  I learned that the first year.  So this is what I do.  Sometimes I get paid, and sometimes I don't.  I have one other staff person who is a full time.  I try to make sure that that person gets paid.  But if it becomes an issue of my getting paid and the gas bill getting paid, the gas bill gets paid.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It's about--for me it's more about getting the stories out there.  It's more about empowering our young people.  It's more about being an example to young folks that if you commit yourself to doing something, you can do it.  For me it's about letting them know that money is not always the prime reason for doing something that you've got to love what you do.  That you can be making all the money in the world.  If you're not helping somebody, if you're not serving some good, and if you're not enjoying what it is that you do, you might as well forget it.
Story_ID: 544798
Speaker 1: I was asking you do you ever have sleepovers in the, in the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] and?
Speaker 2: That's not something we've done, but it's certainly something we've talked about doing.  And that and a number of other activities that, that we'd like to do just to bring people back to the museum.  And one of the things we started doing pretty early on just for that reason, was bringing in temporary exhibits.  So some--in addition to what we see that's, that's always here, we try to add new figures, new exhibits, but we also bring in traveling exhibits.  So that gives people who maybe haven't been here for a year or so, an opportunity to come back.  And then we try to use the museum to rent space out to other people, other groups, sororities, fraternities, youth groups and clubs who will come in and tour the museum and then have maybe a meal function.  Or like the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] had their annual meeting I think last year or the year before, and they brought in their youth group for a tour and some activities here around the museum.  So you know it's a small museum and a small staff, so we're limited in some ways what we can do, but we certainly got all these ideas of things we'd like to do.  And we think it's just a matter of time before we can really get down to doing some of those things.  You know, we need some more space and we're working on that little by little.  As I say, we just sort of, sort of go day by day, have some plans and we try to execute the plans when we, we think they're feasible to execute them in a reasonable way and with the resources that are necessary to do them.
Story_ID: 544799
Speaker 1: Okay, and you say you have an upstairs--the, the second floor is a big open area (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this building, this building used to be a Catholic school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, this school was built as Sacred Heart Catholic school in 1916.  And that's one of the beauties of the building and one of the attractions for this building is that it is so structurally sound that it's never gonna go anywhere.  But that's also one of the challenges because it is an old building.  Trying to renovate it, you know, brings some special challenges to it.  But the space is wonderful.  The upstairs is and was used primarily for their gym and auditorium and you know, community space.  So it's just big, open space that is the, the width and the breadth of the building.  Which when it's renovated, is going to provide an excellent space for us to use for our own programming, for lectures and poetry and, you know, spoken word kinds of things and, and for large scale exhibits.  But it also gives us another opportunity to rent the space out to the public for wedding receptions and, and parties and things like that that will provide a, a, an income source for the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] that will enable us to continue to do what we do in the museum here, so.
Story_ID: 544800
Speaker 1: Is there a favorite exhibit for school children, for young people that come in here?  Do they--is any one figure more popular than others?
Speaker 2: One, I guess maybe there are two and maybe for different reasons that seem to stand out, seem to draw the most attention.  One is the Middle Passage ship, the slave ship.  And of course that gets all kinds of reactions from, from visitors.  Kids ask if it's real.  Not if the ship is real, but if the experience, the activity, the event is real.  They've not learned, you know, that that happened.  And so we often get that question.  "Did you all, did you all just make this up for us, or did this really--is it real?"  And so they, you know and in, in--on the one hand, it's a pretty basic question.  On the other hand it gives us an opportunity to teach.  It gives us an opportunity now to share with them their history.  And for many of them, both black and white, it's a revelation.  Sometimes it--we find kids crying about it.  Sometimes we find black and white kids embracing each other about it, actually, physically hugging and comforting each other about it.  Sometimes we get people, kids and adults, who cannot tolerate it, who just can't handle it and are very angry about it.  So that's one of the more popular exhibits for a number of reasons.  And, and popular in different ways to people.  The other one that kids seem to be drawn to is the one that we feature York, who was an enslaved black man who traveled on the Lewis and Clark Expedition (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't see York.  That's, that's an excit- I'm excited about that, just hearing about it.
Speaker 2: The kids really like that one because I think, you know, it has this rugged, the Indian, the, the Native American kind of frontiersman's dress and the boots and the animals.  There are animals there.  It talks about the fur trading and there's some horses and of course there's guns and weapons and there, there--those are some things that I think they--many kids haven't related to, haven't seen, haven't an experience of.
Speaker 1: Well York came back and settled here in St. Louis [Missouri] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) York came back to St. Louis for a while, not sure what ultimately happened to him.  Some folklore say he went back to live with the In- Native American tribes.  Never quite--nobody's ever really pinned down what happened to him.  But he did come back here after the expedition in the hopes that he was gonna get his freedom, but that didn't happen either, so--his story did not--even after being such an important part of the--
Speaker 1: Now he, he was the slave of which one, Clark [William Clark] or Lewis [Meriwether Lewis].
Speaker 2: Clark.
Speaker 1: Clark, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, he was his slave.
Speaker 1: I know the book I read, the bio, said that Clark became--was drunk once and had York beaten for bragging about saving Clark's life out on the trip (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, he did--the story goes that he was beaten.
Speaker 1: And that's about the time that York decided to get out of there.
Speaker 2: He said that's enough.  I'm not gonna do it anymore, yeah, yeah.  Again, one of those unfortunate periods in our history that we need to know about, you know.  Not a good, not a good time and it's unfortunate that he could be such an important part of that expedition, and then come back to St. Louis and not get his freedom, and, and really kind of just fade into obscurity.  You know, nobody knows quite what happened to him.  It's kind of like, like modern day Vietnam [Vietnam War] or black soldiers.  I say black soldiers in [U.S.] military who go off and fight from Civil War on through every war we've had, practically, and then who come back home after the war is over and have no dignity, have no respect, have no rights.  So you know, things haven't changed a whole lot.  Things haven't changed a whole lot.  And we've got to start changing them.
Story_ID: 544801
Speaker 1: Now tell me what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community here in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: It's probably a useful hope, but a vain hope.  But I really would like, and I, I probably won't be around to see it.  But I would like to hope at least that St. Louis is going to move to a point where we are not so racially divided.  There's really no need for us to continue to be at odds with each other simply because of race in this, in this city.  St. Louis was a, a, an important place in the development of this entire country.  White folks played a part, but black folks did too.  Many things that occurred as a result of what we call western expansion, occurred because black folks were there, white folks were there.  So why don't we have respect for each other in the same way?  Why, why do we continually think that somebody's better than the other and somebody's lesser than the other in particular.  So I guess I would hope that at some point, I have two grandchildren.  One's six now and one's fourteen months old.  I would hope that at some point they would come--be able to experience a St. Louis that's not so racially divi- and not so blatantly racially divided.  I mean we are still--we just--and I don't know if you're aware.  We just recently--our first and only African American fire chief [Sherman George] was just--well I'd say forced to resign over a racial issue, which nobody wants to admit is a racial issue, but it's really a racial--it is simply a racial issue.  This is 2007, and we're still fighting.  Percy Green [Percy Green II] climbed the Arch [Gateway Arch, St. Louis, Missouri] forty years ago over racial issues.  We're still fighting over racial issues, and we shouldn't be.  I'm hoping for the day when young folks can experience a St. Louis that is free, somewhat more free of that than it is today.  I don't know if it will happen.
Story_ID: 544802
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: In my life?  I probably would have--I wish that I had been a little more active in the civil, actively active in the Civil Rights Movement.  Although I was fairly young, but I still think I was young en- I was old enough to have been more involved.  But I also would have gone directly to school, through school, college, grad school.  And probably would have finished a Ph.D., had I done it that way.  I, yeah I think I would have done that differently 'cause I think I would have gotten to this point quicker.  And that's me thinking that I would have gotten to this point quicker.  I love doing what I'm doing with the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] now.  And I wish--the one thing that I say about the museum and, and this whole project is that I wish that I could have done it a lot sooner in my life, but that's me talking.  I guess doing it when I'm doing it is when I'm supposed to be doing it.  But I keep having this notion in my head that had I gone directly to school and not gotten married and not had babies and not done some other wasted--done some other things in terms of career choices, that I would have been doing this, which I love more than any job I've ever had.  This is more gratifying to me than any work experience I've ever had.  And I, I keep saying I wish I could have been doing it so much sooner because it's, it's not only personally gratifying in that I'm able, that I can say that I founded a museum.  It's gratifying to me because I know that what I do makes a difference in the lives other people.  I know that what I do affects young people when they come in these doors.  I, I can see the change in folks.  I don't know how long it lasts, but I know that when they come in here, they've learned something different than they knew when they first came.  I don't know if it makes them do, behave differently when they leave.  I have to believe that.  So for me doing what I'm doing now, I can't think of anything better that I, that I would want.  And I just wish I could have done it earlier and that I had longer to look forward to doing it.

Speaker 1: Likewise when you look at everything you've done up to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh wow.  Do I have a legacy?  Well I guess this would be it.  And I'm, and I'm hoping that--one of the reasons I'm pleased that Erika [Conley's daughter, Erika Neal] is involved, is I'm hoping that when I'm no longer able to do this, or no longer can do it, or think about--have the ability to do it, that she will want to do it.  One of the reasons I have from the very beginning operated a, a youth heritage training program here at the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] ever summer, is to expose young people to this whole business of museum work.  And, and heritage preservation and cultural tourism is because I want them to understand the importance of preserving our history.  And hopefully some of them, just like I got the bug planted by Ernest Patterson years ago and, and N. Webster Mor- [N. Webster Moore] maybe one of them will want to do something like this as well.  They will see the importance of it as well.  So for me, my legacy is I hope that this, whatever impact I'm making by having founded this museum, will rub off on somebody else and somebody will want to continue to do this, or will want to try to do something like this that makes, makes them wanna commit to preserving our history.

Speaker 1: You talked about Erika [Erika Neal].  That's your daughter, right?
Speaker 2: Erika's my daughter.
Speaker 1: She works with you.
Speaker 2: She works here with me.  In fact when I first opened the museum [The Black World History Wax Museum; The Griot Museum of Black History, St. Louis, Missouri] in '97 [1997], she worked here alone.  I was still working full time at another job.  And she basically ran the place for the first, almost the first year.  She's a wonderful person.  She has a background in, in communication arts, worked in PR [public relations], and is just a great writer.  She's a spoken word artist.  She came into the museum probably thinking this is a job and there--you know, I get to write and I'll get to do some PR.  But now she's very much a part of all of the planning and development and programming that goes on.  In fact, she just recently was promoted to deputy director of the museum.  And now I think her passion for it is certainly not equal to mine, but it's, it's rapidly approaching being--she's almost as passionate about it as I am.  So I'm very--it's, it's one thing that I'm really, really pleased about.  That she has--she's been here with me for ten years, so she could have gone somewhere else.  It hasn't been very easy and I know she could have gone somewhere else.  So I'm really glad that she's here and I'm glad that she's finding this as a niche as well for herself, that I, that I see her--I've seen her grow in.  As I say, I just, just promoted her to deputy director.  So I have a lot of confidence in her ability to keep this thing going if I should decide not to do it anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we haven't covered that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You mean how much money I need (laughter)? You mean the address of where people can send checks or things like that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No basically you know as I say, we do fine in that we exist.  But I would like the opportunity to have enough money to have a budget that is a real budget, that has dollars behind it, and to be able to operate in the way that--'cause really our, our public deserves a quality product.  And you can't do that without, without adequate resources.  So yeah, I would encourage folk--I, you know.  You got some money laying around, send it to us; we can put it to good use, yeah.

Speaker 1: Now the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess just basically as someone who is fair minded.  Someone who is, is open and honest and who tries, who tries to relate to people in the way that is fair.  Someone who appreciates the goodness of others and who tries to be good to others as well.  I'm just a common, ordinary person who has been blessed to have God's goodness shine on me.  And I hope that because of that, that I share that with other folks, and that other people can see that in me.  If they see that and recognize that as, as real, then I'm happy.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Okay. Thank you.

Speaker 1: Now we have a shot of Josephine Baker up here.  Can you describe the Josephine Baker figure for us and just tell us a little bit about what she's got on.  You can take a look around, yeah.
Speaker 2: You mean in terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She's on the, yeah she's on the screen.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well Josephine Baker, you know the story of Josephine Baker is that most people relate to is, is that she went to Paris [France] and she became famous for her banana dance, and for, for baring her body and you know--but the fact of the matter is, she realized when she left this country that she couldn't, she couldn't really hone her craft here, and she wasn't well received.  So she went to France where they did receive black folks.  She did a, she did a banana dance, but she also was very much active in civil rights activities and both in the, in this country and in, in France.  We--I chose to interpret her story in that way that discounted, or not discounted, but certainly gave less attention to the fact that she was a banana, she danced in a banana skirt, but that she was a, a lady.  She was a woman who was actively involved in civil rights.  She cared about human beings.  She was a diva, if you will.  And that's why she's portrayed this way.  She of course adopted eleven, almost twelve, but eleven multiracial, well children of various races because she believed in the humanity of man and that people of different races could live together.  And the way that she could prove that was to raise young children all of different races.  She is in a dress that is not her dress, but a dress from the period, the 1930s that I wanted to show in this kind of splendor that she typically performed in.  Hairstyle, pretty much the kind of hair--the way she wore her hair.  She lost her hair, her natural hair at an early age, so her hair was always kind of cropped short.  So I portrayed her that way.  Again, just in a theatrical setting.  Have a young guy who helps me do the, the sets.  I kind of give him the concept of what I wanna create, and I cannot draw, but I scribble and he gets the idea and then he builds the set for me.  She is--her coloring and, and everything else is taken from research that we do in the process of building the exhibit, to see what she looked like, and how tall she is, her weight and so forth.  And this is what the result is.
