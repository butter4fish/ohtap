Story_ID: 9699
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your family origins?  How far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother on my father's side was Agnes King, and she had maybe, as I remember, three or four daughters and four or five sons.  And those sons were Woodie King, Sr., Joseph King, John King.  And I think when I was born, one of the sons had died.  And the daughters were Carrie King and Colleen King.  And I don't, I can't trace it back beyond that.  On my mother's side, I just remember my grandfather, William Johnson, and there was about six to eight brothers and sisters also, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are they all from the same part of Alabama?
Speaker 2: The, yes, yes, all around Mobile, Bladon Springs, Montgomery, in that area, yeah, Birmingham.

Speaker 2: Sorry to interrupt.  I won't do it again.
Speaker 1: Oh, I was--are we rolling?.

Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so all of your relatives are from around the same area of Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandfather very briefly, and I knew my grandmother very briefly on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that have passed down through the family about what life was like during the days of slavery or the nineteenth century or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, because my mother and father divorced or separated when I was very young.  And I went to Jackson, Alabama to say with a aunt, and so that's where I began school in 1945, '46 [1946], '47 [1947].  And 1948, what I remember is my uncles from Detroit [Michigan], coming down to get me and my mother coming to get me.  And the drive to Detroit.  That's my earliest, really memory of being with relatives, you know, other than an aunt who I was with in Jackson, Alabama.
Story_ID: 9700
Speaker 1: Tell us about, as much as you know about your father.  What was his full name?
Speaker 2: Woodie King, Sr.
Speaker 1: And when was he was born?
Speaker 2: He was born around 1897, 1898.  And he died in maybe 1962.  I think he was about sixty-five or sixty-six.
Speaker 1: So what was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a truck driver for City Sales of Mobile, Alabama.  And periodically, he would take me on those rides.  You remember that was before I moved to Detroit at ten years old.  And I remember those, not vividly, but I remember them, you know.  And we would be in this, this huge truck; had these huge bags of flour and other grain for the city of Mobile.  And that's what I remember vaguely, you know, not even precisely, but vaguely.  And he was, he was a, I think he was an alcoholic, you know, cause I can't find any other reason for me abhorring any kind of liquor (laughs).  And I can't stand for it to be around me, you know.  And I remember his death in 1962, and this hospital in Mobile, Alabama.  And I've written about it in short stories, trying to, in some way, come to some realization of what it was like, you know.  And vaguely, our last conversation in 1962 where we were trying to communicate, you know.  But by that time, I think I was about nineteen or twenty, twenty-one, my career and my focus had already fallen in place, if you will.
Story_ID: 9701
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your mother.  What was her full name and when was she born?
Speaker 2: Her name was Ruby Johnson.  And she married again, Dave Jones, but prior to that, the person who really--I had an affinity with was Milton Martin who was sort of like the numbers man in Detroit [Michigan], very suave, but they were very close for many, many years, all through my junior high school and even into high school.
Speaker 1: And so he was like a surrogate father to you--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and when he died, she married Dave Jones, and, you know, but by that time, (unclear) I was getting ready to get married myself and move out, you know, on my own.  But it was--
Speaker 1: So what was your mother like?  I mean what--(unclear) ?
Speaker 2: She was a domestic, you know, and worked in a furniture store in Detroit .  And periodically, you know, walk her home--it wasn't that far from where we lived, and I would walk her home and walk her to the furniture store, as the man of the house in those intervening years, you know, what I mean, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how did she and your father meet (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I really don't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay, she never--they never had a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about Milton Martin?  I mean--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: All I know is that when, in 1949 when I came to Detroit, when they brought me to Detroit, Milton Martin's brother was married to her sister, you know, Leatha, who owned a cleaners, her and her husband, Tom Martin, owned a cleaners.  And Tom was Milton's brother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but you and Mr. Martin had a pretty decent relationship.  He was kind of a--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah--yeah.  He was, he was there.  He was always cool with me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he'd take you places and stuff?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did he take you places?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't take me places.  But we were cool, you know.  At one time, vague memory, he wanted to change my name to Woodie Martin (laughs).  But I don't know, but I think my mother iced that right away, you know.
Story_ID: 9702
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did, did--did you live in--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: In Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We lived on the lower east side, and the area was sort of like--now, when I arrived in Detroit in 1949, we lived on the North End, okay.  And the North End was Oakland, Euclid.  The schools were schools like Bright Meyer, Moore School for Boys.  It was like the small places.  The theaters were like Echo and the Grant Theater.  The stores were like Barthwell's Ice Cream, you know.  I mean places that you never dreamed of in Alabama, and the--in these little town in Alabama, you know.  So school was about discoveries and finding theaters and discovering new friends and realizing that this was a new kind existence.  My best friend was a guy named James Grady.  He lived across the hall.  My auntie's friend was a guy who would come by periodically, and he knew he was gonna go off to the [Korean] war.  He was gonna off to--it was 1949 or '50-something [1950], he was gonna go off to the war and kill some Koreans, you know.  And I remember him returning, you know, always sad, just very sad, one of those wars that had not been declared.  And then my auntie's husband returned after being away, you know.  I don't know if he was in the army, but, you know, you know, I know all those things.  So, but it was--the North end was about discovery.  And after being there two or three years, we moved to our own lower flat on Heidelberg Street on the East side.  And then I went to another school, Barbara Intermediate School and Smith School and discovered things at settlement houses.  That's where I became so enamored with settlements, like the Franklin settlement house where I learned how to play basketball and a whole new discovery of friends.
Story_ID: 9703
Speaker 1: Coming to Detroit [Michigan] at, in the, like nine or ten years old, I think, I came, but coming from the South, you were automatically put back in school because, you know, schools in Alabama were supposed to be so terrible.  And in the North you were put back.  So one embarrassing, I guess, time was like, I was ten years old and in the first grade, you know.  And whatever it was, my mother made sure that I went to summer school every year cause I loved school.  I went to summer school every year right up until high school and even tried to go to summer school going to high school, but they, they iced it that first year of high school.  So I think the reason I was reason to come out ahead of the system was because of my love of education, my love of learning, you know, stuff like, you know.  So--.
Speaker 2: Was this intrinsic or did you have anybody trying to encourage you to go to school?
Speaker 1: Well, there was always that teacher.  It was always--at Smith School, Mr. Yarborough, a white guy and his wife, Mrs. Yarborough who taught science and he might have taught math.  And a Mr. Finger who taught art, who was a great friend of Hoyt Fuller's. Who later, as I grew older, and I guess Hoyt left Detroit and started working in Chicago [Illinois], remembered this Mr. Finger who taught me art.  I would draw--I was very well known for my art in those days at twelve and thirteen years old, if you can be known for your art in school, you know (laughs).  So my art was what kept me going, you know.
Speaker 2: So what grade school did you finally graduate from, did you, you know, finish up in?  You named a, quite a few of them-- ?
Speaker 1: Well, the elementary on the North end was Bright Meyer [Detroit, Michigan].  On the transfer school, was Smith School.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, you transfer from one--when you move in Detroit, you have to go to another school.  And the intermediate school before high school was Barbara--like a woman's name, Barbara Intermediate.  And then out of that, I went into sort of like a very specialized high school in Detroit.  And, you know, I, I don't know if you--a lot of people have heard about Cass Technical High School [Detroit, Michigan].  So I was that, you know.
Speaker 2: That is the most famous high school in Detroit.
Speaker 1: (laughs) right, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Cass Tech, I, you know, I started to say it, but I, when you started saying that, but Cass Tech, yes, I--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: So because I had exceptional grades.  I probably got dumb after I got to high school (laughs), but before that I had exceptional grades, you know.  And, okay, and in high school, it was again, the discoveries of rhythm and blues, the discoveries of gangs, discoveries of women, you know.  It was like discoveries, you know, these things that you realize that now you were a part of something much bigger.  So--basketball, I was on the basketball team, not very good, but I was on the team, you know.
Speaker 2: That's good.  I mean not everybody make the team.
Speaker 1: Right (laughs), right.  So Cass Technical High School, and I came out of the--I guess the great thing is I came out ahead of a system in a sense that was set up to destroy you, you know.
Story_ID: 9704
Speaker 1: You mentioned gangs, were the gangs a big problem for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a Warlord.  So I, I didn't have to fight.  I was just, I would go and negotiate what was gonna happen.  I mean I ain't even got my suit dirty.  You know, and I was--you know, then it was like, I had a paper route.  My mother always--I was the only child.  My mother made sure I had money.  I was the best dressed in high school, the best dressed, you know, year after year.  And so the gangs, they would recruit you, and you had to become part of a gang or a rhythm and blues group.  You had to be part of something.  Otherwise, you'd be destroyed.  Not only were they not gonna let anything happen to me, I was a Warlord, you know.  I would say what's gonna happen, plan it; go over and do negotiations and then go home or go hang out with my girlfriend (laughs).  They would do the fighting (laughs).
Speaker 1: So you wouldn't do the fighting?  You--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, the Warlords didn't, you know, you didn't have to do that.
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the gang?
Speaker 2: The Jokers.
Speaker 1: Jokers, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, and the terrible gangs at that time, as I remember, was the Chili Macs, the Shakers, the most notorious gang of all, you know, and the Shakers, my closest friend became a member of the Shakers.  And there, of course, there was never gonna be anything, no fighting between us.  We were (laughs), you know, we were running buddies, you know.  And during high school, we discovered the social clubs.  And I came, became a member of a social club called the Hexagons.  And again, we were very close.  This, this was in the mid-'50's [1950s].
Story_ID: 9705
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school?  Probably drafting, probably math, probably--if I could say English, you know, I would say that was it.  You know, those were three of my favorites, drafting, English, and I must have been very good in machine shop because recruited right into the Ford Motor Company a day after high school.
Speaker 1: So when you were--so you--were you still involved in art in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But I wasn't in the art department.
Speaker 1: So were you involved with theater at all in that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, had no idea I was gonna be involved in theater.  I mean I graduated in 1956, and I might have seen the movie with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis in 'The Defiant Ones'.  And I must have seen it at least six or seven times.  I ain't never seen anything like it.  And that's, that, that defined my career, you know.  And then to read Sidney Poitier's bio of how he had gotten where he was.  And I think when he made 'The Defiant Ones' he was twenty-five years old.  Like I said, I am eighteen, and he's twenty-five.  And he's nominated for an Academy Award, you know.  And you say, wow, if this guy taught himself to read, taught himself to speak English, lived on roof tops in New York, had nothing, you know, and had worked himself from nothing, from seventeen to twenty-five years--he had done three or four films then by the time he was twenty-one or twenty-two, then there's no excuse for me not to be able to do that just by working hard, you know.  And--.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're working for Ford at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was recruited right out of high school.
Story_ID: 9706
Speaker 1: I graduated [high school] June, 1956, July, I was at Ford [Motor Company].  They came, and they recruited, give you these jobs, you know, really--I was a arc welder and a checker, you know, where all you do is, like, you know, go around and put white chalks on these frames that these old black men welded.  And they teach you how to be cruel to old people, you know.  You know, you know, it's not--this is not right; do it again, you know.  And you watch these old people get laid off.  They were worried about getting laid off, and the six of us, man, I guess--from 1956 to 1959, we could work anytime we wanted to.  We could work ten hours, twelve hours.  I mean can you imagine, like, at that time, making four or five hundred dollars a week, you know.
Speaker 2: That was considered a good job, for somebody black to be able to make--(unclear) (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, you know.
Speaker 2: You were doing (unclear) if you were--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I worked midnight to--first, I worked from four to midnight.  Then I worked from midnight to 8:00 a.m. because then I wanted to go to school.  And I went through all kind of hell to get in drama schools and all that cause I, I was enamored, you know.  So I would come from work, go direct to the library.  And I would stay in the library, go to sleep in the library; wake up and read some more.  I had discovered theater, Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Fred O'Neill and all the people in Detroit [Michigan] who had migrated from New York.  So it was about finding them and touching base with them.  It was like a unbelievable discovery, that right there in my midst that people like Elmer Forrest Parks and Len Powell Lindsey, who had left New York, you know.  And you see their picture, you know.  And early works by Ralph Ellison, you discovered, you know, Richard Wright.  You know, one thing leads to another.  So, I guess my leaving Ford Motor was, was timely.  It was a major explosion, and a lot of people were killed.  And, and it was right in the plant, maybe a block from where I was, right, where these frames had gone through this paint.  And this paint had chemicals in it while the welding was still hot, and they blew up, killed a couple people.  One of them was my friend, you know.  And you start saying, wait a minute, is this what I want?  Is this what I want at twenty-one years old?  No way, man, you know.
Story_ID: 9707
Speaker 1: Now, now were you driving yourself about all this?  I mean did you have any friends interested in theater or any--(unclear)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, once, you know, once I, once I knew theater was what I wanted to do, and, and then I had to get in the drama school.  So, of course, I tried three or four, but they didn't deal with black people.  And then you read the local black papers, and you start seeing the names keep appearing.  David Rambo, in the Rambo family.  And David Rambo sort of like became a very, very close friend.  Tony Brown, Ron Milner, who I realized you had to have someone who wrote.  So I worked with him.  And then the local white theaters, and then Cliff Frazier became my very close friend.  And we acted in plays together.  And then Reverend Malcolm Boyd and--but still I was trying to get into a drama school.  And I went out to Bloomfield Hills , Michigan, a place called Cranbrook Academy [of Art].  It's a part of Will-O-Way School of Theater [sic, Will-O-Way Apprentice Theater].  And, and there was this old lady named Theresa Way Merrill.  And Theresa Way Merrill was in a wheelchair.  And we must have talked about writing and the theater.  And she gave me a four year scholarship and actually paid me to go to drama school.  So I said, well, if I got this, I really don't need Ford Motor Company, especially since all that tragedy and all that stuff had happened there.  And I could get another job where I didn't have to wear no white coat and all that, you know, just go to work, man, in the city of Detroit [Michigan].
Story_ID: 9708
Speaker 1: Now you're in art--I mean in drama school full time.  You've got a scholarship--?
Speaker 2: And working, and working for about--after I get the scholarship, I work about six months more at Ford [Motor Company].  But, you know, then it's like driving home at 8:00 o'clock in the morning.  You're nodding now at the wheel.  You could have a accident, anything, you know, sleepy time, man.  So I said, "Aw, man, this is not gonna work," you know.  And so it was very difficult, you know.  And I'd gotten married, man, you know.  So it was very hard.
Speaker 1: So this is about 1960?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1960, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did you do all four years at the drama school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I, I went to school all the four years, got my degree.  But you, but it--six months after I left Ford [Motor Company], I went to the city so it was infinitely easier, you know, 'cause you could, you could bullshit, you know, you didn't have to go through,lots of--so you could draft--you're working for the city.  You wasn't making any money; went from making four hundred or three hundred or four hundred dollars a week to maybe two hundred dollars every two weeks (laughs), you know.  But you get all those other things, you know.  And--(unclear).
Speaker 1: You have benefits and stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, now that I retired, I can't get any of those benefits.  That was prior to, prior to all these laws that's going in, you know.  So it's weird, man, but I'm still working on it.  But anyway, so I had the scholarship, and I went there.  And while there I learned that, I guess, that it was all white, but in the school was three other black people.  But the days I was there, it was all white.  And the days Elaine Jackson was there, and my--and Philip Hayes Dean, who was--went on to become a very well-known writer, and Eric Saunders and Cliff Frazier.  So it was the other four and me, right?  But while I was there, it was no other black people, right?  So the lady that gave me the scholarship, she must have died a year or so after she gave me the scholarship, and her daughter and son took over.  But we'd have these long talks, you know.  And we would talk about literature and other areas of theater.  And I told her I wanted to be an actor.  And she said why be, why don't you just learn how to stage manage and produce and do all those other things, you know.  And as I did, I just started liking it, having that kind of information, you know.
Speaker 1: It gave you a slightly different perspective.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, a different--a different angle of vision as they say.
Story_ID: 9709
Speaker 1: So what did you end up doing with that?
Speaker 2: Well, I ended up starting a theater in downtown Detroit [Michigan] in 1962 called Concept East.  Concept East, we produced new works, original works, works I would see, cause we would come to New York every summer just to hang out for three or four days or a week or whatever, you know.  And I would come back with plays, and we would them there.  And in 1964, two years later, we had a huge hit in the theater.  And that play was by Reverend Malcolm Boyd.  And it was called 'A Study in Color', was one of them.  And the other one was called 'Boy'.  And we toured these plays to, through the Episcopal Society for Racial and Cultural Unity.  And we went all over the United States.  So again, I went back to--after only three or four years making big money, cause I was the producer.  I was the director.  And the Cliff Frazier was the director, and he was one of--we were partners, right?  So we--the, the minister who wrote them was acting in them, and we only had to give half of our fee to the Episcopal Society.  We kept the other half.  And we ended up, ironically, of all places, in New York.  And we thought it would be very, very easy in New York (laughs), you know.  We were staying in these huge apartments that the church owned.  And we had a hit show.  And the same job I had in Detroit as a draftsman, I could do it in New York and make three times as much money.  But little did I know the rent was three times as much (laughs), right?  The cost of living was three or four times as much, you know.  But I did get a job at Pratt Whitney Aircraft.  I got a job as a surveyor in Brooklyn. [New York]  But as soon as they would read a review that I was in, I would get fired.  But in New York, the person on this side of the street hates and the one right across the street will hire you and double.  And the one across the street have no idea that you just worked across the street.  So you, you begin to learn how to negotiate New York, you know.  And I guess that's what happened in those early days, you know.  And--I was always working.  I was never out of work.  I either worked as a draftsman or a surveyor or I was in a play.  And then I got a John Hay Whitney fellowship.  And in that John Hay Whitney fellowship list of awardees, again, Hoyt Fuller's name appeared.  He got one that year, you know.  And Wayne Greis (ph.) and Rod Rogers, all people I knew, you know, vaguely.  And so we came together, and we found out Hoyt was in Chicago.  Rod was, of Detroit, was now in New York.  Wayne Greis was now in New York, and we all became very good friends.  And simultaneously, me and Cliff Frazier had a hit show.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the same Cliff Frazier that's in Chicago [Illinois] now acting?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's different, this is New York Cliff Frazier.  The one in Chicago is not even related.  I talked to him about that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so things are--so now we're about nineteen sixty--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Four [1964].
Story_ID: 9710
Speaker 1: So how long did this show for the Episcopal church last?
Speaker 2: Oh, we must have ran about a year and a half on the tour.  And then we sold out in New York for about six months, five months.  And a year and a half, and another five months, you know, where you're making a lot of money every week.  And we got an apartment on Eleventh Street and decided to take our shot at New York.  And at the very same time, I think we were so disillusioned because of the [President John F.] Kennedy assassination.  I think that's why we wanted to get away from Detroit [Michigan] and places like that, you know.  And we thought, I guess, if someone can assassinate a president, you better do what you want to do now.  And if theater is what you want, you've got to do it, you know.  You go after it, whether you get it or not.  So [President] Lyndon Johnson was setting up something called the real Great Society--the Great Society program.  And [U.S.Congressman] Adam Clayton Powell was like really in power in New York, and he was setting up poverty program units.  And these poverty programs units was in Brooklyn [New York], Harlem [New York] and the Lower East Side of Manhattan [New York].  And Robert Hooks, who had sort of like become very, very popular as an actor and had a training program for young kids and had really taken one of Gwendolyn Brooks poems, 'We Real Cool', and expanded, he and Barbara Ann Teer, and made a whole evening of theater with young people, and got a unbelievable amount of visibility.  So Adam Clayton Powell had contacted Robert Hooks about running a cultural arts section at one of these programs, especially one on the Lower East Side of New York.  Robert Hooks was not gonna take no full-time job because his acting career was at such a ascendancy.  It had reached--it was like really going.  So he asked me, and asked the people to talk to me.  They talked to me, and remember, I had come out of Will-O-Way [Apprentice Theater, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan].  So I had their formula for setting up a drama school.  So I used their formula, got it to Adam Clayton Powell's office, got to the people Robert Hooks told me to get it to, and they bought into it and made that the model for the cultural arts programs of both Bedford-Stuyvesant Mobilization for Youth and I think, HARUAC.  I was put in charge of the cultural arts program and mobilization for youth.  And what they did at putting me in charge of it--let's see, I was twenty-five, oh, yeah, yeah.  What they did was they said, you had to be twenty-five, graduated from a drama--you know, how they make the rules based on who you are, right?  That's always good, you know.  And so I got the job, and I think at that time blacks were put in charge of things, and they really was learning while they were doing it.  We were really learning while we were doing it.  But I think because I had come from this literary place with this knowledge of association with people like Langston Hughes and these poets and all these people who I had got to know in Detroit [Michigan], just through luck, I would ask a thousand questions.  And in putting together a program, people say, you got to get a good lawyer.  So I got--I got two or three lawyers put on my payroll.  Ah, you got to get a good accountant.  So I got two accountants put on the payroll.  You can't do everything.  You got to hire people.  And so I hired the best dance teachers, the best acting teachers, the best sculptures and artists, the best filmmakers, right?  And so pretty soon we had a full kind of program in dance, theater, music and art.  And each one of those departments was filled with young artists between sixteen and twenty-one.  And because we had these kind of people who, if they taught dance, the kids come in, take a dance lesson, tomorrow night, they'll see them on television.  So their teachers were role models, if you will.  And Cliff Frazier was one of the teachers in acting, Edmund Cain was one of the teachers, Lonnie Elder taught playwright and Douglas Turner Ward, all these people, you know, came.  And we sort of like captured the imagination of festivals abroad.  So I was able to take thirty or forty kids to Rome, Italy.  That's when the airlines would give you tickets for nothing, tons of publicity.  Hemisphere in Canada and San Antonio, Texas, I mean, and these kids were just winning awards and all that, right?  So, but still periodically, I would appear in a play, you know.  'The Great White Hope' I appeared in on Broadway, off Broadway, 'The Perfect Party'.  Then in Negro Ensemble's [Negro Ensemble Company, Inc.] 'Day of Absence' and 'Happy Ending', you know, things like that, American Place Theatre [New York, New York], 'Benito Cereno', 'Brothers to a Dragon', John O. Killens's 'Lower Than the Angels', so in those places and in those settings, you know, I got to meet people like Ralph Ellison, Robert Penn Warren, Robert Lowell, and because I knew literature, I could talk to them.  And so they would, began--they would invite you places because, you know, if, if you go to--you hang out with these people, you got to know what you're talking about.  So somehow, I guess I knew a lot about what they were talking about, and so they wanted some, kind of young appearance, I guess, in what they were about.  So I was acting in those plays, and my program, mobilization, was so visible, and I don't want to say it was successful because I would rather for someone else to say that, but so many of the kids in that program went on to other things of greatness, right, as actors, as dancers, as musicians, you know.  And they got in Broadway shows and always, it came back to where they got their start from.  And this sort of like gave, not only my program visibility, but the organization in which the program was a part of.  And so the, 'Mobilization of Youth' director really embraced me.  And his name was Bertram Beck, and he was asked to run Henry Street Settlement because Henry Street Settlement was a old-line, cultural institution, and here was a poverty program that had, in a sense, found a way to reach the imagination of cultural critics in New York, the whole off, off-Broadway movement now was being embraced with black people in Brooklyn, the Lower East Side and Harlem.  And so we were all just, you know, just in one melting pot doing it, right.  So he was asked to come to Henry Street and run the Henry Street Settlement, the whole thing.  So he asked me to come in and run the arts program.  So I moved over to Henry Street Settlement.  And in moving over to Henry Street Settlement, he knew I was into theater.  He said, why don't you make it sep--make a separate corporation and what--if you did that, what would you make it?  I said, I think I would, according to history, make it a free theater and call it the New Federal Theatre modeled after the old Federal Theatre project.  And, of course, he helped me, and we began in 1970.  And we had a hit every year from 1970 to 1979.
Story_ID: 9711
Speaker 1: Tell us briefly about the old Federal Theatre Project.  I think that was like significant to (unclear) (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Okay, under the Work Progress Administration (WPA), [President Franklin D.] Roosevelt, they tried to find ways to put blacks on the government payroll.  And one way they did was have theater.  And that, the unit that, that, what the blacks, would call it 'Negro [Theatre] Unit'.  However, the 'Negro Unit' was run by [caucasians] Orson Welles and John Houseman.  They had a huge hit in New York, 'The Voodoo Macbeth', but they did a lot of other things in different cities.  I think [James] Theodore Ward out of Chicago [Illinois] was a member of it.  Certainly, Leonard Depaw (ph.), you know, was a member the run, 'Run Children', Hughes Allison, 'The Trial of Dr. Beck', plays like that, you know.  So it was free.  All you got to do is go and see it.  And people got paid a little amount of money for being in it.  So I thought artists should be paid expenses at least, and be on a payroll and supported by the government.  I felt that, should have a open-door policy, and that the public should not have to pay to come in.  So for the first three years, that's what we did.  Again, that had never been done in the theater.  So it really jolted the New York establishment and, and they were really open arms for what we were about.  So our first play that was a hit was a play called 'Black Girl' by J. E. Franklin, and later made into a movie and brought an unbelievable amount of national attention to the New Federal Theatre.  We followed that up with--that was in '70 [1970]--'71 [1971],  '72 [1972], '73 [1973] we had a hit with a play called 'The Taking of Ms. Janie' by Ed Bullins, which won the Drama Critics Circle Award.  And I think it's the first time a community kind of theater had won a Drama Critics Circle Award.  Then our next play was so huge, it went all over the United States for two or three years, a play by Ron Milner called 'What the Wine-Sellers Buy', that we had been nurturing, and Fran from Detroit [Michigan].  And I mean it really worked. And we went everywhere.  And the black community across America just embraced us, so in Chicago--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You're right.  It was a big deal and whenever--it came to Columbus, Ohio--Cincinnati [Ohio].  It was all over the place.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and so the New Federal Theatre's name just spread, spread, you know.  So what we thought was, my God, this could be our forever, you know, this could--we could just reach everybody.  It was the beginning, and it didn't have, it didn't have anything but positive connotations around it, very positive.  And then the next year, we had 'for colored girls [who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf'], which was a hit for three or four years, you know, all over the world.  So the New Federal Theatre in reaching out to women writers and those who had not had an opportunity before, started getting scripts from everywhere, all over the world, scripts from London [England], Australia, Canada, in addition to across the United States.  So we started getting great scripts in, you know.  And we started doing Asian writers, David Henry Hwang, 'The Dance and the Railroad'.  We think we were the first to produce him, you know.  Don Evans, you know, plays that went on to other things.  So, you know, so, so for, for a while, until the white theater world discovered this is the way to do it, by using us as role models, you know.  It's like, somebody said, "It's almost like Little Richard singing 'Tutti Frutti' and [singer] Pat Boone coming along after."  I said, "Oh, is that all you have to do?", you know. (laughs)  So we made mold, and they just came along and said, "Oh, that's all you have to do?  We'll do that."  And that's how that thing sort of shifted.  We're for--we're always reinventing and in, and inventing.  And so each time I went out after that, I had to discover a new way to do it.
Speaker 1: Well, why did you have to discover a new way to doing these things?
Speaker 2: Because, you know, the '[What The] Wine-Sellers [Buy]' and 'for colored girls' did so well, the theater owners wasn't gonna let us come to their theater again unless they owned it, you know.  It's like if you go to a theater, I mean in those days you could go to a theater, the Studebaker [Theater, Somerville, Massachusetts], and rent it.  Not any--you can't go to the Studebaker and rent that theater.  You can't rent the Shubert Theater in Chicago [Illinois] anymore.  They said, "No, no, no.  We'll take a percentage of the gross, and if you fall below a certain amount, you got to give us this amount," which is like, maybe thirty thousand dollars or thirty percent of the gross.  So if you gross 400,000 dollars, and they're getting thirty percent of it, you know what I mean. (laughs)  So, and you say, "Wait a minute, if they getting thirty percent of this, I got to do everything else out of my seventy [percent]," you know.  You can't do that.  You can't do it anymore.  That's why the so called urban-circuit plays, you know, it's like, I, I sit back and laugh.  I know the, the guy's--who put it together, he's the writer, he's the director, he's the lead actor, you know.  He's trying to get them churches in there.  The play will gross six or seven hundred thousand dollars.  He ain't making that.  Whoever owns the theater is making that, you know.  He may make his hundred, but he's got to rip off everybody he got in the company and pay them nothing if he wants to get in something.  You can't, you know, it's very sad, man, it's very sad, you know, what it's come to.
Story_ID: 9712
Speaker 1: Now, in the late '70s [1970], you were involved in a movie about The Last Poets?
Speaker 2: The late '60s [1960s].  I, I did a movie called 'Right On! [The Original Last Poets'] with The Last Poets.  And these were the original Last Poets, David Nelson, Felipe Luciano and Gylan Kain, and the movie was directed by a friend of mine named Herbert Danska.  And ironically, The Last Poets, it's sort of like being rediscovered, if you will.  They just did a documentary on A&E [Arts and Entertainment cable network] about The Last Poets, right?  It's so weird.  And they're all on the thing, man, and I remember when you couldn't get anybody to come in and see them, you know.  We would try to put these records out, have to sell from the back of our car, you know.  Yeah, but we did that movie.  It's still, I think, buyable.  I think it's still unique and different; the only film ever made on poetry that was released in a theater, black poetry, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And you were writing quite a bit--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Articles.
Speaker 1: And during the, from the six--through the, from the, I guess, the late '60s [1960s]--(simultaneously)--?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --through the '70s [1970s], through now.  I mean, you know, you still--I mean you put together anthologies of plays--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I put together a lot of anthology plays, starting with 'A Black Quartet' in 1969, '70 [1970], a 'Black Drama Anthology' I did with Ron Milner; a 'Black Short Story Anthology'.  Then I did plays for the black theater I did with Third World Press and 'National Black Theater Anthology' [sic, 'National Black Drama Anthology:  Eleven Plays from America's Leading African-American Theaters'] I did with Applause Books.  Scenes for black actors, from black theater, for black actors to use, called 'Echoes' and 'Voices and Echoes' ['Voices of Color:  50 Scenes and Monologues by African American Playwrights'], you know, those kind of books, you know, about fifteen books I, I do, you know, about five films I've done.  But, yeah, you know, you have to--when the theater gets very rough, I'll do a book.  When the publishing world gets very, very rough, you know, I do a play or a movie, you know.  So, you know, the system can't close you down totally because, you know, I'm very comfortable in making films.  I'm very comfortable in publishing books and anthologies.  I have a new book coming out in July 2003 called 'The Impact of Race', and a subtitle, 'Theater and Culture' and Applause Books is doing this.  It's a big book, you know.  I've been working on it a long time.  But those are the, the anthologies and those are the films, and those are the plays and play productions that I've been actively involved with for twenty, twenty-five years.
Story_ID: 9713
Speaker 1: In addition to your business acumen and your aggressiveness about going and getting these things done, it's not easy to get a book published or get plays produced, but you have a, you also have contacts that span the United States basically cause you're--starting in Detroit [Michigan], I guess, gave you--and you know people all over the country--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: I mean it's not--it's--well, can you talk about that? (laughs)
Speaker 2: Okay, that--well, I mean if I talk about a list of friends in London [England], talk about friends in Johannesburg and Durban [South Africa] .  Salailo Moretti (ph.) and a whole group of artists who came over here in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], we embraced because they were fighting the whole apartheid craziness, just as we had fought, when we started the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power Movement.  So we sort of like embraced and became a part of that movement.  In the public eye, in the Black Arts Movement, there was no one more powerful, more visible than Amiri Baraka, and I produced all of his plays.  So that's a certain kind of association that we got.  And then in France because I do things on national tour, we have friends and associates in these other countries, but again, they're going through the same thing we are, you know.  So if I get one play in France in ten years and one and two plays in Africa in tens years and two plays in Australia in ten years, then everybody thinks, oh, my God, he's doing all this stuff.  But, you know, the--it's not like a lot of stuff, but it is being visible, you know.  So you know what I'm saying, so, so, yeah, I have these--I mean you might come here and, you know, have lunch with, yeah have Salailo Moretti from South Africa or John Coney in Winston Ntshona who's in Brooklyn [New York].  He directed here in, in the Africa series I did.  You know, that--and so it's not unusual.  You know, it's like it's not unusual for you to come visit South Africa and I'll be staying with Salailo for that week, you know what I mean, because it, it's, it's all one place.  It's not with, you know, or the Caribbean, you know.  It's not--it's all one place.  It's not like, it's not divisive.
Story_ID: 9714
Speaker 1: The theater is a universal language.  When you take a play from, I mean written by black Americans, say about black American life, to South Africa or to France or some place, does it translate?
Speaker 2: In South Africa, our struggle against a racist society is similar to their struggle against apartheid, okay.  And the reason so many South African plays were able to relate an American audience because they found an artistic and a fierce voice in articulating it.  After America in a sense became segregated--I mean became integrated, you noticed that the dramas of our integrated life ceased to exist on the American stage.  The fall of apartheid has sort of like, in a sense, lessened the effect of South African drama.  So it's gone back to its old state.  In America though, I think Dr. Richard Long talks about this all the time, we are trans- urban.  When we migrated North into Chicago [Illinois], Detroit [Michigan], New York, Harlem [New York], you know, Indiana, you know, these cities and South Central Cali--in Los Angeles [California], as a trans-urban people we have what Paul Carter Harrison talks about as a African continuum.  This African continuum is an unspoken communication.  We can embrace whiteness, we can do all those things, but there's a common language if four or five black people are in a room.  And that's that African continuum, you know.  It's like it's a part of who you are.  You will react to an amoral situation because black people are basically a moral kind of a person, not matter how hard they try to be otherwise, and that, in a sense, is integral to what we are about as theater people.  And I wish I could articulate it as well as Dr. Richard Long and Paul Carter Harrison, but it is definitely true.  And when we did plays like 'Black Girl' and like 'What the Wine-Sellers Buy' and 'for colored girls [who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf]' and plays like 'The Taking of Ms. Janie' or the Ed Bullins cycle of plays, no matter what city we're in, black people say, "Oh, that's about my uncle.  That's about my cousin who lives over--ah, man, you all know my cousin, John, over across the--Ed is writing about somebody in San Francisco [California], you know.  August Wilson is writing about somebody in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], but there's this common African vibration, if you will.  And to the, to the extent that we, who produce these things, we who write these things are able to vibrate with our surrun--surroundings, is how we deal with something they call esthetic, okay.  When we, when we are no longer able to vibrate with these surroundings we will cease to be the artists that we want to be.  A perfect example of that is I always say, is the whole poets of the '60s [1960s], how they could articulate what they wanted to do in a one-page poem; how a Gwendolyn Brooks might be able to articulate the unrest of young kids in 'We real cool/we quit school/we jazz june/and we'--you know, how she was able to articulate that in six stanzas.  Or how Gwendolyn Brooks was able to articulate the migration from the South to the North to the new clothes, to the new feeling, to the beauty of it in the 'Sundays of Satin-Legs Smith'.  It's no different, you know, or  Haki [Madhubuti] 'For Black People and Negroes Too', you know, how he's able to--or 'Ego Tripping' by Nikki Giovanni.  It's all the same, where a writer, an artist is able to vibrate what the people can relate to, you know; or Quincy Troupe in 'Train, Train, Run-A-Way Train', about [John] Coltrane or 'Changes' or, or [Amiri] Baraka 'Nation Time, Nation Time', you know what I mean.  It's like when we, when we--like why are we able to do that?  It's because you deal with artists like, and producers, like Abena Joan Brown in Chicago [Illinois, at ETA Creative Arts Foundation].  Okay, Abena will relate to politicians, the white power structure, in board meetings and in the evening, she'll sit at the bar and deal with a bartender.  You know what I mean?  So it's cross cultural, it's trans urban, and she can do that in any city she goes to, okay--total comfort.  Now, once we lose that ability, we're embracing something that we're not, you know what I mean?  Once we lose--and your art is gonna reflect that on stage.
Story_ID: 9715
Speaker 1: You wrote and were featured in 'Black World' quite a bit during the '70s [1970s], and there was a annual theater roundup issue, you know, and you were on the cover of one, if not a couple of them.  And 'Black World' seemed to be--that period of time seemed to be like a golden age of theater in a sense.  I mean what did you think?  Do you have the same sense of that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean 'Black World' was our organ.  It was a way of communicating across America.  And 'Black World' had at its head one of the most clear-thinking brothers imaginable.  He knew who he was.  Hoyt Fuller knew his politics, knew who he was, knew what the black contribution in America was, knew literature and knew the value of those literary icons, okay.  And so whether he was able to communicate this with John Johnson who owned the publication became the linch pin in this whole thing.  But black theater across America has that, again, in something called the [National] Black Theatre Festival in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  At any one time, you may see twenty-five or thirty thousand people coming to this one place in one week to reacquaint themselves with each other and with the black theater and its esthetic--it's esthetics, you know.  So I would say it is happening.  I would say what is happening though is the best of each city is now sort of like focused, you know, like it may be twenty-five or thirty theaters around America and in the '60s [1960s], it might have been two hundred.  But all of them were not producing at the capacity.  All of them were not run full time as theaters.  You know, a professor in a college might have had to do two plays in a little theater because he couldn't do it on campus.  He would do it off campus, you know, with graduate students or whatever, you know.  But that focus is now on those people who make theater their lives.
Speaker 1: So it's stronger now, you think, even though, there's not as many, but they're more institutionalized theaters?
Speaker 2: I think it is stronger now, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned, in terms of--you used Abena Joan Brown as an example of someone who could negotiate the business world and the academic world and then still come back down to the, talk to the bartender and the people on the street level--(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and that seems to be something that is done in these black community theaters that hadn't been done before, I mean on a--I mean we've always had black actors going back to Ira Aldridge, but--they were doing [William] Shakespeare and other things.  And the, having our own story on stage has a particular importance.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You know, and black audiences talk back to the stage and do all kinds of things that don't--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: There is a corroboration of who you are, you know.  That's why the people say, talk to me, speak to me, tell them about it, because all that person did on stage, either as a writer or as an actor, it communicates so well what that audience is feeling, they have to talk back, you know.  And these kind of producers exist for these kind of plays like Ron Himes in St. Louis [Missouri], Marjorie Moon at the Billie Holiday Theatre in Brooklyn [New York], Dr. Barbara Ann Teer in Harlem [New York], you know, and Walter Dallas in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Ed Simpkins in Philadelphia--Al Simpkins in Philadelphia, Gary Anderson in Detroit [Michigan], Jackie Taylor in Chicago [Illinois], along with Abena, these people really know about blackness, and they love them, they love blackness.  You can't hate black people too long and produce the kind of work they've produced over so many years, 'cause black people when you don't like them.  They can say, well I, well "I'm not going to that theater.  You know, why should I go sit somewhere where they don't like me," you know.  They come back to Abena's theater [ETA Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], time aft--Jackie's theater [Black Ensemble Theater], time after time, you know.  So that, that's this trans-urban thing that Dr. Richard Long talks about, that's sort of like inculcated itself into the world during the great migration.  And I think it's that great migration in the '30s [1930s], not the one in 1919, 1920, the one prior to that.
Story_ID: 9716
Speaker 1: Did you have to go through any changes as a producer in, I guess in the mid-'70s [1970s]?  In the mid-'70s [1970s] or late '70s [1970s], starting about 1980, there were theater groups, black people in theater groups were talking about toning down the rhetoric in theater, say, there were some people who actually thought they were--and actually said, maybe were being too black or something, you know, theater.  You ever had--you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: No, no, I never had to deal with that, right.  But I've heard of people who had to deal with that.  You know, it's like, I don't know.  It's like anything else.  You negotiate a system in which you are working.  Otherwise, you get out of that system.  You know, it's like that--I learned from Harvard Business Review once, right.  They had a course in, in that business school and said (phone ringing). I forgot where I was.  Where was I?
Speaker 1: Okay, Harvard [University] Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that this company is going to go bankrupt.  It can go bankrupt in one year.  It can go bankrupt in ten years.  It can go bankrupt in twenty years, okay.  And these, this is, these are the roads you go down.  It's gonna be rough, okay, but of these three roads, decide which one you can negotiate, you know what I'm--okay.  The other one is we gonna put up this building.  It's gonna cost fifteen million, it's gonna cost twenty million, it's gonna cost twenty-five million, okay?  Decide which one you want to put up because getting it up is gonna be rough, no matter what, (laughs) you know what I mean?  So you say, okay, if I do these things, I can get this building up for fifteen million.  I don't have to spend twenty-five million, you know.  Okay, so--you know what I'm saying.  So putting on a play, raising money, whether I come to you as an individual or go to a foundation, a foundation wants visibility for their giving.  An individual wants to be acknowledged for his giving.  He's not too interested in telling you what to do with his giving, you know.  Okay, a lot of people want to believe if Joe Blow gives me some money, he's gonna tell me what to do.  I don't believe that.  First of all, I would never put myself in a position where Joe Blow could actually come to me and think he can tell me what to do, you know.  I'm not interested in being friends with Joe Blow.  If I got a theater, I'm interested in putting this play on.  I'm not interested in being Joe Blow's friend.  I'm going to him just like I'm going to another, another three hundred people to get money to do this project.  And if this project is a [Amiri] Baraka's or this is 'The Trial of One Shortsighted Black Woman' or if this project is Ron Milner's '[What The] Wine-Sellers [Buy]', this is what I'm going to you for.  And if you put money in, you can't come back and tell me, well, I didn't know Ron Milner was cursing this much in his play.  Or I didn't know Marcia Leslie has this Mammy role in her play.  Hey, it's not any, it's--either you give me the money or you don't give it to me.  Either you read or you didn't read it, you know what I'm saying.  Then, you can't come then and say, I want my money back, you know.  Now, I might--and a lot of people do this, they will say, give me half now and half later.  And that's stupid, you know.  Why would you even take it?  Do it with the half now.  You ain't gonna never get the half later (laughs).  So, so what I'm saying is, this, this system is so corrupt, so easy to manipulate, so in need of being in the bed with white people and being in partnership with white people.  You know, there are brilliant, brilliant white people who really just love what we're doing.  They don't want to come in and tell you what to do.  Look, he'll say, look, I'll work with you.  You know, there are--and these, I mean, there's no actor more brilliant than Nick Searcy in the world; one of the most brilliant actors.  And he went all over America with us doing 'I Have a Dream', playing all the white characters in the villains, the sheriff, [Theophilus Eugene] 'Bull' Connors [sic, Connor] and all that.  Because he's not like that, he can do that.  James Kirk Bergwall, brilliant actor, you know.  These are, these are white guys who know what they're about, you know, Otto Pirchner (ph.), who died, you know.  These are, you know, guys who gave--Joseph Papp had to be one of the most brilliant guys.  He'd sit me down and talked to me for hours about shit, man, you know, because if you know his background, you know what to talk to him about.  You can't go and say, "Do my play, Mr. Papp."  You got to go in and say "Look, man, when you used to play jazz, when you used to be in the Communist Party," you know, you got to go where they are, you know, (laughs), you know what I'm saying?  One of the--most playwrights, man, they, I mean they send me plays, they never even been to the New Federal Theatre.  They ain't interested in coming to New Federal Theatre.  They just want their plays done.  I could read five pages and know--I say, "Damn, this person never been to the New Federal Theatre.  I would never do this play.  Why would they even want to waste their time sending it to me?"  And you aren't gonna ever see no play on the New Federal Theatre stage about some white guy and a black guy fighting because they hate each other because of the color because I know that's not the issue, you understand?  That is not the issue, you know.  You'll find, hey, man, these two guys, this white guy is in a boat.  This black guy is in a boat.  They're in the middle of the ocean.  The boat's got a hole in it.  What are they going to do to get that boat to the shore?  That's what I'm interested in and race ain't got nothing to do with getting that boat to the shore, you know, (laughs) you know what I'm saying, right.  So that's what I'm interested in, man.  So when I put on these plays, man, when I go after money, it's like these people are interested in--and black too.  Bill Cosby ain't gonna tell you what to do with the money.  Sidney Poitier, when he gives me money, he, he just want me to do a good job.  Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee just want you to do a good job, you know what I mean, and don't leave them embarrassed.  I mean for twenty years I produced with Henry Street [Settlement, New York].  All Burt would say is, "Look, man, I mean don't get Henry Street no trouble, you know, by putting on plays that all these people want to come down on us and the government's not gonna give us any money."  That's all he has to say.  You don't have to tell--he's not interested in what I do, you know.  You know, it's like we have here one of the largest Jewish communities in the world, Lower East Side of Manhattan [New York].  Why would I do a play about Jewish people and black people fighting?  It would have to be so brilliantly written, and then I'd probably talk to the rabbi around the corner who's my friend, you know, and say, "Look," you know, we, we're sitting having coffee.  "You want to read this?"  "Yeah, I'll read it," you know, because even though he's rabbi, he's just a--we just, we're just coffee buddies, you know what I mean.  And just, you know, it's not like, "Well, my God, he's a rabbi, so and so and so," you know.  And he's reading the play.  He'll say, "I think you should do it, wow," you know.  (laughs)  So if somebody come down I say, "Look, this guy okayed the play.  He likes it, you know," stuff like that.  But what I'm trying to say is, it's a matter of negotiating within a system in which we are working, which we make our living.  We're not here for a short time.  I been doing this thirty-five, forty years, you know.  So it's like I know the rules, in a sense, because I was a part of making the rules.  Because in theater in New York, like if you say, "Okay, this is the way we gonna interview theater people," okay.  If it is successful, within a year, everybody will be doing it.  Within two years, the union will put a set of rules on how it's done, exactly the way you, you laid it out.  It was no rules when you laid it out.  Now, you do it five years later, and you come back, and they say, "Uh, Larry, you got to do, you got to do it like this and this and this."  And you say, "Yeah, yeah, I know that."  "Yeah, but you got to sign this paper now because that's what we--"  "Wait a minute I know that.  I'm, I'm, I'm the one who initiated that ten years ago when you all didn't have no rules."  "Yes, but, you know," (laughs) you know, you know what I'm saying?  That, that's all it's about, you know.

Speaker 1: One of the dilemmas that face a lot of black theater companies that start on the community theater level is how, is whether or not to take a successful show to another level of production, to another house or sometimes to another city, and, you know.  Those are--a lot of companies have crashed in trying to do that--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --because of union rules and other things (unclear).  How do you--what advice do you give anybody doing that?
Speaker 2: Well, the advice I would give is don't take the theater company's money to go to the other city, you know.  If you have a hit show and six or seven people say I like this show, here's a couple hundred thousand dollars to take it to Cleveland [Ohio], Detroit [Michigan], then you do it.  But if you got money in the till to do two other plays at that space, that's what you do.  You don't, you don't take that money and do some--and gamble with it.  It's like going to a slot machine down in the Bahamas or somewhere, you know.  You know, it's the--all the things you learn--, speaking of slot machines, in places in Gouville [Sur-Mer] France where I had films and--I go over there, you know, I'm the only black guy in the casino.  The casino is so racist, okay, with Africans and black guys, you can win three or four thousand dollars, right, because if white people say, "Oh, if that black guy can do it, I could do it."  And they'll go there and lose everything.  Now, the average black guy, if he's in France or the Bahamas, he wins three or four thousand dollars, he thinks he's gonna win ten.  Now, if you quit immediately on a, on a grand or two thousand, they will actually follow you out of the casino offering you all kind of deals to come back and play some more, you know what I mean?  Now, the, the trick is to know how much you've won and when to quit. (laughs)  It's the same way everywhere, you know what I mean?  The trick is, "When do I quit?  When am I satisfied," you know.  And they say, "Well, come back tomorrow, we'll give you all these discounts.  We'll give you all these coupons."  Sure, you go back tomorrow, you gonna lose all that three grand back, you know.  You take that three grand, pay for your vacation and have a good time and they realize their racism is the cause of that.  You don't go back.  You know, you, you want to cheat them other white people, cheat them because they are racist cause they say, "Aw, man, this big ole black guy won all that money.  He can't be any smarter, so I'll go over to the blackjack table and win twice as much, cause I know I'm smarter than he is."  But the system lets you win.  But they aren't gonna let you win everything, you know what I mean.  It's like, for example, we have a hit show, okay.  The critics will say, "It is great.  You should move it to--from Jackie Taylor's theater [Black Ensemble Theater, Chicago, Illinois] to the Regal or you should move it from Jackie Taylor's theater to the Shubert [Theater, Chicago, Illinois]."  Okay, the system says that with all the reviews, right?  Okay, now, the Jeff Awards come out.  All the nom--not one person in nominated.  Okay, you say, "Damn, they, they told me how great I was.  But I don't get no--well, hey, you're great, but you're not as great as John Jones, white, you know, and we can only nominate five, you know."  Or, "Denzel Washington did one of the greatest jobs on Antwone Fisher story, I mean it is great."  Not one nomination.  "But hey, he's not great as Michael Caine, he's not great as Jack Nicholson.  He's not great as Martin Scorsese or Roman Polanski," you know what I'm saying, because when you get the awards, that makes you a part of history, you know what I mean.  And you ain't gonna be no part of history, you know?  It's a sad kind of commentary on the state of art, the whole state of moving shows, as you said, from one place to the other, you know.  I will only move a show if the money comes in from somewhere else.
Story_ID: 9718
Speaker 1: A lot of groups have done that and have sunk, you know--,
Speaker 2: Of course, you know.
Speaker 1: --cut their season off and ended the show for a bigger venue and they got union rules or a higher level of rent to pay and all that.
Speaker 2: But you cannot do it unless the money comes from somewhere.  It's no, it's no big mystery.  You operate your theater on a million dollars a year, okay?  You get a hit.  To move that show into that theater costs a million dollars.  So if you take it out of here, when that's gone, you ain't got nothing.  You out of business until two or three years later.  Plus, you out of business, plus you owe money because it's gonna cost more than that cause you gonna try and get that money back, you know.  It's, it's one of those catch-22 things, you know.
Speaker 1: What would be your assessment of community theater today, I guess, in the black community?  There are theaters that have not, you know, become quote unquote professional theaters in the sense that they are unionized and so forth.  And there's an ongoing debate, I guess, back and forth among some black actors and theater performers, about whether it's better to become active equity or to say in at the community level.  I mean what do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's like community theaters are usually about institution building.  A actor is about a single job.  A director is about a single job, a single play on, director, a single job as a director, okay.  I don't think, when you try to build an institution, you are necessarily about providing employment for someone.  I mean the arts, especially black art, has very seldom been able to support someone.  All great artists have other jobs, you know.  And you may have a breakthrough novel that will take care of you and take you (unclear), but the, that breakthrough novel means you got to teach.  I think Haki is one of the most astute businessmen to be able to build a press into Haki Madhubuti into what he's built it in, but he's a professor.  He's been a professor at both Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and now Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], and, you know. I think it's--that's where you'll get your benefits and pensions, because if you had to sell all your books, you'd be putting out [Jacqueline] Susann, Jackie Susann books, you know.
Story_ID: 9719
Speaker 1: What's the biggest challenge for you as a producer?
Speaker 2: Getting the manpower with the knowledge of how to do these things, getting people who are experienced in musical theater, who know how to put a show on for a hundred thousand dollars and know how to do one for two hundred [thousand dollars] or a million [dollars].  And you won't find many who really have the experience, doing it at a million, you know.  And I don't--and once you reach into, reach back for those kind of budgets, you can't have anyone learning on you.  You won't have that kind of time and energy, you know.  They could only learn, for example, if you deal with an actor or a writer who never appeared on Broadway [New York, New York], they don't know the rules.  So they come in expecting one thing and they waste your time and energy when they discover it's not like that.  A lot of artists make you challenge them because they really don't know about money and fame.  They want who they are corroborated.  They, they want someone to say, wow, I wrote this play, and it's successful because I wrote this play or it's successful because I'm the lead actor, and I made it successful.  That's what they really need.  They need all those disappointments in corroborated through their art.  And it's not about anything else.  And those are very difficult challenges, okay.  I mean a lot of times I've gone and raised money--it might have taken me two, three years, and lose the whole budget in four weeks because the director and writer didn't get along, you know.  And both of them the same age, and each one thinks he can tell the other what to do.  That's not gonna happen, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's something that happens in all fields on some level, but ego deprivation and some of the problems associated with that are really, they really do go on in the black community--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Right, right, they really go on in the black community.
Speaker 1: --cause people don't get enough attention.
Speaker 2: Right, they need that attention, you know.
Speaker 1: When they finally get to a certain level, you know.
Speaker 2: They been a, they've been a failure all their life in everything, and that success will corroborate them in the eyes of their woman, their mother, their father, their family, and they need that, each person needs that.  And I--well, since each person needs that, each person want a fight to get that.  And as a producer, once that fight begins, that's the end of that project.  You can't, you can't resurrect it.  You just got to get out of it and move on.
Story_ID: 9720
Speaker 1: In this vein, can you give me the evolution of--now, you took one project basically, I think it started at basically level, a small level, and went all the way to Broadway, and that was 'Checkmates' played by Ron Milner.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you were, you were really involved with that one. So can you talk about that one?
Speaker 2: Okay, well the evolution of the play is Ron Milner and I started off in theater in Detroit [Michigan].  We can argue and we can fight, but we know ultimately that the product on stage is what's gonna keep us together, right?  Ron Milner will work on a play from the day of rehearsal right through its run.  He never stops working, you got to appreciate that, you know.  It's like we started on it, at ETA in Chicago [Illinois].  By the time we got to Atlanta [Georgia], it was restructured again.  By the time we got to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], it was restructured again, you know; San Francisco [California], restructured.  Restructured--not that much, but always trying to better the play, and right on to Broadway [New York CIty theater district], six, seven theaters.  I mean what we remember is we're doing it in Chicago.  We're doing it with Abena [Joan Brown], someone we love, okay.  So that's what you--it's no money in it, it's (unclear), you know, cause we're doing it in, with Jack Jackson, in Los Angeles.  We're actually living in a one-room building, sleeping on the floor.  So when money comes, you can't say, "Ron, you ain't gonna get your share."  He can't say, "Woodie, you ain't gonna get your share," you know what I mean, because we've been through too much. You know what I'm saying?  So it's like, "Wow, man, we talk everyday, you know," it's, it's those kind of things, right.  And so the development of a piece like 'Checkmates' is about our continuum working, our continuum listening, our taking this little bit from the actor or that little bit from the actor, sharing it, you know, and I'm like all artists--and I, I, you know, I would say as a producer-director, I'm an artist, there are things that I want to happen when I pick up a play and decide to do it.  As a writer, there are things that he might not want to happen.  So how do we compromise, you know?  Those are the questions, those are the difficulties.  And then you have ultimately on Broadway, someone like Denzel Washington playing the lead or a Ruby Dee playing the lead or a Paul Winfield or a Marsha Jackson playing the lead.  They bring a certain amount of knowledge and cache to this project.  You take what you can and, you can't, you can't go up to Denzel and say, "Don't do this," and he, that's--his life is on this, you know what I mean.  You can't say, "Don't do this or do this or"--you can't demand, you negotiate.  That's what art--artists do not understand that, whether it is Ron Milner or whether it is August Wilson or Morgan Freeman or Al Freeman [Jr.] or Ruby Dee, you know, there's a respect for these artists.  You got to have this resp--and this respect is they know what they're doing.  Now, to take a 'Checkmates' an ETA [Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] to five other cities and end on Broadway, people would say, "It's a miracle."  But it's because we believed in the play.  Now, we get to Broadway and some critic says, "It's one of the worst plays I've ever seen in my life, you know.  It is horrible, it is horrendous.  How did they ever get--?"  But we've been to every city, we know that ain't true.  So what is it that is so bad about it now, okay?  There are inner thoughts on what we are in this business this about and these are inner thoughts of how we negotiate and live, you know, and white people have never seen these kind of black people before, you know.  So if they've never seen these black, kind of black people before, the only thing they can do is say, "I don't like it.  It's terrible."  They aren't gonna go and learn about them.  They want us to go and learn about [Anton] Chekhov, [Henrik] Ibsen, [George Bernard] Shaw, you know.  And that's what we'll get in school, you know.  We have to go and learn about--you think they'll go and put Aime Cesare in there, structured, they're gonna put August Wilson and Ron--no way.  You know, they aren't going, they won't--you know, they aren't gonna put Wole Soyinka or the Derrick Wolcott as a part of the study thing, you know.  No, no, you got to come through Ibsen.  You got to come through Shaw, you got to come through Arthur Miller.  You got to come through Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard.  So they come out of school and they're critics.  And if Ron Milner is not talking like these people, but talking to black people, "Aw, it's horrible, I hate it."  So those are the kind of things that you come through, and you have artists like Ron and I that, I mean a young artist just getting out of school, it would destroy them cause they would believe it.  Artists like Ron Milner and George C. Wolfe, August Wilson, bad reviews from the 'New York Times', say, "Hey, we know the play is gonna be done all over the world.  'Checkmates' is being done everywhere cause there's a truth in it, you understand?"  (laughs)  So that's a, that's a--you know, if I thought the New York Times was right, then I would say, Abena [Joan Brown] don't know what she's talking about.  And I know that's not true.  I would say Jack Jackson don't know what he's talking about.  Denzel don't know what he's talking--I know that's not true.  Ruby Dee, come on, you know what I'm saying (laughs).  Okay, that's what's--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So you have to taken criticism in stride.  You got to consider where it comes from in the cultural context of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, in cultural context, yeah.
Story_ID: 9721
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, my hope is that starting with the young people who are in the black community, that they will believe in themselves.  They will have a firm knowledge of who they are as a black person, and what we've come through to get where we are.  For middle-aged black people, read more, listen more and communicate more.  For older black people in the black community, pass that knowledge on to young people.  Do not sit on it.  You know, if our women, in a sense, talked to us as men and told us the things that they tell their kids, we'd be way smarter than we are.  We assume that we know, you know.  No, share what you feel, share what you know.  You know, I try to mentor two or three young people every year, whether they're playwrights, actors, whatever, you know.  And some of them go on; some of them go into other fields.  But, you know, it's like this is information.  I mean we are, in a sense, teachers.  I mean, I mean that's all we are.  You know, we hope to live through some student out there, our continuation, our--this African continuum we were talking about, you know.  We hope to pass it on and watch them succeed, you know.  You know, if you see a, a brilliant, brilliant actor like Denzel [Washington], you really see he's learned from Sidney Poitier.  You saw Sidney Poitier live through Juano Hernandez and James Edwards, (laughs) you know what I mean?  And you saw that continuum, you what I mean?  And you say, "Wow, man," you know.  The dignity that James Edwards brought to something, Sidney said, "Oh, wow, if he can do it, maybe I can."  Denzel said, "Man, Sidney brings so much dignity, if he can do that, I can," you know what I'm saying?  So it just passes on.  So another young kid will say, "Whoa, man, Denzel, if he can direct and bring that kind of dignity, maybe I can."  So that's it.  You know, you don't see these negative images constantly parading before, so you say, "Oh, wow, I can't do it cause no one's done it before me."  So those are three levels that I would hope we could embrace as a black community.
Story_ID: 9722
Speaker 1: You've mentioned quite a few people you've worked with.  Maybe I can get a quick reaction about some of them, you know.  I know talked a lot about Abena [Joan Brown], Jackie Taylor and some of the others.  What about--I know last night you were at an affair for Amiri Baraka.  Can you give us a quick, kind of--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on April 17, 2003, a group of people, four hundred--five hundred roasted and toasted Amiri Baraka.  Among those who roasted and toasted him, of course, was Mayor Sharpe James of Newark [New Jersey], Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, Ronnie Clanton, Phyllis Yvonne Stickney, his [Baraka's] son, Ras Baraka, Obilisha (ph.) Baraka, and just a host of political honchos in Newark, and about four hundred people in the room who had dinner, or spoke on stage, etc.  It was very moving, very inspiring.  People really who came to roast and toast him, really ended up paying tribute to who he was as an artist, as a person, and as a teacher.  And that was inspiring to me, you know.  I was the host of the evening, and I think I got, in a sense, selected as one of the hosts because I've done all of his plays, you know (laughs).  And Sonia Sanchez was gonna try and make it.  Ed Bullins was gonna try and make it, Ben Caldwell and Felipe Luciano, but I think that even though they could not make it, they are close, close friends of Amiri.  I think Haki [Madhubuti] was supposed to make it.  I don't know what happened, you know.  But again, it was hard getting back and forth into Newark Airport for some reason yesterday.  I don't know what it was, you know.  But, yeah, yeah, I worked Amiri and the roast and toasting was very entertaining because it ended up being a tribute.
Speaker 1: Now, the arts, the black arts community seems to be a very tight-knit community, and why do you think that's true, I mean at this juncture, cause I don't think it always that tight, you know, when you look back at our history?  But it does seem to be, seems to be a very tight-knit community.
Speaker 2: Well, if you say it's tight-knit, I assume you have done some investigating and know that.  I don't necessarily know that.  I mean we know a lot of people in the arts community, and we are close because we don't want anything from them other than we share information.  We don't, you know, we don't go and infringe our time and impose ourselves on them, and they don't impose themselves on me.  So I don't know how close we are outside of the traditional, you know, you know what I'm saying.  I, I just don't know.  I mean that's--I would say, if you say that, I agree.  I just don't know, you know.
Story_ID: 9723
Speaker 1: Sir, of all your works, what did you get the most enjoyment from doing or what do you are the best things-- the most important one?
Speaker 2: Well, I think producing 'James Brown in Africa' , producing Zora Neale Hurston at Cape Coast Castle in Ghana, you know, watch--you know, on top of where it's, the  people were put on slaves ships and actually taken out of the dungeons on this ship and put on the Middle Passage, and being on that cape coast and actually almost hearing voices, of being down in those in dungeons and almost hearing those voices.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a play that you all (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And James Brown is, it was James Brown the artist, where we traveled to Liberia [Africa] with James Brown and entourage of twenty, was picked up in London [England] by Liberian Air and arrived in Liberia.  On the road going from the airport into town, as far as you can see, people was lined on each side chanting, "James Brown, James Brown, James Brown," and at the airport, from the time we got off the airline.  And I think what you feel is, you're standing, and there's an unbelievable feeling inside that, as a producer, I made this happen, you know.  And so when you do a play, whether it is Ron Milner's play in rehearsal, at the back of the theater, when the audience swoop to their feet cheering, black people, now, you know, and you say, oh, wow, I made this happen.  That's what you get as a, a producer, you know.  And so when the reviews come out or whatever, and they say, they hated it, it really don't matter cause you what you seen.  And you long for that feeling again and again and again.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you consider yourself as having a certain theatrical style or a certain philosophy of theater or?
Speaker 2: No, no, your philosophy is based on who you are, from--a play must corroborate who you are.  You know, another guy can come run this theater, and his whole philosophy is totally different, you know.  But in the plays that I produce, you will see a certain familiarity, you will see a certain family.  You may see women trying to come together to overcome some odds.  You know, whether it's 'Black Girl', 'for colored girls [who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf]', 'What the Wine-Sellers Buy', you'll see a father missing.  You'll see these elements.  You will see these elements where what they must overcome is far greater than they ever imagined.  And the only way they can overcome is by being together.  So you will see this over and over again as a theme.  And, but as a philosophy it usually is a writer committed to writing making these statements, you know.  You, you, you know, you start losing interest.  This person only wrote one play, and he's trying to become a millionaire on it, you know, you're not really (unclear)--even if he becomes a millionaire, he's wasted your time, you know.  So, but those kind of things that reoccur, it doesn't matter whether it's my theater or a theater in Chicago [Illinois] or wherever, you know.  This, this theme reoccurs over and over again, you know.
Story_ID: 9724
Speaker 1: At this juncture, I know you're--what's the--I know you're working on a book, you said, you've a book going now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a book coming out in July 2003.  And that's gonna be from Applause Books.  It's called 'The Impact of Race:Theater and Culture', and it's a series of observations over twenty-five years.  So like in a chronological order, you know, things like my first seeing Gwendolyn Brooks's work, my meeting her in Chicago [Illinois] at the Writers' Conference, my celebration of her eighty-fourth birthday, eighty-second birthday; my observation of Ron Milner and his work over the years or Lawrence Holder or P. J. Gibson or, you know, like that, and of (unclear) the changing nature of Lorraine Hansberry's work under her husband's authorship, you know.  But it's all got to do with race and the impact that had on changing those plays in some sort of way, the change in their work.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you think about non-traditional casting?
Speaker 2: Well, it's good for the actor.  It doesn't mean nothing for the American theater.  If an actor needs to make some money, it's a good way to make some money, you know.  It doesn't mean that theater's gonna do one next year.  I think it's a waste of time for a black theater to think of non-traditional casting.
Story_ID: 9725
Speaker 1: At this juncture, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I--boy, that's a hard one.  I don't know, you know, because legacy means longevity.  It means history, it means leaving something.  And you don't know what people are gonna take, you know.  You just got to do what you believe, you just got to do what you believe in.  I believe in these kind of plays, you know.  So I don't, I don't know.  I, that's a hard one.
Speaker 1: Now, did you mother [Ruby Jones King] or father [Woodie King, Sr.] ever imagine that you would be involved in--I mean, I guess--how did they feel about you being involved in the theater?
Speaker 2: Well, no, my, my had, you know, died right at my beginnings.  And my mom, she had no idea what theater, what we were doing.  Like (unclear) the time she passes, "Now, what, what's this you do again? (laughs) How you gonna make a living?  What, what's this you do again?"
Speaker 1: Did she ever come to a play?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I brought her to 'Wine-Sellers'  I brought her to New York [New York] to see, yeah, I took her to the theater, I used to see--to go see Pearl Bailey in 'Hello Dolly'.  She loved that.  She said, oh, I see why you like this, you know.  But the play I brought her to see was 'What the Wine-Sellers Buy', and I figured if I did anything in Detroit [Michigan], before I left I would bring her to the theater.  You know, she was, she's--she loved what we did, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I wanted to remembered, honest person who tried to, who really love seeing our images reflected back to us in a beautiful, beautiful and artistic way because we are a beautiful people, and our literature, when it's at its peak is awesome.  There's nothing more awesome than James Baldwin's 'Go Tell It on the Mountain', there's no, nothing more stunning and beautiful than Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man', you know.  It's just, it just jumps out, out of you, African literature, the beautiful ones--the beautiful ones are not yet born, you know.
Speaker 1: Armon (ph.).
Speaker 2: Armon, you know, just stunning work, you know.  And I love, you know, [Fyodor] Dostoyevsky but the black literature is so--and it is at its peak when it's really talking about who we are.  It's beautiful.  And I want to re--be able to recreate that in theater.  I really want to be, be able to recreate what Smokey Robinson created with song on the stage or The Last Poets and Haki Madhubuti created with poetry in a play, you know.  [Amiri] Baraka, you know, 'Nation Time', I would love to, you know.  So that's what we want to do as theater, you know.
