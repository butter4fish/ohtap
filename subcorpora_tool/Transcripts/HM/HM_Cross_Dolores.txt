Story_ID: 5891
Speaker 1: I was asking about your father.  Can you just talk about, you know, him and his background? His family background.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Charles Tucker.  He was born in New Rochelle New York.  He was the youngest son of eight.  My grandfather, his father was a minister.  Right after high school, he went off to join the [U.S.] Merchant Marines.  And he married--When he married my mother he was nineteen years old. And he was a year younger than my mother.  Very much an extrovert. Always could tell a good joke.  Was considered the one that, you know, was less serious than his brothers.  I enjoyed being around him.  Was always very upbeat.
Speaker 1: And his family--there was some history behind his family. Right?
Speaker 2: He has a wonderful history.  His father was Reverend Thomas T. Tucker.  They were from Crewe, Virginia.  And I believe they were associated with some of the first Tuckers that landed in Virginia.  My grandfather was born shortly after the Civil War and at about nineteen--in fact he was born on a plantation.  And his mother died when he was very young.  And as a young man, he went on and joined the ministry, you know, quite young.  He went on to get a doctorate of divinity. He established churches throughout Virginia and New Jersey.  Did an awful lot of missionary work in Haiti.  In fact, he's written a book. Or there's a book written about him baptizing people in Haiti. So he was very, very much into missionary work. And he established quite a few churches in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: And your mother.  Her name and her background.
Speaker 2: Ozie Olean Johnson [Tucker].  And she was born in North Carolina.  Different kind of background.  Her father was half--you know, part Cherokee Indian.  He had traveled from Oklahoma.  The family had traveled from Oklahoma and joined an African American slave family.  He was a stonemason. But his--but my mother's siblings worked on tobacco farms.  He did a lot of traveling; working stonemasonry work. But the family worked on farms--tobacco farms.  My mother was the youngest--second youngest daughter. And also had to do, you know, that type of work as well.  Her father was born, you know, in the late 1800s.  But when she was born, he was well into his seventies.  And he had--it's very interesting marriage because he married two sisters.  The--so my mother's--half her sisters were married to an older sister. And when the older sister died, he married a younger sister, who was my mother.  So the family was very, very large.  By that time there were close to eighteen children.  And my mother was the child of the second wife.  So it was very interesting in terms of his background, being a stonemason, and the fact that the children in the family found work around farms.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they--your mother's side of the family got to New Jersey--the New Jersey connection?
Speaker 2: Well they got to New Jersey--the young men in the family went north for jobs.  Moving from the South.  There just was not enough work for them on the various tobacco farms and cotton fields.  So they went north for jobs.  And also met young women and had, you know, wives and families.  And as they got settled, they invited other members of the family north.
Speaker 1: And did you--did either of your parents talk to you much about growing up, their growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother did more.  I learned a lot about my father through my cousin Henry.  My mother, shortly before she died, came to my house in Chicago [Illinois] and began writing and talking more about herself.  She talked about herself in terms of how she tried to avoid some of the work in the fields by hiding under the bed and reading.  And she talked about how her oldest sister wanted to make sure that she had a vocation.  So she taught her how to sew.  And she talked a lot. A lot of passion about the segregation in the South. And how it was so difficult for young people her age to even get a high school education. How they were prevented from getting a high school education and how far they had to go for, you know, schooling.  So she talked about that. And her relationship with her sisters, and how her sisters could cook.  And she was detailed into other housekeeping.  And so I learned a lot about her relationship with her sisters.  I learned a lot about how she saw the segregation in the South.  And also a lot about her father and her mother.  So I learned about relationships and the political situation.  More than some of the things about her feelings.  And my father I learned about him through his cousin.  And his cousin said that my father was pretty much like I saw him.  Always having fun, avoiding work, tried to be very different than his brothers. Didn't go to church the way my grandfather would have wanted him to go to church.  Always liked to play cards.  My father was a gambler.  And very dapper. Very dapper.
Speaker 1: And talk about how your parents met.
Speaker 2: My father and mother met at a Y[MCA, Young Men's Christian Association] dance--they met at a dance.  And my mother and I talk about this in the book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story']. Said that she was attracted to him, because of his dancing.  She saw him dancing.  She liked to dance and he was a good dancer.  And he thought of my mother as exotic.  My mother tended to mimic Billie Holiday, and she had a flower in her hair.  And she was really--had a lot of spunk and whatnot. And they were really attracted to each other, because of the dancing and appearances.
Speaker 1: You know what I found interesting is that they were born a day apart.
Speaker 2: Right.  Both Aquarius.  On February 11th [1917]; my father on February 12th [1918].
Story_ID: 5892
Speaker 1: What are some of your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest were living on Fairview Avenue in Newark [New Jersey].  And I can remember my sister and I sharing a bed in the middle room, and looking at shadows on the wall.  I think I must have been about two or three.  And we were frightened by the shadows on the wall. And we talked about that.  And then I remember a big fight between my, you know, my parents [Charles Tucker and Ozie Johnson Tucker] in the living room.  This--which frightened us, because they were not normally that angry.  And I remember my cousin told me that what they were fighting about is that my mother had a miscarriage.  And my mother was--was angry. Because my father wasn't there. It was something to do about his being out with people.  There was a lot of anger.  And my sister and I talked about that a lot because we had visualized that we would have a little brother.  And that had been--so I remember that.  And I think I must have been about three years old.  No more than that.
Speaker 1: And what other memories do you have about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well my memories are mixed. You know, I have very vivid memories and memories of my relationship with my sister.
Speaker 1: Tell--give us your sister's name and her--.
Speaker 2: My sister's name is Jean Dale and now her married name is McRae.  And she's a year older, you know, than I am.  My mother just wanted us--she thought that all the socializing that we needed we could find in each other, which we felt was annoying. Because we saw each other as being very different, you know, from each--my sister was very outgoing. And she says to this day she was more like my father.  And I was quieter. Because I stuttered very badly.  And my sister, she made fun of me sometimes, but didn't make as much fun as other people in terms of stuttering, you know, your face contorting. But one of the memories--and I talk about this in the book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story'], was a very painful--in fact it was the most painful part of the book to write. Because I can still visualize it.  And that was being molested in the housing project at a very young age.  And that part of the book was very hard, because my sister asked me not to write it.  And it was, you know, difficult in terms of having a stranger enter our house, you know, late at night. Because my mother worked at night.  And, you know, we answered the doorbell because he said he was a friend of my mother's.  And to be violated as a young child--I think I was either four or five and my sister was six.  And it was very hard. Because even today as I talk about it, I can see myself, you know, in the situation. And then our fear in terms of telling our mother. Because we were scared to tell her we had let someone in the house.  And we were just frightened because we knew of a young girl who was close to us in age who had been found murdered in the apartment and her body incinerated.  So we were just really very, very frightened.  And then my mother went into denial about it happening. Which was--and even as we got older when we talked, you know, she just did not--she did not want us to talk about it. Because it meant that something that she had done wrong.  But I was very, very--in terms of something that remains with you.
Speaker 1: Now you know, but I wasn't sure--you did not know? This was not a friend of your mother--Was it a friend or was--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: Or was it a?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was a stranger.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) A stranger. But he had said that to gain entry.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, right.  He said that to gain entry.  And probably just knowing my mother's patterns. And it wasn't clear if he had also violated other people or other young people in the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 5893
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you what sort of sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood, if you took yourself back to that period?
Speaker 2: A little bit earlier the smells--there's two smells.  One is my grandmother's [Mary Winston Tucker] rolls. I could smell those, in terms of, she made rolls every weekend. And my sister [Jean Tucker McRae] and I from a very young age, took a bus to my grandmother's house.  I think we started doing that in the projects when we were five years old. My mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] showed us where the bus was. We got on the bus. The High Street bus. Went to my grandmother's. And Sunday morning, the smell of rolls.  And then the responsibility of selling this bread to people in the neighborhood.  Another smell was the smell of soup.  And here I--this was much later on. Visiting a white elementary school and smelled soup.  I didn't realize that people had school lunches. And to walk into that school and smell soup, it was very, very nurturing, you know, to me.  And I could imagine now, you know, the young people maybe don't have parents who are home.  But it must smell good to smell the cafeteria soup or food.
Story_ID: 5894
Speaker 1: One thing you talk about in your book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story'] about the fact that you lived in a--it was a three-flat, right, three?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a three-flat.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then when your parents broke up, your father [Charles Tucker] left.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And after--surely after they had had that argument, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so--Then your mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] was forced to raise you by herself. And you, you know, moved into the projects. But they were a different type of projects than what we associate today.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They weren't the high risers.  They were just three floors. And they were built around a courtyard.  I lived there from the time I was five 'til thirteen years old.  So I saw a change from flowers to the cement, etcetera.  And one of things I describe in the book--'cause this was when my father left. When I first saw the projects I thought it was a jail.  You know, five years old.  I see these bars up there. And I thought--and 'cause my father had pointed these things out.  So (laughs) I thought I was going to jail. And my mother had to really sell the whole facility to me.  But I felt different and I felt better when I got inside.  I saw a gas stove--'cause we had a wooden stove. You know, a wood burning stove.  And, you know, the floors and then also a bathroom in the apartment. Because when we lived in--Fairview Avenue--there was sort of a community bathroom.  So it was a big change.  And--but on initial-j-ust seeing it from the outside, it was imposing. And I didn't know what this structure was.
Speaker 1: And that whole--how would you describe that period of time, you know, from five to sort of thirteen?  There were a lot of changes you had.  And you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Well there were a lot of changes in terms of my mother.  She was working in the munitions plant.  And things seemed to be so much opening up in terms of opportunities.  Blacks had better jobs, you know.  I think that children--at least I, you know, were left on their own.  And everything was moving up.  It was like life was going to change.  And then we heard about some of the changes in the South.  It was like the good times.  We had a great deal of hope, a lot of optimism.  And even though some terrible things were happening in peoples' lives, it was all gonna get better.  So it was very, very upbeat.  And you also felt that by hard work and education, and these things were key and things were going to get better. Just--especially if we focused on achievements and didn't focus on anything negative.  And that's one of the reasons why, you know, some of the things that happened to us that were horrific we didn't talk about them. Because we weren't supposed to.
Story_ID: 5895
Speaker 1: What was that community like? You know, we hear a lot about Newark, New Jersey. But it was a different community at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a collage of many immigrants.  The school that I went to was in an Italian neighborhood.  There were a lot of people from various--Polish, Greeks, Irish and--but divided.  I lived on one side of the railroad track and the Irish lived on the other.  Even the projects were segregated.  There were colored people that lived in one part of the projects and the white people lived in the other and you never went from one to the other.  But in school it was very much a collage.  Every conceivable language, and the immigrants were poor immigrants.  So there were poor blacks or colored people and poor immigrants.  And so it was very competitive as well.
Speaker 1: Now give your--the name of your elementary school.
Speaker 2: McKinley [Elementary School, Newark, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were five when you went there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 5896
Speaker 1: I'd like to understand a little bit about, you know, what the young Dolores Tucker at that time what was--what she was like?  And, you know, was she, was she introspective?  Was she a dreamer?  Was she--you know, what was she like?
Speaker 2: Well I can tell you a bit in terms of what--I saw a lot of myself in my conversations with my cousin Henry.  He would call me 'Bright Eyes'. And he said that I was always looking around and cheerful.  Cheerful. Continued to try to express myself even though I stuttered some.  I wanted people to like me. You know, I think that moving toward people so they wouldn't hurt me. So, you know, to like me.  I wanted them to feel proud of me.  My mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] always talked about the importance of being a good girl, good grades and whatnot.  So I wanted to be liked.  I wanted to be accepted.  I would feel bad sometimes when some of the kids wouldn't invite me to parties. Because they maybe came from homes where there was a father in the home.  They thought my mother was a bit odd. And we were left alone during the daytime.  So I felt that our lives were different than some of our neighbors whose mothers were, you know, home.  I thought my mother was odd because she did things that the other parents didn't do. She was very political. So she would get on radio and she would write and things like that.  So I just wanted to make sure that they liked me. And I didn't do anything that would get my mother upset.  So we had chores to do. Cleaning up, doing the floors, fixing dinner, getting things done.  The big thing was I didn't want my mother to get upset. Because I felt the weight of everything she was experiencing.
Speaker 1: And you felt the weight mainly because you heard the weight a lot. You know, you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know you heard her verbalize it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard her verbalize what it was.  My mother, you know, as I talked about in the book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story'], was the first African American woman to take an exam for telephone operator in the state of New Jersey.  And she was placed in an area which was very, very hostile in Hoboken [New Jersey].  And she would come back home and talk about the discrimination and what her coworkers were doing to her.  So we really felt, you know, the oppression.  But we couldn't understand it completely. Because that's not what we were being told in school about the black experience.  So that was--so we--when she came home, we wanted her to be happy.  We would sing, dance for her (laughs), fix food in the house.  There would be many shows. If I had a good grade in school, show her my report card.  We just wanted her to be okay.
Story_ID: 5897
Speaker 1: On one hand it was, you know, this is a time where it's--everyone's feeling like there's a bright future, you know, like this is still the early stages of the civil rights--the modern-day Civil Rights Movement--,
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --you know,  whatever.  But so there's a feeling of, okay, things are gonna change, but on the other hand there also--you know, what your mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] is experiencing. One, she's a single parent--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --trying to raise--and then on the other hand, you know, she's experiencing her own form of frustration out of there in the job place, that is sort of--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so what she was experiencing was maybe different also than what my father's [Charles Tucker] family--my father's family they were the Tuckers.  And they had the Tucker Brothers' Insurance Company.  And they were men, you know, fair-skinned.  My father was, you know, the brownest in complexion.  And they were very much like the upwardly-mobile blacks.  And so my mother had a reality that was different.  Their wives stayed at home.  You know, my uncles' wives stayed at home.  My mother worked.  And so for a while it was very--you know, they initially had not even approved of my father marrying. 'Cause my father married young.  So for a long time they would call us "Charlie's children" rather than their nieces, whatnot.  So--but they were always amazed at my mother.  So I had the reality of seeing these achieving uncles who didn't ask me how my mother was doing.  But they would say, "Are you doing good in school?  What are you gonna do with your schooling?" etcetera. So they were not involved that much in reality of my sister and I living in the housing projects, etcetera, but focusing more on how well we were doing in school.
Story_ID: 5898
Speaker 1: How did living in the projects impact you, if at all?  Do you think it impacted you?  You know, when you look back and say, you know, was that different than if I had stayed on, different than if I had stayed on--?
Speaker 2: Fairview Avenue [Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well living in the projects, that was presented as moving up.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right. That's right. That's right.
Speaker 2: We are moving up.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) You were moving up.  That's right.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, that was like the Sugar Hill [Harlem, New York].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah that was progress.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right. Now you--in school you did well always. Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what--do you think you just had a natural inclination?  That's why I was asking you what type of child you were. You know were you, know--you know, I was just trying to sort of--were you a child that lived in your head? And--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I lived in my head.  I spent a lot of time in the library.  I would--I'd have a pattern.  I'd run from school and do what needed to be done in the house and run to the library--Newark Public Library every day.  And read there--I love to read. I read a great deal.  So I always prided myself on picking up extra information. So if I had to write, I could have a little bit extra to write about.  I was very, very curious.  Loved to read.  Loved the museum as well.
Story_ID: 5899
Speaker 1: Your sister [Jean Tucker McRae] though.  There was an interesting you know, as siblings go. She is that, you know, the outgoing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) 'Cause it's cute the way the story about how, you know, you had to be together with your mother. And then you went out going in different directions.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's right. But, you know, we each knew what our roles were.
Speaker 1: (Laughs).
Speaker 2: My sister could be so--she knew how to ingratiate people.  We'd go into somebody's house and she'd say as soon as she walked in (gasps) "Oh it's so beautiful in here, oh I really think this is great!" and whatnot.  And so I could just stand up there and just be in the background and whatnot. 'Cause she--that was her, you know, that was her role.  Or if they were interested in grades, she'd say, you know, "Okay, you know, Dolores, how are you doing?"  and show the report card, whatnot.  So we played off, you know, like that.  But then at home, we knew we had to get the jobs done, etcetera.  And my sister knew that if she didn't do it--I was more concerned about my mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] being angry--I would do it.  And we would get into a lot of fist fights at home when I thought that she was spending too much time in one little area.  We had the whole room to clean. She'd spend thirty minutes cleaning one corner.  And then I'd have to deal with the rest of it.
Story_ID: 5900
Speaker 1: I want you to just talk about what in terms of your parents [Charles Tucker and Ozie Johnson Tucker] what you think you got from each one of them.  You know, 'cause we take things from our parents.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well my mother, a resilience.  And my mother was very strong and she went through a lot in terms of discrimination etcetera. It was amazing. You know, I talk about it in the book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story'] at thirteen, when she had a breakdown.  And she committed herself to a mental institution.  We had been living in the Salvation Army and she just fell apart after we had been evicted and went to the Salvation Army.  Then she committed herself to a mental institution.  And we went to live with various people in our family.  But two years after that, you know, I had been--I spent time working in the summers and we got some of the money to pay back the back rent.  We moved into another housing project.  My mother continued to go to school, continued to take exams, became a supervisor.  Went to--continued in night school. And continued being very political.  I think I talk about this in the book.  When the government was giving people cheese and milk and whatnot, my mother knew that eating cheese would lead to hypertension.  And she had us out there, you know, parading in front of the welfare place, you know, "Don't eat the cheese.  It's the government's conspiracy to give you--make you sick and whatnot."  She would tell people about this.  And we would call it the cheese conspiracy.  And we were embarassed by it, you know, to be the only people standing in front of the welfare office trying to get people not to take the government, you know, get the cheese.  I mean that's the--that's the way she was.  So she was resilient.  She was political.  She was interested in education.  She was proud of me.  So I got that.  From my father I got a bit more in terms of risk-taking.  My father would take risks.  I think I have a tendency to take risks.  He did his in gambling.  I've done mine in terms of doing different jobs.  You know, taking a chance.  So you know, that.  I also have a good sense of humor, which I think is like his sense of humor, a bit, you know, dry whatnot.  My father also stuttered.  And so, you know, he'd see that in terms of similarity.  So his sense of humor, his willing to take a risk. And then his ability to move on and let things go.  My father could move on, let things go very well.
Speaker 1: And you're able to do that.
Speaker 2: I am.  And what I got from my mother, my mother had very little fear.  I think that I never had much fear.  I remember as a child my mother used to take my sister and I out.  And we would be walking out at night.  And she said, "This is how you walk in terms of--you don't walk like you're scared."  And someone once said to me later on, I behave as if I have no fear.  You know, I don't think that I have a a level of--I don't--(laughs)--well maybe that's not appropriate, but I don't have a lot of deep-seated fears.
Story_ID: 5901
Speaker 1: I wanna talk a little bit about your stuttering though.  Because was there any discussion early on between you and your father [Charles Tucker]?  Any identification with you because he would stutter and you were a stutterer--did that--'cause, you know, people--some people don't get over it.  And then look at you right now.  You know, and James Earl Jones, you know, he was a stutterer. You know, where did it disappear to?  You know what makes it--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well I still stutter.  I think that one of the things that happens, you know, I keep my voice sort of controlled at a certain level.  And I avoid certain words that I know I'm going to stutter on. Like words begin M or W.  But if I get very excited. If I go to another octave, I stutter.  So I tend to get--sound very flat.  But that's a way that I avoid it.  And I learned that, you know, they used to tell me, take my time. Which it drove me up the wall taking your time. You know how you're trying. But I learned that if I would talk lower, slower--but if I get stressed out, or get very excited, I do stutter.
Speaker 1: To the same extent that you did as a child?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean I could not--I could not say a sentence without my face twisting. You know, I literally walked around with a pad, you know, saying, you know.  I could not communicate.  But I talk about in the book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story']--my teachers.  My eighth grade teacher who really wanted to help me with this.  And she had me do a play.  But she said, it wouldn't become the class play unless I directed it.  And I had so much invested in it.  And that even though I stuttered then, I took the risk and I pushed myself to speak.
Speaker 1: That's pretty impressive though when you think about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's--yeah.
Speaker 1: Had you written a play and you were gonna write it
Speaker 2: I wrote it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: She said she wanted me to do the eighth grade play. Because she liked my writing style.  And--nut it would become the play if I directed it.  (Laughs) So I had a lot invested in it.  So that's what I did.
Speaker 1: So had you ever study techniques of stutterers or anything like that?  Have you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No. Did you--okay.  That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was apparent until my twenties and then I--it abated.
Story_ID: 5902
Speaker 1: Let's talk some more about just schools and, you know, school and the influence of your teachers, and, you know, and this sort of growing interests, you know, there within the school environment.
Speaker 2: Well as I said, my eighth grade teacher was very important.  And in high school [Central High School, Newark, New Jersey], even though I was really, you know, very bright, I was not guided to take a college prep.  I took commercial stenography, typing, etcetera. But one of my English teachers, a Dr. Goldstein, he felt that I should be doing more, etcetera. And he changed the rules around for who the high school graduation speaker would be.  In honor of his retirement he wanted the person who wrote the best essay to be the high school graduation speaker. And he was my English teacher. And he looked at me. And I knew that was a signal for me to try.  So I wrote the essay and I became the high school graduation speaker.  I had no thought of going to college.  It had never even been presented to me as an option.  Then I went to work at the Newark Board of Education.  And there was a woman, my supervisors Mrs. Malone, an Irish woman who was--and she was second generation over there--here.  And she said, "You should really go to college."  Hadn't thought about it.  And she pointed out that I could go to college and also continue to work.  And I went to college [Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey].  I went there to matriculate.  They said, well you hadn't taken the courses that you need.  But at that time in New Jersey, you could take exams to make up for a year of biology, a year of chemistry and whatnot.  And I had seen my mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] take exams.  And she took every single civil service exam that you could possibly wanna take.  I had no fear of exams.  So when I found out that you could take it.  So I just went to the library, got all the courses. Found out what it was gonna cover in biology, studied.  Took an exam in biology, passed first year biology.  Did the same thing for geology. Then took another in biology.  And then I had someone tutor me for algebra.  Took--made up four years of academic work through exams.  That had a profound experience.  It made an impact on me, knowing that. One of the things that helped me is I didn't have anxiety about exams.  And right now I see so many young people having anxiety about exams. Because what they say is, blacks don't do well on exams.  I had seen nothing but my mother, my mother used to have stacks of passed grades for exams.  Like every time they would have a civil service exam, she'd just go out and take it. Like, you know, people go to maybe a bingo game.  And she just flip through them and say, "Well, no, I don't wanna do this.  I don't wanna do that." And she steadily took exams up to supervisor.  And I also saw her go through a painful experience of coming out first as the supervisor. But they gave it to a white woman who was second.  And my mother then decided to sue the state of New Jersey for discrimination.  And she got a lawyer, and eventually got a settlement of $10,000.  But I'd seen her take exams, do well.  I'd seen her be rejected.  So that's how I began.
Story_ID: 5903
Speaker 1: For my mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker], being the top of your game was to get a civil service job.  So for my mother, the fact that I had done well and had qualified for a senior clerk stenographer at the Newark [New Jersey] Board of Education. There were very few colored working there. I had really done what she expected.  I had really achieved well in terms of a civil service exam.  My uncles also thought that this was an achievement. And their expectation was even with that, that I would continue to give back. When they saw that I was going to college, they said, "Okay what is this gonna mean for the community?" You know, "What is your going to college going to mean?" And so they made it very clear that they would not value the degree much if I didn't do something with it that would have an impact on improving--as they would say, "Improving the lives of Negroes."
Speaker 2: So why were you at that place? Mrs. Malone said, "Have you ever thought about this?" She was--you found--first of all she found--she took an interest in you.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  And you talked about her only having two pairs of--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, two outfits.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: Not changes of clothes, but two outfits.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. And she was--she was also very independent, strong woman.  Her husband did not work. So she did lots of things to support him.  And in the process, she didn't have much for herself.  She was very giving. So she only had two outfits.  And she would put one in the cleaners and she'd wear one.  And she'd--so I saw her, you know, make her own personal sacrifices.  And then I saw her as someone who was genuinely interested in me.  She didn't have any children, but she was genuinely interested in me.  And felt--I mean, to the point where when I wasn't the best typist, but she covered for me.  She'd come in Saturday (laughs) and do my typing so that the supervisor--her--our immediate supervisor would not think that I was inadequate.  She was really very--.
Speaker 2: So she was really a mentor--.
Speaker 1: She was a mentor.  She was a support.  I learned a lot from her in terms of sacrifice.  So I learned a lot from her.
Story_ID: 5904
Speaker 1: So now how did you decide on Seton Hall [University, South Orange, New Jersey]?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: Well Seton Hall was in walking distance from where I worked.  I could go there.  And then also the--my person who later became my husband, Tom Cross [Sr.], was a student at Seton Hall on the South Orange Campus.  He was a basketball player.  So there was a connection there, too.  He was at Seton Hall playing basketball.  I could go to the Newark Campus and walk to school.
Speaker 1: And this began a long love affair actually--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  That was the first person, oh gosh. You know, a basketball player.  My uncles liked him.  He fit in, etcetera. And that was very, very special for me.
Speaker 1: And you--so what happened after that?
Speaker 2: Well after that, you know, a couple years or a year or so after we were married, I discovered I was pregnant.  And my first child was born, Tom [Cross] Jr.  And then three years after that, again before I finished my degree, my daughter [Jane Cross] was born.  So I had--it took me about seven years to complete my undergraduate degree. 'Cause I had two children.  And I was working as well as going to school. Because I didn't want my husband to have to drop out.  So he went to school full time. And I worked and I went to school a mixture of full and part time.
Speaker 1: That was a lot to balance too. And its--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) A lot to balance--.
Speaker 1: Did your family--did they say, "Now why are you doing this?  Why are you working so hard?  Why are you trying to do all of this?"
Speaker 2: Not--I think they were more worried about my doing something that would interrupt my husband's studies.  You know, I mean that was paramount, you know, his friends and people.  You know, they were concerned that his being married and having children would interfere with his finishing his degree and playing basketball.  So I did not want to be a liability.  You know, I wanted to show that, you know, I could--I was there, you know, to help.  So I didn't talk that much about what I was doing. You know.  I just wanted to make sure that whatever they were predicting in terms of my being, you know, negative.  Because for some of his friends, you know, he had gotten involved with a person on the wrong side of the track. I was from Newark, New Jersey.  He could have had himself a wife or a young woman from East Orange, or Montclair, or South Orange from a more middle-class background.  And I felt privileged that, you know, Tom Cross was interested in me.  And I was just gonna make sure that I didn't do anything to interrupt his schooling.
Speaker 1: You know, there's some interesting similarities. 'Cause your father [Charles Tucker] had been, you know, married across his--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  But a difference--you know, your father was happy-go-lucky.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Tom was--well he was a serious student.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A serious student basketball player. Yeah.  He was serious.
Speaker 1: Now did you as a young couple did you spend a lot of time talking about the future and what you wanted and--you know. I mean 'cause you're basically still very young--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, wasn't--You're like--.
Speaker 2: I was--when I got married, I had just turned nineteen.
Speaker 1: You're young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you--by twenty you have, you know, your first--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty I yeah--my first child.
Speaker 1: So I mean I'm just wondering what do--and you're trying to balance all these things.  So was there much time to really sort of talk and plan and--?
Speaker 2: Well we were--you know, we were so encouraged by some of the things that we saw in the late '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], you know.  Civil rights, what was happening in Atlanta [Georgia]. You know, the--everything was changing.  The riots, you know, were happening. We really thought that equity would finally begin, you know, to happen.  And we were gonna be part of that.  You know, we could really--we just, we just were concerned about with all this excitement that we wouldn't just burn out at forty or fifty.  It was just so much happening.  But--And we wanted to be a part of it. You know, the [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] speeches and whatnot. It was just the right time to enter history.
Story_ID: 5905
Speaker 1: What about the demands of raising a family and all of that. You know, in this juncture? 'Cause you didn't really have a lot of support systems at this point..
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No. I didn't.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] was in school.  My mother-in-law was in Hagerstown, Maryland.  So what I did is we got an apartment with an extra bedroom.  So we took in students.  We took in students from the college. And we tried to work our schedule around--made their class schedule around watching, you know, the children.  And then, you know.  So that's what we had to do.  And then when I had to finally end up doing my student teaching, I did kindergarten.  So I could take my son [Tom Cross, Jr.] with me to kindergarten. So we found ways, to, you know, to make it happen.  Largely by taking in students.  So it grew from one student to two students.  And Tom [Cross, Sr.] was a student [at Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey].  And so there was always somebody there with Tommy.
Speaker 1: Now did your--but in a way was your--this nuclear family you had formed, were they sort of a--was there a sense of pride in the extended family? You know, two college--you know.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  And they also--I think they had a lot of respect for me and what I was doing being in school, and whatnot.  'Cause I would come home and fix dinner for people.  I mean working full time, fix dinner and then go off to--to classes.  And then do whatever was necessary in between.  I think what I missed more than anything is spending more time with my son.  Yeah.  And my daughter [Jane Cross] when they were very young.
Story_ID: 5906
Speaker 1: Your husband [Tom Cross, Sr.] gets a Fulbright [Scholarship], right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well what I would do is I would check on all the opportunities, you know, for him.  And he was French and Spanish.  So I had this whole thing--probably from my mother--apply for everything.  'Cause I wanted him to succeed.  So at one point he had a Fulbright.  And the first one was in Puerto Rico, and then a second Fulbright in Spain.  And then I would stay home and work.  And this was during the '60s [1960s], you know, the riots.  So I would work and he had the Fulbright etcetera.  So I--he was really the center of our lives.  And I just wanted to be there to support his success.  At the same time, I had my own dreams.  I wanted to have a degree.  I wanted to--I had to be part of that.  But I didn't talk that much.  I saw my role more as being instrumental.  And not out there like, you know, right--you know, eventually I went on to take a leadership role.  But saw myself pretty much in the background.
Speaker 1: And instrumental in the family success.
Speaker 2: Instrumental in the family success.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And in his success.
Speaker 2: Also instrumental in terms of the children etcetera.
Speaker 1: Now what was the thought that he was gonna do though with the, you know a French, French major and a Spanish minor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what was the thought back then? What it--?
Speaker 2: To teach.
Speaker 1: To teach.  Okay.
Speaker 2: To teach and also to have the credentials so that he would have a job always.  And so that was really to make him formidable as a teacher.
Speaker 1: And then the sports.  Was there any thought--because you--you know, he--was there any thought that he could go sort of pro--well at that point--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He could have gone pro.  He did semi-pro and then he tried out for the [New York] Knicks for a while.  And the Knicks told him, you know, if you lost weight come back. But Tom was not the kind of person that was driven by it.  I think he could have done very well professionally.  But he wasn't going to push himself to make the team.
Story_ID: 5907
Speaker 1: Hagerstown [Maryland] is where Tom [Cross, Sr.] was from.  And we got married in Hagerstown.
Speaker 2: You moved to Lakeview [New York].
Speaker 1: Lakeview.
Speaker 2: That was where--?
Speaker 1: That was where I got involved in self-help groups and that was--they say it was the Malverne Integration.  And the school that my children [Tom, Jr. and Jane Cross] were going to was segregated schools.  And so there was a move then by the commissioner--I think it was Commissioner Allen to integrate the schools.  So we lived in Lakeview.  In order for us to achieve integration, we had to bus the children to Malverne [New York].  And so what I did then is I became head of the Lakeview Self-Help Committee.  And we organized busing and ran busing from our house, to achieve that.  And I also got involved with some of the, you know, demonstrations.  And some of it really could have--I could've landed in jail, and frightened me afterwards.  That I had taken some risks and done some things that might have if the authorities had caught me maybe not be with my children.
Speaker 2: Now let's sort of paint the picture of what time we're in.  'Cause we're in--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) We're in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s].  So in the mid--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Mid '60s [1960s], '65 [1965], '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Voting Rights Act has really just passed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A few years before.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Isn't that amazing?
Speaker 2: I know (Laughs).  But there's a sense of things happening.  You know, and Newark [New Jersey] has its riots among lots of other places.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right, right.
Speaker 2: I think that's when we had the Fulbright.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But what, what--give--when you go to Lake--have you--You've finished school when you go to Lakeview.  Have you finished--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I finished my BA, but I was still working on my Masters in Lakeview.
Speaker 2: But you had finished it taking late years to finish.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right, right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause with juggling and that
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you're there.  And he's, he's in graduate school, right?
Speaker 1: He's in--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) A fellowship?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  He was in fellowship and he was in Hofstra [University, Hempstead, New York] graduate school.
Story_ID: 5908
Speaker 1: Paint sort of the picture of what's go--what's happening and what these two communities are like that are about to sort of be forced to merged? You know, that you're trying to sort of--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  You see the whole world is opening up.  You know, you see Jim Crow diminishing in the South.  And then you have Malverne [New York] which is an all white community.  And then you have Lakeview [New York] which is a new mixed community of young black families.  And everybody feels.  We're getting--We're taking--getting our cues from what we see in the South.  And our cues from, you know, what's being said by spokespeople that, you know, if you assert yourself, you join these lines singing 'We Shall Overcome'.  Demonstrate in front of the superintendent's house. You know, barricade schools, rush into schools.  Do whatever is necessary to make sure that your children have an opportunity.  So we were inspired.  We were ready to do that.  So we were doing our part.  But we were part of a larger picture of change all over--all over this country.  Where it was gonna be better for us and it would be better for our children.
Speaker 1: So what things did you do specifically in, you know, in Lakeview? You yourself?
Speaker 2: The Lakeview Self-Help Committee. Also having meetings at my house, in which we would take about our demonstrations, leading demonstrations in which our children would be involved.  Being a key person taking over a school.  Getting into a high school and then finding a way that I could let the community in.  I mean this is the--disruptive activity that I was involved in.  And, you know, just leading the activist activities.
Story_ID: 5909
Speaker 1: You were saying that this was all a very exciting time.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, a very exciting time.
Speaker 1: There was movement.
Speaker 2: There's movement.  And we are an integral part of history.  You know, we're part of it.  We're making a difference.  Life was gonna be better.  The only concern that we had is that we were-we were so involved that we worried about just burning out.  You know? That we're just putting so much energy in this.  We could not imagine living to forty or fifty at this pace and intensity.
Story_ID: 5910
Speaker 1: And your neighborhood--was it a nice--could you talk about Lakeview [New York] as--it was a nice home.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh it was just very nice.  Nice homes, nice neighborhood.  You know, also our kids [Tom Cross, Jr. and Jane Cross] are going to school.  You know, that was gonna be part of their lives.  And we did things like we had the Links [Inc.].  And we had took them to New York, to see shows.  So even though we were involved, we also tried to balance it with experiences.  And there was one woman in the neighborhood that taught swimming.  So we made sure that they had their swimming lessons.  That there were trips into New York.  That, you know, the kids were encouraged to not only participate in demonstrations, but also to continue to grow.
Speaker 1: But you weren't part of the Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.].  So it wasn't that type of thing.
Speaker 2: It was Jack and Jill.  Yeah, I belonged to the Links.  Not the Jack and Jill.
Speaker 1: See that's--when you said the Links.  You were part of the Links?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay (Laughs).
Speaker 2: I dropped out later on.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you said to me--I was thinking maybe she means another form of Links.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was, you know, I was part of that.  I think maybe Jack and Jill too.  But you know it was--I--a little bit later on I thought that was a bit pointless.  But then when my kids were young I was part of Jack and Jill and the Links.
Story_ID: 5911
Speaker 1: Well Tom [Cross, Sr.] was losing his--you know, he went through a period where he'd go to one district and it wouldn't work out.  And it didn't seem like this last--this district before we moved to Michigan was gonna work out.  And some of it was discrimination and some of it was, you know, not being as politically astute as he needed to be.  So when I saw this job open at Michigan, I saw it was a way that he could go to Michigan, get a Ph.D., and that would just, you know, make him--again give him more opportunities.  So that was the plan.  He would go to Michigan, get a Ph.D.  We would live in Brown Hall--we'd sell our house and we'd live in Brown Hall.  I would be head advisor there.  So we'd save money and then get board, et cetera, and I went into that situation as the first African American to ever be head advisor in a residence facility at Eastern Michigan University [Ypsilanti, Michigan].  End of the '60s [1960s].  Students were demonstrating on campus.  There were all kinds of riots, etcetera.  When we get to Minnesota--I mean to Michigan, another job opens up for him as a junior high school assistant principal.  And he decided that he's not gonna get a Ph.D.  But he's gonna get an Ed.S.  And in the mean time, I'm there.  And when he takes the Graduate Records Exam [GRE], I took the Graduate Records too.  Did very well on the Graduate Records.  And decided I would go on for a Ph.D.  And that's when I got into the Ph.D. program.  And he eventually got into the Ed.S. program.  So what I did is to continue to help him with the Ed.S. program.  You know, support with his papers, etcetera, and began my own program.  But it was a volatile time, you know in the '60s. [1960s]  Some of the wives did not like the fact that I was head advisor.  As I talk about in the book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story'], you know, the class--you know, things were breaking down in the residence hall.  There was a fire in the residence hall.  And it was on the third floor of the residence hall.  And Jane [Cross] was spending the night there with some of the young women.  And there was a moment there after the fire I wasn't sure if she was safe, etcetera.but then I--you know, I began to realize that, you know, the political situation was intense in Lakeview [New York].  But in Michigan with some of the prejudice and discrimination and other, there was just turmoil everywhere.  In addition to that, the Vietnam War.  So tense times.
Speaker 2: All right.  And you--and the kids, they were upset about the move.  Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They were very upset about the move.  'Cause they were leaving their friends.  And they were leaving a community.  And they were moving from an extended community to a nuclear family.  We took their dog.  So we had the dog, two kids.  Moving from a house--it was a beautiful house, to a residence hall.  And it helped us in a number of ways.  Because as a young couple we had lots of debts.  And we had the financial struggles.  But then we had the insecurities of--that my husband was experiencing in terms of being able to hold on to a job.  So this looked like an opportunity for us to get even more education, deal with some of the bills and continue moving ahead.  But it was tough on them.
Story_ID: 5912
Speaker 1: Now your husband [Tom Cross, Sr.] was he--did he--would he come home and say, "You know, this is really horrible.  Or this is what I'm experiencing." And then you would say, "Okay.  Well why don't we try this." And--I mean is that kind of what the whole thing--or were you out there more aggressive and looking for opportunity and--?
Speaker 2: Well I was--I was picking up signals from him that it wasn't going well.  You know, in terms of, well I may not be reappointed next year.  They haven't told me that they're gonna bring me back. So I'd look for, okay, maybe other job that he should be then applying for.  And I could pick up the signals that it was not a good situation, you know, for him.  And I was--I was really very angry and upset.  Because I thought that someone should've reached out to give him some support within the school district.  And that wasn't happening.
Speaker 1: And then, but at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], was it Dr. Betty Morrison?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Betty Morrison.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And she had an influence on you.  Right?
Speaker 2: Right.  See I think I entered Michigan at a very good time in terms of her presence.  There were no--you know, I didn't have an opportunity to have any African American advisors etcetera.  Then my second year into the program, Dr. Betty Morrison came on campus.  And the most difficult course for many of us had to do with statistics and research.  She was tough.  She was an African American woman I made a part of my committee.  I learned so much, in terms of what it would take to get a Ph.D., in an institution that, you know, was not that anxious in terms of African Americans getting Ph.D.s  There weren't many people interested in my success.  But she was determined that the small group of African Americans who were there would succeed.  So I understood the importance of having a mentor--an African American mentor there.
Story_ID: 5913
Speaker 1: So you were at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] how long, until?
Speaker 2: I was there for two years to get my Ph.D.  'Cause I had come in with--I had my master's and had begun a second master's.  So I had quite a--I had quite a lot of work done before I went to Michigan.
Speaker 1: And then an opportunity opens up at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Northwestern right.  Well it opened up first for my husband [Tom Cross, Sr.].  He got the opportunity to be principal at Evanston Township High School.  Because he had had an experience going off with administrators from all over the nation, met Scott Thompson who was superintendent, who hired him as the first African American to be principal at Evanston Township High School.  And then I went to Northwestern.  And did not know that much about applying.  But just felt okay, I had a Ph.D. So I just went and met with the dean and said, "I'd finished Michigan.  I had a Ph.D.  I wanna teach here." I think he was just so flabbergasted that I would just walk in.  I thought that was how it was done.  And I got a job.  Assistant Professor.  And head of the Undergraduate Clinical Experiences.  And then they expanded that to Assistant Professor, head of the Undergraduate Clinical Experiences and the Masters of Arts and Teaching.  And then I was supposed to--I had to advise doctoral students, teach, administer the program.  And a family.  So I was Assistant Professor there for three years.
Speaker 1: That was a lot of work.
Speaker 2: A lot of work.  Wearing three hats.  But, you know, the other thing.  The only way for African Americans to really get into these institutions, that in some cases you had to--you had an administrative job as well as a faculty position.  And then you have to publish.  Now fortunately I was able to get a [W. K.] Kellogg [Foundation] Grant.  And I got a Kellogg Grant.  And I wrote a textbook teaching the multicultural society based upon the reality of conflicts in classrooms between people of different cultural backgrounds.
Story_ID: 5914
Speaker 1: You have things like the Women's Movement and, you know, the Black Movement, and all those sort of movements--gay movements starting (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they had--You know they were talking about cultural pluralism and the multicultural education.  And that--they were just beginning to talk about that.  What I had done, and this was in the early, you know '70s [1970s].  I had many people who were teaching in the Chicago [Illinois] Public Schools.  And these young teachers would talk about, you know, some of the conflicts that they saw between their supervising teacher and students.  So what I began to do is to go to the Chicago Public Schools and tape conflicts. You know, conflicts in terms of listening to a teacher saying something, well you can't do any better because of your background, etcetera, and seeing the conflicts.  And that became the basis for my communicating that more needed to be done to teach people more tolerance.  So I took those tapes to people from [W. K.] Kellogg [Foundation].  And I got a grant to do a textbook, 'Teaching the Multicultural Society'.  And I brought different faculty members together and asked them to rethink what they were presenting as knowledge.  Face these, you know, conflicts.  So if they're teaching a course in linguistics, are they teaching the course in such a way that they are preparing people to be more tolerant? Are they reinforcing the wrong ideas? If they're teaching a course in politics or whatnot, are you looking at the reality that many people have made a contribution? And they developed, you know, chapters, you know, for this book about the realities of teaching in a multicultural society.  So it was my premise that people in the academy had to rethink what they were presenting as knowledge to young teachers.  Because these teachers were coming out with certain ideas about race.  They were coming out ideas--with certain ideas about culture.  And it had some--you know, it was definitely tied in to what had been presented to them as information.  So to somehow tell people in the academy that they had--they had to look at what was happening in their classroom.  They had to look at whether or not they were teaching from a unicultural perspective, or a multicultural perspective.  And that's what the book was about.  And then I also emphasize how every culture borrows.  And I think that came from my own background.  You know, that some of what I do--even some of your hand gestures and words, etcetera, came from what I borrowed from other cultures.  But even though I could see things from a starting point of my own culture as an African American, I could also see how my presentation has been influenced by other cultures.
Speaker 1: And so was this viewed as sort of groundbreaking at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was groundbreaking.  But then there was--you know, there're two sets.  You know, there's multicultural education, which talks about, you know, the very importance of presenting variety of cultures of understanding.  And then there's cultural pluralism.  And cultural pluralism talked more about the immersion of oneself within your own culture.  So that if you're Mexican American you just--you don't talk about borrowing from another culture.  You just talk about your own culture as if it's uninfluenced by other cultures.  Or African Americans just--so, you know, the--all the slices of the pie.  As in cultural pluralism talked about what was--you know, the cultures as if they were slices of a pie, rather than cultures borrowing from other cultures.
Story_ID: 5915
Speaker 1: Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] was a good place to be for this? And the experience? Or was it--it was a step up from University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  University of Michigan had--I'm just talking about culture--Because they're sort of a similar institution
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're a similar institution with a different role.  Like when I went to Northwestern I'm coming in as the first African American woman faculty member in education.  So I'm coming in new there--not been an African American woman there.  And so what you're, you know, what you're dealing with is the--is the isolation.  At Northwestern I got more involved in women's groups.  And that was really my first interaction with I think forming a coalition with white women.  Because the other women on the faculty were white. And a woman who later became my friend, Susan Lourenco who used to invite the women for sherry on Friday.  And I can remember the first time I went to the--one of these meetings.  And I saw these white women.  I said, you know, like what can I--got this big 'fro and whatnot--big Afro--and what can I learn from you white women? You cannot, you know, teach me. So I separated myself.  But then I realized that they were the only people that were inviting me for sherry.  They were the only people who were engaged.  So I became part of that group.  So I began to work more with women.  But that was really my first experience in forming a collegial relationship, or a friendship, especially after I, you know, some of my earlier more negative experiences with white women.  That happened at Northwestern.  So I felt the fury of racism in the academy at Northwestern.  I also--the fury of sexism.  Because all of the women who were there with me they were all assistant professors.  And interestingly, I was the only one who completed her Ph.D.  The rest of them were still completing their Ph.D.  So.
Speaker 1: The inequities, right.
Speaker 2: They were even inequities in my status.  Because they did not have their Ph.D.  But they did not have programs to run and still be there.  They just had the luxury of just teaching.  This is oh, you know, a dream.  But I had to teach, do research, administer two programs--an undergraduate program and a graduate program, and advise doctoral students.
Speaker 1: And now your husband [Tom Cross, Sr.] at this time he's--Evanston [Township High School]--So that was a big deal for him to be--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Big deal.
Speaker 1: Big deal.
Speaker 2: A big deal at Evanston Township, you know, High School.  I got--I guess that's a little bit later on.  I think one of the things that he said to me which was maybe a turning point even in our marriage, is that I wasn't there for him in quite the same way that I had been there for him in the past.  I got involved in Northwestern, my career, etcetera, and if I had been there for him more, I think he might have even experienced more success at Evanston Township High School.  But it was clear after three years there that it wasn't gonna work out for him.  So we began looking for another place.  And I gave a paper in Southern California.  And as--for giving that paper, I was invited to joint the faculty at Claremont Graduate School [later Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California].  And then what he was going to do then is to go--he said he wanted a new career.  He was gonna go to law school.  But he didn't go to law school.  He took a principalship, you know, in one of the schools around Claremont.  So.
Speaker 1: It might have worked better if he had gone to law school maybe.
Speaker 2: Well he did for a year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But then he dropped out.
Story_ID: 5916
Speaker 1: Now Claremont [Graduate School, later Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California], you still continued some of your work that you had started at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].  Right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  I finished the book there.  And there again I was the first African American woman on the faculty there.  And had responsibilities that were similar.  But now I was an Associate Professor.  So my rank changed from assistant to associate.  I was their director of their graduate teacher education program.  And a new credentialing requirement was coming down.  So I had to initiate that.  I also advised doctoral students, had the teaching responsibility and had program development responsibilities.  What was unique there, I developed a joint doctoral program between Claremont Graduate School and San Diego State [University, San Diego, California], which became the first joint doctoral program between a private and a public university in the state of California.  So developing programs, the teacher education program, teaching, whatnot.  And was there for four years.  And then I got a postdoctoral experience in Washington D.C. and began to think more about administration.  Because by then my marriage [to Tom Cross, Sr.] was falling apart.  And I have to worry about in a few years my kids [Tom, Jr. and Jane Cross] would be going off to school.  And how would I support them and their college activities? So at that time I was making like $19,000 a year as an associate professor at Claremont Graduate School.  And I heard about the job as Vice Chancellor in City University of New York.  And I had been encouraged after the post-doctorate to get into administration.  So it was--a real shift came in my life then in terms of moving out.  Deciding that I'm going to take the leave and go for the goal.  So I applied for the job of Vice Chancellor at City University of New York [CUNY] and got the job.  I think there were close to 400 applicants.  And moved into a very political situation.  I said it in the book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story'] there.  Made the 'New York Times' newspaper, the front page, that the Black Caucus legislators were gonna sever their ties with the chancellor over my appointment.  Because it was "Californian gets the job."  And many of them did not realize that I was from the East Coast.  So I had to come back to the situation and some how make peace with the black, you know, legislators.  And then come in again as the first.  I was the first African American to be a Vice Chancellor.  African American woman to be a Vice Chancellor at the City University of New York.  That was in '78 [1978], first woman.  But I'm over admissions for the eighteen colleges, financial aid, special programs for the entire university system.
Story_ID: 5917
Speaker 1: Now you had been in difficult situations before. But were you prepared for what awaited you in New York [at the City University of New York]? In terms of the heightened visibility?
Speaker 2: Well I think what I was not prepared for was going there by myself.  You know, I think I had been--lots of people saying, you know, you need Tom [Cross, Sr.] with you. To go there as a single woman.  'Cause my kids now were--Jane [Cross] at sixteen was going off to college.  My son [Tom Cross, Jr.] was in college.  I was really--first time by myself moving from California, kids out of the nest, I wasn't forty years old.  And I was in my late thirties when I made this move.  Two grown children going to New York without a husband, etcetera. So it was that in terms of people dealing with me.  What I did do though in order not to go by myself I gathered my doctoral students at Claremont Graduate School [later Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California].  And I said to them that I wanted one of my students to go as my executive assistant.  Students--people who I had worked with for four years who knew me--my passion.  And I let them vote on the person who they thought should go.  And they voted on Dennis Cabral, who was--had lived all his life in Hawaii.  And his wife was from Germany.  They had never really spent as much time on the mainland.  But they thought that Dennis in terms of his mind, whatnot should be my executive assistant.  So if you can imagine this African American coming in to New York (laughs) with a white male who speaks like he's from 'Hawaii Five-0' (laughs).  Coming to New York in this political situation, not knowing that they had already picked out my executive assistant.  And just, you know, doing it my way. This is someone, you know, who believed in me, etcetera. But then what I did when I got here I wanted to meet immediately with who the black legislatures had seen as the person.  And the person that was seen as the person was a wonderful person Leo Corbie.  I met him, I liked him.  I made him my deputy too.  And so, you know, began the three of us.  I formed a team.  Dennis, who knew me.  And his charge was to keep me intellectually honest so I would not sell out in terms of what I had believed in, etcetera. And we kept this communication with my doctoral students in Claremont.  And so that was wonderful.  Having someone who believed in me and what I was about as--and my values.  So that was--that was important.
Speaker 1: And so the whole process--you went--you stayed in that position how many years?
Speaker 2: For--well I was in Claremont for four years.
Speaker 1: For four years.  But then New York?
Speaker 2: I was just in that job two years.  Because--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Two years.  But then you got appointed--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, the Chancellor died that who had appointed me.  But then Governor [Hugh] Carey--because I had been over the centralized administration of financial aid, asked me to become a member of his cabinet.  And to become President of the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation.  And then I moved up as the first African American in this country to run an agency administering $2 billion in student financial aid.  And I was there for a period and reappointed by Governor Mario Cuomo.  So I served in Governor Carey's cabinet.  Then later Mario Cuomo's cabinet.  So I was in that job as a commissioner for eight years.
Story_ID: 5918
Speaker 1: To make sure that their voices were heard and to recognize the fact that people had, you know, different voices.  So when I took the job as Vice Chancellor of CUNY [City University of New York], I came in at a time when they were ending open admissions.  So, you know, what I wanted to do is to use the admissions process and the financial aid process to make sure that people got an opportunity to go to school.  And I went to CUNY because CUNY had as its mission to help students who were under-served. And then at--when I went--took the job in New York, increasingly financing of education was a concern.  So the first thing I did is I took a statewide survey, finding out how students were financing their education.  And found out that despite everything the government was saying about there being enough financial aid to meet the cost of an education, that there was an unmet need.  And recognizing there was this unmet need looking to promote policies that would be responsive to this.  Policies that led to part-time tuition assistance and policies that led to more financial aid for independent students.  So continuing to be an advocate for people with different points of views to develop a perspective.  And to make sure that cost was not a barrier to their going to school.  So for eight years doing that.  I had a TV show at the time, 'Paying for College'.  I began to produce my own show with the help of a media person in which I would interview people and talk about access issues.  And then also Governor [Mario] Cuomo saw to it that I had a group of twenty-one college presidents to work with.  And I began to give them some of the information.  So that they could go to Washington and be a force as then-President [Ronald] Reagan was threatening cutbacks in student financial aid.
Speaker 2: What are you proud of that you accomplished during that eight year period? Or even attempt--you know.  What are you proud of there?
Speaker 1: The proudest thing, you know, promoting new policies.  There were three pieces of legislation that I--that my research held.  One was to make sure that there was tuition assistance for part-time students.  That had not occurred before.  The second was that independent students--these are students with young children--got more financial aid.  And the third was the Hope Scholarship.  What the Hope Scholarship said is that if you stay in school and get good grades, then what the state would give you is $7,000 toward going to a private college, or cover the cost of your going to the public.  So I was able to use that information, you know, the power of that information to promote legislation so that people could have a chance.  And I was also able to show that poor people were struggling with the cost of education.
Speaker 2: And that was affecting their access.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 5919
Speaker 1: Now you also around this time, something starts percolating in you in terms of wanting to be running actually an institution as--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a college president.
Speaker 2: And that's--I think the working the presidents and some of the advocacy.  And I talked to Cliff Warden who was Chancellor oF the State University [of New York, SUNY] system.  And he said, "Now Dolores, you've been out of academe for a long time.  You know, you've been a Vice Chancellor.  And now you--people see you as the governor-type.  But the best way to do this is to get a job in academic affairs at a research big institution.  And let that be your first step back." So somehow I made the connection with the University of Minnesota and got a job there again as a first.  And I became Associate Vice Chancellor and Associate VP [vice president] for Academic Affairs, at the University of Minnesota.  And that was over the five campuses there.  Working on their blueprint for action for diversity.  Very different in that they're only 1,000 African American students out of 37,000 in the system.  And that was in Minneapolis.  I was there for a couple of years and I planned to stay longer.  'Cause Dennis Cabral also came with me to that job.  I got a call from Peter Drucker, you know, who's in the area of management.  And he told me that this job had opened up at Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois] which seems very right for me.  Because it's an urban institution and I'm interested in urban areas.  President of Chicago State University.  So I applied for that and got that job and became the first woman to head a four-year public institution in the state of Illinois.  Which is amazing--in 1990 to be the first woman in a job, let alone African American.  And Chicago State University, as you know, enrolls one third of all the African Americans who attend four-year institutions in the state of Illinois.  And setting up a process.  There I began looking at what did a president have to do to make sure that students have an opportunity? So I said there were three things.  You have to have very strong pre-college programs. Then you have to have very viable support programs.  And the third thing is to create articulation agreements for students to go on to graduate school.  So I was able to do the latter with the University of Minnesota. I developed a pipeline program between Chicago State and the University of Minnesota, we got $4 million from the MacArthur Foundation to keep that going.  And by now I think we have about twenty students or better who've gone through that program to complete their Ph.D's at the University of Minnesota.  And we had ninety-one pre-college programs when I left.
Speaker 1: Now this was--Chicago State career-wise stands out for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I mean you get your college presidency.  But what can--what is--were you surprised by what you found when you got there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And what I was surprised by was the image.  That the image--I mean not that many people knew about Chicago State University.  And also--well I was also pleasantly surprised by the campus.  It's a beautiful campus on the South Side.  And that, you know, there was not as much support from the state of Illinois.  So those things were surprising for me.
Speaker 1: And you really sort of took the town by storm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know, it was like--I don't know how it was in New York when you--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I assume that was taking it by storm.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you took Chicago by storm.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I did.  And just--I defined what I wanted to do to improve the retention and success of students, their success. And also to improve the enrollment.  And then began--got involved with Greater Chicago.  And set up a group called Friends of CSU Scholars.  In which I involved CEOs [chief executive officers] from major corporations as mentors to students.  So I got Leo Mullen down who's head of Delta [Airlines], as a mentor.  Don Perkins.  It was really his idea initially to--you know to get it going.  And, you know, he was head of K-Mart [Corporation] and any number of things.  And then Richard Morrow who was head of Amoco [Oil Corporation] at that particular time.  And David Fox who was head of Northern Trust [Corporation].  But I called on--see what I felt was that the only way that I could get them to buy in is to have them become mentors to Chicago State University students.  And I just asked them to develop a relationship with a student.  Call the student up.  Find out how they're doing.  Take them to lunch.  Just to be in touch.  And then developed a personal relationship.  I didn't ask them for money.  I just said, you know, reach out.  Be a friend. And then after that, they began to promote and support the college and to become aware of the college.  So that was, you know--that was an important achievement.  And then to making sure the students--I had residence halls built on campus.  And there were residence halls for the first time.  A new student center.  A new science center.  So during the time I was there for seven and a half years, we created the--we built $31 million in building.  And I also started the Gwendolyn Brooks Center.  And made sure that she had support in the state of Illinois, you know, to be there.  So I set up that center.  But I defined those things coming in what I wanted to do.  And I was able to do it.
Story_ID: 5920
Speaker 1: It's pretty amazing what you were able to do in a short period of time [as president of Chicago State University]. And I'm wondering why do you think you had success that way? Because I mean anything could have slowed down, you know, it's just the bureaucracy of a state institution.  You know, you weren't from Chicago [Illinois]. Maybe--I'm just saying, you know.  There's the politics of the situation. So I mean like when you describe the, you know, asking the CEOs [chief executive officers].  Had they not ever been asked? Is that what--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They'd never even been to Chicago State.  But you know what I did, I took it--talked about the students.  You know the story was the students.  Heroic in terms of having other things vying for their attention, yet determined to go to school.  And I could--and it was the first time--when I went to Chicago State University--it's the first time that I begun talking about my own background.  I had not expressed, you know, even to students at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] or Claremont [Graduate School, later Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California] my connect.  But I taught a course to freshmen.  And in the course of the conversation, some of the students assumed that I wouldn't understand.  And I started talking about myself.  And I'm listening to them.  And I realized that even though it had been tough for me, it was tougher for them.  Because it--you know, they weren't--they didn't have the energy of the times.  There was nothing propelling them in terms of somebody waiting for them to take over.  You know, I always felt that somebody was waiting for me to do something--to achieve.  But it was almost like, okay, we have a few people who've made it through.  And we like them.  And so we've made friends with them.  But we're not necessarily interested in the younger people in the pipeline. So I realized that they did not have people.  And I also realized that there weren't too many people who were heads of institutions--presidents who had had the urban experience.  Many of them come from the South.  They come from suburbia.  They come from a different experience than mine.  Especially as a woman.  There're not too many women CEOs that have been basically born and raised in urban environment, that could identify with them.  So I began to tell the story of the student.  And then, as you know, the '[Chicago] Tribune' calls us "Success U".  But they felt better about the students.
Story_ID: 5921
Speaker 1: We haven't dealt with your marathon running and the fact that you had taken up running.  Many of your--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) At age fifty I ran my first marathon.
Speaker 1: And it was almost as if--from an outside--that it was you and the school on a marathon.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know. That--you were synonymous as sort of the leader.  And here was the school [Chicago State University].  You know, even gaining some--you know, not even probably crawling beforehand.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But every year that I was in Chicago I ran the marathon.  I did my last one there, which was my twentieth marathon in 2000.  But every year running the marathon, then setting up the 5K [kilometer] race, and talking about going the distance.  Showing that the stamina and the energy.  Plus running just keeps you--helps deal with the stress.  I mean, it was very, very stressful in terms of the state impositions, the students having problems.  You had the faculty, whatnot.  So running is really key you know, for me, to help me go.  So I continued to run.  So there's a lot in terms of going the distance.  Doing your personal best.  And the stress--the growth--the physical growth.  The emotional growth, the intellectual growth and the spiritual growth.  To just keep that focus and yes, you know, you can do anything. And then also I think with running you don't take yourself, you know, that seriously.  At the end of the day you put on your running shoes.  And it's one foot in front of the other.  And sometimes that was the only thing to me that was real.  You know.  One foot then the other foot, one foot then the other foot.  And you make it to the finish line.
Speaker 1: And you were running in the evening, after--?
Speaker 2: I'd run in the evening, I'd run in the morning.  I ran with the cross country team.  You know, I would--especially when they first got started, you know.  Because they were out of shape.  And then as they got better, I would watch them (laughs).  But the cross country team in the morning.  And then I'd run in the evening.  Usually twice a day.  Tried to get in at least six or seven miles.
Story_ID: 5922
Speaker 1: Now how did you see the faculty change [at Chicago State University]? And how did you see the student body change?
Speaker 2: I saw the student body just expanded.  And then also began to get more international students as well as white students in Chicago State.  I think the faculty began to feel better about the college, in terms of recognition.  And it began to attract people.  And I was able to get Gwendolyn Brooks.  Other people also came.  And we started the Black Writers' Conference.  That had not gone on before.  So I supported Haki [Madhubuti] in doing that.
Speaker 1: Now how did that--how did the Gwendolyn Brooks Center how did that even come? What was its--you know, germination and--?
Speaker 2: Well the interim president before me had told me about this.  So we got money from the [Illinois State] legislature to pay her salary.  And then the whole issue of space and reallocating the resources to create a space for her in the library.  And then having an opening to announce that and making sure that she had the support to do her work.  But, you know, to have that as the center of what was happening at the College of Arts and Sciences.
Speaker 1: Now why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I think that the defining factor for me was my mother's [Ozie Johnson Tucker] death.  My mother--I think it was a transition for me.  Her death came very quickly.  You know, she went to live with my sister [Jean Tucker McRae].  And she was always, you know, telling me, you know, you're working too hard.  Stop.  You're not spending enough time with me. And the shock of that. You know, I felt that I'd given so much to Chicago State University.  And I hadn't taken time with her.  And I just wanted to just stop.  And then I also felt that it was time for me to leave, etcetera, in terms of, leave when they love you, so to speak.  But I think that what I probably need more was a sabbatical.  Maybe not a change.  And I probably needed then maybe three, six months to reflect.  But, you know, I decided to leave when I got an opportunity to an opportunity to go to the GE [General Electric] firm for a year as a summer break.  And then after being there for a year I was ready to go back.  And I got a call from Johnetta Cole and some other people about Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  How it caused, you know, a whole lot of trouble facing reaccreditation and also an $8 million order of disallowance from the federal government.  And I said, okay.  Come here and do some things that needed to be done.  But not to stay long. Not because the institution wouldn't need me to stay long.  But in my own mind to set up what would be the start and what would be the finish.  So my initial contract was for three years.  And then after three years when the college did not--still had--we had sixty-eight recommendations.  It had done nothing to get ready for--or very little to get ready for its self-study.  So they had sixty-eight recommendations.  And then sixty-six were completed.  There were two left.  And I decided that, you know, it's time to energize the college and move ahead.  And maybe do some things that I wanna do. You know, it's like saying to myself, okay uncles.  You know, I've done everything.  I've given back.  Now I've done things in terms of where I'm needed.  Now what is it that I would like to do? You know, it's like Jane Fonda talks us about chapter--final--Chapter three where she says, scene three, or the last--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Act three.
Speaker 2: Act three.  Okay.  What do I wanna do in act three.  And to do that, you know, for me.  Something that I can use my wisdom and my stamina and my giveback.  But not with the intensity.  My life's been extremely intense.  And I've never taken a sabbatical.  Never stopped running, you know, this marathon.  I'm thinking about a number of things.  And people have asked me about consulting and helping other institutions.  There's something very attractive about teaching.  A friend of mine who's a president would like me to go to the institution as a presidential scholar professor.  I think I'd like to do that. You know, so I can do that.  You know, I'm in a relationship with some one who is also fairly mobile.  So I can--so now I'm looking at--I'm looking at that.  And it's very hard also not to want to go--people call me and ask me about presidencies.  I don't think I wanna be a president again.  You know, there's a seduction in that.  But I don't wanna move quickly.  That's one of the reasons why I'm even doing this transition the way I am doing it.  By having the person who the senior operating officer for me literally run the college.  And I'm just doing the fundraising, the speaking, these last few months.  But that's the big dilemma.  In terms of doing something.  You know.  Using that music that's still in your body and doing something different, you know. At this age, over sixty, doing something that makes sense.
Speaker 1: I think you've got a lot of life still in you though too, when you think about it.
Speaker 2: Ah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But I understand the sabbatical. It might be good just to rest too. But--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I thought about that too.
Story_ID: 5923
Speaker 1: I can't sit before an educator and, you know, someone who has spent their life, you know, in the academic arena, and you know, a variety of different roles, both administrative and teaching and not ask your views about education and its role in our--you know, in our society--you know, in our society. And, you know, where you see things sort of going? Sort of in the future.  And also about black institutions.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.  'Cause you've had--you've had--black--education of blacks. You know, whether it was in white institutions, or--.
Speaker 2: Well I have a number of concerns as it relates to access to opportunities for blacks and students who've been under-served.  I'm very concerned about the standardized test movement, and what that's going to be doing to resegregate our society.  'Cause see the assumptions with the standardized tests is that there's a level playing field.  There's not a level playing field.  The assumption is that everybody has an environment that doesn't change, you know.  I see these homeless children who have to live in different places.  That's much more migration among blacks, because of the employment situation.  Yet these youngsters are subject to a standardized test as if there was not this change in their lives and there was a level playing field.  Very concerned about that.  I also wonder why policy makers even educational leaders don't speak up more about this.  You know, there's nothing wrong with a test if everything is fair. You know, if everybody has had access to computers.  If everybody has access to a parent who can stay home and read.  And if everybody was from families who are, you know, people are working and properly employed.  But the assumption is that equity has been addressed.  Equity has not been addressed.  I've also seen situations where, you know, if someone doesn't pass an exam, they're held back.  And I visited a Chicago Public School and I saw an eleven year old in a third grade.  And there's nothing--I mean what does that do? It's gonna eventually push students, you know, to drop out.  Now I think it is something that you can use in terms of measuring.  But what it's doing in terms of holding people back.  And more and more states looking at exams before they can give students degrees.  Now I know myself in taking these tests if I could take a test that would say, you know, I could pass a subject, a matter, exam in a year. I mean I'd just played toward the test.  There were lots of things that I missed in the interaction.  But then I see young people with problem solving skills that tests don't measure.  And I say this in my book ['Breaking Through the Wall: A Marathoner's Story'].  If a youngster who can get up, dress himself or herself, maybe even prepare food for someone else in the family, take public transportation, come home and do chores. That person has some competencies that tests don't measure.  You know, and they have some common sensibility.  And that person should be given a chance.  That person is solving problems related to his or her or her existence.  That's not captured.  So I have some concerns about that.  I also have real concerns about student having to borrow as much money as they're borrowing as undergraduates.  I've seen grants become less a part of a financial aid package.  And more students having to borrow.  I saw this in 1980.  I've seen it change now.  This precludes young people from the opportunity to go on to graduate school.  You know, they make decision about their lives what they can do, based upon their student loans.  And in many cases, African Americans only get entry-level jobs and yet are saddled with loans.  So you take the standardized test.  And you take, you know, the loan situation.  And then you also take colleges that are changing their mission.  Like one of the things I've been concerned about at a Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or CUNY [City University of New York]. That some times people are saying "Well we don't want to give students who are not totally prepared a chance.  We don't want to provide support in terms of remediation." Yet we know from the research that if you provide this support these students can succeed.  So I feel very, very strongly about that.  And there will be fewer people who have backgrounds like mine being able to go on to school.

Speaker 1: And then in terms of the historically black colleges, I am deeply concerned.  The historically black colleges are our legacy.  They are the legacy of my generation and the legacy of your generation.  They are in danger.  They are in danger, because they're undercapitalized.  I mean I have seen where, you know, Cornell University [Ithaca, New York] may get more money from a foundation than all the historically black colleges put together.  It's very--relatively little money going to these institutions.  And they don't have--I mean a Morris Brown College's endowment is under $20 million.  And you have to ask, who's interested in their success? And I wonder if their boards--the boards of historically black colleges. I mean who from the big corporations are on their boards? Where is the background? I think--when I look at a Morris Brown, there were at one time twenty-one AME [African Methodist Episcopal] colleges.  There are now six.  Morris Brown and the historically black colleges, they have the same dilemma as small liberal arts colleges.  But I worry about historically black colleges.  Some of them will survive.  The Dillards [University] will survive, the Morehouses [College], the Spelmans [College] will survive.  The Howards [University] will survive.  But what's gonna happen to Talladega [College]? What's gonna happen to Bennett [College]? And what's gonna happen to a Morris Brown?

Speaker 1: Do you think that it, that these are institutions [historically black colleges and universities, HBCUs]--I mean what if there were a shrinking, you know, and some of the, you know, there are--how many, 180?
Speaker 2: You mean should they survive?
Speaker 1: Right, should they survive.  I mean is that a bad thing that they shrink and the resources are put to, maybe the resources are collapsed and put more into the ones that are, you know--more capable of surviving.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's a bad thing right now, because if you have all the institutions going for the same students that the white institutions are going for, it's a bad thing.  I mean if they were interested, if, if you had smaller, fewer interested in diversity.  I mean--by diversity, I mean students that come in at different places academically, you know, some that have been under-served, etcetera.  But if they're all going for the top 10 percent, and you get fewer going for the, you know, you, you collapse them, and you get fewer of them, what's gonna happen to the person from rural Georgia?  What's gonna happen to the person from Newark, New Jersey or what's gonna happen to the person from Detroit who--I'm only talking about these people from these areas who've been, been under-served.  And so that you need to keep the diversity within the HBCUs.  You need to have some who have it as their mission to try to give somebody a chance.  They may not graduate, but give them a chance.  Like, I used to talk about the second generation impact.  They might not--because of the requirements and standards, they might not graduate, but their children will have an opportunity to go to school.  A second generation impact.  I used to, I used to hear people in my family say, well, you know, I went to college for a year.  Well, they were very proud that they went for a year.  And they want someone else to graduate, but they, they should be given the chance, you know, the opportunity.  So in answer to your question, if these institutions were responding to the diversity within our culture, few of them. But if you're gonna have a few of them, and they're only gonna deal with the talented tenth or the talented fifth, oh, what--less than a tenth, yeah. Then I, I worry about that.  It's just the same way that I worry about the City University of New York [CUNY].  The City University of New York, when I went there in '78 [1978] was looking at giving a wide range of students a chance.  And now they're looking at, okay, if students haven't done super well in high school, they should not be given a chance.  But you and I know that even if they haven't been given, you know--if, if they get the appropriate support at, in college and there're people there that care about them, they can succeed.  My mother [Ozie Johnson Tucker] can be in school at seventy-two years old.  Somebody looked at background and said, "My gosh, if she'd be in school, this woman's had a nervous breakdown," you know.  But she had a chance.

Speaker 1: So you believe very much in the public education system?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  I believe, and I worry about--my, my other thing I worry about--I worry about vouchers.  I worry about anything that takes money from public education.  I mean the reason why they had public education, it was not--because not a broad spectrum of the public was being educated.  You know, the vouchers create another kind of private school.  It has to be supplemented.  The costs has to be supplemented with money that your parents have in many cases, but that takes away from monies that the public schools need.
Speaker 1: It's just that I think that people, people who talk about vouchers or charter or things like that, they're talking about a reallocate-- you know, the, the sexy part of it is, this is not working.  You know, someone's getting paid, you know.  We keep throwing money in and it's not working, and there has to be a reallocation.  I mean I think that's the way the argument--you know, the, you know, it's probably too much money going for administration.  Let's shake up the system, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but see, the, the way we used to look at it in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], why it wasn't working was much broader.  We looked at it in terms of why it wasn't working in terms of were parents employed, why, you know--if there was the, the kind of support.  It's not gonna work.  They changed the welfare regulations, you know.  Lots of people aren't working, you know.  In some cases--there's a number of reasons why it isn't working.  It doesn't have all that to do with the school situation.  And I think there's more, perhaps clinical depression in families that's not being addressed.  So there're tons of reasons why it's not working that has a lot to do with how responsive or, or the lack of, of our society being responsive.  It's much too simplistic.  And I don't know how we've moved the way--I mean there again, it's this illusion that equity has been addressed.  It is not a fair world.

Speaker 1: What about this whole issue of multiculturalism and its reality within society in general.  You know, the United States has been more than any other nation, a melting pot, even at its worst.  But, you know, as someone who's spent so much of their time sort of looking at this issue and, and its implementation, what do you feel?
Speaker 2: Well, you have to look at what the goal of multicultural education is, or pluralism. Aand the goals should be, so that you have the freedom to development your own perspective, your own point of view.  Now, today, I worry about this, you know.  I think it's, you know, it's very good in terms of united we stand, but you can still have your own point of view.  Now, one of the things that, that's happening right now, it's like everybody has the same point of view because you're American.  But still, I--even though, even though you're patriotic and you embrace being American, you can understand why not everybody in this world is a happy camper, and not why everybody in this world is happy with what we're doing.  As an African American, I can.  So I do have a filter, and I would hate for us to, you know, in terms of multicultural, you have to understand that you have Arab Americans, you have Muslim Americans, that they, they may have a different point of view or a different perspective.  And what multiculturalism says that you got to honor that perspective, and you got to listen to it, and maybe learn something from it or tell them your point of view, but you cannot necessarily expect them to be, you know, where you are.  Or if you have an African American that grew in a, at a time like I did, when we saw something's wrong with the system.  I grew up in terms of non-violence, but now the country's at war.  How do I feel about the country being at war?  I think some people should be sitting down talking about it, even though we have to be at war.  Now, that's my perspective.  That's my voice.  So still American, united, but I have my own point of view.  So the goal of multiculturalism or the goal of cultural pluralism is to expect that people have a different means to perhaps the same end.  That the end is not necessarily different, but they have different means, given their own cultural--and to, and to listen to that.

Speaker 1: How do you think that African Americans can either maintain their voice or find their voice going forward?
Speaker 2: I think doing what you're doing.  I think that people have to realize, okay, number one, that there are different voices, and there are different ways of seeing the world.  I worry about African Americans feeling that they have to somehow compromise.  You know, the oral tradition is very rich in our community, but people are afraid to, to tell, to articulate their point of view.  You know, come on, what could they do to me at this point?  You know, I'll soon be able to get social security, (laughs) but I mean (laughs), but it--I worry about people who are afraid, you know, to, to speak out.  And, and as African Americans, you need to be able to see--the only way that we can become a people right now for us is to somehow understand people, the fourth world, poor people of color.  And I worry about us seeing the big picture.  And the big picture is what is happening in this country or in this world for, you know--and who are their advocates?  So in answer to your question in terms of what, you know, our voice needs, can be provincial, or regional, but we've got to somehow look at some of the big issues.  I'd like us to look at--where is--you don't want me to get going on standardized tests again.  But I wrote a paper once, on what do you do with people who you've identified as incompetent? (laughs) And then I started thinking about all the people who have degrees who passed the test for running this country, I mean some of them who are not--lots of people at Enron [Corporation] probably did very well--let me stop (laughs)--on a standardized test.

Speaker 1: What do you want to have as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I want to have that I walked my talk, as, you know, it's, it isn't just something that I said, you know, in the '60s [1960s] that somebody should be out here helping, making a difference; that I've taken some risk.  You know, not everybody has loved me, not everybody's embraced me.  But I've done what I thought was, was right and what I had a responsibility, and that I remember and know who, know who I am.  I want that in terms of my legacy.  I've been true to who I am.  I haven't played games.
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I want to be remembered for the fact that I just didn't define myself as an educator, but how I defined myself as a marathoner.  When I think about myself, I don't necessarily think about myself in my cap and gown.  I think about myself running and putting one foot ahead of the other, and, and being tenacious enough to say, you know, this is what I, you know, I want to do, and taking the risk at fifty and beyond to keep doing it.  And I didn't just define myself that way, as, as a president, but that there was more that is, in some ways, has a greater reality for me than some of the other, the, the literal marathons, may have a great reality than the figurative because so many things keep repeating themselves.
