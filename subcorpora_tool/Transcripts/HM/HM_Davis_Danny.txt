Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I am interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Danny, D-A-N-N-Y, middle initial K, Davis, D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: And what does the K stand for?
Speaker 2: Well, the K actually stands for Kenyatta.  I was a, a real fan of Jomo Kenyatta and the work that he did towards the liberation of, of Kenya.  And as a young adult, once I got enough money to do some things (laughs), one of the things that I decided to do was insert the K in honor of, of Jomo Kenyatta.  And one of the great experiences that I've had in life was the opportunity to go to Kenya in, in 1975, and, and have an opport--I spent a month in Kenya in '75 [1975].  And that's what, that's where the K comes from.
Speaker 1: All right, and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm, I was born in Parkdale, [Ashley County] Arkansas, September the 6th, 1941, one of the sons of Martha [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis].
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I am a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing the Seventh Congressional District in the State of Illinois.
Speaker 1: And, sir, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Currently, we are in a historic building that used to be the Sears Merchandising Center and was international headquarters for Sears, Roebuck and Company until they moved away.  My congressional office is downstairs on the first floor, but we're on the second floor.  And I moved into this building because my predecessor was actually downtown in the Federal Building.  And I knew that we'd have so many people coming through here for different things, meetings and all, until it would just be untenable.  So we found a location out in the heart of the neighborhood.  This is probably the heart of my congressional district because it starts downtown at the lake and goes out to [interstate highway] 294, to the end of Cook County.  And so this would be very centrally located for my congressional district.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is December 15, 2003.
Story_ID: 6318
Speaker 1: Sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Probably turnip greens and what is called hot water cornbread (laughs).  Nothing gets better than that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color would be blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I, I, I particularly like the summer.  It seems to me that I eat less during the summer.  I always lose a few pounds, and I'm outdoors more.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I really don't.  I like to revisit the South where I grew up.  I mean, I grew up in rural Arkansas, and have a great deal of affinity for the South.  And so I like revisiting or going back around the areas where I grew up as a child and reminiscing and looking at things, and, and retracing, retracking.  And, of course, you generally get the chance to run into some relatives that you haven't seen for many, many years.  So that, that, that, that's kind of my favorite stuff that I like to do in terms of a vacation.
Speaker 1: All right, and the last question is, sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I really have a lot of them, but one of them that, that I'm, I'm really fond of is something that Frederick Doug-Douglass said, and that is "power concedes nothing without a demand.  It never has, and it never will.  If you would find the level of oppression that a people will accept, that is exactly what they will get."
Story_ID: 6319
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  We'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Mazzie, M-A-Z-Z-I-E, Lee Davis.  Of course, her maiden name was Glass, so Mazzie Lee Glass was my mother's maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give us her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, she was born in Alabama, as a matter of fact, August the 16th, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well not very much in terms of really going back because my mother's family migrated when she was a little girl, from Alabama to Arkansas.  As a matter of fact, she had a sister who was left behind in Alabama that she didn't see for about thirty-five years.  I mean they never saw each other again until then.  They rediscovered, and I can remember it so well because they--this woman came to visit us, Aunt Eula Mae [ph.], and she looked just like my mother when she got off the bus.  And we just knew it was her.  And so my mother's parents came--her mother came to Arkansas with her family.  Her father went to Mississippi with his family, and, of course, my mother's mother married a gentleman in Arkansas who had twelve children, who was kind of like the patriarch of the little town where they lived.  My, my, my grandfather got married in Mississippi, and I guess he had seven, eight, nine, ten children.  And so my mother had about twenty-five brothers and sisters (laughs), none of which were what one would call whole brothers and sisters, but because of my mother's personality and, and all of this, we were very close to all of them.  I, I, I mean, we were close to her father's side of the family.  We were very close to her mother's side of the family.  And so when I was a child growing up, we just always had people coming to visit us from all these far-away places that they lived.  And, and it was very interesting.  But other than trying to find out about, you know, her relatives before then, we never found out much about them because, as I say, they left Alabama.  And other folk did not.  She did have an uncle who was sort of the person I think who led the group.  And what was happening is that the land where both my parents were born in Alabama sort of gave out, and they came to Arkansas as part of groups looking for new land, fresh land to farm.
Speaker 1: About what year would that be?
Speaker 2: I guess that would have been when my father was about six or seven years old and my mother was probably four or five.  Let's see, my father [Hezekiah Davis] is ninety-one years old now, so that would have been probably in the early 1920s.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories from your mother's side of the family that she tells about her side?
Speaker 2: Well, just that it was pretty clear that, that, that my mother's side of the family probably were what, dating back to slavery, were probably what would have been called house slaves.  I mean I've pieced together that much history.  And, and they were also very knowledgeable people even though they didn't have much formal education.  I mean, like I have an uncle who's my mother's stepbrother, right now, who's ninety-nine years old.  I mean, and you may have noticed that I had a little difficulty using the terminology stepbrother because they never dealt with any of that.  As a matter of fact, the closest people to us (laughs) technically, I guess, would not have been related because these were stepbrothers and sisters of my mother's and it just happens that, that one of the closest families that we had a relationship with would have been my mother's stepbrother's family.  And, and, and, of course, his name is Willie Bonds, but we always called him Uncle Dude, and so Uncle Dude was like our guy.  Uncle Dude is ninety-nine years old right now, and we're all looking forward to his one hundredth birthday which is going to be around Easter of, of this year coming up.  And my cousin is preparing--step cousin--(laughs), is preparing a, a birthday party for him.  And, of course, everybody will come and, and we trust--because he's very, right now he--just came from Arkansas, as a matter of fact, three weeks ago.  He went to Arkansas to hear a fellow preach who had grown up with me as we all were kids in the church where my uncle was the Sunday school superintendent for sixty-five years.
Speaker 1: So he's pretty mobile now.  He can move around--?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  He does walk with a walker, but he also has a tremendous memory.  I, I mean he remembers things that went on when I was a kid that I cannot remember myself.  And, and to see he and my father have a conversation--I mean I have another uncle who, who is about eighty years old.  And they often will tell him that he's not old enough, that he doesn't qualify to be in their conversation, and that all he's talking is hearsay because he wasn't (laughs) really on the set.  And, and, and so, I mean that was one, that's my mother's side of the family on her mother's side.  Then on her father's side, I am discovering people every day, almost, who are relatives of mine that I never knew were relatives.  And, and some of the--we've just had the most wonderful relationship.  For example, there's a fellow in Gary, Indiana who's been an elected official--well, he just got defeated.  But before then, he was probably the longest serving black person in Indiana politics.  I mean he's been in office for years, Dozier Allen [Jr.].  I went to a family reunion one year, and I don't know if he asked me what was I doing there or if I asked him what was he doing there and I said, "Well, you know, I came to the family reunion."  And he said, "Well, this is my family's reunion too."  And we discovered that we were cousins, and that both our, our--on our, our mother's side, they were Glasses.  My mother was a Glass.  His mother was a Glass, and since then, I mean we've just had the most wonderful relationship.  I had a call just the other day from a young fellow in Connecticut who is a postal executive, who was reading an article in a postal magazine that I had written and that somebody had showed him.  And he said, "Oh, that's my cousin."  And he called, and he's going to be in this area for Christmas, and I'm looking forward to seeing him.  So I just keep--I also got a call from a lady in Alabama, Huntsville, Alabama, and she said, "You know, I think we may be cousins."  And I said, "Well, maybe so."  And she asked me if I'd heard of a person Ruben (ph.) Glass.  Well, turns out, I said, "Well, yeah, my mother had a brother named Ruben Glass."  She said, "But was he living in 1870-something?"  I said, "Well, no he wasn't (laughs) living then."  Turns out, though that they have done a real search on the Glasses and, and I'm almost certain that my uncle probably got his name from this person because they've done a search.  And then almost--I'm also certain that I probably have an aunt because they had another person listed there, a Lilly [ph.] Glass.  I have an Aunt whose name is Lullie (ph.) Glass.  And I got a strong feeling that, that her name probably came, came from that origin.  And so it's fascinating to, to find these people that, that we are, in deed, related.  I mean I've gotten enough information to know that--like the young fellow the other day, he says, "Well, you know, my brother used to visit a fellow in Mississippi whose name was Son Glass."  I said, "Ah, that was my grandfather."  I said, "His name was actually James Glass, but we always called him 'Son'."  Everybody called him Son.  We never called him grandfather or anything."  And so it was very clear that this was real information.  You know, that it's not manufactured, but it's real stuff.  And these are, in deed, my relatives.  And, and it's just been a lot of fun.  And, and even prejudices can show--for example, I met one fellow named Glass many years ago who was a police sergeant at the time.  But he was a, he was--his complexion was dark. and I just didn't bother to inquire of him.  Then later on I met his brother whose complexion looked pretty much like the Glasses that I had known, and we started inquiring and talking.  Low and behold, his father and my grandfather were close relatives, and John and I became close friends and remained so until he died.  And, and so I keep finding people on my mother's side of the family--haven't found many on my father's side of the family, but on my mother's side.
Story_ID: 6320
Speaker 1: What is your father's full name, and can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Well, my father had--his, his name is actually Hezekiah Davis.  They always used the initial.  I never knew why, H. D. Davis.  And it was clear from, you know, interacting with them, I mean his, his, his mother's maiden name was Webb, and we never really found out a great deal about them either because her husband died, when my father was a little boy his daddy died.  And, and his mother raised he and his brothers and sister and never remarried.  It was also pretty clear that they were from what would be called the field hand period of slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: I mean they were tenacious.
Speaker 1: Oh, there's something I didn't (unclear) about your mother's [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis] side.  You said, they were house people for the most part, that you thought they were people that served in the house.  Now, did they own the property that they moved from in Alabama or--?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: They were renting?
Speaker 2: It just didn't--I mean that, they just couldn't make a living because the property just did not produce anything.  I mean--and I guess--and all of it would tie in as I would listen and learned all about George Washington Carver, and how he came up with these different approaches to, to making things out of peanuts and--.
Speaker 1: So did, did they live that part of Alabama?
Speaker 2: I'm saying they lived in that part of Alabama--.
Speaker 1: Near Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: --and, and, and it all just made so much sense as, as I've listened and, and, and heard how people managed.  And it's so unfortunate that so many of our children, young people, don't have much sense of this or any understanding of it.  And, and basically because we've neglected to share it with them.  I mean--.
Speaker 1: Now, back to your father though, your father's family, you said, they were like field people, workers, for the most part--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He, yeah, it was clear in terms of what they ate, in terms how they--for example, I mean the difference in, in, in dietary things, like on my father's side of the family, they, they liked coarse food, kind of hard bread (laughs).  They didn't, they weren't in for too many dainty things, and, and I mean my mother could make all these little things, teacakes and cookies and tarts and pies.  I mean, and, and it was clear that this had been handed down to her, which means that her parents, her mother had obviously been able to do that. I, I, I mean on my father's side of the family, that was not a staple.  I mean their thing was more--they liked--even wild game and fish, and, and, and they, they put a lot of emphasis on real hard work and, and--I mean my father probably was the most tenacious working guy (laughs) I've ever heard about.  He was like John Henry, but he was just a little guy (laughs), you know.  He could have been John Henry except he just was a small guy in stature, plus the members of his family, they, they've lived long periods of time.  I mean my grandmother--we used to call her grandma Mattie, was ninety-six when she died.  My father's oldest brother was ninety-six when he died, Uncle Joe.  My father's sister, Aunt Mary, was ninety-four when she died.  And so here my father is, he's ninety one, and then he's got a brother who's two years younger than he is, and they're still kicking, and, and still around.  And, and so--they were great storytellers.  I mean my father told us a great deal about what he knew.  And he really didn't know much though, and, and--because--I mean he just remembered his father when his father got killed in an accident because he was a carpenter and fell of a ladder, a ladder and stuck something in his side, and couldn't get to the doctor and that kind of thing.  But, but they obviously talked a great deal.  And--I mean there are people who accuse me of being a storyteller and that kind of thing.  Well, if so, then I really picked it up from my father who kept us pretty much enthralled during my entire childhood.
Story_ID: 6321
Speaker 1: What are some stories he [father, Hezekiah 'H.D.' Davis] told?  Did he--did they have stories that went all the way back to slavery or?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he, he'd come close to slavery.  I mean he'd have stories about people who would be out searching for treasury after the Civil War, and it was clear--I mean I'd read some of this in, in history books and did read it and all, and how people would be looking--you know, because the Southern planters, when the Northern troops would be on the way, would hide whatever they owned.  And these things just sort of evolved, and people would go out money hunting.  And, and they even would do it while I was a kid.  I mean I--my father and some of his friends would go out.  And, of course, there was the whole thing about seeing ghosts and, and there was so much conversation about this.
Speaker 1: Now, did they call them ghosts then?
Speaker 2: Well, haints .
Speaker 1: Haints?  Hants?
Speaker 2: They called them ghosts, some people called them ghosts, some people called them hants.  And we actually thought we could see them.  I mean when I was a kid, I, I--I mean there was a period when I was just absolutely certain, I mean I had reached the point where I felt like I was old enough to date.  And I had a little girl that I liked, and I wanted to walk her home from church one night.  And I told my father and, you know, told them they could go ahead, I was gonna walk home.  And after I'd walked her home, you know, (chuckle) I got down the road, and this fellow had died, Uncle Nero, and I was just absolutely certain that I saw Uncle Nero, unequivocally without a doubt, standing by the road (laughs) out in front of his house.  And so I started running, and I got about a mile and a half or maybe two miles to the next fellow's house who had died, a fellow named Mr. Ed Ritter, who had a big tree in front of his house.  And he always smoked a pipe.  And I looked up, and there Mr. Ed Ritter was with a (laughs) jumper suit on, smoking a pipe and had a hunting cap (laughs).  And oh, my God, when I got home, and I ran on the porch and hit the door.  And my mother [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis] said, "What's wrong with you, fool?  What are you doing?"  I says, "I just saw Mr. Ed, Mr. Ed Ritter!" (laughs).  "And I saw Uncle Nero before I saw him!"  And, and all of this stuff was so clear and (sigh), but, you know, strangely enough, I haven't seen any of those kind of things in many, many years.  But we used to actually feel as though we saw them at that time because people talked about things.
Story_ID: 6322
Speaker 1: Well, much of this [superstition] was a carryover, I learned, as I began to study history, you know, that, that much of this was a carryover from slavery.  And there was some natural superstition, but also there would be things that the plantation owners and slave holders would concoct and, you know, my father used to tell us stories about how whites would come to their house, even--and, and this was when he was a child, and, you know, they'd have organized [Ku Klux] Klan activity, and that the Klan would come up to your house and maybe somebody would ask for a drink of water.  And they'd drink a whole bucket full of water.  And, of course, they discovered later on that they really weren't drinking the water, that they'd have another bucket under the robes (laughs).  And they'd be pouring the water (laughs) out of one container into another container.  And, and, and so, yeah, it's a--I mean the storytelling--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was done to trick people and scare them, I guess.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah, absolutely
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --and make them think they had supernatural ability
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I'm saying, even though slavery was over long time, but, but, but, you know, there was still the creation of a fear atmosphere and the creation of an idea that there was a level of superiority that existed as evidenced by the fact that "I can drink a bucket of water.  You cannot drink a bucket full of water, but I can, and you saw me drink it, although I had my robe on, you know, had my sheet on and everything."  And, and so, yeah, we learned a great deal from that kind of storytelling.  And we also learned a great deal about how people amassed certain a amount of resource and wealth and then how it was snatched away from 'em.  My father used to tell stories about how people would come, after people had acquired land--they may have homesteaded it. They may have gotten it, but they would sell their land sometimes for some beads or a, a merchant would come through or they would sell it for some cloth or a watch or whatever.  And, and, and so the, the, the trickery that obviously was used after the period of Reconstruction, I'm, I'm saying that's a period that a great deal was lost, but fortunately, in some families, people were still close enough to that until they told--for example, most of the things that I learned about Reconstruction in the history of that period, after I got interested in studying it and reading it, were the kind of things that my father had told us as stories.  They may have been (laughs) slightly different, but it, it, it, you know, you could piece together the information.  One set of information, you got it out of a history book.  Another set of information, you got it in stories and tales and information that someone passed on as they had received it, and, and so, somehow or another, we need to put more emphasis on that so that our children can have a better understanding of where they really came from.
Story_ID: 6323
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your mother's [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis], her personality?  What kind of person is your mother, and what did she--?
Speaker 2: My mother was the best social worker (chuckle), I've ever known in my life and never had a day of social work.
Speaker 1: Did--did she have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, she really didn't.  My mother finished the eighth grade.  My father [Hezekiah 'H.D.' Davis] finished the fourth grade.  And the reason that my mother was able to finish the eighth grade is she went to Mississippi and lived some, during her growing up years, with her father, who, who was my grandfather, in Mississippi.  And she managed to finish the eighth grade.  Where we lived, and where I lived [Parkdale, Arkansas], there was not a high school, actually, for blacks until, oh, I guess ten years before I got to high school.  I'm saying I know people that I kind of grew up with who were older than I am who had to go away to go to high school.  I'm, I'm saying they could only finish the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Now, did you mother do--did she, was she basically a housewife or did she do, work outside the home?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, she was a farmer's wife.  She was a farmer's wife, which meant that she was a housewife, she also worked the fields.  And she did all of the other things that you do, and, of course, she also had nine children.  And, and so she looked after all of us.  But some how or another, her personality was such, she had such a giving spirit, and she was so pleasing that people kind of gravitated to her and around her.  And she was so good at, at displaying sensitivity that when my mother died, my brothers and sisters and I sat up all night talking about which one of us (chuckle) was her favorite child.  I mean we, we got into this argument about which one was the favorite child.  And my father was in the other room, we thought asleep.  Finally, he got up and came out.  He says, "I heard you all in here arguing about who was Mazzie's favorite child."  And he said, "Well, none of you really weren't her favorite."  He says, "I was her favorite (laughs) because I knew her the longest," and that kind of thing.  But I mean that, that was my mother.  And she had, she had tremendous skill.  I mean she was a great cook.  She could sew and make anything almost.  And she just simply had a way--I, I mean we used to try to get sick so that my mother could, could (chuckle) nurse us or take care of us or put her hand on our forehead or talk about having some soup or some tea.  I mean generally, the only sickness that you got was to have a bad cold in the wintertime or catch the flu or something like that.  And if, you know, I mean I've had people tell me about social work stuff.  Well, if, if, if I got any of that, it came from, from my mother who, who just simply had a way, and, and had a desire to display sensitivity.  I never will forget her.  If somebody got sick in our neighborhood, she'd make them a pot of soup or chicken or whatever.  Of course, if we butchered a hog, everybody in the neighborhood had to get some of it.  She'd divide it up.  And I never will forget my mother sending me to a lady's house who was sick, on a mule to, to (laughs) take her (laughs) chicken.  And when I got back home I said to my mother--and this lady had tuberculosis, and I said to my mother, I said, "Well, you know, Cousin Doll really looked good," I mean because they were so afraid of tuberculosis, my mother had said, "Don't get off the mule, just go there," and, you know, and, of course, I couldn't do that.  And, and so I went in, and saw the lady and all of that.  And matter of fact, the lady outlived my mother and alots of other people too.  And I, so my mother said, "Well, how do you know how she looked?"  I says, "Oh, when they came out the house, and I gave them the chicken, I leaned over on the mule and happened (chuckle) to see."  And my mother said, "You lying.  You know you're lying (laughs), you, 'cause I told you not to go in that house.  And you've gone."  But it was nothing unusual for me to have a task of doing that,  I mean just "Cousin so and so is sick, here. I'm gon' bake her a cake. Take it to her."  And she'd bake this--the thing about this soup and all, she'd put the soup in a container and put the lid over it, you know.  But she'd put a towel in between, and I'm supposed to be able to ride this mule and take it and she'd say, "And don't waste it." (laughs)  And so, here I am, you know, trying to get to wherever it is that I'm going and not waste this liquid, you know.  And, and, and it's the craziest thing in the world.  Generally, I managed, I mean to do so, but that was my mother.  I mean that, and, and--But she was firm at the same time.  My mother would actually be punishing you in terms of a whipping, and she'd be laughing all at the same time.  I mean she'd just be cracking up.  And we'd say, "Well, what, what--why are you doing this?"  "What?"  And she'd say, "Oh, I'm, I, I love you.  I'm, I'm not mad with you.  I'm not angry.  I'm just whipping you because you need it.  I mean it, you, you--I got to do this.  I, I don't have any choice."  I said, "But why are you laughing at me?"  She said, 'Cause you're funny, the way you're squirming around and jumping around and (laughs), trying to crawl under the bed and all of this kind of thing."  And so I had a good childhood.  We were simply--we worked hard, poor people, went to church, didn't have any money.  But we, we were taught values.  We were taught responsibility.
Story_ID: 6324
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father [Hezekiah Davis].  What was he like--well, he's still alive, and--?
Speaker 2: Still alive.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Solid man, one of the smartest cats I've ever met in my life, finished the fourth grade, but he was an avid reader.  And my father read all the time.  I mean he'd be reading a book.  He'd come home from the fields, and take himself a bath and read.  And, and I guess he may have passed that on to me in a sense--I mean--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)--And did he read mostly newspapers?
Speaker 2: He read everything.  There weren't any newspapers.  We didn't have any newspapers.  As a matter of fact, I became very friendly with a white man who lived in our town.  And the reason was he would save me his newspapers every week.  I had a job cleaning his yard, and this guy would pay me three dollars, which was more than the going rate.  Most people only made three dollars for working a whole day.  And I could do his yard in about a half a day.  But the most important things was, he would save me his newspapers, the 'Arkansas Gazette' and the 'Arkansas Democrat', and I would devour those papers that whole week, and just be waiting till the next Saturday came so I could go back and get the next bunch.  He didn't know it, but I would have done his yard for nothing, for the newspapers. Now his name was Carl Dean Miller, and we just became--as a matter of fact, I went to visit him a few years ago.  I happened to be in the town [Parkdale, Arkansas].  He was about eighty-five years old at the time because he and my father were the same age.  And so I go in this store on a Sunday, my wife and I are there visiting.  And there's a mercantile store.  I said, "My goodness, this says Miller Mercantile.  I wonder if Mr. Carl Dean might be there."  I go in, go in the store and says, "I'm looking for Mr. Carl Dean Miller."  He said, "You just found him."  I said, "You wouldn't possibly know who I am."  He says, "Ah, yeah, I know who you are.  You're H.D. [Hezekiah Davis] and Mazzie's [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis] son," so and so and so and so.  But, but, yeah, my father was just a great reader.  And plain, conservative, serious, not overbearing, had a lot of pride.  I mean my father had so much pride until--I mean I can remember my father being stuck--he bought a tractor one year, he finally got a tractor.  And a fellow came by and says, "Dee," said, "You're having a little problem.  I see you're stuck," cause he always worked--it was actually too wet (laughs) for him to be working, trying to work in the field.  He said, "Well, I got a little disadvantage, but I ain't really got no problem."  Says, "My tractor is stuck," said, "But I'm going up here and get my mules and pull it out."  He said, "Just because I bought a tractor, I didn't get rid of my mules." (laughs)  And, and, and so he was that kind of a practical person.  I mean I remember going in the summertime in August, it was so hot, and these were the days--you know, the dog days of August.  And my father said to my brothers and I, "Come on fellows, we need to go to the woods and cut some wood."  And so we, "Daddy, you know, I mean this is the most ridiculous--I mean it's a hundred degrees.  And here we are out here cutting wood."  He said, "Now let me tell--say 'Always prepare for war in the time of peace'."  Well, we didn't pay any attention to it.  That winter, it was cold, raining bad, sleeting, and our neighbors came by on their way to the woods.  And so my father called me and my brothers out to the porch, he said, "Come here." Say "Where you think them fellows going?"  We said, "Well, they're probably going to get them some wood."  He say, "Do we need any wood?"  I said, "Nah, we got plenty.  We got it piled up."  He said, "Y'all remember back in August when you was wondering why we was getting the wood then?" (laughs) He said, "Well, we was getting it then so we wouldn't have to be getting it now."  And, and, and so my father was a very practical, didactic, always teaching, greatly philosophical man, church-goer.  As a matter of fact--but he didn't beat you over the head with the religion.

Speaker 1: My father was the public pray-er.  I mean, I mean in, in those days, you know, people prayed publicly.  And my father was one of the best in the country.  People would come from miles around to get him to pray, and--.
Speaker 2: Did that inspire you 'cause you--you're known as a orator.  You have a rich sounding voice.  Did your father's voice sound like that?
Speaker 1: Well, not, not, not in a sense--and he didn't do anything other than pray.  He was not a--but he could do this praying.  I mean he--and I can remember almost verbatim some of my father's public prayers to this day.  You know, how he'd start them, "Father, oh, Father, I stretch my hand to thee for no other help I know, if thous withdraw thyself from me wherever shall I go?  What did thine only son endure before I drew my breath; what pain, what labors to save my soul from an endless death?" and I mean he could on and on, thundering around.  My, my, my friend and I used to--we thought we were kind of bright little boys as we were growing up.  You know, we started learning little stuff.  And we'd be trying to figure out where these people got their vocabularies, and how they knew certain things and it made sense, like my father would say, search and research our deceitful heart.  And if you find anything like sin or evil, cast it as far away as the East is from the West."  And me and my buddy, Haywood Davidson, we'd be trying to figure out, how far is East from West. (laughs) I mean how do you measure that? Or, he might say, "Cast it into the sea of forgetfulness where it will never rise again."  (laughs)  We'd be "Where these cats get this stuff from?"  We knew they hadn't gone to school.  I'm saying, we, we, we knew that they had not had the opportunity for formal education.  People in my town built a new church in our little congregation and all.  And, and, you know, money that we'd often have on a Sunday would be six cents.  We'd have a nickel and a penny.  The penny was for the collection for Sunday school, and the nickel, of course, was the, the collection for the general offering.
Story_ID: 6326
Speaker 1: There would be periods of time, especially during the winter, say from January up until the time what you--when you would begin to prepare your crop, you wouldn't see maybe--a whole family wouldn't see fifty dollars; January, February, March.  April, you could begin to get things on credit because now you're getting ready to make your crop or, or grow what you're going to grow.  And you could get credit from the general stores and all.  But you couldn't get credit because you weren't doing anything.  There was no work for you to be doing.  And so January, February and March were very lean times, the money.  You just wouldn't see it.  I, I mean it just--we only went to school when I was a kid growing up, and where I grew up, five months a year.  I mean we went to school January, February, March, April, and school would be over the first week of May.  Then we'd go to school again from about the middle of July until the middle of August.
Story_ID: 6327
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you something--back track a minute and ask you how your parents [Hezekiah Davis and Mazzie Lee Glass Davis] met? Is there a story?
Speaker 2: I really don't know that.  I guess they probably--because they were both, probably at church.  They, they, I'm saying both their families were members of the, we called it the CME church, but it, it was the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in the town.  And so they both grew up in that church, and I'm pretty sure that that's where they probably met or maybe at school, but they may not have met at school because, like I say, there was no high school during the time that they were growing up.  They didn't have a high school for blacks in that town.  So they didn't meet at, probably at school unless they met, you know--and, and the way the schools were--because you lived so far apart, there may be somebody having classes on a plantation or there may have been a little school like Ms. Beadie King taught the first school I went to which was a one-room school.
Story_ID: 6328
Speaker 1: Well, in regards to the school, now you went to--now, Ms. Beadie King taught you in a, it was a eight room?
Speaker 2: One room.
Speaker 1: One room, okay, well the eighth grades was--
Speaker 2: (laughs).  Eighth grade (laughs).
Speaker 1: See, that's how the Internet can mess us up when we do research. (laughs)  'Cause they got in there, it was a eight room school, I said, well--.
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: So it's really a one-room with eight grades in it?
Speaker 2: One, one room, one room, one, one room about the size of this room that we're in.  It was about maybe the size, maybe a little smaller.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Beadie?
Speaker 2: B-E-A-D-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mrs. King, just a wonderful woman.
Speaker 1: And what kind of little fellow were you in those days?  Did you--I mean I read that you had a speech impediment, and were you shy--?
Speaker 2: I was tie tongued.
Speaker 1: Were you--okay.
Speaker 2: I was tie-tongued, and shy.
Speaker 1: That's what they called it back then?
Speaker 2: That's what they called it.  I was tie-tongued.
Speaker 1: That means you stuttered?
Speaker 2: I stuttered when I talked.  And sometimes I would get so excited trying to get out what I would be trying to say until it would be "b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b", and actually, my nickname was 'Puff'.  I'm, I'm saying the kids started calling me Puff because I used to try to tell the story about the three little pigs, you know.  And I'd say, you know, "And the big bad wolf says, he'd huff and puff and b-b-b-b-b-b(laughs) and blow your house down," and that kind of thing.  And, and so, if ever I run into--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And you couldn't say puff? (laughs)
Speaker 2: Yeah, and somebody who says "Puff," I know where they coming from, you know, that, that they're coming back when we were six, seven, eight, nine, ten years old.  I, I mean I had a wonderful experience not long ago.  I was in Little Rock, Arkansas and in the airport, and my father and I were about to rent a car.  And the person called my name, you know, "Danny Davis, your car is ready."  A lady came over and said, "Are you Danny Davis?"  I said, "Well, yes, I am."  She said, "Well, I am Hayward Davidson's wife."  And, of course, Hayward had died, but, but this was the guy who was my best friend when were growing up, I mean when we were little kids.  We were best friends.  And ah, that, that was precious.
Story_ID: 6329
Speaker 1: What was that community like?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, the name of the town reflected--you know, Parkdale [Arkansas], that meant that--you know, a dale, where there were trees.  And there was a bayou, a bit of water.  And, and it was, you know, kind of, nice little place, the little town, although most of us lived in, in the rural part of it [Ashley County] because we were farmers.  Blacks lived in a little area, the ones who lived in a congregated fashion in what was called the quarters.  And this was a little area that had been built essentially for people who were house workers and, and so forth initially for the white population who lived there.
Speaker 1: So was it situated behind rich people's homes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was kind of--in this instance, it wasn't really behind because they had--where they lived was actually right, adjacent to the body of water.  But it was a little to the side of where they lived.  And, and these--people, many people who lived there, especially early on, were people who had worked as cooks and, and housekeepers and other kinds of things.  And there were some people who worked at the mill.  And so if they worked at the mill, which was in another town, there was no need for them to be out on the farm or out in the rural part of the community.  And, of course, we were very envious.  We thought of the people who lived in "the quarters" (laughs) they, they were congregated.  They could see each other without having to go a mile to see the next neighbor.  And, but then we had some advantages living out in the country because we grew much of our food.  And, and my parents [Hezekiah Davis and Mazzie Lee Glass Davis], I mean I--God bless them, I, I mean, the more I, I understand about them, the greater--my father used to load his wagon full of watermelons, and just take it downtown and park it for people who didn't have any, and just give it to 'em.  Or we'd just let people come out to our field and pick whatever vegetables they wanted.  No charge, no anything.  You want some peas, we got plenty of them; just come and get--pick them until you can't pick anymore.  You want some roasting ears--we didn't call them roasting ears.  We just called them "roastinehs" (laughs), but the, but, but if you want some, we'd give it to you.  I mean, I--and, and my, my brothers and I would often question my father about things like that.  Why are you doing this?  I mean what?  And he said, "Well, you know, there isn't anything we really can do with these watermelons.  You guys want some watermelon?"  "Well, yeah."  "Well, you got plenty, you, (laughs) you've been eating them all week." (laughs) "Will you still have some?"  "Well, yeah, there're plenty in the field."  He said, "Do we have enough for the hogs?"  "Yeah, the hogs got plenty."  "Well, we gonna let them spoil when we can let other people have them?"  And, and the season when things were, you know, like the end of August and in September, and that's when--we just take them out, put them in the wagon, anybody who wanted them, come.
Story_ID: 6330
Speaker 1: In school, now, you, and Mrs. Beadie King's school [a one-room grade school for African Americans in Parkdale, Arkansas] , how long were you there and--?
Speaker 2: Well, it turned out that Mrs. Beadie ended up being my teacher from the time I started school till the time I finished because by the time I graduated from high school, the schools had consolidated a great deal, and there was a high school [Savage High School, Parkdale, Ark.].  And she was the high school English and literature teacher.
Speaker 1: So you had her in high school too?
Speaker 2: I had her in high school too.  I mean she, she, she probably had the greatest influence on things that, that, that I remember, and things that I learned.  She often taught by--she used little vignettes and parables.  People hear me recite poetry sometimes, and most of that stuff I really learned from Mrs. Beadie.  I mean she had a way of teaching, and, and she taught principles and concepts.  I mean she'd--it's like, if she wanted you to be quiet, she may tell you something like, "A wise old owl sat on an oak.  The more he heard, the less he spoke; the less he spoke, the more he heard.  Now, I want you boys to be like that wise old bird."  And, you know, it made sense, you know.  So here, if you're not talking, then you can hear, and (laughs), and, of course, if you didn't adhere to that, then she had Mr. Love's plow lines to assist (laughs), you know, I mean, the, the--and, and she'd walk to school--even
Speaker 1: You mean plow lines, you mean the reins the for the plow, the--leather straps?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's right, these leather--.
Speaker 1: And these were applied to certain portions of the body to--?
Speaker 2: Of the anatomy, yes, I mean these, these were--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --to create compliance in the school.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --tools that, that helped one be in compliance with her regulations, and, and all.  I mean she just had so many of those kind of things.  I mean, like if you were criticizing another person, she had one called the 'Owl Critic' and, and which taught you that you need to be sure.  You know, it sort of said, "The guy walks in the barber shop.  'Who stuffed that owl, Mr. Brown?' the man said with a frown.  He said, "I could take an old hat and make an owl that looked better than that."  The barber kept on, but the deal went down, the owl flew off the perch, (laughs) which meant it really was not a stuffed owl at all.  The owl was alive, and, and, and I mean there were so fond memories of those kind of things.  And, you know, when I left school, I went away to college thinking that I had been deprived, and, and thinking that everybody at college knew more than I did because of the little time that, that we had actually spent [in school]  And the more I learned, the more precious Mrs. King and the other people became.  And I've had so many great experiences with her memory and members of her family.  I mean her grandson is a Ph.D. physicist down in Florida.  I was giving a speech to the Corp of Engineers, the [U.S.] Army Corp of Engineers one day, and I mentioned her.  And a young woman came over and said, "Did I hear you say Mrs. Beadie King was your teacher?"  I said, "She sure was."  She said, "Well, that's my grandmother." Says, "I just want you to know that."  And she said, "I felt so good (laughs) listening to that," and, and I just mentioned Mrs. King, but there're a lot of people, I mean I learned this thing that people did.
Story_ID: 6331
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I think it was history.  I developed a real like--well, history because--we didn't have very many books.  I, I'm saying, I, I, I always suggests that maybe I was a practical person.  We didn't have very many books at all.  We didn't even have very many subjects.  But people told these stories about history.  My mother [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis] was a great Abraham Lincoln fan, and she'd talk about Abraham Lincoln all the time, I mean just in terms of Abraham Lincoln and slavery and so I got interested in Abraham Lincoln, would read everything I could find about Abraham Lincoln, and in the process, I read a lot of other things too, you know, slavery, and all of the things that were going on.  They didn't really teach black history at school.  I mean that was probably taboo and against the law, but they taught it at our church.  I, I mean we had something called KYB Club [Know Your Bible Club], and ah, that was just the most exciting part of the week.  They would teach us the things about the Bible, you know, you have to learn stuff about the Bible.  But we also would learn James Weldon Johnson and "God stepped out on space, and he looked all around."  And we'd learn Countee Cullen.  And we would learn poetry.  We would learn--and so it, it was just exciting because you could learn these things that you didn't hear about at school.  And, and, and so church was a great motivator and stimulator.  And, and so I'd always look forward to the KYB, which meant "Know Your Bible" part of the week.
Speaker 1: Because you actually recited poetry, secular poetry and things of that nature?
Speaker 2: Yeah, whatever the, the, the, the people would teach.  My aunt generally conducted the children's activities, who again, would have been my mother's step-sister. (laughs)  But we didn't think of it that way.  And, and she generally conducted the children's activities, plus, they'd get the children involved very early.
Speaker 1: Mmm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And the children would start developing their own activities and programs.  And my sister, actually was a great orator.  I had a sister who was a few years older than I.  And Chris was, was just super good.  I mean she was--.
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have and where do you fall in there?
Speaker 2: I'm actually, I have--my father [Hezekiah Davis] has a son who was born when he was a teenager.  And then I have three sisters who are older than I, of my mother and father's children.  And so I was the fourth in that group.  Then I've got two brothers immediately younger than I am.  And then I've got three sisters who came in the last set.  And then my, after--my father got married at an old age.  And, and I have a sister--well, she died actually.  But she was only about twenty-six, twenty-seven years old when she did die.  So my father's second wife and his daughter both died.  So I have actually ten brothers and sisters, and I was kind of in the middle, kind of in the middle.  My three sisters have actually died who are immediately older than I am.  One of them was my running buddy as we were growing up, the one that I said, Chris, who was a great orator and, I mean could captivate audiences and--.
Speaker 1: Now, the oratory seems to be a theme I think in your early life, as someone, as a child who stuttered, you were--what I've read is that you were taught to slow down.  Was it Mrs. [Beadie] King that you taught--?
Speaker 2: No, it was actually my mother who did the slowing down.  I mean I'd be trying to tell my mother something, and she'd say, "Slow down.  I don't know a word you're saying, just slow down; take it easy."  And I learned that by doing that she could hear what I had to say, and, and she could understand it.  And that's how I kind overcame the stuttering, although I still have a bit of a speech impediment.  I mean if I talk too fast, then it, it gets caught up a little bit.  And so it's still there.  But I, I think overcoming the stuttering probably had a great impact on my sense of security, and my sense of being, and sense of well being.  And I can almost remember how good I felt when I had reached a point where I could get through something without stuttering, and that I could say it clearly.  You know, it was like you wanted to hit yourself in the chest (laughs) or pat yourself on the back.  And, and so I credit my mother, actually, with that.
Story_ID: 6332
Speaker 1: In high school, you went to high in the same school?
Speaker 2: Same school, Savage High [School, Parkdale, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Had it expanded--it expanded a bit?
Speaker 2: It had expanded a bit, but there were eight people in my graduating class when we graduated from high school.  And the interesting thing about it, a few years ago I was there visiting while my father [Hezekiah Davis] still lived there.  And I said, "Daddy, I want to go out to the Savage High School and see it."  And so we got in the car and drove out.  And I got pretty excited about it, and ran up to it and ran inside.  He said, "Come out of there, boy, what's wrong with you?"  (laughs) I said, "Well--," you know, I'm thinking that maybe this is some kind of museum--you know, a little-- I'm thinking--dumbly, and he say, "You better come out of those people's house."  (laughs) Some people actually lived in what was the school--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) In Savage High School?
Speaker 2: --the main building, yeah.  People actually lived there.  He said, "I don't imagine they care about you looking around," said, "But you need to at least ask them." (laughs)  And, and, and so it wasn't very large.  I mean we were a small--there were eight of us when I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Now, who was Savage?
Speaker 2: Savage was the guy who owned the plantation and gave the land for the school to be built and probably gave part of the money, I would imagine, to build it.  But he was a landowner, Mr. Savage.  And the school was named for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so, in such a small high school, did you have like a regular type high activities?  Did you play (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have a gym, but we played basketball.  We actually played basketball on the ground.  And there were some years that we had pretty good teams.  I mean it just--.
Speaker 1: So you actually had a team that played other schools?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we played other schools.  But we didn't have a gym.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: The first protest I think I was ever involved in--and we, we didn't think of it so much as being a protest--but I remember one year, we felt like we had a good basketball team.  And we was getting ready for the regional tournament.  And a little group of us decided that if we could practice in a gym before going to the tournament, it would probably improve (laughs) our play.  So we came up with this little idea to go and see the superintendent of the schools, Mr. Ryburn (ph.), who was the principal of the white school, but was the superintendent of the black school.  I never quite understood that.  But that was the set-up.  And a fellow named Isaac Brown was our leader.  I mean Isaac was pretty gregarious and fearless, and we got together and went to see Mr. Ryburn.  And I remember Isaac saying, "Mr. Ryburn," says, "We, we want to talk to you."  He said, "Yeah, okay, boys, what can I do for you boys?"  And he told him, said, "Well, you know, we think we got a pretty good basketball team, and we believe if we could practice in a gym before going to the tournament that it would improve our play, and we may even win it.  And we wanted to know if we could practice in the white people's gym." (laughs)  He said, "Well, when do you all want to practice?"  And I don't know.  We hadn't come up with no date.  But whatever day Isaac said, he said, "Let me look."  So he looked at his sheet, and he says, "Well, you know, the white kids are having school closing that night, and I can't let you have it."  He says, "But I'll tell you what.  The people in Wilmot [Arkansas]--the colored--kids down there have a gym, and I'll call Miss LeGrand (ph.) down in Wilmot--," Miss LeGrand was the principal, "--And see if she can let you all practice in the colored kids' gym in Wilmot.  And if she say, 'Yeah,' I'll let you have the school bus.  And if you can find somebody that's got a license, you can drive down there and practice."  And sure enough, that's what he did.  He called down, and Miss LeGrand said, "Yes," and we went down there and practiced--the name of that school now is the Slacks-LeGrand High School in Wilmot, Arkansas.  But we felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment when we realized that we didn't get to practice in the Parkdale [Arkansas] white gym, but we did get to practice in a gym by going to Wilmot, and we got the use of the school bus to drive down there to do it.  And, and that was my first real lesson, I think, in protest.  And, and that is, when you advocate, you may not get exactly what you're looking for, but you often get more than what you had. (laughs)  And, and, and that was a lesson for me, well learned and has probably helped to shape much of my advocacy to this day, that, that if you don't get what you looking for, you get a little bit closer than you were.  And, and so I thank you Isaac Brown, wherever you are.
Story_ID: 6333
Speaker 1: Were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a matter of fact, there was just no reason not to be.  I generally made As and Bs.  I can remember in grammar school, high school, stuff like that, if I got less than a A, there were times I'd want to tear the paper up. (laughs)  I'd be ashamed to take it home. (laughs)  I, I'm saying, I wouldn't even want to take it home if it wasn't an A.  I mean, it just wasn't much reason not to have an A.  I mean, plus, I indicated I, I had--I had learned to read and to like reading.  And so I just read every spare minute that I had when I was a kid.  I mean I just--we had a little, we finally got a little library.  And I read almost every book in the library that we had.  It wasn't a big library.  I'd have to--I'd take, when we first got our little library, I'd take a arm full of books home (laughs), every day.  Most of them were autobiographies and things like that.  Ah, I'd, I'd just devour these things.  I mean Helen Keller, Augustus A. Showdo (ph.), you know, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Booker [T.] Washington, oh, I--I mean I'd read them walking, you know, walking home from the bus, school bus.  We eventually got a school bus, and, and, you know, I'd be walking trying to read walking home after we got off the bus.  I'd go to the basketball games and try to sit on the back seat of the bus and read when the car get behind--the cars would get behind the bus, I'd be trying to read then. (chuckle)  And so, yeah, I, I was, I was a good high school student.  Matter of fact, I was the salutatorian of our group.  Lillian Dunnan (ph.) was the valedictorian of our high school class.  And matter of fact, I got Lillian's scholarship to go to college, which was a fifty dollar a semester scholarship, provided that you keep a B average.  I mean the State of Arkansas gave each school a fifty dollar scholarship.
Speaker 1: Now, was it a tough decision to go to the University of Arkansas, Pine--I mean you didn't have a lot of choices.
Speaker 2: It wasn't any decision at all.  It, it was--I'm saying it was the only place that I could go.  I had thought about maybe going to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] because I lived so close to Louisiana.  I'd heard about Grambling, and, you know, and about this famous athletic program.  But I wasn't no athlete anyway, and so it wasn't no point in wanting to go there.  But I went to Arkansas AM&N College [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, later University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff], and I was fortunate that I had an uncle and aunt who lived in Pine Bluff [Arkansas].  And so I didn't have any money.  Matter of fact, when I went to college, I had twenty dollars.
Story_ID: 6334
Speaker 1: There's a story about your father [Hezekiah Davis] and what he supposed owed somebody in a store or what they owed him--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean in terms of my--.
Speaker 1: That's (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, that's story is--my father actually got locked up in the store one night.
Speaker 1: How did that happen? What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you get--oftentimes, if you were sharecroppers, you'd work the whole year.  And at the end of the year, you'd be in debt.  I mean you'd come out--and this was real stuff.  This isn't something that was just in the history books about.  So my father  [Hezekiah 'H.D.' Davis], I think we had made twenty-four bales of cotton that year, I believe.  My father went down to settle up [their account at the local general store].  And he tells the story that after they had settled up, the man who owned the plantation and the store, Mr. Edwin Gregory, was the one doing the settling.  He was gonna eventually take over for his father, he'd got out of college and was an accountant and everything.  And so at the end of the session he said to my father, he says, "'Dee', " say, yeah, "You've made four hundred dollars."  Said, "Man, what are you gonna do with all that money?"  And my father says, he told him, says, "Mr. Edwards," says, "I know you went to school for figuring and everything," and, (laughs) rather than saying I know you're an accountant.  He say, he says, "But I can figure a little bit, and Mazzie [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis], my wife, figures better than I do.  And the way we figure it, we got more than four hundred dollars."  So he says, "Well," he sat there a little bit, and finally Mr. Edwards says, "Dee--," says, "Boy, I'll tell you what, Miss Annette is waiting supper, and so I got to go home."  And my father says, he told him, said, "Well, you know, Mazzie waiting supper too," said, "But I can't go home, not with four hundred dollars."  Basically, this fellow reached in the safe and pulled his pistol out and laid it on the counter and says, "Dee I got to go home, I just really got to go."  And he, he wasn't afraid of my father, my father was always a sensible, rational man.  And so he said, he told him, "Well, you go ahead--," says, "I, I think I'm just gonna stay here until I get the rest of my money."  And so he locked the store, and went on home.  My father's horse came home late that night.  And, of course, we were afraid that maybe he had gotten robbed or something.  The next morning, my mother sent us to go look for him.  And we met him coming down the road.  And he told us what had happened, that after he had spent the night in the store, that morning, the real owner, the elderly gentleman came down, Mr. Gregory, said to him, said, "Dee," said, "My son tells me you had four hundred dollars coming," said, "Don't you want to buy my breakfast this morning?" (laughs)  He says, he told him, says, "Mr. Gregory--," say, "You know, when--I don't want to argue with your son about his figuring 'cause I know he's a good figurer" (chuckle) "--'cause he went to school for that."  Said, "But the way me and Mazzie figured, whenever we buy something at the store, we write it down.  We know how much cotton sells for.  We know how to add, subtract, multiple and divide, and the way we figure it, we just got more than four hundred dollars coming."  And he says, Mr. Gregory said, "Well, I'll tell you what, come on in the store."  Well, they refigured, and my father actually had sixteen hundred dollars in his pocket when he got home.  And I never shall forget after he recounted and told the story, how happy everybody in our house was.  He and my mother, and all of us threw the money up in the bed and we wallowed and played in the money (laughs) and just had a good time, I mean sixteen hundred dollars at one time, where people generally would remain in debt.  And that's how people were enslaved to the land, even after slavery was over.  I, I'm saying people who were sharecroppers were almost in slavery, and they couldn't get away.  They couldn't--and people would tell them, "If you owe somebody, you can't leave."  I mean many people who would leave the South, they would slip away in the middle of night because they owed someone who owned a land--the plantation.  And they, they--and so we felt very good about that, and just knew that we were gonna have a great time, spend a lot of money.  And lo and behold, my daddy decided to go and pay down on him a little forty-acre piece of land. (laughs)  And he was told, I mean the neighbors and everybody said he was going to have to move because he had defied the, the plantation owner.  So my father went and asked him, says, "Mr. Gregory, can I see you?"  He said, "Yeah."  He says, "Well, you know, people are telling me that I'ma have to move and all of that, and if so, I'd just like to know it so that I can try to find a place for my wife and children to live.  It's, you know, winter is gonna be bad," and Mr. Gregory, of course, told him, said, "Dee, you don't ever have to leave here as long as I've got a plantation, you've got a place, long as I got a place."  And, and that's why were kind of amazed when my father went and bought this little piece of land or paid down on it.  And we asked him again, said, "Well, why did you do that?  I mean, Mr. Gregory already said you didn't have to move, that you could stay here long as you wanted to."  He said, "Once again, boys, prepare for war in the time of peace."  He said, "Everything is all right, right now, but there may come a time when it's not all right, and we'll have to have some place to go.  And if we do, at least we'll have our own little piece of land."  And he still is very proud of that little piece of land.  Actually, I, I kind of hate that we've been trying to say, "Daddy, why don't you sell your little old piece of land and get it rid of it," and so and so and so.  He will not do it because he wants to leave it for us.  I mean he, and I said, "Well, Daddy, you know, give me a break.  There are so many of us that by the time we divide it up, we're not gonna have very much of any--," He said, "That's all right.  You'll have that."  He said, "I want to leave it 'cause I want to leave something."  And, and I mean that just fits right in with our, with ownership, wealth program that we've been promoting, trying to get people to purchase homes so that a part of the rationale is that when they leave, when they die, they've got something that they can pass on to their children.  And, and, and I mean that was a part of growing up, I think.  At the time, when my father and his generation and people like him, they wanted to have something to leave.  And that's still very important to him, even though he knows that the chances are neither one of us will ever go back and live in Dermott, Arkansas.

Speaker 1: Let's take you back to the University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff.  Now, you're, it was called university--.
Speaker 2: Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Arkansas AM&N [College, later the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff].
Speaker 2: AM&N College.
Speaker 1: College, okay.
Speaker 2: [Arkansas] Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College.
Speaker 1: And 'Normal' meant, what is that?
Speaker 2: Teaching, one of the land grant colleges and universities that was established under the [Justin Smith] Morrill [Land-Grant College] Act that set up schools like that, first in about 1862 or so, I think.  And then later on, in the--1890-something.  Matter of fact, seven of the members of my family have gone there.  I mean it's been a lifesaver for us.  One of my older sisters went.  I went.  My two brothers went.  All three of my younger sisters went, and I've got a niece there now.  I had two nephews who graduated from there, Chester and Rickey.  Mickey went, he didn't graduate because he went in the [U.S.] Navy.  And I've got two or three first cousins who went.  And so, it's, it's been our lifeline in terms of, of opportunity for education, for further learning and for working to try and improve the quality of, of our lives and the quality of our being.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is 1957, and you're sixteen years old when you start college, right?
Speaker 2: My birthday.  I went to college on my birthday.  I mean I got myself a pack of cigarettes after I got away from my mama [Mazzie Lee Glass Davis], and stuck them in my shirt pocket, declared myself grown, (laughs) and I was gone .  I was gone to see what the future held.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was the college like?  Who were some of the personalities that you remember, students or teachers?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just so exciting.  I mean, we had, of course, one of the greatest educators probably that's ever--a fellow we all called 'Prexie', President Lawrence Arnett Davis [Sr.], whose son is currently the, the chancellor at the university, Lawrence, Jr.  But, but President Davis established an era--as a matter of fact, he and Judge Glen Jones were best of friends, and, and actually married into the same families and all.  And we had people who were just legendary.  We had a fellow there, Dr. [G.D.] Kyle, who was a physicist, and legend was that he didn't start school until he was fourteen years old, (laughs) and that he had come out of the back woods of somewhere and, and went to school, and graduated in a few years and went to college and dah, dah, dah, and became a great physicist.
Speaker 1: And wasn't there a Dr. [Samuel P.] Massie?
Speaker 2: Dr. Massie, same thing, I mean same thing in terms of great chemist.  Dr. Massie was a chemist, and, and Dr. Kyle was a physicist. The guy who is my real mentor--and, and there were two of them who influenced me a great deal--one was a fellow named Adolph Reed, who just died last year.  His son is Dr. Adolph Reed who's now a political science teacher, and his grandson [Toure F. Reed] is also a political science teacher down at Normal.  But my guy was a fellow named Ray Russell, who was the chairman of the history department.  And Ray Russell I always felt was probably one of the best professors who ever walked into a classroom.  I mean this guy could make history so exciting until you, you'd--I mean he'd be all on top of the desk with his pointers, fighting the Russian Revolution, (laughs) the wars and teaching us about technological superiority and, and, and I used to help him grade his papers sometimes.  And I remember, I thought I'd be very liberal to some friends of mine who were athletes, and, you know, just be kind of liberal.  And so he called me into his office, and he says, "Friend Davis?"  I said, "Yes, sir, Mr. Russell?"  He says, "I just reread those papers that you graded, and I, I believe you were trying to be fair to some of your classmates who are athletes."  He says, "But let me tell you," he says, "When I was at Kentucky State [University, Frankfort, Kentucky], there was one year, I scored five touchdowns in one game.  And that same year, I made five A's." (laughs)  I said, "Say no more, Mr. Russell, I, I understand.  I, I, I apologize."  I said, (laughs) "You don't have to say anything else."  But, yeah, I, I mean we--there were great teachers and individuals who were just seriously committed and, and wanted to make sure you learned.
Story_ID: 6336
Speaker 1: I majored in history and minored in education [at Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, later University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff].  I wanted to be a history teacher.  And I was gonna be a history teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did you get involved in campus life activities there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did, we did all of the, the regular things because we--I mean it was, if you remember '57 [1957] was the year that, that, that, that, the, the integration of Central High School in Little Rock [Arkansas] took place.  And, and so we were close to Little Rock, you know, only about fifty miles away, and here I am, a college freshman.  And so all of this is heady stuff for me.  As a matter of fact, I was down at SIU [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois] with Minnie Jean Brown not very long ago.
Speaker 2: She was one of the--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was one of the persons who, who helped integrate--.
Speaker 2: The Little Rock Nine?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Central High School.  And, and so we were very close to that.  Plus, there were campus protests.  I mean we were a part of probably not as vigorous as some of the things that went on in places like North and South Carolina or even in Louisiana, but we had our own marches and demonstrations and protests.  They had brought Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] to the campus to speak just before I got there.  So there was still some concern expressed by the General Assembly, legislature in Arkansas about King having been on campus.  And so we had our protests.  We were part of the action.  We--the president and the dean would be, you know, talking to us about, you know, they've got to get money from the [Arkansas] General Assembly, from the legislature, they--and, and that, you know, that we needed to conduct ourselves a certain way, and all of that kind of activity.  So yeah, we were, we were a part of, part of the [Civil Rights] Movement.
Story_ID: 6337
Speaker 1: The governor, Orval Faubus was a national villain to black folks, you know, in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Governor Faubus (ph.) decided that, you know, these kids couldn't go to school.  And some people think that Farvous (ph.) decided to, that he needed an issue to get reelected on.  And, because actually there had not been that kind of heavy strife and turmoil.  I mean there'd been a race riot in Arkansas some years before at a place called Elaine, in that area.  And there were always skirmishes and that kind of thing, but where we lived, other than the separated--I mean there was the separation, but there was not a lot of racial strife where I lived as a kid.  I mean there was racial separation, but not a great of racial strife.  Every once and a while something would, would go down.  For example, we had people who would not allow themselves to be abused and misused.  One of the main fellows that I found was Mr. Charlie Lewis, matter of fact, they had dirt roads.  And there was sort of a tradition in many instances were the black person was going down the road in front of a white person, that you would pull over and let the white person by.  And, and it just kind of would happen.  And, of course, Mr. Charlie would always make sure that he never did that.  I'm saying (laughs), and I'm, I'm say, and there were whites who would try to pass Mr. Charlie, you know, in terms of--if somebody's got to be dusty, let it be you, rather than me.  And Mr. Charlie would make absolutely certain, whether he was driving his car or whether he was driving his wagon that nobody was going to pass him on one of those dirt roads.  And so that kind of--his son and I were best of friends, matter of fact, we were in the same class, T.C. and J.B. and we were all buddies and that kind of thing.  But, but we were all proud of Mr. Charlie.  Mr. Charlie did not play.  And, and, and, but, but other kind of relationships, I mean where I lived some of our real friends and people that we interacted with and associated with were white, as a matter of fact, who were also sharecroppers and lived on the same plantation.  I never will forget a young fellow named John David Grice (ph.) who spent a lot of time at our house.  John David would come to our house, and my mother would be cooking, and she'd ask John David, said, "David, have you eaten?"  And he said, yeah, as a matter of fact I have.  She said, well, what did you have, David?  He says, well, I had steak and rice, gravy, candied sweet potatoes, cornbread--I mean you couldn't do much better than that.  I mean that (laughs), that was kind of like--and my mother said, David, you sure you've eaten?  He said, oh, yes, ma'am, says, I'm fine.  She said, get you a plate and let me give you some of these beans we got.  David would say, well, I'm really not hungry, but if you insist (laughs).  That was kind of a game that we played.  I mean David would not have had anything to eat probably at all.  I'm, I'm, I'm say--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was--.
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm say it was, it was kind of a--his parents were a young, young couple.  And, of course, yeah, but David had pride.  I'm saying everybody had pride.  And so the proudful thing to do and say was that you had your fill and you had the best that there was to have.  And, and, and so every once in a while, there may have been a bit of stuff, but actually--and we'd hear stories of, of lynchings and fights that had taken place years before and that kind of thing, but not when I was a kid coming up, other than every once in a while.  I mean there were people--I mean I had a cousin who used to work for the sheriff.  And the sheriff was the main bootlegger in the county.  And I had a cousin who was known as a pretty tough guy.  And he and the sheriff were bootlegging buddies.  And I remember the sheriff admonishing him one night, (unclear) he wanted to talk to him.  And my cousin says, I'll be there in a minute cause I'm talking to Aunt Mazzie.  He was talking about my mother.  And so he sweared, and my cousin said, you know, Mr. Robert, we don't cuss in front of Aunt Mazzie.  And the fellow said, nigger, you know who you talking to?  And, of course, my cousin hit him and knocked him down.  And that night my father took him home with us, and the next day, we took him to get out of town, catch the bus.  And my cousin caught the bus, and the bus driver asked him, said, where do you want to go, boy?  He says--he had met somebody from Cleveland.  And Bill thought he was going to Cleveland, Ohio, but when they got to Cleveland, Mississippi, the man said, boy, you say you want to go to Cleveland?  He said, yeah.  He said, well you in Cleveland.  And so Bill got out and ended up living in Cleveland, Mississippi all of his life.  We used to wonder how (laughs) could a cat be leaving Arkansas running from the sheriff and stop (laughs) in Cleveland, Mississippi.  Finally, he told us.  He says, I realized later on that this wasn't the Cleveland that I really thought I was going to.  He said, but since I got there, and I was there, I just decided to stay.  And Bill stayed in Cleveland, Mississippi the rest of his life, and that's where he died.  And, and so there things that went on, but by and large, the interactions were not, not strife.
Story_ID: 6338
Speaker 1: The University of Arkansas, AM&N [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, later University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff], are there any, any stories from, from your college days you want to tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we just were pretty normal, always wanting to have a football team, but always getting beat up on by people like Southern [University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi] and Prairie View [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Prairie View, Texas].  I remember we televised a football game.  We went out and washed cars and did everything under the sun to get money to do this.  And I think it was--Prairie View beat us twenty-four to nothing.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was televised (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was the first time that--and we had to raise a good portion of the money, you know, I mean to do it.  And we had done that, but by and large, a good time.  I mean people had a lot of hope.  I mean I remember one brother in my class, I mean the standard joke was that he didn't own a suit, and he'd have to borrow a suit or a sport jacket on Sundays to go to Vespers.  And he did.  I mean he, he actually did that.  Some of us would go out and make money.  We'd actually cut class and go out and pick cotton, like Tuesdays and Thursdays, were often days when you may have only had two classes or you'd take two-hour classes.  And there were things that you could probably get by with if you studied hard.  We just ditched sometime and go pick cotton so we'd have money.  We'd go out and pick cotton on a Saturday morning before a football game, and, of course, some kids worked on the farm.  Actually, they majored in agriculture or something like that.  Then they actually, their work-study was working on the college farm.  And that was kind of a prestigious thing to do.  You know, we didn't, people didn't have a lot, but, you know, when I look around and see--and sometimes we kid about the number of principals in the Chicago [Illinois] Public School system who came out of (chuckle) UAPB [University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff] or the number of people who are physicians and dentists.  And I mean I could name some of the townspeople, you know, who are physicians and doctors and dentists and attorneys and, and, they made their way.  I, I mean, and, and, and they were taught to, not only make their own way, but to try and help others to make a way.  I mean the State of Arkansas, just before that period, you couldn't get in the Arkansas graduate school.  I mean Cecil Partee, for example, ended up going to Northwestern University Law School [Chicago, Illinois] because the State of Arkansas, the University of Arkansas Law School wouldn't admit him, but they had a policy that if you got admitted to a professional school, they'd pay for it, even though they were not admitting, at the time Cecil came through, African Americans to those schools.  And, and so people struggled.  They worked.  They had a sense of hope.  They had a sense of responsibility.  They were taught to give back, and, you know, I'm very proud of, of having grown up in a sense where I did, the way that I did because there were many things that, that continue to serve me well, that, that I learned.  And I think my experience is very similar to that of just thousands of others who, who were part of the last big wave of migration.  I mean we pretty much knew that once school was over, many of us were going to migrate.  This was right during the time when the cotton picker (laughs) had just been perfected in, in Mississippi, actually, in Clarksdale, Mississippi on a big plantation out there.  That's where the cotton picker got effective, which means that you really didn't need the kind of, of intense field hands and labor that you had needed before that.  And, and so fortunately, people could migrate.  Now, as technology continues to improve and increase, there are large numbers of African American men, for example, who are not equipped, not trained for the kind of work that exists in our country.  And that's one of the reasons that there's so much unemployment.  I mean black men in America traditionally worked in, in, in production and manufacturing, I mean farm production before the industrial revolution, assembly line production after the industrial revolution.  Now, we are increasingly becoming more of a highly technical, service-oriented society.  And, unfortunately, many African American males are not taught and are not being taught to connect with those opportunities.  And, and that's something we've got to find a way to change.
Story_ID: 6339
Speaker 1: Back in school, now, when you were on the verge of graduation [from Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College, later University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff], did you still have it in your mind that you wanted to teach history if you could find a place to teach history?
Speaker 2: Yep, absolutely.  I mean, I, I wanted to teach, came to Chicago [Illinois], didn't teach the first year because I ended up getting a job working at the post office, and I actually was making more money working as a postal clerk than I would make teaching.
Speaker 1: Your sister was here, right?  That's why you came--(unclear) (simultaneously)--you had a sister here.
Speaker 2: Right, I had two older sisters who lived here.  And so I knew I had a place to stay.  And I, I came and lived with them.  They both lived in the same apartment building.  I mean they both, and their families.  And so--.
Speaker 1: Did you ever consider staying in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: I thought about it, but I just simply decided that--I mean I had a job offer to teach that paid twenty-seven hundred dollars a year ($2,700) and three hundred dollars ($300) to coach junior high basketball, which means that I would have been earning three thousand dollars a year ($3,000).  And I just decided that rather than do that, I'd take my chances in the big city.  Plus, Count [William] Basie and Joe Williams were ambassadors.  And they were singing "Going to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you."  And Chicago just sounded so glamorous and great and all of that, 63rd Street.  You know, (sings) "Going to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you"  And so I decided to come to Chicago.  But really, I came because my, my sisters were here, and I knew that, that I could survive until I could get on my own feet.  And, and, and if, had not it been for that, I maybe, perhaps would not because I had a brother who was finishing high school about the same time.  And he came.  Of course, he was going to college that, that September, and we'd go places looking for jobs.  And, you know, people would tell me that I had too much education, and they'd tell him, you know, he didn't have enough.  And we'd compare all of that.  But, but I got a job.  I was disappointed because I just knew that I was going to get a job immediately.  And my brother-in-law had a reputation of helping people find a job.  He worked at a steel foundry, and he took me.  I didn't have much money, I had--to get here, I had to borrow fifty dollars ($50.00) from my father [Hezekiah Davis] who borrowed fifty dollars (laughs) from another fellow.  I mean this is in the part of the year when there's no money.  You know, I mean I came to Chicago in July because I decided that I'd help my father get his crop finished before leaving.  And so money was kind of hard to come by.  And so I just knew I was gonna get a job that next day after I got here.  And my brother-in-law took me to this foundry, and the guy says, "No, we're not gonna hire you because you've got a college degree.  And you're not gonna stay with us.  And so by the time we train you--," and I wanted to tell the cat, "Nah, don't worry about that, that, that ain't no big deal.  I want a job, man.  I want to work.  Give me a break, give me a play."  And, and, and so my money was running out.  And so I took the first thing I could connect with and, and did that.  But then I got a job, I mean I worked at the post office for about a year.  But I decided even though I was making more money, more money than I was gonna get teaching school, that I would go ahead and teach school.  So I took a job teaching in an EVG [education and vocational guidance] Center in the heart of the North Lawndale community.
Story_ID: 6340
Speaker 1: At the time, where did you live, (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: I lived in, on the West Side [of Chicago, Illinois], and, and I deliberately decided actually, especially since--I mean this was the era of the culturally deprived child and the disadvantaged child, and the disadvantaged community.  And that sounded exciting to me, so I took a job teaching at an EVG center--at the Magellan Education Vocational Guidance Center, which was a special school for over-age, underachievers.  And I started working on my master's degree, you know, in history, to be this history teacher.  But then the more I taught these kids, these young people, I decided that I really needed to learn more about my subjects than subject matter.  I'm, I'm saying that I needed to learn about the young people that I was trying to teach.  And so I junked my history career and enrolled in a psychology program, decided that I'd learn human behavior.  And, I mean that just kind of grabbed me, and it became very exciting to, to learn what's causing young people to have such a hard time in urban inner city America.  And, and I did that actually for six years until I came into contact with an opportunity to head up a community organization as a result of teaching GED [General Educational Development high school equivalency test].  I taught a woman how to read.
Speaker 1: And you were at Chicago Teachers College or--?
Speaker 2: At the same time, working on graduate degrees and--.
Speaker 1: Which is now Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right, and I met this woman named Rose Marie Love who was the assistant director of the Lawndale Urban Progress Center.  And I taught her godmother who was about seventy-six years old how to read.  And she said to me, says, you know, "You got to meet my goddaughter," said, "because both of you are always trying to help people and talk about helping."  I met Rose.  Rose turned out to be chairman also of the personnel committee for the Greater Lawndale Conservation Commission.  And they were looking for an executive director.  And Rose convinced me to leave my good job with the Chicago Public School system where I was a certified teacher and head of the counseling program at my (chuckle) school.  And so I took a leave of absence.  Julien Drayton was the assoc-associate superintendent at the time.  And Dr. Drayton gave me a leave of absence or approved my leave of absence to come work with this community organization.  And I went to work and never, never got back to the Board of Ed[ucation], and, and continued to work there.  Then I went to work in health care because a new community health center [the Martin Luther King, Jr. Health Center] was being organized in the community.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of community organization was it?  Did you all do organizing in the neighborhood or--?
Speaker 2: Block club organizing, conservation efforts, really community advocacy is, is what--.
Speaker 1: Now,--.
Speaker 2: --what we really did.  There, there was a great deal of consternation, I mean again, the riots and disturbances and aftermaths and large numbers of people in poverty and how to help this mass of people migrating from the South, adjust to urban living; how to fight the efforts that were going on in a changing neighborhood, where people, one group was moving out but also wanted to maintain control of, of what was taking place and what was going on; community organizing to help people get rid of predatory lending.  I mean the contract buyers' league was being formed.  People would buy a house and after twenty years, owe more on it than, than they did when they first bought it because they were being stuck up by predatory lending.  Part of the area, we had real estate speculation, panic peddling, blockbusting, all, all of this stuff was going on.  So it was just a great place to be and great work to do.  We had street gangs and street gang activities.  We had to try to work with that and try and help it subside, and help it not proliferate.  And, and so I just got, oh, my God, totally immersed in this.  And, and got involved with all kinds of activities and groups and, to the point where I didn't know what I worked for in terms of who paid me.  I, I mean most people didn't.  I, I mean many people didn't know what my actual job was, I mean especially after I, I took a job [in 1969] as director of training at the Martin Luther King Health Center, did that for a while and got into some conflict with the board and left them [in 1971], and ended up taking a job and working [1971-1979] as the executive director of the Westside Health Planning Organization, which was a comprehensive health planning agency.  And, and I really got turned on learning about the health disparities and health care, and ended up taking a, a graduate degree with the focus on, on health care organization and getting involved with the hospitals and the universities and the school of public health.
Speaker 1: And you were going to school too at the time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and I did that and, until I ran for public office.  I mean I got involved nationally with healthcare issues, joined the American Public Health Association, got involved with that, involved with the National Association of Community Health Centers, became president of it, became somewhat of a community health activist.  Some people said that we may have been, well, maybe experts or whatever it is that you'd be.  And [President] Jimmy Carter appointed me to a national group to study the public health service hospitals in the country.  And make a--.
Speaker 1: This was 1976.
Speaker 2: --make a recommendation about what should be done with them.  And so health just sort of became--but, but, but it was health in terms of a health policy, health organization, health development.  And that's what I really did until I decided to run for public office.  A matter of fact, we organized groups,  Ernie [Ernest] Jenkins and I, and Gloria Jenkins, and Warner Saunders--.
Speaker 1: There at WACA, right, Westside--?
Speaker 2: WACA, Westside Association for Community Action, Ma [Ida Mae] Fletcher and Earlean Lindsey, and Ma [Mary Alice] Henry and, I mean grass roots kind of things.  And I decided that, that where I lived we wanted to change the alderman.  And so I became chairman of a search committee to find the person that we would run for alderman [in 1979]  We couldn't find anybody (laughs).  And the committee disbanded and wolf tickets were being sold.  And I decided that maybe I'd run myself.  And I did run, and, and people responded.  I was fortunate enough to get into a run-off, and then I got elected.  And I've been running ever since (laughs), for something.

Speaker 1: Now, you were elected to [Chicago] City Council in '78?
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979], actually, or--it was '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Same time Jane Byrne was elected mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then became part of a little group of, of what we called independents or mavericks.  There were five or six of us.  The votes would often be forty-five to five or--.
Speaker 1: Who would they have been like, a Martin Oberman?
Speaker 2: That's right.  David Orr.
Speaker 1: David Orr.
Speaker 2: Marty Oberman, Larry [Lawrence] Bloom, Marion Volini, Cliff Kelley sometimes, sometimes Allan Streeter, after Streeter came.
Speaker 1: Was Schiller in?
Speaker 2: No, Helen was not there at that time.
Speaker 1: Streeter, it was his candidacy that kind of--in 1980--the special election in '81 [1981] or '82 [1982]--.
Speaker 2: Right, they--.
Speaker 1: --it kind of cracked the veneer of the Jane Byrne hold on--.
Speaker 2: It, it certainly was a part of that.  Streeter was appointed by Jane Byrne and then broke with Jane Byrne--.
Speaker 1: And it was community pressure, right, that sort of--?
Speaker 2: Lu [Lutrelle] Palmer, CBUC [Chicago Black United Communities], I mean all of us were engaged and involved and, and Allan came with the, the broad community coalition.  And it really was around the appointment of members to the [Chicago] Board of Education.  Michael Scott as a matter of fact--Jane Byrne had a blue ribbon commission that, that the Urban League spearheaded in a sense, and had put Michael Scott and Leon Davis on the school board.  She was not reappointing them.
Story_ID: 6342
Speaker 1: We're at '79 [1979], and, well, [Chicago, Illinois Mayor] Jane Byrne's in office, and we were just the, Allan Streeter, right Allan Streeter's campaign?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, actually, there, there were a group of us who had kind coalesced even before the--and actually when Mayor [Richard J.] Daley died, there were a group of us who, who kind of coalesced, and Harold [Washington] ran for mayor, himself, then.
Speaker 1: In '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: In '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And I mean a bunch of us, Gus Savage, Niles Sherman, Leonard Farrakhan [Muhammad], I mean just--Bob [Robert] Lucas, kind of like the same group that ended up kind of being part of the core when Harold Washington ultimately ran against Jane Byrne, but, but, but we, we--Jane Byrne decided that she was not going to reappoint Michael Scott and Leon Davis to the school board.  And, and, of course, Allan Streeter had to make a choice, take a position in terms of the new school board nominees.
Speaker 1: Now, I think there was a call in the, I know, in the ['Chicago] Metro News' on Nate [Nathaniel] Clay, and Lu [Lutrelle Fleming] Palmer [Jr.] on his ['Lu's] Notebook' [radio program], you know, they denounced Jane Byrne's dismissal of the only African American mem- members of the school board in favor of two white--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Janis and Bono.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Rosemary Janus (ph.)--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were known as the Bogan Broads.
Speaker 2: And Mary Bono (ph.).
Speaker 1: Who stood up and, and defied desegregation.
Speaker 2: Well, I think Bono was from Bogan and Janus was the Northwest side, yeah, I think from, from, you know, 'cause I'm getting old, yes.
Speaker 1: One was one of the "Bogan Broads" [anti-bussing activists] and then the other one was--had a similar pedigree.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hum, from the Northwest--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --pedigree.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) side.  And, and, of course, Allan Streeter became part of that controversy and, and--but those were the six or seven of us [Aldermen] who often would, would defy Jane Byrne, and the [Chicago City Council] votes would be, you know, sometimes forty-eight to two.
Story_ID: 6343
Speaker 1: I think we kind of slipped over your [1979] election.  We may need to go back and revisit that now.  Twenty-ninth ward--.
Speaker 2: Leroy Cross was the in-, incumbent.  Leroy had gotten elected when Biggs--well, appointed initially when Alderman Biggs died.  And then he'd gotten elected.  We had a classic, knock down, drag out, in terms of--I ended up being the first, what we called "independent" to win an aldermanic election on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I, I'm saying, we had elected an independent, Jesse Madison, for the state legislature.  We had elected Earlean Collins to the [Illinois state] senate in a district, you know, that was overwhelming black.  But Earlean ran against a person who was not black because the party, the party machinery had refused to slate an African American for that position even though the area was overwhelmingly black.  And Earlean won by, I think about fifty-nine, fifty-seven votes or something like that.  But we had not been able to win an aldermanic seat for what we called an "independent."  And, and so I was able to win in the twenty-ninth ward.  That kind of broke the notion--.
Speaker 1: Now, for those who don't understand Chicago politics, in Chicago there aren't hardly any Republicans in office.  So they're all Democrats, but the--traditionally, they were controlled by a boss--.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, the--.
Speaker 1: The old Mayor Daley was in the boss mold, and the, Jane Byrne was trying to continue in that tradition on some level, but wasn't having as much success.  And some people were--.
Speaker 2: Well, in, in, in the traditional Chicago politics, we say that the, the West side was neo-colonized.  I'm, I'm saying--.
Speaker 1: Neo-colonialism.
Speaker 2: Well, see, here, here, here's what the, the colonization piece and, and is that, as the West side areas, it be--the West side was the last port of entry for African Americans migrating from the South in large numbers.  And so even after the areas would become predominantly black, the ward bosses remained white, even if they had a black "overseer."  I'm, I'm saying, in the twenty-fourth ward, where we're actually located, Erwin [R.] Horwitz was the overseer for a good period of time.  Twenty-eighth ward, [Joseph] Jambrone, even though they may have eventually got a black alderman who was Jimmy Washington first, and then Bill [William] Carothers after that because Jimmy died.  And, and, but the overlords--.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) it would be the ward committee?  Would that be the ward committeeman?.  It would be still be--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ed [Edward A.] Quigley was the overlord in the twenty-seventh ward, even though Eugene Ray, an African American became the alderman.  In the twenty-ninth ward, Bernie [Bernard] Neistein, [Illinois state] Senator Neistein, who just died recently, but actually lived on Lake Shore Drive was the overlord.  And so you had ward bosses who were in charge.  And, and the black aldermen were aldermen, but they weren't the bosses.  And, and they wanted to be the bosses.  And, and, and African Americans, even in civic social circles on the West Side were not the ones who had city jobs.  And, and that too was because as blacks began to get serious jobs in city government as a result of the poverty programs and the war on poverty and all, you had to be sponsored.  Well, the third ward was the main apparatus through which one went, [William L.] Dawson and then [Ralph] Metcalfe, and, and that's kind of how you got--.
Speaker 1: And that's the South side.
Story_ID: 6344
Speaker 1: So even though much of the poverty area was the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], the people who ran the poverty programs came from the South Side.  I'm, I'm say--.
Speaker 2: So these two different black communities, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, and that created somewhat of, of some friction.  I'm saying here were guys who would come over to run social service programs who were policemen from the South Side, but who were members of the third ward Democratic organization and were sponsored by, initially, [William L.] Dawson, and then after Dawson, [Ralph Metcalfe]  for their city jobs because these were the [African American] political heavyweights who had the relationship with City Hall.  And so that created, you know, some, some, some riff and some concern.  Of course, we had one fellow on, in this area, Otis Grant Collins, who was in the [Illinois] legislature who were, who was somewhat of an independent-minded gentleman, and so ultimately was David Rhodes who became the [24th Ward] alderman after George Collins came to Congress and, and all.  But Harold Washington would come over because he and Otis were good friends.  And that's how I met Harold Washington and really got to know Harold Washington.  Otis Collins was my friend and I used to help him and do some things with him.  And we'd sit in Otis's house with Harold.  And Harold would come over, and he and Otis would commiserate and talk politics and have a little Jack Daniels or a little Canadian Club or whatever (laughs) they may have been having.  And, and that was really one of the ways that I really got to know Harold Washington and, and, and, and you know, was, was through my relationship with Otis Collins.  Well, I was able to win, and got elected and, and hung with this little group of independents in the City Council, and, and that was sort of the political grounding that I had and, and pretty much stuck with that, to that, and, and still maintain that and maintain the position of a, a political independent in terms of not having been captured by the regular Democratic organization machinery, relating to interacting with but always serving, as far as I'm concerned, the people, my constituents.  And, and, and I guess that's why I get challenged from time to time and all of that, matter of fact, I'm challenged right now in terms of an opponent for the upcoming [2004] election  Isaac ['Ike' Sims] Carothers, whose grandfather was part of the political machinery, Isaac, "Ike" Sims, one of the originals.  And then, of course Bill [William] Carothers and Ike [Isaac Sims Carothers] and I guess he's--there's a lady named Anita [Rivkin-]Carothers who's going to run against me supposedly for [U.S.] Congress in the upcoming [2004] election, who is Bill Carothers's brother's wife, and I guess Ike, Isaac Carothers or Isaac "Ike" Carothers's aunt. [Note: Congressman Davis was re-elected.]
Story_ID: 6345
Speaker 1: We were talking about how you got elected, and then we--the next big event in Chicago [Illinois] politics was the election of Harold Washington in '83 [1983].  And you were alderman for the twenty-ninth ward then, and you were very active in the campaign to elect Harold Washington [as Mayor of Chicago] and was a close associate of Lu [Lutrelle Fleming] Palmer [Jr.] who did a lot of organize the grass-roots movement, that really called for a black mayor in the first place.  And at the same time, I think you were actually running for--you had run for [U.S.] Congress, I think in eighty--did you run in '83 [1983]?
Speaker 2: No, well, I actually ran after Harold had gotten elected Mayor.
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause you ran for the seventh district seat against Cardiss Collins.
Speaker 2: Cardiss Collins, right.
Speaker 1: But, well, tell us about the Harold Washington campaign, briefly and what you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, the campaign was, was, was the most exciting thing that, that one could imagine.  I happened to be sitting in Lu Palmer's basement with about seven or eight other people one Sunday afternoon, where we put the question in, in a very serious way to Harold.  Lu Palmer was there, Jorja [English Palmer] was there, Vernon Jarrett, Ed Gose, from the Afro-[American] Patrolmen's League, Renault Robinson, Bob [Robert] Starks, Ed Smith, and that may have been it.  And we kind of--.
Speaker 1: Was Conrad Worrill there?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember if Conrad was actually there.  I don't believe so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but Bob Starks was there.  And we finally put the question, I mean we, we'd been going through a lot of things about a candidate.  As a matter of fact, Lu Palmer and I had gone and got Manford Byrd [Jr.] out of the bed one night to see if Manford Byrd would run.  And Manfred said, "Well, you know, I'm flattered, but I'm an educator."  I, I mean we had talked to all kind of people about being the candidate for mayor.  And we finally put the question to Harold in a very serious way.  And said--somebody said, "Harold, you know, we really need to know if you are going to run for mayor. If you will you will run, let us know, and if you're not going to run, let us know, and then we'll go find a candidate because we are going to have a candidate." Harold--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now, this is after, there was a plebiscite held by CBUC, I think--.
Speaker 2: During the, it was during all of that time, I'm saying all of these things were, these discussions were--this was, I believe in August, I think when we were in the basement, it was eating watermelon--.
Speaker 1: I was trying to establish that there was a community plebiscite held and Harold Washington was a candidate chosen by the community, (unclear) the number one choice--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)Well, we, we, we, we would come up with this plebiscite business.  We had huge meetings and rallies at Bethel AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church that were just--and, and we had this voting business and the plebiscite and all of that.  But all of this really was, was community organizing.  I'm, I'm saying in a real sense that's what it was really was.  Harold finally said to us that Sunday afternoon, says, "Look I've got a great, great job."  He looked over at me and said, "You know, you'd love being in Congress, you'd really like that", say, "You know, I mean, you, you get a chance to discuss and debate all of these issues and to do all of that good stuff."  And we--we said, "Yeah, Harold, we, we really understand that, but the question is, will you run for mayor?"  And Harold said, "Well I'll tell you what.  Before I could even consider running for mayor, we'd have to have fifty thousand people registered to vote and at least a hundred thousand dollars that we could put in the bank, and go to the bank with." Harold was there with, oh, his sidekick, that--who was--?, that-- there was, Clarence McClain, he and Clarence were, were there.  And Harold had another meeting to go to, and so we fi--at that point, we says, "Well, tell you what.  You and Clarence can actually leave.  You can go on to your meeting."  And that's when we started talking about organizing the, the, the Task Force for Black Political Empowerment.
Story_ID: 6346
Speaker 1: We called a meeting for Roberts Motel, I think for the next week after that [meeting at which Harold Washington agreed to run if 50,000 new voters were registered and 100,000 dollars raised for the campaign] .  And that's when we--and I guess several hundred people actually showed up.  And that's when we organized the Task Force for Black Political Empowerment.  Bob Starks, chairman.  I think I was the secretary, and Lu Palmer was the treasurer.  And, and, of course, the task force started its work.  POWER [People's Organization for Welfare Economic Reform] was organized by Slim [Walter] Coleman and Nancy Jefferson.  They were--started organizing at a different and another level or organizing individuals who were sort of welfare rights and welfare recipients and people of that level.  And then, of course, Ed [Edward] Gardner got Tim [Timuel] Black and, and Nate [Nathaniel] Clay.  And they organized the voter registration piece that they were doing.  And all of this activity sort of came together.  Jesse Jackson [Sr.], Operation PUSH [People United to Save Humanity], also organizing and, and it, it kind of started to look like there was going to be a campaign, and that, that, that Harold Washington may very well make up his mind.  And I think, actually, Harold was also meeting with other people at other levels of it.  I mean I've read a lot of books and so forth, but I haven't read a book yet--.
Speaker 2: You know, I've heard--.
Speaker 1: --that, that, that had the comprehensiveness of what was actually going on because some of the people were writing and wrote from the vantage point of where they were, and, and and--but, but, but there was a level of spontaneity.  There were organizing lieutenants and people all over town doing their piece of that and--. Dorothy Tillman, Marian Stamps, [Perry] Hutchinson out in the area--.
Speaker 2: Roseland area?
Speaker 1: --where they were.  And, and--I mean a lot of the, the traditional people were not into organizing for Harold Washington for a primary election.  And many of the, the elected officials who were African American and business people and other people were not with the deal during the primary.  Many of these individuals became supporters and got on board after Harold Washington had won the primary.  The only elected officials that I recall who were elected officials and who were supporting Harold in the primary was myself, Cliff [Clifford] Kelly, Allan Streeter and, and Dick [Richard] Newhouse [Jr.].  I don't remember others.  There may have been others, but just, at this moment, those were--.
Speaker 2: I think you're right, and people like Ed Smith was running--.
Speaker 1: They were running.
Speaker 2: --and Perry Hutchinson was running, Marian Humes then was running then.
Speaker 1: Right, I mean so these were--.
Speaker 2: And (unclear) I think was running then.
Speaker 1: But Marian was elected.
Speaker 2: She was already in office?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, but, but--.
Speaker 2: She was running for re-election, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, and, and then, of course--.
Speaker 2: And you're right, she might have been involved until after the primary?
Speaker 1: Yeah, none of these, none of the individuals, I'm, I'm saying who were elected, other than the people that I just named, to my recollection during the primary. And, of course, as things began to take shape and, and unravel and there it is, then--you know, after the primary, then everybody pretty much got involved and got on board and were seriously supportive and, and, and Harold got elected, you know, with overwhelming support, especially in the African American community.  But also others as well, I mean people who were progressive leaders in other communities as well.  But, but it, it was an outpouring and, and great organizing, great support--black nationalists, individuals who sometimes were not electoral, political activists, Conrad (chuckle), Dr. Worrill, just, just, just lots of people.  And, and, of course, Harold was able to win.  And, and that changed the, the landscape and the aura.  And, of course, it was so unfortunate that Harold didn't get an opportunity to operate any longer than he did and, and did, in fact, die early.  And we didn't have the benefit of any more of that.  And it's, it's--it's no telling what Chicago might be like right now had Harold Washington not died when he did.
Story_ID: 6347
Speaker 1: I want to get to the condition--the situation around his death, but what was it like for you being a part of the [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington coalition of alderman and can you maybe give us an analysis of how, how and why people lined up with, with the Harold Washington side of the split in [Chicago, Illinois] City Council?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it--I mean it was pretty inevitable and pretty clear.  I, I was chairman of the, the zoning committee during that time.  And it wasn't necessarily what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be because there wasn't much zoning going on in the twenty-ninth ward [of which Davis was alderman].  And, and even when Harold asked me about doing that, I, I said, "Well, you know, I, I--I'm into some other things."  "Well, you know, I, I really need you to do the zoning thing if you would," says, "'cause I need somebody that I, I think will be able to handle that and won't go to jail." (laughs)  I mean I, you know, Harold had a way of, of, of putting things out in a humorous way, but also a serious way.  And the changes that, that--and the discussions and the conversations about what needed to happen and, and the sense of hopefulness and, and the expressions of, of hope and willingness to do things and knowing that there was opposition on the other side.  And I think that many people didn't have the understanding of the process that Harold had.  And, you know, it would--I mean Harold was living it up in a sense.  You know, we, we'd, y'know we'd--you might be with Harold somewhere, and people were saying, "Oh, Mr. Mayor, these people just shouldn't be doing this to you", and, and that, and, and Harold's just thriving on this.
Speaker 1: These are the council wars?
Speaker 2: Because he understood--.
Speaker 1: The opposition of these white alderman.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but still though the power of the executive, and that even if you didn't have a majority, the power of the executive was such that you had a stalemate.  And, and I'm, I'm saying, and that there's a lot of power vested in the executive, although there is also power vested in the legislature and the legislative branch.  And so we'd have these, these stand-offs and these stalemates, but Harold had so much assurance and self assurance that he knew that he was going to win.  I'm, I'm, I'm saying, and, and, and he just kind of knew that ultimately, the stalemate would be broken, and, and, and the tide would turn.  But it would be in favor of, of his position and in favor of the people's position, and that the people would, in fact, win.  And, and I think that was a level of assurance that Harold had and felt, beyond what even some of the other members of his group felt, or would certainly express.  I mean--I often felt it, I mean I just felt that, that, you know, eventually, the mayor was going to win.  And, and, and so the mayor didn't have a problem holding on and, and waiting until that time came, but working assiduously and continuously to make that happen.  And, and so, yeah, it was a very heady, heady time for Chicago.  It was exciting.  As a matter of fact, you'd hate to go to bed or you'd be eager to wake up to see what (laughs), what, what the new day was going to bring.  And, and so I don't know if there would ever be another period like that in the history of, of Chicago.
Story_ID: 6348
Speaker 1: I asked the question during the break of what did you think about the, the ideology of the [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington coalition or people in the coalition, if it was, you know, was it held together ideology or political pragmatism or--?
Speaker 2: A combination, I, I mean, there, there were those who, you know, have high hopes for the city.  But, I mean there are so many people who have thought of Chicago [Illinois] politics as being the question of who gets what, where and when.  And this vision of tomorrow and all of--they, they didn't think of that as being the business of, of the political arena, that, that, that the political arena was to have a coliseum where the gladiators came and decided (chuckle) who was going to get what portion of the largess, and, and, that, and that this is the practical stuff of politics, and, and, you know, this business of let's get rid of the homeless, let's have good schools for everybody, let's make sure that the teachers are really teaching and the kids are really learning, and that the hospitals have--serum and (chuckle) and, and antidotes and having medicine, and, yeah, that's, that's all cool--but, you know, the, the politics is something else, and, and, you know, Harold was able to imbue people with this notion of being visionary, and this notion of looking for something that you had not seen, of seeking something that maybe you hadn't even felt, but, but being able to make public decisions in such a way that you could cut into them people who had been traditionally been cut out of them, or even people who had felt that there was nothing in it for them, unless maybe a new garbage can, you know, or, or if we can patch a hole.  But can we give your children a good school so that they can grow up with the idea of living in a neighborhood where holes are not the only thing to be patched or that government has a responsibility to provide good teachers for schools, just as it may have the responsibility to provide hot tar for pavement.  I'm, 'm, I'm, I'm saying, and, and so Harold, I think was able to help convey that notion and, and raise the level of expectation that people had for their government and for what their government could do.  And, and, and you know, the legacy of a Harold Washington era, and, and that's what I think it really was.  I think that's what it really is.  And, and, you know, it's kind of like the poet saying that there are some people who see things that are and asking why, but I dream of things that have never been, and asking why not?  And, and--as a result of, of Harold's presence, Harold's being, Harold's work, Harold's influence and Harold's impact, people started asking questions about things that had never been.  And, and being audacious enough or willing to say why not?
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about power and, and the, and the black com-, community.  There was a heavy nationalistic push, you know, amongst the grassroots in terms of the election of Harold Washington.  In fact, the question was framed that it was time for a black mayor, and (unclear) we have an agenda of things that need to be fixed in the black community.  And there was a high expectation that, that, that--that finally, and since the election of a black mayor, there'd be real power in the black community.  And, of course, there was some, but there was a lot of disappointment too, you know, with what happened.  Do you, how do you assess that?
Speaker 2: Well, there was disappointment, it didn't--I'm saying, Harold's tenure was so brief.  I mean it was so short.  My last conversation with Harold Washington, I remember it as clearly as I remember the sun coming up on the day.  We talked about the progress that had been made and how we had been able to open up city government to the extent that people felt that city hall or a little piece of it belonged to them.  We talked about even the fact that middle-class African American businesspeople and others had had some doors of opportunity opened for them.  But we talked about what he was going to be able to focus on in his next administration.  And, and we talked about trying to figure out ways to significantly impact in a positive way the lives of the poor people who lived in Chicago, and, and that that was the big challenge facing us.  And that was something that he really wanted to tackle.  That was my last conversation with Harold Washington.  I mean that's what we talked about.
Story_ID: 6349
Speaker 1: Now, his death [Chicago, Illinois Mayor Harold Washington, of a massive heart attack on November 25, 1987] was a sudden shock after being reelected [in April, 1987] and the, having the balance of power at city hall tilt to his, his favor.  He had an agenda, a progressive agenda he's trying to run, and all of a sudden he drops dead.  And people are, you know, it takes the air out of the, out of the black community and the progressive community.  How did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: I, well, I, I felt like we had not prepared for Harold's death.
Speaker 1: Did you hear your father's words ["Prepare for war in time of peace."] come back, sort of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I also, I'm saying we had not prepared, and the thing that I lament was that we got carried away and couldn't settle down enough to do a serious analysis of the landscape.  And we just couldn't--you couldn't get people to take a quiet moment and to try and think through seriously what to do next, that, that, that the mumble jumble, the hustle and bustle, the aura of excitement, just kind of took over, and, and and had, I mean people would have discussions as though, you know, the only people interested in being mayor is [Tim] Evans or [Eugene] Sawyer (chuckle), and--which one are you with (laughs)?  And what about all of the other people who are not interested in either one?  You know, as though there were no other choices to do this, that, that it was gonna either be Evans or Sawyer.  Well, what about [Richard M.] Daley or what about--it was as if none of this existed, you know.  And, and that there was just simply going to be that, and that's what it was.  And you couldn't even get people to talk about, what are the other possibilities, and what if the Attorney General, I mean the [Illinois] State's Attorney [Richard M. Daley] run or whoever, or whoever.  And it was as though people just didn't deal with none of that.  You know, that's, just gonna be either Evans or Sawyer, Evans or Sawyer, I mean that's, that's gonna be it.
Speaker 1: Well, people were highly upset, the black community and other communities were--surrounded city hall on the night of the selection of Eugene Sawyer as mayor by the city council.  The, I think the black community basically felt that the choice was taken out of their hands, basically.
Speaker 2: But even so, it was a very flawed, I'm, I'm, I'm saying the strategy was so flawed, even after Eugene Sawyer became mayor and preparations started being made for reelection, and there were people saying, you know, we, we got to have a special election.  And I, I, I mean, why do we have to have a special election?  I mean so that we could get Eugene Sawyer out of being mayor? I mean that's, seemed to have been what people were saying about a special election, as though that meant some guarantee that somebody else or Tim Evans would be, if we had a special election.  If Eugene Sawyer had been able to serve out the term, maybe he would have been able to solidify himself in a position, as he demonstrated to people, that while he didn't have the fanfair and while he didn't have the--.
Speaker 1: Savoir-faire (chuckle).
Speaker 2: You know, the, the charisma that a Harold Washington had, that wouldn't necessarily keep him from making the decisions that a Harold Washington made, you know, I mean you don't have to be able to say "hocus pocus dominocus" or "sui generi"  to say, "We gonna put five miles of pavement (laughs) between Ninety-fifth Street and Seventh-first."  I, I, I'm saying, you can say that "Five miles of pavement from Seventy-first to Ninety fifth" without saying, "and we will swish in a new aura of sophisticated concrete with two layers" (laughs) in between," I mean, "five miles of pavement." (laughs). I'm, I'm saying, and, and, and so, yeah, I mean serious mistakes were made during that period, I mean serious, serious, serious mistakes that will have political consequences for still many, many years to come.  And, and you can't go back.  I mean you can look back, but you can't go back, and, and, and you can try--I mean I've, I've often asked myself, what could have been done?  I've even asked myself individually, was there anything that I could have done differently, individually.
Speaker 1: But the city council that night for, you know, when we--it was surrounded, and I remember at the end of the night, about 5:00 in the morning, you were walking back.  I mean I saw you.  I was walking next to you, you know, asking you what was coming next, cause I recognized you coming out of the city council, and you were walking kind of with your hands in your pockets and kind of, you know--what, what were you thinking at that, at--?
Speaker 2: I, I, I think I was trying to tell myself that all is not lost, and that goodbyes don't necessarily mean gone, and that no matter how dark it is tonight, there is hope for tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and I think that has to be the continuing thrust because I, I--I mean life, as well as politics is kind of like an athletic event.  And in order to win a marathon, you've got to be a long-distance runner.  And in the race, there are peaks and valleys and you got to keep going till you get to the finish line, no matter how many setbacks there may be.  And, and so I called that a setback.  What is it that we're really looking for?  Well, obviously, you're looking for equal opportunity, equal justice, equal treatment.  You, you're looking for a feeling of, yeah, all people are created equal, endowed by their creator with these inalienable rights, that if one person has a bag of crack cocaine, another person has a bag of powder cocaine, that they both get the same sentence.  One person commits an infraction in one place, another person commits the same infraction in another place.  They both get equal time.  One person go to school where they're spending five thousand dollars a year per pupil; another person go to a school a school where they're spending ten thousand dollars a year per pupil.  What's equal about that?  I, I, I mean what--? And, and so, you keep moving, you keep working, you keep hoping, you keep praying, you, you keep struggling, knowing that ultimately, yeah, you will be equal, knowing that, yeah, ultimately, there will be equal opportunity; yeah, ultimately, there will be equal justice, and, yeah, ultimately, there will be understanding.  And, and so you just keep going, keep going.

Speaker 1: Now, you basically served as alderman during, I guess what might be called the glory years of the Chicago [Illinois] black aldermen anyway from, from, at a time when they, we started challenging [Mayor] Jane Byrne through the, the tenure of Mayor Eugene Sawyer.  And then in 1990, you resigned to take a seat on Cook County [Illinois] Board [of Commissioners].  And so how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, there was still this business of trying to settle and provide direction for the African American community.  I knew that there was not a candidate willing to run for mayor at the time.  I also knew that if there was a little hope left, that we may be able to bring the community back together.  I knew that there were people asking me if I would be willing to try and do that.  And while I hadn't decided whether I would or not, I decided to position myself to be in, in a position to try and do it.  And so if I was on the county board, I could try and do that and still be an elected official to continue to struggle.  If I was in the city council I would not be in a position to do that and still be an elected official.  And so, I decided that I would take the seat on the county board in the event that a decision still had to be made to run for Mayor [of Chicago].  And we knew that we'd be running up the rough side of the mountain.  We knew that we'd be swimming upstream.  We knew that we'd be--what we didn't know was that the Persian Gulf War would really take off and remain, and that peoples would be glued to SCUD missiles and other kind of things on their television set, and, and that it would be very difficult or as difficult to get them to look at a local election for mayor. And, and that's what happened at that time.  And, and it was very difficult to break through that.  I mean although, you know, we felt that we ended up running a good campaign--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It was sort of a last--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) --creditable--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) --the last hurrah of the Harold Washington coalition, sort of?
Speaker 2: It, I, I think that's what it really ended up kind of being.
Speaker 1: And to your credit, your were seen as a candidate [for mayor of Chicago] who was articulate like [Chicago, Illinois Mayor] Harold Washington was and who was progressive and who could, you know, galvanize the black vote, certainly, and perhaps the rest, but--.
Speaker 2: And, and, you know, the [first Persian Gulf] war came, and there wasn't much that you can do about it.  We were very proud, I was very proud of that campaign and what we were able to do in that campaign, the way that, that, that we ran it, the numbers of people who participated in it across the board, African Americans, non-African Americans, whites, Hispanics, people, just, just people who were willing to look at an alternative to what existed.  I always say that the difference between politics and government is that government is what you got and what you get; politics is what you want.  And so you deal with government as it is, and you pursue your goals through politics, and, and, and that you keep trying to create through politics, the kind of world in which you want to live, or would find to be most desirable, and that if you rest on the government, it's like being satisfied with what you've got, never being able to realize, as my mother would say, what you can get.  I mean my mother used to tell us that anybody who gets carried away with what they've already done will never realize what they might be able to do.  And, and so, that was that race.  And so I ran and was able to retain my seat on the Cook County Board, and ultimately got an opportunity to--or took an opportunity to run for [U.S.] Congress when Congresswoman Cardiss Collins decided that she was going to retire.

Speaker 1: And so now I've been in Congress since '97 [1997], you know, like to feel that we've had some good moments.  I mean we've passed some meaningful legislation.  I mean meaningful legislation.
Speaker 2: Can--can you give us an example of some of the legislation you've passed (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: Well, let me just say--.
Speaker 2: --which has meant the most to your constituents?
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me just say this about legislation.  Not a lot of new bills get passed.  I mean, you know, people, legislatures generally deal with appropriations, I mean you pass appropriation bills every--that's the amount of money that it takes to run the government.  And you decide where that money is going to come from.  I mean those are the kind of main things that you do.  Every once in a while, you get something passed that is new, that is different.  I was very pleased when, when I was able to amend the Transportation Bill in the hundred and fifth Congress to increase the authorization for the Access to Jobs program from around two hundred million dollars to about seven hundred and fifty million dollars over a five-year period.  Now, of course, there are a lot of people who don't know what the Access to Jobs program is or why that's meaningful.  Well, the reality is that seventy-five percent of all new jobs in this country are created in suburban communities, which means that new jobs are not being created that much in central city areas.  The biggest unemployment is where there are no new jobs.  And if there are new jobs in suburban communities and people can't get to those jobs, they don't do the person on Sixty-third Street a great deal of good.  The Access to Jobs programs funded public transportation so that people could get to where the jobs were at that time.  And, and, and, and that's why, to me, that was a very meaningful piece of legislation.  The American Community Renewal Act  and New Market Initiatives that J. C. [Julius Caesar] Watts [Jr.] and I and Jim [James Matthes] Talent teamed up on.  Of course, J.C., both of them, Republicans.  Jim Talent is now a United States senator from Missouri, but that was our legislation, benefits Chicago, South Side area in Englewood in Chicago was designated as one of the renewal zones, a bill that created forty renewal communities, poorest areas in the country, for special tax credits and incentives to draw business back into the inner city.
Story_ID: 6352
Speaker 1: In terms of the--your term in Con-, [U.S.] Congress so far, well, what would you consider as a highlight of your terms?
Speaker 2: Well, there've been so many highlights.  I mean the legislation that, that I just mentioned, our bill that, that is gaining momentum right now [2003], the, the Public Safety Ex-Offenders Self Sufficiency Act that we're trying to get passed that deals with the tremendous crisis that, that we face with African American males in the criminal justice system, the--.
Speaker 1: Is that the number one issue in your district?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, it's, you know, it's hard to--number one issues, really.  I'm, I'm saying-- Every issue--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It would be a top issue, I know--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--is number one.  I'm, I'm saying--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It would be a top one though, right?
Speaker 2: --there is a crisis with African American males in this country.  There is a crisis in criminal justice with African American males and African Americans in this country.  I mean black people in America are about forty-eight percent of the prison population.  There's a big difference between forty-eight percent and fourteen or fifteen percent of the [total] population.  I mean in Illinois, black men make up six percent of the state's population, but sixty percent of the prison population.  That's heavy.  And so we've been trying to organize some focused attention on that issue, while at the same time, dealing with all of the parameters of poverty, lack of education, drug use and substance abuse.  I mean we've got an, a, a, an initiative that we've got going right now to try and get on the ballot a referendum question for drug treatment on demand in Illinois.  And so all of these, to me, are real great highlights.  I mean we do things in every arena.  I mean the Illinois Hospital Association just gave me an outstanding award for the work that we do in health care, and, and trying to salvage and save hospitals, which is a--and, of course, health is a big issue.  I got four or five amendments passed this year in education reauthorization bills, [H.R. 1261] Head Start, to increase male involvement; got an amendment passed there, got an amendment to have ex-offenders defined as, as a hard-to-serve, hard-to-reach population in the job training employment bill, bill; got an amendment [to H.R. 1350] passed dealing with the high number of black boys placed in special education, any disproportionate placement of a population group, but we were basically talking about black boys.  I'm saying, that amendment.  So there, there are so many things actually.  Many people don't know that the postal issues is a big piece, nine billion dollar industry.  I'm chairman of the Postal Caucus.  I'm the ranking member on a special postal subcommittee in government reform [Special Panel on Postal Reform and Oversight], which really means that there are four of us who work with these issues in a real sense.  The chairman, Tom [Thomas M.] Davis [III]--Republican, Henry [Arnold] Waxman, our ranking member-- Democrat, [John Michael] McHugh--Republican and me.  So we're very proud of, of the work that we do in Congress, and, and have done.  We've got this black male piece that's, that's going around the nation this year.  I serve as, as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus' child welfare brain trust.  We've gone around the country, ferreting out issues dealing with child welfare, Mississippi, Texas.  And so there, there, there are so many things, I mean you just (can?) work, and so I'm gonna work until my days are done (laughs).  I, I mean it's hard to say that something is a bigger issue than something else.  I mean unemployment, job creation, job development, issues that's very hard to get people to understand because much of the genesis of the issue relates to trade policy.  I'm, I'm saying, people, you know, I hear politicians go out and tell people, "You know, I'm gonna get you some jobs, I'm a--", I, it's--I get so sick when I hear those lies.  And people (laughs) telling people that they're gonna do that.  And they take no position at all on trade policy that really relates to job creation and job development or they're not dealing with education so that individuals learn the technology that they need to know in order to compete effectively.  And so, "I'm gonna find you some jobs" doing what? If I'm not dealing with--I'm, I'm saying, and--I mean, it's scandalous when people tell individuals that they're going to do that. And they're not dealing with anything at all that is designed to create jobs and work opportunities, and, and, and so--a lot of issues.  But, but people involvement is really the big deal because individual elected officials or anybody else individually, aren't gonna do much of anything about anything.  It's the extent to which you can get people involved to work in behalf of their individual and collective self-interest, and make use of that power potential.  That's when you really do something for them.
Story_ID: 6353
Speaker 1: In that regard, I know that you worked with a lot of grassroots organizations on the West Side [of Chicago, Illinois], and there's a, you know, you have a pretty decent working relationship with them, even though politicians are not necessarily considered the friends of grassroots organizations by definition, that's how they do things, but over here, with NAC [Northwest Austin Council ] and SACC [South Austin Community Coalition] and--.
Speaker 2: Well, we have a lot of, we work--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously).--Westside Health and--.
Speaker 2: We, we are engaged--I have thirty-two advisory committees that we staff and work every month.  We meet with more than five hundred people every month in policy discussions, health, education, youth development.  Not only grassroots organizations, but law enforcement.  I mean the co-chairs of our public safety committee are two police chiefs, the chief of police from Bellwood [Illinois], Chief Greg Moore, the chief of police from Oak Park [Illinois], Rick [Richard C.] Tanksley.  We, we, we create an environment where people can work collectively on the issues that impact their lives, and, and, and create the utilization of power that they have the possibility of projecting in order to get the kind of public-policy decision making that is beneficial and helpful to them.  And, and, and our long suit, I'd probably say that is it.  I mean we convene every year more than two thousand people at one time for a discussion of these issues, a day and a half, Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois], Friday evening, all day Saturday.  And then we make use of that.  I'm saying all of our legislative initiatives are driven by the things that people tell us.  Our ex-offender work comes out of our ex-offender task force.  'Ebony' magazine has a four-page article in this month's issue on ex-offender issues that affects the whole country, dealing with the work that we do on ex-offenders.  Well, the significance of that?  There are a lot of people who don't even know that there is an ex-offender problem.  And so if an, if a magazine like 'Ebony' runs a story on this, they go into fourteen million households.  I mean that's a lot of opportunity for people to know.  I'm, I'm, I'm saying--and so all of the things that we really do connects and come together and, and and that's really what politicians and elected officials and public interest people can do.  I don't believe in running out and saying to people, "I am," "I did," I so and so, I so and so and so. "We did,"  "We so and so and so."  We communicate.  I got over two hundred thousand newsletters that will going into people's homes this week and next week.  We do that twice a year so that they are up to snuff on some of the things that, that we do.  An enlightened citizenry is the only possibility that we have for a democracy to really work.
Story_ID: 6354
Speaker 1: Sir, at this juncture in your life, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: If--it would probably be that I have been intimately involved and associated with the people that I seek to represent.
Speaker 1: Okay, and would you do anything differently when you look back on it, on your life?
Speaker 2: Start early (laughs), start sooner (laughs).
Speaker 1: You could always go longer too.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I, I, I think that would, oh, if only I knew then--you know, there's this song, "Going Against the Wind", if only I knew what I know now, then.  And, and, and, and I would have started and doing electoral politics perhaps a bit sooner because the, the senior, seniority system that we have is very meaningful in electoral politics.  And there's only one way to have that.  I mean, take, for example, we are so fortunate right now in Illinois that we have an Art [Arthur L.] Turner in the, in the Illinois House [Illinois General Assembly] who is the number three ranking Democrat there; or that we have an Emil Jones who is, is the president of the [Illinois state] senate.  Well, seniority has, has played a tremendous role in each one of those situations.  And, and so, if you can direct people when they're young into an office, I mean Jesse Jackson, Jr. has so much possibility and potential because of his age.  Harold Ford [Jr.] has so much potential and possibility.  Greg [Gregory] Meeks has so much potential and possibility because there were situations, you know, where they were able to get elected and, you know, they can have twenty years.  I mean Harold Ford can have--you know, can be in, in Congress twenty years and maybe be forty-six years old or so, which means that, that, that there's a lot of prime time left.  I mean Jesse, Jr. can be in his late forties and have a great deal of seniority.  And seniority does, in fact, in our system play a role.  I mean Art is relatively young and has been in the legislature more than twenty years.  So I, I, I--I think if, if we can find young, bright, interested people and have them get elected when there's an opportunity at early ages--I mean Dan Rostenkowski didn't just walk in being chairman of Ways and Means.  I mean Charlie [Charles] Rangel didn't just walk up and be the chair--the, the, the ranking [Democratic] member of the Ways and Means Committee.  I mean seniority, are factors in all of that.  So when there are some vacancies, and we can elect some young fellows or young ladies, you know, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty years old, where they can be in a legislative body for twenty years and only be forty-whatever or fifty, I think we really will be arriving in, in the political legislative arena at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this last question is similar to legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I'd like to be remembered as one who tried to make a difference.  I mean I've, I've always said that anything that I've ever done, I'd like to leave it in better shape than it was when I found it.  And so, I'd like to believe when I'm no longer in public office, that I used that opportunity to make the world a better place than when I got there, and, and, and so I guess that's how I'd like to be remembered.
