Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your mother starting with her name and where she was born and where she grew up as a child and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: My mother name is Stella Calomathi.  Her middle name was Cornish.  I think that was her mother's maiden name.  So she was Stella Cornish Calomathi, C-A-L-O-M-A-T-H-I.  And, and her married name was Barr, B-A-R-R.
Speaker 1: And where was she born and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: She was born in Trelawny [Jamaica] in the same place I was born, which is Jamaica.  And she grew up--she went to school there in the parish of Waldensia.  That's the area is called.  And she in her early years became a, a seamstress or dressmaker.  Then from there she moved to Montego Bay [Jamaica].
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a little girl growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, not--well, my mother lost her, her left eye when she was eleven years old by playing outside in some water.  It got into the eye and got infected.  And, and she lost it.  So, she would share some of the trying times as a child growing up with one, with, with, with only vision in one eye.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did she tell you about it?
Speaker 2: Well, well, my mother is a beautiful woman.  Her name is actually--her--they called her 'Beauty'.  And everybody who knows her knows her as Beauty.  She was such as pretty girl.  She had really kind of long jet black hair because my grandfather was Italian Indian mixed in with African American--I mean not African American, with, with, with, with African 'cause they're not American, African.  And, and so she was, she was tall, stately.  She was about, about five [feet] eight [inches], five [feet] nine [inches], very tall, stately lady with--you know, held herself--walked.  When she walked in to a room, you knew she was there.  And had a radiant personality.  So, I think her--her mother died at, at a very young age.  And she was the--there was a sister that was older and she died.  And right after she died, she then became more or less like the matriarch of the family.  You know, she felt it was her responsibility to look out for her brothers and sisters.  And so she's had a very busy, full life.  But she was also a woman that was very adventurous.  She loved to go out.  She love a good party.  She loves to--she loves people.  And she was involved in her church and, and civic leadership within the area and the Woman, Woman Business League and different things.  So I came from a mother like that.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of things did she tell you about some of the challenges of just having vision in one eye.  Was it like a--was it a physical or did, did she--?
Speaker 2: Well, she had to gave a glass eye put in.  So that was another, I guess, as a little girl for a while until they could afford to put a glass eye in--and, and remember this is a small Caribbean island.  So it wasn't easily to come by.  I'm sure she went through her own, you know, disappointments and failures based on that.  But once she was able to get the--the eye put in and she looked fairly normal.  And unless someone know--if you really walk up to her, you would never know.  What she tends to do is that as a little girl when I would, when I would get on her left hand, she would kind of take her hand and move me around and put me on her right side so she could actually see, see me because she had no vision on that side.  But no one would know, if you've met her.  And that she was such--beautiful smile and such a radiant lady and classy lady, too.  She became a manager at a very large department store.  She was an excellent saleswoman.  And, and she was the buyer.  So, needless to say, I was the only girl so I got all the nice clothes and all the fashionable stuff right along with her.  It wasn't unusual for her to have both of us dressed up in the same identical outfits.
Speaker 1: And did she make a lot of your clothes as well?
Speaker 2: As she got busier and became the manager, she didn't have time to sew.  She, she sent my stuff out to, to others.  She did that when I was much younger.
Story_ID: 11303
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father, now, starting with his name.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Horace, H-O-, H-O-R-A-C-E, Dermot, D-E-R-M-O-, M-O-, I think it's M-O-T, and his last name is Nathan.  My, my dad grew up in Trelawny [Jamaica] but in a different part.  It's an area called Gray's Inn where he, where he grew up.  His father was an overseer of large plantation.  His mother was--it was a home--a homemaker.  His father was, was a mixture with Nathan--they were a mixture of Scottish and, and, and African.  And my grandmother was a darker--my grand--his was a much lighter complected.  My grandmother was a darker lady.  Her name was, was--my mother's mother was Emily and my father's mother was Marianne.  And so they, they grew up I would say in, in, in that area in Trelawny.  And at the stories that they usually tell me is that when he was about--his mother died also when he was a teenager.  And he had to then assume a lot of responsibilities.  And then at about seventeen he decided to learn a trade.  And he went into carpentry.  My dad is literally a self-made man.  He went into carpentry.  He would tell me stories, and the stories would be, would be the first time he decided to go into, to learn carpentry.  His father loaned him his hammer and, and the initial tools that you need for carpentry--saw and hammer.  And he told him that as soon as he made his first check, he needs to bring it, bring his, his tool--buy his own.  And so my dad within--before the week--by the time he got his first--well, I think he told him sometime within that period.  But by the time he got his first check he bought all of his own equipment and returned his father's equipment.  His father was so proud that he followed through and was doing so well in, in, in this undertaking.  And as he grew up as--you know, over the years my dad traveled abroad.  He was in farm workers, he was in Panama, he was in America, back and forth, then come back to Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Did he go to work in these places?
Speaker 2: He would go, go to work in these places and come back.  So there a period in my life that I really didn't quite remember him because he was gone so much.  And I remember the first time that we were really united.  I was--my mom [Stella Calomathi Barr] had me waiting for my dad.  And he arrived.  And he--and I was out at a ice cream cart.  I probably was about five and I was at the ice cream cart having some ice cream.  And he said, "Little girl, who are you waiting to see?"  Again, he said, "Hi little girl, what is your name?"  And I said, "Shirley."  And he said, "Are you waiting to see someone?"  And he said--and I said, "Yes, I'm waiting to see my, my father."  And he said, "If you see your father, would you know him?"  And I said, "Yes, I would."  And I said, "My father has the first--his little finger is missing on his--on his right hand, not the mid finger, just the first joint of the finger."  And I reached out to take his hand to show him where, where it was, and I saw it and I screamed.  And so that was my first real unite, you know, uniting back with my dad.  I--he became a contractor and builder.  As I said he was a man who build his own house, never borrowed anything from anyone, paid for everything that he owned cash, had his own--his favorite saying was "The heights of great men reached and kept were not attained by sudden flight but while their companions slept they toiled through the night," or something to that matter.  I don't remember each aspect.  But he would repeat that--"The heights of great men."  And so my father was the guy who fired the prime minister and rehired him and fired the governor.  And everybody political and members of Parliament at the, at the table, the dinner table each evening  So he would redo the budget (laughs), he would plan where they, what they're not doing correctly in running the government.  And, and so I think I had a keen ear of listening to all of that, you know.  And so--but some--there was a period in my life that I didn't live with either my mother or my father.  I lived with my Aunt Vera who was really a distant relative to my dad.  And this lady just fell in love with me.  She never had any children.  And she wanted me to come to Kingston [Jamaica].  So this is how I end up leaving Montego Bay [Jamaica] where my, I had been living with my mom in Montego Bay.  And then about seven years old I moved to Kingston.  And then I attending school in Kingston as a little girl.  I attended Mico Practicing School in Kingston and, and senior school as I got older.  And, and, and then they discovered that I was dyslexic.  And so I had to have a lot of private tutoring.  And so that was basically my education.
Story_ID: 11304
Speaker 1: Delegate Nathan-Pulliam, tell me what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory was this bright-eyed little girl with reddish looking hair, probably about three and a half going on four.  When my, my parents had broken up and had separated and my father [Horace Nathan]--I was--my mother [Stella Camonathi Barr] left me with my dad when she was an adventurous woman I told you.  You know, she went off.  And so my dad brought me back, brought me from Trelawny [Jamaica] where I was and brought me to Montego Bay [Jamaica] to, to my, to my mother.  Because I think he was probably getting ready to go to Panama, one of his, his, his places overseas.  And so he brought me to my mom.  And I remember clearly my mom was not there the day--she was at work.  And I remember an old lady by the name of Aunt Lize we called her, who said, "Don't worry.  I'll take care of Shirley until Beauty get home."  And I remember sitting there really puzzled sitting on the step looking out, you know, kind of sad look 'cause my dad's going.  I haven't seen my mom.  And I'm sitting, sitting here.  But this lady was so overwhelming in terms of love and, and security I felt.  And then she gave me a chicken.  She gave me what they call a sensa fowl.  It's a, it's, it's a, it's a chicken that doesn't that doesn't have all the hair on the--the hair looks kind of wild on, on it.  It's like a little chicken.  And that was my little baby pet.  And that little chicken followed me around for a long time.  So that was my earliest recollection.  And probably maybe about four or five I remembered that there was a war going on.  And why I remember is that at nights they would come and knock on the doors and say to cut the lights out.  So I know that's probably was about--I was born '39 [1939], so it's probably was about '44 [1944], '45 [1945], somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about what holidays were like in your house growing up and daily life, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Daily life was as I said just typical little girl.  I would make, make up doll houses and, and have my little dolls.  And when I didn't have dolls or I didn't--they wouldn't--I would take, you know, breadfruit, which is a fruit that grows on a tree.  When a breadfruit comes in, although it ends up being round, it comes in to a long, it comes out as a chute, like a long chute.  And I would take the breadfruit and carve a face on the, on the outside of it and take matches and make arms and legs.  And I would create my own, my own baby dolls and line them up inside of these little houses that I would make.  As I got older, of course, my dad was a--was a builder and cabinetmaker.  He could make anything.  So my first real dollhouse my dad made for me.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that dollhouse?
Speaker 2: I remember that dollhouse, and you know, and I would set it out there and I would have everything lined up inside of it.  I was also a little girl that was very curious.  I would, man, I would go out and catch all the insects either from little--from caterpillars to, to, to butterflies, to anything that was out there.  I would play with them until they die.  And then I would bury them.  I would have regular rituals.  I put them in matchbox and dig holes and buried them and had all my little friends and put flowers on the grave.  Why I did it I don't know, but it was typical little kid.  I was kid who played with all the kids around.  I was very--up until I was--I had a brother, my older brother Lloyd [Gardner]--but up until, which was three years older than me.  Lloyd came to live with us probably when I was about five or six, about five.
Speaker 1: So where was Lloyd living before--?
Speaker 2: Lloyd was living with my grandparents in, in Trelawny.  And, and with his, you know--that's where he was.  We did not have the same father, so he, he lived there with them and then with his dad.  And then my mother--I remember the night my mother went and, and stole him and brought him back with us.
Speaker 1: Why do you say stole him?
Speaker 2: Well, she didn't tell them that she wanted him.  She wanted him.  But because they, they had him, they wouldn't, would willingly give him up.  There was no legal, any papers or anything.  So she just nicely--we--a friend of ours who drove a truck up to--we spent the weekend, the whole family, in the country.  And so she just nicely inform him not to go to school that day, to come and meet us.  And she brought all his clothing and everything and packed them in the, in the back of the truck and it was covered over.
Speaker 1: What was the grandparents' reaction?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, we were gone by the time the reaction.  I'm sure they were angry.  They were totally angry.  But she was determined that she was taking her, both her children with her.  So it was just a determined woman.  And I was so worried because it poured rain.  I remember it clearly.  'Cause it poured rain so much that I, I was worried the whole time because I was sitting in the front of the truck with my mother and I said, "Oh, my God, he's gonna drown."  I thought he's gonna drown.  I was so worried about him.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was sitting in the--.
Speaker 2: He was--they had him covered over in the back.  And it started pouring rain.  And if you know anything about tropical countries and rain and narrow winding roads.  I mean I was just so worried sick that my poor brother was gonna drown.  But, anyhow, he didn't drown and we arrived in Montego Bay safely.  He was soaking wet part of the thing.  And he didn't have--they didn't have all the, the, the clothing.  He was shaking.  So my mother decided to put everything she could find on him to stop him to stop him from shaking including my slip.  And that poor boy didn't live that down for a long time.  I used that as a thing to tease him for a very long time.  I was a teaser, you know.  Oh, yeah.  The minute he said something, I said, "Yes, you wore my slip" (laughs).  But beyond that we just had a fairly normal--he was a very bright child.  And I didn't know that I was dyslexic.  I didn't know that I didn't--I didn't know the difference Bs and Ds and M and N and I read things backwards.  But they didn't know what was wrong.  They thought I was just dumb.  And--but I knew I wasn't dumb.  I knew I could memorize things that most kids didn't memorize.  And I understood more complicated things.  But simple things like that puzzled me.  And so I really grew up with that, with that kind of feeling of not having good self-esteem, feeling kind of, you know, you know, can I accomplish this, really doubted myself for quite some, for quite a while through elementary and high school.

Speaker 1: Delegate Nathan-Pulliam, tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up in Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Oh, smell of cinnamon, fresh cinnamon over my, my porridge or, as what my parents would call it, in the morning--cornmeal porridge and fresh cinnamon.  The--the sound of the doctor bird or the birds singing and the, the sea, the beautiful sea and, and the blue, blue, clear blue water and the palm trees bowing down, yes, the coconut trees.  Yeah, that's my--as a matter of fact when I'm depressed and things are not going, I can do good imagery.  I literally take myself to that place.
Story_ID: 11306
Speaker 1: I know that you said that both your maternal and paternal grandmothers had passed when your parents were children, but did you know your grandfathers at all?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What can you--?
Speaker 2: Knew both my grandfathers.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about them starting with their name.  Let's talk about your paternal grandfather.
Speaker 2: My paternal grandfather name was, was Nicholas Baron Nathan.  And he was not as tall as my dad [Horace Nathan].  My dad was probably about five, five [feet] ten [inches].  My grandfather was I think was somewhat shorter.  But maybe he seemed shorter to me because he was older.  I--he died when he was ninety-two years old.  And I remember being at his funeral.  I remember the whole thing.  I was nine years old.  But I'd had the opportunity to meet him on a couple occasions before when I was like four and five and six years old.  And, and used to remember having dinner with him, sitting at the table with him.  And I was a picky eater.  I like swordfish and I like plantain and I like those kinds of things.  But I wouldn't eat the yam and the, and the potatoes and, and green bananas, which is a part of our, our regular meals.  I wouldn't eat those things.  I would feed it to the dog or something under the table.  But I--and my grandfather allowed me to do that.  When, you know--and, but he would say, "Well you just have to have a better appetite."  So he thought that if he roasted sour orange, which is like orange but it is sour--if he roasted it and put sugar on it and get me to eat it, it would increase my appetite to--I would eat a little bit more.  So he did stuff--and I remember walking out with him to the tangerine and the--and the orange trees.  And then we had just like miniature tangerine trees and, and orange trees that were short and were loaded down with oranges and tangerine.  And many time they weren't quite ripe.  They weren't ready to be picked.  But I want them.  And he would say, "Oh, go ahead and pick it."  You know, and he would just let me do what I wanted to do.  And I would walk with him around.  I remember those days.  And I remember when my--the day that my dad called to say that he had passed.  And I couldn't understand.  You know, at nine you--and so we're, we're in a bus headed to, to Gray's Inn [Jamaica] where, where my grandfather's home was.  And we got there and the--I remember a lady coming up to the bus as we were getting off.  And she said, "Mas Nick is doing fine."  They called him Mas Nick.  And I said, "Mas Nick--.
Speaker 1: Mas Nick for Master Nick?
Speaker 2: For Mas, yes, Master, but Nick for short of Nicholas.  So Mas Nick is what they call him.  "Mas Nick is doing fine."  And so I said, "Oh, he's not dead.  She say he's doing fine."  So we got up to the house and, of course, his body was still laying--he was still in the house laid out in the house dressed in red for burial.  And I was really very heartbroke when I walk in and realize he was really dead.  And I took a look at him.  And my dad being the--my dad and couple of other men cut the tree down.  We had mahogany trees on the property.  They cut the trees down.  They made the casket right there.  They lined up all the lumber and made a casket down to varnishing and polishing and do every.  And I remember climbing in the casket when they had done everything, climbing in, you know, just, just a little devilish kid.  While they were turned around, I jumped into the casket.  And they got me out of it.  And I remember that evening, later that evening he was buried.  And it was pouring, started pouring rain.  And I was standing by the gravesite with my dad holding his hand.  And my mom and all the others had come and gathered around the gravesite.  And I remember looking up at my father and that was the first time I ever saw him cry.  And I was--first I wasn't sure if it was the rain that was on his face.  But as I observed carefully, I realized--.  And I was so afraid that my grandfather was gonna drown in this, in this, in this grave because it was full of water from the pouring rain (laughs).  But it just typical child.  And I remember that quite clearly.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about the plantation where he was an overseer.
Speaker 2: Well I don't know anything about that.  I think we, we owned a lot of land, lot of what they call cockpit country.  It's, it's up in the hills and up in the mountains and all around.  And he basically oversee--I think initially that I think if you go way back to slavery, I guess, maybe--and although they never really discussed that much about slavery with me, but I would assume that maybe his father may have been the owner because he, he, he was Scottish.  So I would think that he probably was the owner of the, of the, of these properties.  And as a child he probably grew up in that household.  And as he got older he became the overseer of all the properties.  And that is about as much as I, I remember.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of people who worked the land in that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: You had people who worked the land and, yes, and there were a lot of fruit trees and different kinds of trees, you know, fruits and things, nessberries and orange--and different kind of exotic fruits that you, you don't know here that are, that are grown, you know.
Speaker 1: And those were the main crops, various fruits?
Speaker 2: Yes on a lot.  And now my mother's father--his name was Joseph, Joseph Calomathi.  He was a interesting guy.  I can back up a little bit and tell you about my, my grandfather, my, my. my father's father and my grandfather I was told used to meet each other on the weekend after they have had a few drinks.  And they would, they, they, my father's father, Nicholas, rode his horse.  They said many time the horse took him home 'cause he was, he was inebriated from their, their get-together on Friday evenings.  And my, my, my mother father--as I said he was, he was a banana exporter.  So he grew banana and coffee on his property, and he exported.  And so--and, well, after he has a shipment that goes, that is shipped off, then that's when they would really, that is, really get his, what we call gets his, gets in his rum--because you know rum is one of our, our, our, our main liquor that they use in Jamaica.  So they would say he gets in his rum, meaning that he's got pretty, pretty intoxicated.  They would have--it's big time celebration.  He was a tall, slender man with very dark hair.  As I said he had looked Indian-looking because of his heritage.  Well spoken, very musical--he played the accordion, he played the piano, he played a lot of musical instruments.  He loved to, to sing.  And I have an Aunt Clara who is now deceased who sang right along with him.  And, and we had a cousin who is now--her name was Aunt Verie (ph.), we would call her.  She was the mother of a cousin of ours who was a physician, Dr. Black.  And they would all get together.  I remember them getting on the veranda and singing, you know, just he's playing the accordion (unclear).  And my Uncle Roland who was one of the deputy chief of the fire department--when we would all gather he, he would sing.  He had a beautiful voice.  So there would be just like a family harmony outside on the, on the porch with everybody singing.  And so I remember those, those, those days.  But he was just a, but he was stingy man.  He never gave much of his money away to his kids.  And when I'd get a--what we would say--it wasn't a dollar then, it would be like a shilling, you know.  Then when I get a shilling, then I would say, oh, he really gave me some money, you know.  Really thought I got some money from him.
Story_ID: 11307
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Stella Calomathi Barr] and your father [Horace Nathan], did they go back to Trelawny [Jamaica] a lot and spend a lot of time there once they had moved away?  And, and like how far was Trelawny from Montego Bay, Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Trelawny's not far from Montego Bay, but my dad lived in Kingston [Jamaica] and my mother lived in Montego Bay 'cause they were, you know, I tell you their relationship--they were not together.  They--my father married in Kingston and I had two sisters and three and two brothers there.  And my mother only had my older brother Lloyd [Gardner] and myself.  So I got, of course, to travel and get to know, you know, back and forth between.  And, of course, I told you about my Aunt Vera, which was this fantastic human being who came into my life who--her mother and father became my grandparents.  And so I had an opportunity to spend quite a bit of time and summertime in a place called Catadupa in the parish of St. James.  And that would be when I would go spend all my summer vacations with them catching crawfish and getting in the water and climbing the mango trees.  I was a climber.  You know, I would climb any tree that there was.  And if I couldn't climb it, I'd figure a way to get the fruit off it.  Couldn't climb a coconut tree, but I'd get close enough to a mango tree so I could try to shake it, you know, find a way to twist the fruit off.  So I was a busy little girl.
Speaker 1: And so--and you went to live with your aunt when you were about seven years old?
Speaker 2: When I was about seven.  And I lived with her spending summers and vacation with my mother in Montego Bay and with my, and my dad would come regularly because he was in the same town to visit with me and I went, while I went to school.  And as I, I think when I was about thirteen I, my dad decide it was about time that I came to live with him because I had gotten to the stage of making my own decisions and going where I wanted to go.  So he decided for me to settle down and work on my lessons and have someone--yeah, I needed to come to live with him.
Story_ID: 11308
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about elementary school.  Tell me a little bit--the name of your elementary school and what some, some of your favorite classes were and, you know, just if you remember some of your teachers.
Speaker 2: Well, as I explained, as I explained to you that I, I was dyslexic, so school wasn't, I wasn't that crazy about.  But I enjoyed playing and going to the--you know, with my friends.  But--and I hated math with a passion because if you, if you revert word, numbers, then you're not gonna come up with the right answers.  And so for that reason I hated that.  But I love, I love anything that has to do with science--botany and, and biology and any of those things.  I, I really excelled in those areas.  The--my school, my school days were--as a little girl at about nine I developed rheumatic fever, okay, and that was partly because of this--there was a heavy storm and I took my shoes off and decided that I would get into the water and just play in the water with the kids.  And over with the tropical country whatever happened between the coldness of the water and the heat of whatever I started the next morning with a terrible sore throat.  And by the time they took me to the doctor I had obviously strep throat.  The--with, with having the medication they gave me obviously didn't get into my system early enough and I got very ill--could not walk.  It had connective tissue involvement.  And so I was hospitalized.  So I spent my tenth birthday in a hospital.  I was a patient in (unclear) ward.  They did not put me in the children ward because there was cardiac in my, my--I had developed a systolic murmur.  And I remember the doctors in all their white lab coats taking me down in a wheelchair, bring me down in a wheelchair because I couldn't walk that well.  And they would try to figure what they gonna do and how they gonna deal with my case.  And so for that they isolated me in a ward with adults.  There was one other Shirley and one other Cynthia that was another child that was on, on the, on that unit.  So they were very sick as well.  I discovered very early and during my three-month stay in the hospital that the--the nurses during the day read the orders so I had to stay in bed.  I was on bed rest.  And so family brought me all kind of goodies and munchies, and my Aunt Vera came and brought me--and my dad [Horace Nathan] came to visit and mom [Stella Calomanthi Barr] came to visit when she was in town.  And everybody just rally around me.  But I discovered that the evening nurses didn't read the orders.  So by evenings I got out of bed and I visited all the patients.  And I gave bedpans and I helped those who couldn't feed themselves.  And so by the time my tenth birthday came around while I was there I knew I was going to be a nurse when I grew up because I, I really admired the nurses.  And the nurses in the evening would let me come in and sit at the table where they ate in the evening when they took a break and they would feed me anything that I wanted.  So I was really spoiled rotten at that, at that time.  So, that was my, my childhood experience.  And so I had about three recurring episodes of rheumatic fever up until I think the last one I had when I was thirteen.  So because of that it limited a lot of things that I could do as a teenager in terms of sports, in terms of other activities because it didn't take much to start a flare-up.  And as I said I had three major episode where I was on penicillin therapy and had to be bed, you know, to be on bed rest.
Speaker 1: And what would a flare-up entail?  What would happen?
Speaker 2: A sore throat; from a sore throat, pains in the joints--in every joint in my body.  The ankles would be swollen.  I couldn't--I would scream in pain--I couldn't put my leg down to walk.  And so they had to have a helper.  The family had a helper in to help bathe me and dress me and, you know.  But I was a devilish little kid, too.  In between those times I, I had a parrot who would wake me up in the morning and call me at "Shirley, Shirley," you know, to get up for school in the morning.  We, I had a helper named Vy who was--had a responsibility to get me ready for school.  And I--she was very religious and I played a lot of little devilish tricks on Vy, some of them I would not put on this tape--things that (laughs)--.
Speaker 1: What did you--what--tell us some that you would put on (laughs), that you can share with us (laughs).
Speaker 2: We had a, we had a bathroom or, well, like it's not a bath where we--it's, it's what you would call it, a toilet that's it way out in the back.  And, and Vy would, would go to her--she belonged to the religious organization called Pukamani where they actually get, you know, the, in the spirit of, you know, jumping and dancing in the, in the street.  They have a street service.  So when she came in the mornings she was very tired, and she would just fall asleep.  So she had a way of going into the bathroom and sitting on the toilet and, and then, and, and fall asleep.  And then many times I'm late for school because she had to come--.  So this one particular morning, my neighbors, this little fella came to get me for school and she wasn't ready.  I couldn't, I wasn't ready, and I could find Vy.  We discovered that Vy was in her favorite place.  So this morning we pull--we got a firecracker and a condensed can and sneak into the bathroom and put it down at her feet and ran out.  And then it went off.  I'm sure needless to tell you the scramble of her getting out.  She was so angry with me, she called me the devil's servant and pour water on--and, and threw some water on me, which precipitated another episode of, of rheumatic fever because I was stubborn.  I wouldn't take the clothes off (laughs).  I got angry and wouldn't take the clothes off.  But I created it, you know.  So, that's, that was a, just a little trick, you know, the little devilish thing that kids did.

Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: As a little girl my mother [Stella Calomathi Barr] was Presbyterian and she sang in the choir.  So I went to Sunday school and I was very involved there.  In Montego Bay [Jamaica] I went to Barracks [Road Primary] School.  I remember the first day I went to, I went to pre-kindergarten.  I wasn't, I was just going on four and when they called Shirley Nathan I ran out, ran all the way home.  But then I actually started back in the school 'cause we start school little bit earlier than the children that start school here.  And I went to Barracks School and then I--.
Speaker 1: You went to what kind of school?
Speaker 2: Barracks is the name of the school.
Speaker 1: That was the name of the school there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Barracks School, which is, which it was like a--what they call it, what did they call it--infant school, meaning that we're little kids, you know.  Went to infant school and then I went to elementary school there before I, before I went to, moved to Kingston [Jamaica] and went to Mico Practicing School.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your experiences like in church?
Speaker 2: In church as a little girl, oh, the best time for me is Harvest.  You call it Thanksgiving.  We call it Harvest.  And that's when people bring all of their, their goodies, the best things that they grow, the prettiest eggs, their, from their chicken, their, the best, the biggest breadfruit, the nicest bunch of bananas, their plantains, their--everything that they're, they have, they would bring it to the church.  And they would put it like at the altar, and we would have what we call harvest baskets, baskets that we bring our little goodies in, and bring it to put at the altar of the church.  And then the next day, of course, after it's all over, the Monday, they would have a big sale.  People would come and buy the best of everything.  And the money would go back to the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to enjoy that as a little girl.  I used to love to see how the church was decorated.  And, and, you know, the--as I left there and went to, to, to Kingston, I became--my Aunt Vera was Anglican, or what we call Episcopalian here.  And so I started going to that church.  And then I became, I was confirmed when I was twelve in the, in the Anglican Church or the Church of England or whatever we call it there.  And so I was very active.  I had belonged to every organization.  I was a member of the 4-H Club, member of the Red Cross, Junior Red Cross Society, member of the Junior Daughters of the King, Girl Scouts, which we called Girl Guides.  I was a Brownie and then I was Girl Guide.  I was a very active child in just about every organization.  And, needless to say, that I belong to about twenty organizations now because I've always done this from a child.  So I have had, had a full, involved childhood.
Story_ID: 11310
Speaker 1: Now did you go to middle school or junior high school or was that part of elementary?
Speaker 2: Well, our, our school system is different from yours because I went to Mico [Practicing School, Kingston, Jamaica] I think up until I was about probably fourteen.  And then I went to, to the other school, senior school, I think somewhere may--between fifteen, sixteen, and seventeen, somewhere about there.  And I, I, I didn't finish school there.  And then I had to be privately tutored because--I don't think I went all the way to sixteen, I was sixteen, and then I was privately tutored because I, I could not pass the exams that they had because they're very stringent in exams.  I took--they, they have different exam--I forgot what they call it now.  It's like the first year and second year and third year exams.  And I was having difficulty passing them because of the dyslexia.
Speaker 1: When was your dyslexia discovered?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents really didn't know what it was.  I had at thirteen I developed severe migraines at puberty.  I had migraine headaches and I think that probably had to come, too, with the stress of worrying about--and I had migraines so bad that I couldn't hold my head up.  I had to be, be in dark rooms when the headache starts.  And you can imagine live in a bright tropical country with migraines.  And migraine creates the visionary problems--and I had a true classic migraine with lights going everywhere and, you know, when you turn on a TV and see lights going crazy--that's what it look like for me when I, when I looked at, when I was having, what they call it, aura of the migraine before.  And so I had pretty, you know, intense with medical problems as well as trying to be a normal, a normal teenager growing up.
Speaker 1: And so was it when you went to live with your father [Horace Nathan] when you were around thirteen that they--?
Speaker 2: That's about when I started having the migraines started.  And so they took me and test my eyes.  They thought it was my eyes.  They gave me glasses.  But it wasn't my eyes.  It was because migraine really affects the cranial nerve.  It's allergy of the cranial nerves.  And so, and they didn't know that much until one doctor discovered that I did have migraine and gave me a book on how to live with my migraine sick--headaches.  And so I began to deal, you know, deal with that.
Speaker 1: So was the dyslexia ever discovered during school?
Speaker 2: It, it was--they knew something was wrong but they didn't know what to call it, okay.  It was not until I was probably on my way to England that having read and having--by the time of overcome many of the dyslexic things were still there because I was worried that how was gonna be a nurse when I revert numbers.  But when you find out what you deficiencies are, you begin to know that I'm normal, that it is, that other people have dyslexia, then I paid very close attention to how, how do I calculate drugs, how I double check everything that I do, how I reread--I may not read as fast as the next person.  I'm slower in reading.  But once I absorb it, I get it.
Story_ID: 11311
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about like what some of your dreams and aspirations were.  Like you knew you wanted to be a nurse.  What were some of your other dreams and aspirations?  Did you ever dream of going to another country or going different places?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, definitely.  I--and remember when you live in a little country, little island you read a lot.  And little islands know more about what's happening in United States and England than many times United--people that live in United States know about these other countries because you read about them and you study geogerphy--geography was some of my favorite subjects, too.  So I could actually take myself to any part of the world.  And so I daydreamed about traveling.  And I, even as a little girl, I traveled a lot.  Remember I was on the train.  I mean I was six years old when I was put on the train by myself with my little lunch packet and went on to Kingston [Jamaica] to visit my aunt first before I decided to live with her.  And so I was used to traveling.  And so getting ready to--so I would daydream that I wanted to, to leave.  And so when I was about seventeen I went to work with my cousin who is a physician in Montego Bay [Jamaica] and the famous Dr. Morrison, Herbert Morrison, who was then what we--was a, a physician in, in that town.  And another physician's name was Buddy Wilson, which was a member of the, Fellow of the Royal School of Surgeons.  They all had an office together.  And I, because I had an interest in nursing and wasn't doing that well in passing those exams, I got a job working in their office, and they trained me as, more or less like a practical or physician's assistant because they trained me how to assist in surgery, how to give injections, how to pull up the dosages, how to go out and make house calls and visit.  So I was doing the stuff before I was even licensed.  So I worked and--so when I, when I--about seventeen and a half or so I decided I was going to go to nursing school in, in Jamaica.  But when I was ready to apply they, they had a waiting list that was about two years long, you know, in terms of waiting.  So at that point I start saying, you know, I want to go to England.  I think I--.
Speaker 1: Why England?
Speaker 2: Because, as a member of the British Commonwealth, England--you could go without having to have a whole lot of visas and whole lot of problem, you see.  You could just go.
Speaker 1: What did you know about England?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I knew that quite a few other people in Jamaica had migrated to England.  And, and I know about, of course, the Queen [Elizabeth II].  And I'd seen the Queen, I'd seen the King, you know, was, as a little girl I remember when the King [George VI] died.  I remember lowering and--lowering the flag on his death at the head--at the Girls Guide headquarters, which is, well, like what you call Girl Scout.  I remember going there and I was the one who lowered the flag.  I was the one who hoist the flag when Queen Elizabeth was crowned queen.  So I have--I had all of that royalty information very well pat in my mind.  So going to England was, was just another step, you know.  I want to see more.  I want to see Buckingham Palace.  I want to travel.  And so when the opportunity came I applied to nursing school [Bootham Park Hospital School of Nursing] in Yorkshire, England, and was accepted.  But just about the time I was accepted my mother [Stella Calomathi Barr] became extremely ill and, and with, with pneumonia and almost died.  And it was because she was in a coma, couldn't really respond.  And they didn't know whether she was gonna make it.  I didn't know where my future was.  I was really kind of worried.  So my brother [Lloyd Gardner] and I were just there trying to figure what we're gonna do.  And eventually my mother did regain consciousness, did get well with the help of the doctors and everyone.  And, and then once she was recuperating I decided that I would continue my dream and I would leave to go to school in England.
Story_ID: 11312
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: The, I, I went to Mico Practicing School [Kingston, Jamaica].
Speaker 1: And could you spell it?
Speaker 2: M-, M-I-C-O, Mico Practicing School.  That was the name.  And the reason why it's called a practicing school, it has an adjoining college, the Teachers College, which is Mico College.  And I think this is where the teachers come and, and practice.  My, my principal at that time was Mr. Durant.  I remember that.  And, and, and I, I remember a lot of my, my, my classmates and my friends, you know.
Speaker 1: Tell us about some that you remember.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I remember falling madly in love with this, with, with this, with this half-Chinese fellow.  His name was Kenneth Mock Yen.  And someone recently told me that he's a monsignor in New York.  So I had to go look him up.  It's funny.  And quite recently I got a call from another classmate on the phone, as a matter of fact this week I got a--class, and he said, "You don't know me."  He said, "My name is Raphael Roper.  You, you and I went to Mico together.  You used to fight me a lot."  And, you know, I, I said--and then when he talked he said, "I, I was--I heard that you didn't know, remember who I was," because he had sent a message by my sister.  And then at that time and at the end of his conversation he said, "And remember those boots."  But what happened, because I had rheumatic fever as a child, my parents put me in these high top boots to keep my feet warm because I had, my ankles were weak from the difficulty walking.  So the kids would tease me and call me Nathan Boots.  And so I would get in a fight.  So that's why he was reminding me.  So I had a good laugh, a big chuckle about that couple days ago when I got his call.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite subjects in high school?  Were you still very interested in the sciences?
Speaker 2: Oh, sciences, sciences all the way.  And I, I was a--I loved poetry.  So, and I would memorize 'If' by Rudyard Kipling and I would memorize all the, you know--lot of, lot of my friends and of my parents and other friends--I had an autograph and they all wrote little inscriptions in it.  You know, my aunt wrote, "Hope is the first feeling in an infant's heart, the last to fly before death's threatening dart."  You know, I have one--and one of my mother's friend wrote, "I give to you neither riches nor the glow of greatness, but that wherever you go some weary heart will glad let you smile, some weary heart will know sunshine for a while."  And those kinds of things really kept me.  I, I've memorized a lot.  My uncle, the one who is, who is, who was the fire department and died, he wrote in mine, he says, "I said to a man who was sitting at the gate for a year, give me a light that I might travel safely into the unknown.  And he said go out and put your hands in the hands of God and that shall be to you better than life and better than the known way."  He wrote that in my book when I was going to England.  I was a little bit nervous and worried about leaving home, and he assured me that I would be fine.  So I had all of those rich memories and things.  You know, I had a very rich childhood.  And because I was involved with so many organizations, I hiked and, and I belonged to all of these teenage groups and, you know, with the Girl Scouts and, you know, Girl Guides as, as we call it in Jamaica.  And so when I went to England I immediately joined the International Red Cross Society and was crowned Queen of May.  As a matter of fact I should have found that picture to give to you.
Story_ID: 11313
Speaker 1: What year did you go to England?
Speaker 2: I went to England in 1958.
Speaker 1: And what year--?
Speaker 2: '57 [1957] or '58 [1958], one of those years.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: If it's fifty--I think it was '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: And so you were accepted to a nursing school and you were--.
Speaker 2: In Yorkshire, England, at Bootham--Naburn and Bootham Park Hospital [School of Nursing] in Yorkshire, England.  And, and I, you know, there were about thirteen Jamaican on or of other young ladies that were at that school.  I specialized in psychiatry in my first part.  And it was in England that I met my husband.  I think I met him--I think I was nineteen.  I think I was going on nineteen.  I was at a party, a Christmas party as a matter of fact.  And he, he was stationed in the [U.S.] Air Force, and he came to say goodbye to some friends.  And he heard the music and it was Christmas and he knocked on the door.  The party was given by many of the African students, and so they all had tribal marks and they all spoke different language and one of them taught me in Swahili to say I want to love you.  And I didn't know I was greeting all the young men coming in the door--you know, they really pulled one on me.  And I was dressed up in their--so when this young man came to the door, I ask him, "What part of Africa are you from?"  And he said, "Pardon me, Miss.  I'm from the USA."  So I thought it was really funny.  I yell out to the group--I said, "Oh, he's from the USA."  Now the rest is history.  You know, I--we, that, the next--I gave him an invitation to my party the next day, which is called Boxing Day.
Speaker 1: Called what day?
Speaker 2: Boxing Day, B-O-X-I-N-G.
Speaker 1: And what, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: That's the day after Christmas is celebrated, and it's a big holiday for all the British Commonwealth countries and in Jamaica and, and those countries.  I don't even know the reason behind the word Boxing Day.  But, anyhow, that--with the Boxing Day celebration I had gotten permission from matron, which was the head of the nursing program, that I could have my party.  And I invited all my friends and I invited this new friend that I just met.  And he came and brought a lot of his other friends from the Air Force.  And so it turned out one of his friend was Jesse.  Jesse turned out to be the best man at our wedding a year after that, you know.  So I, we met and, and I was married in, in Saint Mary's Church near the old York Minster in, in, in Yorkshire, England, in a beautiful June wedding.  And my parents--my mother [Stella Calomathi Barr] had my gown made in Jamaica and sent it to, to England, although my, they, my parents could not be there.  My cousin, Cherry, was my chief bridesmaid.  And so she visited me quite recently from England too.  So it's just been a, you know, an, a very, a life full of travel and excitement.  And, and then I came to--I joined my husband in, in United States.
Speaker 1: So now did you finish nursing school in England or did you--?
Speaker 2: In England we usually call, it's RMN, which would be a registered mental nurse.  Now there are different phases to it.  I needed to do what they call SRN, which would be the state registered nurse.  And a--and I applied to do my midwifery.  So when I came to this country I had not finished the other parts of my--I passed the, the two state boards before--part one and part two state boards, but I did not finish my final of those other two parts.  And I came to, to Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: That, is that--was that your husband's home?
Speaker 2: Well, my husband is, was from North Carolina, but his parents had moved to Baltimore while he was stationed in--abroad.  So he mo-, he came directly here.  And he was here, and I joined him.  He, he, he came home earlier that year, I think a little after we were married.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: That was 1960.
Story_ID: 11314
Speaker 1: And so you came to Baltimore [Maryland] in 1960.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came to Baltimore in November, 1960 and joined my husband.  And, of course, from, from that marriage I had three children.
Speaker 1: Now when you came to Baltimore, was that your first time visiting the United States?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I was in my own culture shock, tremendous culture shock because--and, and my husband family, we, you know, we came from different worlds, basically.  Because although my father was a contractor and builder, we always own our own homes, we always had a helper, we always had a different lifestyle.  As a little girl, you know, I took the, you know, on a Saturday morning I would be gone to the matinee or the, the, you know, the, the movie early in the morning.  I had a different lifestyle.  Saturday morning for him is working on a sharecropper with his father, helping his father--was a sharecropper in North Carolina pulling tobacco and doing different things.  So his, his, his--really every day was survival.  And, and my parents preach education.  So we had a different, different outlook and different upbringing, which eventually create a little bit of problem in raising our children because or views and our cultures were so different.
Speaker 1: What was your impression of Baltimore when you arrived here in 1960?
Speaker 2: When I came--well, I passed all these fabulous nice homes and then I ended up in where my husband's family was living in some--they some rented apartments in, in, in the city, which was a little bit disheartening for me at that time because, again, I, I had a different exposure.  But I, I eventually, you know, what I would say, adapted.  There was a lot of issues in terms of integrating into the culture, things that they thought was fun I didn't think it was fun.  I didn't--I had to learn the currency.  I was pregnant, too, with my first child [Wayne Pulliam].  So that was added, additional stress.  And my husband had just come out the service [U.S. Air Force] so he was looking for work.  So we had a lot of original stress and then it was, I think, after my son was born--as a matter of fact my, both my sons are born on their father's birthday.  So--.
Speaker 1: Wow, what a coincidence.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm just a fantastic woman.  I can do many things.  Anyhow, it was on, on February 3, 1961, in the height--we had a lot of snow--and I, my husband finally got out of that snow and got me to the hospital.  But I got to the hospital, I think, it was on Groundhog's Day--it was the second.  And I got to the hospital and I thought I was going to have this baby.  And I labored all night, didn't have the baby until the next day on his birthday.  And so when he came in, I told him since I didn't learn pound, shillings, and pence, and I didn't understand the, the, the, the dollars, the currency here, so this was his, his birthday gift.  So we had a, our first child.  And then, of course, I had the daughter after that, Sharon [Pulliam Faulkner].  In 1963 Sharon was born.  And then the surprise child was my, was eight years after that on the very same day.  On the third of February I got up that morning, put the cake out, went and got the gift for my husband and my younger son, and my son, well, my oldest son--got their gift and put it out on the, on the table and do everything and went in labor and had the other son [Warren Pulliam] on his birthday.  So that's--.
Speaker 1: So when you came to Baltimore in the '60s [1960s], what were some of your impressions of the--you know, the Civil Rights Movement was kind of underway, that kind of thing.  What was your view--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, because it was in the '60s [1960s].  It was in the heart--I mean I wanted to go march with [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr,], but I was pregnant.  I had this big, this big stomach and for--I couldn't go walk.  But I was, I had started working right after that year.  I, I, I went, I tried to get into nursing schools to finish up and found that it was quite difficult--because I wasn't quite aware of the racism and other things.  I applied to [The Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland].  Well Hopkins wasn't about to bring me in, but I didn't know. I applied, you know.  I applied to different places.  Nobody responded in half of the, the places.  And then I called the State Board of Nurses and she suggested that I, that I go to Baltimore City Hospital and meet with this lady by the name of Miss Pike and, and she would look at my nursing background history.  And, and so with that I was able to get into their licensed practical nurse program that they had there without having to take all the exams and stuff to get in because of my background.  And so I in 1962 I graduated and got my licensed practical nurse's license.
Story_ID: 11315
Speaker 1: Just going back a little bit when you first moved to Baltimore [Maryland] in the '60s [1960s], can you just kind of tell me a little bit about, you know, what your impression was just in terms of the segregation and that kind of thing 'cause that had to be something that was not familiar to you.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The thing, the begin--the first thing that I noticed:  I didn't see enough blacks in the fire department.  I didn't see enough of--remember my uncle was a, was the assistant chief of fire department then so I was used to as a little hanging out at the fire department and going down to my uncle and sliding down the pole.  So I looked to see that, and I didn't see but very few.  And then I didn't--and the police department, hardly any in Baltimore city.  And, and I grew up in a, in an island [Jamaica] where my doctor looked like me, my dentist, my police officer, everybody.  So one of the things that I think that, that when people talk about people from the Caribbean and people in terms of their pride about who they are--you see, they've always seen people like themselves in position of power, you see.  And so it's, it's, it, it's kind of hard when you--you can always see the absence of yourself.  And I saw the absence of myself or people that look like me in many of those place that I--and that didn't sit too well with me.  As a matter of fact I think one of the first debates--I went to, I went to work at Bon Secour Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland] after I left Baltimore City Hospital.
Speaker 1: And you left Baltimore City Hospital in about 1967?
Speaker 2: 1966, somewhere about there.
Speaker 1: And then you went to work where?
Speaker 2: At Bon Secour Hospital.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: B-O-N, S-E-C-O-R [sic], two different words, Bon Secour Hospital.  I think I took a--I, I probably worked for about two months at Church Hospital [Balitmore, Maryland] and thought they were racists.  And so I immediately left and went to, and resigned and left and went to work at Bon Secour.
Speaker 1: You were saying one of the first debates there at the hospital--.
Speaker 2: One of the--well, I met a nun who was, who was on faculty at Notre Dame College [of Maryland].  And there was a panel discussion on racism.  And I was very opinionated about some of the racist situations that I had, had seen.  And she invited me to speak on the panel.  And believe you me, that was back in, probably in, in about '67 [1967], and I still have those glasses in my china cabinet that they gave me as a gift for having spoken on that panel.
Story_ID: 11316
Speaker 1: What was your husband--did he try to prepare you at all for how the U.S. was very different?
Speaker 2: No, no, my husband told me that if I marry him and came to United States, he would give me the world.  He never prepared me for what--and I guess he was young, too.  I mean, you know, I was twenty-one and he was twenty-two when we were married.  And so he didn't really, he, you know, he probably--and probably not having the kind of exposure, too, probably didn't know what I expected.
Speaker 1: Right, and could his interpretation of the world have been very different from what yours was?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  Mine--my world was different.  And I--the joke I always tell my children is that, you know, I had nice heavy winter coats and well-lined boots in England and my husband told me, he said "Don't take all that stuff with you."  He said, "Leave all that stuff.  When you come, I'll buy you all the stuff that you need."  And then the first day he took me up to buy me a pair of boots on Pennsylvania Avenue, I never forget that.  We went shopping on Pennsylvania Avenue and by the time I came home and put the boots on, water came all the way through the boots (laughs). You know, that was my first--I said, "And I left all my good stuff in England" (laughs).  But that was my, you know--and then I had to roll with punches and realize that I was, you know, I was in for a very interesting life.
Speaker 1: And what were your parents' thoughts?  How was their new son-in-law measuring up in their eyes?
Speaker 2: Mom [Stella Calomathi Barr]--well, they didn't meet him until about seven years after I had been here in United States is when I finally took him home to meet them.  My dad [Horace Nathan] never liked the idea that I got married to this man over there.  My--and she, he was never really that crazy about my husband.  My mother, however, is the kind of person that is she embraces.  And, and so she, she loved him.  She actually loved him.  And so he eventually, you know, she accepted him.  And, and my mother traveled so she came back and forth to visit me and visit the children and, and that.  So they developed a very good relationship.
Speaker 1: And what were your in-laws' impression of you?  Were you like the, the first person from like a Caribbean island that they had met and--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, yes, and--.
Speaker 1: But I'm sure you were a different kind of black person, too.
Speaker 2: And they, so they, they embraced me.  His mother loved me.  His father embraced me.  Never could pronounce my name right.  He called me Shelley.  That was another problem I had, too, because, remember, I'm coming from--I, I when I got here, I had a mixture of a Yorkshire accent and a Caribbean accent mixed together.  And so I had a--this different pronunciation of words.  And so when the--as a matter of fact when my husband picked me up at airport at--it was, which is now [John F.] Kennedy [International Airport, New York, New York]--it was then--what was it's name before, I forgot, before it was Kennedy?
Speaker 1: Idlewild.
Speaker 2: Idlewild.  And so he came to pick me up at the airport and he a friend with him and--to help him drive the car back.  And I didn't know that Baltimore was almost three hundred miles away from where I was.  I thought it was just about 'round the corner.  So needless to say, I'm nine months pregnant, eight, eight and a half months pregnant, I'm ready--you know, I'm big.  I was right about eight months.  I couldn't quite eight, probably seven and a half to eight months, but I was getting there.  I was very big and uncomfortable.  And I had traveled a ten hour flight from London.  And I get here.  I'm tired, I'm worn out, I'm, you know, edgy.  And my husband comes with his friend and they got me in this car and then I find out that I got another almost three hours' ride, three to four hours' ride back to Baltimore.  I was really--by that time my feet were swelling and I was really getting miserable.  But the guy that was, that was helping when I ask him, when he introduce himself, he said his name was Abbot.  And what I heard I thought was A-B-B-O-T, Abbot.  So, it was a couple months after I was in Baltimore that I saw his name written.  And I said your name is Albert, you know, because he--Abbot, you know, he doesn't say A, so that's some of the things that I had to get used to.  And even as a nurse giving medication, I had to re-, remember I'm dyslexic still, so, you know, I still have to double check everything.  But one of the things that I discovered is that many of the patients in their pronunciation, especially African American that came from the South, I didn't quite understand, and I'm sure they didn't understand me either.  So I would ask, "What did you say?" and "What did you say?"  But their pronunciation of their names--so I learned very early that I had to read those name bands and read them twice and double check everything before I gave any medicine (laughs) because I couldn't understand what, you know, their pronunciation of their names.
Story_ID: 11317
Speaker 1: Were you fulfilled with your nursing career?  Was it all that you had hoped it would be as you, when you dreamed of becoming a nurse as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, initially, not, no, not when I came here.  In England I was very fulfilled.  I loved psychiatry.  I decided I was going to stop psychiatry though and to start helping the patients look for atomic rays (laughs).  I decided that maybe I need to change it.  But, anyhow, when I came here, when I, when I came here working as a licensed practical nurse was not quite what I had intended.  So after I train other nurses when they come in and train new RNs [registered nurses] coming on and then I have to step back and let them be in charge and making less money, I started getting very restless.  And so in 1975 I decide--well, no, not 1975, 19--Warren [Pulliam], Warren, my youngest son, was born 1969 and that's when I decided to explore going back to school.  At that time I discovered I had to bec-, I had to take my GED.  They wouldn't accept anything that I had.
Speaker 1: Because you were in the United States--?
Speaker 2: Different--yes, I had to take GED [General Educational Development], I had to take a lot of the things all over.  So I went to Edmondson High School [Baltimore, Maryland] at night to refresh, took some refresher course and took my GED.  And in 1970 armed with my GED I--I always drove past Baltimore City Community College.  And every time the car, my husband and I would drive past in the car, I would, I would silently say, "Oh, I want to go there.  I want to go there."  And so one day, armed with my GED I walked in and registered for class.
Speaker 1: In 1970.
Speaker 2: In 1970.  And because I had now three babies and working, I only took, I started off by taking three credits and then six credits and then nine credits and little by little.  And it took me--I think it was 1973 before I, I went into the nursing program.  And then I challenged the first year.  I, they, you could do what the CLEP [College Level Examination Program] for all the things, the CLEP exam for all the things that you, that you know.  And then--and so I took the CLEP exam and so that took one year out of the nursing program.  And then so I graduated in 1975 from, from, with an associate of arts degree in nursing.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like at Baltimore City College?
Speaker 2: They were good.  I had to work hard.  I mean let's face it, I was juggling a ba-, you know, I had these three babies that I had to take care of and working there.  It was--I got on very well with the faculty.  As long as you did your work, you know, and study.  Even though I have to set up till two, three o'clock in the morning to get the papers done, I got them done.  And then I was named--I got my first 'Who's Who in American Junior Colleges'.  And so, and that--and before I graduated there I started the, the Nursing Alumni.  I created the Baltimore City Nursing Alumni and became its first president.  And--.
Speaker 1: What were your husband's thoughts about you going back to college?
Speaker 2: He wasn't too crazy about it because, remember, he wasn't educationally oriented.  But I was, I, I was pushing him at the same time to go back to school.  And so he, he went to Mergenthaler [Vocational-Technical High School, Baltimore, Maryland] to become an, an electrician.  And many nights he said, "I'm not going there."  I said, "You're going."  And so I said, "We got these kids to raise and you're gonna have a, you're gonna have a profession that you can take care of these kids."  And so when he finally graduated I felt like I had earned that diploma as well.  But, but I finished CCB [Community College of Baltimore] and then by the time I had left Bon Secour [Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland] I had gotten offered a position as quality assurance project coordinator, initially, and then it became a quality assurance coordinator at the Lutheran Hospital.
Speaker 1: What's the, what was the name of the hospital?
Speaker 2: Lutheran.
Speaker 1: Oh, Lutheran Hospital in Baltimore.
Speaker 2: Lutheran Hospital in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: 1975, the same year I graduated I was offered the position.  And I hurried up and left 'cause I had worked--about nine and a half years I had worked at Bon Secour [Hospital] and I did everything from charge nurses to staff nurse to everything, working in every department from emergency room, medical surgical units, everything.  So I had a rich experience.  And so I went over and, and this job was an administrative position because I more or less helped write standards of care, develop criteria for audits.  And it was about the time when they just started really looking at quality assurance in hospitals.
Story_ID: 11318
Speaker 1: How were you enjoying the administrative end of nursing?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked it because--.
Speaker 1: You weren't missing the hands-on?
Speaker 2: Well, I, well, because I was the kind of person that still went to the, I still stopped on the floors and still touched, touched, touch a patient or do things that needed to be done.  And if you're writing standards of care, you have to know about the care that you, that you're writing about.  So I didn't feel that I was that removed.  But, you know, I had a own, my own office.  I could, you know, function more autonomously, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so tell us a little bit--how long did you stay at Lutheran Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I stayed at Lutheran Hospital until for about--I worked--Lutheran Hospital was--became Liberty Medical Center--they merged.  In about 1986 I think is when they merged, those hospitals merged, or, or '87 [1987]--think it was '87 [1987] when they merged.  But, between that time I went back to school.  I went to University of Maryland [School of Nursing, Baltimore, Maryland] and, and got my bachelor of science in nursing and with that I was able to ride the first year of that nursing program.  I, I took an exam so I didn't have to do the whole time.  I passed the first, the first year.  Again, sat for the exam, paid 150 bucks and wrote the exam and then, and then I was accepted in the nursing program.  And, and it was a two-year program, what they call RN [registered nurse], RN to BSN [Bachelor of Science in Nursing] program 'cause I was already an RN.  So and I got my bachelor of science.  And then and that was a, an experience, too, you know, working in, going to University of Maryland in that setting.  The--because there were still, you still dealt with a little bit of racism in and different things and, you know, but I didn't let that bother me 'cause I just moved forward.  You know, I was gonna be who--and it was about that time that my marriage ended.  So I was going through a tremendous amount of stress because I now have three kids that I'm raising, my husband is gone, and I am, and I'm in nursing school with a lot of things and got a little bit distressed.  And with my--got on a plane and flew home, climb in my mom's bed, climb in my mom's bed, had a good cry and Mom [Stella Calomathi Barr] hugged me and, and then I went off to my dad [Horace Nathan] and visit my father that weekend.  And my dad reassured me that a high-minded woman is good for the life of any man.  And the man who didn't know it, didn't deserve me.  So I felt pretty good.  I got back on the plane, came back, graduate from, from, from University of Maryland.  And there was some rough, rough periods of time when you were the head, now head of household.  I mean I have days of crying and, and depression and how I'm gonna pay the bills.  The roof went up, the car stopped running, the hot water heater went up--everything happened at the same time.  But I took one step at a time and a friend--I'll never forget the morning when I was at my lowest ebb, a dear friend of mine, Bernice (Ranford-Lewis?) sent me a poem, and it's the one that "Foot-," "Footprints"--that's when, you know, that's when I carried you.  And when I finished reading that, I had a good cry, got up, brush, and this was like a little voice says, you've always depended.  You can, there's someone to depend on you.  You, you've been the one who's been carrying this family.  You can do it.  I got up and shook myself off and never looked back.  You move on and then enrolled in Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] and got my masters in administrative science.  Because about that time I decided I wanted to start my own business.
Story_ID: 11319
Speaker 1: I decided to run for the [Maryland] House of Delegates in 1986.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And what, what, what year are we talking--we're talking about 1986?
Speaker 1: Six, yeah, 1986.  And I ran for the House of Delegates.  I lost by a very narrow, narrow--my first time out, I had--but what I didn't tell you is that the period between '75 [1975] and '86 [1986] I probably served on whole lot of boards of directors.  I was active member of the, the, the Maryland Nursing Association, the Black Nurses Association, different organizations in my church, different community organizations.  And because of my involvement, I got very active in working on everybody's campaign.  If you, if your goals are my goals and you were running and you're a Democrat, Shirley worked on your campaign.  So I worked on the mayor's campaign, I work on presidental campaign, I work on the people running for the [Baltimore City] Council and for the House [of Delegates].  And so over the years I did that.  And then the last campaign I was working on was [Samuel] Rosenberg and I decided--Rosenberg and, and he was still a member of the House and [James] Campbell and they at, when--I, I think they did ask me then to--to join their ticket.  And that something because one was Jewish, one was Caucasian who lived in Hampden [Maryland], which is not a, which is a area that's somewhat not very receptive to blacks at that time.  However, I came on the ticket.  We ran the good, good race.  We were the CPR team--Campbell, Pulliam, and Rosenberg.  We were going to resuscitate the, the community (laughs).  But anyhow, I, I lost.  It was my first defeat.  I worked very hard campaigning, knocking on doors, getting--my mom [Stella Calomathi Barr] as a matter of fact, was here.  My mom was here helping, stuffing envelopes and working the polls right along with me.  So it was a, it was a good first time out.  And although I came in fourth out of three seats, there were many other people--there were probably about twenty-one people.  So everybody--that wasn't too bad for my first time out.  And I just kind of jumped into starting my own business.  And this--I got incorporated--my first company, which is Nathan's Network.
Story_ID: 11320
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Nathan's Network.  What kind of company was it?
Speaker 2: It's a healthcare company that there's consultation, education, consultation, and promotion.  And while I was working on developing the company, I got a contract to do, to do personal care services with the, the, the state [Maryland] and the city [Baltimore, Maryland].  And so I started using that company as the vehicle to which to do, to, to, to fill that contract.  And as, and it, as I was building the--that little business, I--I was still working as a nurse.  I got little bit disheartened--discouraged about different administrative changes that were occurring at Lutheran Hospital--Liberty [Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland], that's the time it was at Liberty--Liberty became--.  And so I decided to resign.  And--.
Speaker 1: And this was in 1987?
Speaker 2: 1987.  And I resigned and started working on my own business.  And what I did was I did private duties, I did, you know, I'll go to the [Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] and do private duty, I go to any hospitals that needed somebody for private duty.  I worked for agencies.
Speaker 1: So were you kind of like a freelance nurse?
Speaker 2: Freelance.  I did private duty, I work, I did what they call agency nurses going into different setting.  And then I started working part-time at Montebello Rehab Hospital [Montebello Rehabilitation Hospital].  I worked on head trauma and the spinal cord unit.  And I did those things in between to keep my income up and to, to do all the things that I need to do while I was building, slowly trying to get more patients to build my, my business.  Once I get the business built to the level where I could pay my bills, then I stopped working for, to the, for these other agencies.
Story_ID: 11321
Speaker 1: Back in 1986 when your unsuccessful attempt at a seat in the [Maryland] General Assembly, did you think maybe this isn't for me and--or did you think I'm, I gotta try this again 'cause I know I belong in that house?
Speaker 2: Well, mixed thoughts because in 1990 when the time came for me to run again, I had started a business.  And I gave it much thought.  Do I want to run or do I want to devote some time to get this business off the ground?  And while I was trying to make up my mind, the then [State] Senator Barbara, Barbara Hoffman had, had me for lunch because Senator [Delores] Kelley was now my senator.  But she came in fifth on the first time we ran.  She came in behind me.  And so Senator Hollen--Hoffman, I mean, wanted to make sure that I didn't run again.  She didn't think there was enough votes to support two black candidates in that area because it was predominantly Jewish and Caucasian and not enough African American votes.  And so she took me to lunch and asked me not to run for that seat this year, that year, but to run for the Democratic State Censure Committee.  So--.
Speaker 1: And what year is this, Delegate?
Speaker 2: That's 1990.  So I ran for the Democratic State Censure Committee and I won, and which forms the board of directors of the Democratic Party.  And right after that I was named by Mayor Kurt Schmoke named me Social Service Commissioner.  And, and, and so I, so I served in those two positions for four years.  And then by the time it was 19-, 19--for four years, but in 1993, the area that I lived was redistrict and once it redistrict I had the opportunity--I said, A, there's no incumbents in a new district so I am going to run.  And so I started making plans to run.  And, you know, and the funny thing if I can back up a little and tell you when I first decide I was gonna run, I went around and talk to different people who ran campaigns and I said how much do I need and what money I need and what I need to do.  The first guy I went to told me I need ten thousand dollars.  I said if I had ten thousand dollars, I'd go invest it in the stock market.  That's what I said then.  So I went on about my business and I went on a--I won a trip to Europe.  I went to Germany--.
Speaker 1: How did you win the trip?
Speaker 2: It was a fam trip.  Like names were put in--somebody put my name in and they pulled the names and my name came up.  And it was a, it was a fam trip to Germany, Holland, and Belgium.
Speaker 1: And what's a fam trip?
Speaker 2: It's a familiarization trip so you can familiarize yourself with these countries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you could tell the word out to other people to go there and visit.  And so I won the trip and I went with twenty-nine other people on the tour.
Story_ID: 11322
Speaker 1: So I went to the fam [familiarization] trip and, and, of course, had a great time visiting Holland and going on the MS Amacita and traveling up the Moselle [River] and Rhine River and, and going to see Van Gogh Museum [Amsterdam, Netherlands] and, and Rembrandt [House] Museum [Amsterdam, Netherlands] and the, the, the Bruges [Brugge, Belgium], the City of Lace, and the Ahr Valley [Germany], and, and also the Antwerp [Belgium], the Diamond City, and, you know, had dinner in the Bellesil Castle (ph.) with, you know, with the all the harp playing, had a wonderful time.  But while I was doing all of this fun things and I came back, I, I can, while I was traveling up the Moselle and the Rhine I was thinking I'm gonna run for this office.  It would just keep coming back.  So when I came back I had fifty dollars.  I took my fifty dollars and I went to the store and I bought some hors d'oeuvres and some little, some crackers and cheese stuff, and some punch.  And I invited some friends over to my home.  And I got a flip chart and I put my goals and objectives on the flip chart.  And I had a little gathering in my living room and I told them that I'm gonna go over my goals and I'm gonna go over the organizations that I've worked with.  I would served on the House of Ruth, which is the, for, for battered women, the battered women.  And while I was serving on the, the House of Ruth board, you know, I just, I, I gave them all these things that I've done in the community.  And I said if you think I'm the kind of person that you'd like to, to represent you, then take your checkbook out and write me a check.  So, I got my first thousand dollars that night.  And it was no stopping me after that.  And so--and that was how I first started.  So, of course, my name was already out there.  Still had money, when the next race came around, I still had money in, in an account that, political account that had been set up, so I had a little bit to start on in 1993.
Speaker 2: So what was that friend, well, the advisor that you had spoken with earlier--was he right?  Did you need ten thousand dollars to run a campaign?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: About how much would you say back then you needed to run a campaign?
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I raised probably when I ran the first thing, I probably raised about twenty thousand to run the first time.  But the--I, you know, you didn't need it to start, you needed to raise it, but you could start without raising it, which is not what he told me.
Speaker 2: And you started with fifty dollars--.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to raise it.
Speaker 1: They--exactly, my own fifty dollars.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I never did give myself, pay myself back that fifty dollars either.  But anyhow, out the campaign funds, I meant (laughs).  And, and so that was really the, the thing that--the other thing that really peaked--back up a little bit.  The thing that kind of peaked my--as a young woman I went to Saint James Episcopal Church in--here in Baltimore [Maryland].  And then I moved.  In 1966 we bought our first home as well.  And at that time there was a church, Saint Bartholomew's, where I go now.  Saint Bartholomew's Episcopal Church was closer.  And I noticed that when I had not showed up at Saint James no one had called to find out what happened to me or why I wasn't there.  But my neighbor, who was a Caucasian female who was from Bermuda who I didn't realize that I integrated the block, came up to meet with me and offered to help me and, and, and that her son could help me baby-sit--very nice lady, Barbara Keane died not to long ago.  But so Barbara went to Saint Bartholomew's and she said, "Shirley, can you, will you come to church with me and bring the kids?"  So I brought the kids and I went to church.  And the, the rector then was Jack Malfus (ph.) and he said--.  I didn't come to church about--I came for about two Sundays and I didn't go back.  I went to going back to Saint James.  And then he called me wanted to know where was I and why didn't I bring the kids.  I was so impressed that this guy took the time to call and find out about me and my children that I decided to join Saint Bartholomew's.  And since 1966 I've been at Saint Bartholomew's until now.  So that's how I got there.  But the reason why I told you the story is that in the mornings we would have adult classes.  And then there would be discussion on, on education issues and different political issues and policies that run the country.  And I was very fascinated.  Because I always felt like was something that was missing from my life, like I wasn't fulfilled, like it was more that I wanted to do.  But I didn't understand.  Remember, I came from another country, different cultures.  I had to go through a lot of cultural changes.  And, and so I, but I would listen intently to their discussion.  And after these discussion, I discovered pretty soon that I was a liberal Democrat and I wasn't a conservative Republican as some of the, them were in the church.  And so I determined who I was at that point.  And then I started joining in to the discussions.  And then I became a debater in the discussions, you know (laughs).  And so, so, needless to say, by the time I started getting active in working on other people's campaign, I was halfway there, really.
Story_ID: 11323
Speaker 1: You were thinking, okay, I'm gonna run for this seat.  And what was it that finally--well, and you had, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well, 1993 I decided.  It was 1993.
Speaker 1: 1993.  And you had raised money.  So tell us a little bit about what that campaign was like and what was different about than in 1986?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll say what was different about it was that there was, it was a new, brand new district and there were no incumbents.  And remember Senator [Delores] Kelley that I mentioned to you, she was then delegate and she moved from Baltimore City [Maryland] into Baltimore County to run as the senator because this--the district had been redistrict.  And so I then somehow in our conversation asked or whether she allowed me to be on her ticket.  And, and so there were two other people on the ticket.  So it's three delegates and one, and one senator.  And so we formed a ticket.  We each ran our own individual campaign and then we came together before the election and kind of pool our monies and pool her for her brochures and for our mailing and for all the different things that we needed to do.  And we campaigned together knocking on doors and doing the different things, yes, and have lawn signs and, you know, the whole works.
Speaker 1: And did you run unopposed?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  There were about twenty-one other folks who ran, too.  A lot of folks ran.  But the more the merrier because then they dilute the vote and the ones who are the front, you know--.  And, and it was, you know, getting out and talking to the people.  And, and, and people trust nurses so it, it's kind of help--my theme was "the nurse for your political health."  And so, you know, and I gave Band-Aids and all kinds of little stuff out with my names, name on it.  I did, you know--and so it was, it was a, it was a good--that night we were victorious in, in November of 1994.
Speaker 1: And so tell us about what it was like for you when you first arrived at the State House [of Delegates] in Annapolis [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Oh, well, before I, I came, Senator Kelley brought me down 'cause, of course, she was a [State] Senate-elect at that point and she was a delegate.  So she, she brought me down.  It was after the election and after the primary, I think, after I won the primary election.  And we still had the general, but I knew that once I'd won the primary I could have, I would won the general because it was a predominantly Democratic district.  And so she brought me down here for something, and, and I had to come under the, under the tunnel--not under the tunnel, under the--we have a--the, the garage is underground.  And so as she pulled into the underground garage and she said, "This is where we park," you know, that you will be able to park, you know, when she, when she'll be on the Senate side but she still had a place in the House.  And when as I drove in her car into the, into the House, that's when it dawn on me, hey, you're gonna be a delegate.  You're gonna actually represent the people of your district.  And so the rest was history, of course.  And come November I won.  And then, believe it or not, my office there, that suite where my office was Sauerbrey--she ran for, she had run for governor, Ellen Sauerbrey.  She had occupied that office.  And the office that I have now Bob [Robert] Ehrlich, who is now the governor of the state of the Maryland, that was his delegate office, and he had just won the seat to [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: So what does that mean?
Speaker 2: So when I came in (laughs), when I came in, I had to--I couldn't move my things in because Bob Ehrlich had all his things still in the office.  So he had to come and clean his office out.  That was, that was when I first time I met him when he came to clean his stuff out the office.  And, and then I was able to get the office cleaned up and have them painted it and start bringing my stuff in, you know.  So I was all excited.  So I--by Christmas I had all my stuff in so that by time January came I was ready to sworn in.
Speaker 1: And what was the reaction of your children?
Speaker 2: Oh, my, my children were, were, were very supportive and very excited about, about it, you know.  Many times they feel I don't give enough time to them, that if I did, if I just quit and stop doing the stuff, I'll have more, they'll have more time.  But now they're all grown up so it really don't make a whole lot of difference now.
Story_ID: 11324
Speaker 1: And so once you, you know, arrived in the [Maryland] State House [of Delegates] and you got settled in your office, what were some of the issues that were most important to you that you were really clamoring, you know, chomping at the bit?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, the issues that I've always ran on, and I, and I ran on then was basic--I, I'd ran on a basic plan of care, health care.  Health care was always my big issue, and it still is.  I felt that, that in a country as rich and powerful as the United States of America, that no person should be, no person should, should be without a basic plan of care, basic health care.  And so I ran on it then.  Although we still have not gotten to that stage of having that, but I've worked continuously over the years to, on those issues to improve the quality of healthcare and to work on any programs that will allow--the CHIP [Children's Health Insurance Program] program that allow the children to have free health care, whatever I could do.  Those are the things that I worked on and championed.  I also champion drug treatment issues.  It was, it was very painful because my youngest son [Warren Pulliam] had become an addict.  And so I had to deal with the pain of a mother going through those problems with a younger child.  And so the--I think that made me fight even harder for drug treatment monies because I understood, not from, not only from the psychological aspect of what happen to an addict, but as a registered nurse I--I understood it probably better than most people did.  And so I came with those issues in mind.  And I know that there's a direct relationship to crime and drugs.  So my issues were crime, drugs, and education.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the bills that you either sponsored or cosponsored that you are most proud of?
Speaker 2: Oh, I've sponsored and cosponsored numerous bill, hundreds of bills.  But--.
Speaker 1: But which ones are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: --the first bill that I got passed I think was one that provided therapeutic community for drug addicts in the prison because they were locking them up and offering no, no, no treatment.  But didn't get enough money to do it all, but to say at least the last six months before they were released that they had to be in a therapeutic community and had to get some treatment and some aftercare.  The other one that I, I'm most proud of was my breast cancer legislation--getting 2.6 million dollars for low income women for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, and screen--the screening and diagnosis and treatment.  And then five hundred thousand dollars for oral cancer because African American male had one of the highest oral cancer rates and the state of Maryland was about the third in the nation in terms of oral cancer for African American male.  I was most happy.  I wish I had, could have gotten more.  I've championed many of those bills.  The bills most recently that I have championed--last year, 2003, I got the Health Disparities Prevention Act.  After the Institute of Medicine [Washington, D.C.] report on the unequal treatment, racial and ethnic unequal treatment that is given to, to blacks and other minorities.  Based on that, that information and that study--and it was not something that I haven't known.  I've been working on this issue since the '60s [1960s] and since this I maybe got more active with it in 1975 when I became a member of the--or in 1970 I should say when I became a member of the, the Black Congress on Health, Law, and Economics [BCHLE] and started my own group here in Maryland, the Maryland Black Congress on Health, Law, and Economics.  Simultaneously to that I founded the Black Alliance on Mental Health and that is still an active organization.  So in finding these organization and working--I was a co-founder of the Black Mental Health Alliance--and I've worked on, on the mental health issues and, and the, and the misdiagnosis of, of blacks.  And so I was always involved in those things.  So the passage of the Disparities Prevention Act was just wonderful for me.  Although they didn't give the, the monies that needed to do--but we're still working on putting all those pieces, pieces in place.  And then the passage of this year I had the first Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities created in the state of Maryland in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in statute.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And what does that office do?
Speaker 2: The office then will, will, will be charged to go--getting grants and raising fund to begin to address those issues as it relates to cultural sensitivity, cultural competency and health literacy.  To make sure because if somebody doesn't read at the level to which the instructions is given from the physician or others then they're not gonna be able to follow.  And as African American and other minorities, we have the highest mortality and morbidity rate in every disease that you can think of.  In the state of Maryland for cardiovascular disease alone African Americans are 28 percent of the population yet still they die at 66.8 percent.  And women cardiovascular disease is increasing tremendously, too, because now we start taking on a lot of the stresses and things that men had been taking on.
Speaker 1: And why do you think these disparities exist even still today?
Speaker 2: Disparities, if you read the IOM report or the Institute of Medicine report, which is a tremendous document--and what they did really in 2000 when that report was released--that stuff hadn't changed in a hundred and eight years, okay.  W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington in 1896 met at the 'Atlantic' expedition.  And at that meeting what did they had?  They talked then about the deficiencies in the Negro--in health care for Negroes.  And if you take the word deficiencies out and put the word disparities in and this is now 2004, a hundred and eight years, whole lot has not changed.  W. E. B. DuBois in his book that he wrote, 'The Souls of Black Folk', he also in that book talked about the declining health of Negroes immediately post-slavery.  And then again in one that he wrote--I think it was in 1906 on--it's called 'Health and Physique'.  And then we had the Margaret Heckler task force report in 1980 that's again identify over sixty thousand of, of minorities, black and other minorities, that die needlessly due to access and quality of care.  And then we have the [U.S.] Surgeon General report, and we have--then Maryland had their own 2010 report that was written in 2000.  Then Senator Larry Young who was here in this body in, back in 19--I think it was 1985, '87 [1987], somewhere around there, that create, started the Governor's Commission on Black and Minority Health.  They have a book in our library downstairs that says "Now is the time."  And with all of those studies and the data that has been there in over a hundred and eight years, not, we haven't come that far in terms of disease.  So we, it, it's a responsibility, yes, it's, it has to be on the, the patient or the recipient of care, but the--but also professionals, doctors and nurses and allied health professional, holds a responsibility as well to make sure that they give and that the person who they're imparting the knowledge to understands their disease process.  And so that's what the bill speaks to.

Speaker 1: As a nurse what perspective do you think you bring to the [Maryland] General Assembly?
Speaker 2: Oh, let--as a nurse and as the first--well, back up.  Beside being the first African American nurse ever to be elected to this body, there are five nurses in the, in the [Maryland] House [of Delegates], but I'm the first African American and the first Caribbean-born and, and more specifically, Jamaican, first Caribbean-born ever to be elected in the 360-year history of this General Assembly.  And so for those, for, for that reason I found, I thought I had a responsibility as a member of the Maryland, of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and as a nurse and, and, and a woman at that time still represented a large African American population, although I do have Caucasians and I do have a mixture of other folks--I don't lose sight of their health care and their needs, but I wanted to make sure that we look at this issue.  And my grandfather always said it was important to be at the table.  And then I just realized what he really meant about being at the table, okay.  Because I know for a fact that if I wasn't at that table sitting in the Health and Government Operations and I served on the Environmental Matters Committee before, if I wasn't there, many of the issues that I'm talking to you about would never discussed--from HIV, AIDS to hepatitis C to, to substance abuse.  You name the issues that I've brought before.  And anytime that I thought that racism played a part and we were not getting our point out, I made sure I spoke loud enough and clear enough that I was understood.  And if I had to get up on the floor of the House and fight for those issues, whether it was immigrant issues because I'm an immigrant, so I'm very touchy about issues that, that impact on immigrants as well.  Because I, I, I know the history of America and I know in fact that this country is a country of immigrants.  And so for which, regardless of what, which, which of those issues that comes before me, I fight.  And don't take on a bill unless I feel that I can put every bit of my energy into getting it to, to passage.  And the Children Health Initiative is another thing that I've been proud of.  I wasn't the lead sponsor but I was one of the sponsor.  I serve on the committee drafted and crafted that that provided health care to over a hundred thousand children in the state of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Poor children who couldn't afford--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Poor children that, that came in a little bit above within that poverty level.  If they were low enough that they're on medical assistance, then they would have coverage.  But those who fell within that gray area of poverty up to 200 percent of federal poverty would be able to get--200 and 250 percent of federal poverty.

Speaker 1: In Maryland's most recent election for governor, a Republican governor was elected, Bob [Robert] Ehrlich.  What were some of your thoughts on that 'cause it had been, you know, many, many, many years since Maryland--?
Speaker 2: I'm a, I'm a loyal Democrat.  And I worked like hell to make sure that he didn't get elected.  Okay, he is elected.  I, I supported Kathleen Kennedy Townsend for the next governor.  I am a strong Democrat.  I don't go back.  If I give you my word that I'm gonna work on your issue, I'm gonna work on it.  We lost that one.  But that doesn't mean that--you know, he's now our governor.  I will work with him in whichever way I can.  We have a, we have the first African American lieutenant governor.  However, as a person, again, who pay attention to what's happening in our state, I saw it as a tremendous loss because under our past governor [Parris Glendening] we had numerous secretaries that look like me, secretaries and deputy secretaries that control billions of dollars in the state that no longer control.  At this time under this governor we have, we have the secretary of juvenile justice who's African American and a Democrat, we have--we have the secretary of, of--oh gosh, I forgot his--.  There's another African American secretary that--I think it's--I've forgotten the name of the title, of his title at this moment.  But that is the secretary.  We have a special secretary for minority affairs and, and a few others in some position, but not anything to the level of what we had under the Democratic leadership.  We see the chief of staff were, the two chief of staff for the governor, were African American, two or three chief of staff, deputy chief of staff.  We had a secretary of health, secretary of correction, secretary of juvenile justice, secretary of higher education, secretary of budget and, budget and, secretary of budget management, secretary of--oh, secretary of DHR [Department of Human Resources], secretary, oh, I could go on and on in terms of--then we, we had a deputy secretary of state that was African American.  So there was so many African Americans who hold positions under that administration.  That was a first in the history of the state that I saw it as a loss.
Story_ID: 11327
Speaker 1: Do you think that you're a role model for immigrants?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think so.  I know for the Caribbean community, particularly, as my senator normally say, "She's an international delegate," because I work closely with embassies, Jamaican embassies, the other embassies.  I serve on a lot of Caribbean organizations.  I serve on the, the NCOCO is the [National] Council of Caribbean Organization.  CIO, the Caribbean--I'm a lifetime member of the Caribbean Intercultural Organization.  The Jamaican--I'm the founder of the Jamaican Association of Maryland.  I serve on the, the BCCO, the Baltimore Council of Organizations, Caribbean Organizations.  So, the, the, the Caribbean Carnival Advisory--so I'm very still involved in the Caribbean community and the community at large.  And so whenever anything happens in any of those islands--right now with the hurricane [Hurricane Ivan] has devastated all those islands--we're out now trying to see if we can raise funds to help those islands.  But, but because of who I am, I get called from Trinidad, from Jamaica, from Barbados, from, you know, Saint Vincent, whatever the organization, Guyana, whatever the organization is having something and need my help or want my presence, I am summoned.  And I feel an obligation to be there because I need others to see that if you become a naturalized citizen and you have the opportunity to move up, you have a responsibility to give back.
Speaker 1: And what's the Caribbean climate like in Baltimore [Maryland]?  I mean is there a large Caribbean population in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: It's, it's a good size Caribbean--it's not as large as New York and, and, you know, and Connecticut, and other, and other big cities, but we, between Baltimore and the Washington [D.C.] metropolitan area, there's a, there's a large Caribbean community.
Speaker 1: And is it like in other cities where many are still struggling with issues of poverty and, and becoming like integrated in the, the community and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, they come in.  If you're coming for--when you come to a country as, as rich as United States and powerful as United States, you come for opportunity.  And many of them are educationally-oriented.  So you'll find, regardless of who they are, that they're looking to, to gain another, a degree, and to, to better themselves educationally.  So you'll find a large number of them after they finish school at a different socio-economic status in terms of their income because they have that immigrant drive to succeed.  And so they work hard.  As the saying goes that when one drop dead, one Jamaican drop dead, that sixteen jobs come open.  There, it, it's just a joke among us because we, they work so hard in trying--it's--and, and if you look at the, the, the, the influx of the Caribbean community, they're not here that long before they buy their first house or, you know, or even if they're working two and three jobs to take care of their kids and do that.  So they're, they're, they, they're a good contributor to the tax base of, of, of the state and to the nation.  And so I, I don't see that population as a burden.  Very rarely you'll find--they would have to probably become ill or mentally ill or physically ill before they become a burden to the state.
Story_ID: 11328
Speaker 1: And there also has been some association, drug association, drug trafficking with the, some Caribbean immigrants, more particularly Jamaican.  So you think that that is an unfair label or--?
Speaker 2: It is definitely the unfair label.  The, the reality is that Jamaica don't own any ship or that brings that--they don't own the ship, they don't grow, they don't--I mean, yes, we have marijuana or ganja that grow in the island.  They don't have cocaine.  They don't have all of that stuff.  So the fact is that since they don't own it and since they don't own the banks and since they don't own the places to launder these monies and do all these things, the, the, the fact that--the problem is bigger.  And when you're looking at small islands and people that are struggling to live and survive, then they're gonna do whatever they can do to survive.  Not that I am in--I, I'm definitely against drug trafficking all the way.  But I can see how it happens and how, and how small islands can be labeled.  But the problem is bigger.  The problem is much, much bigger than, than those Caribbean islands.  And, and when they were doing the piece on 'The Posse', I was one of those who led a, a big march on Channel 13 [WJZ-TV, Baltimore, Maryland] and we did our own program to, to show--.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.  What was the, the posse?  What is their characterization?  What does it mean?
Speaker 2: 'The Posse' was at a time when they were having a lot of drug trafficking and, and killings and things that were going and they were, they were blaming it all on the, this, this, this Jamaican posse.  And, and what they said that they were calculating and they were, they were harsh and they were, they were well organized.  And, and I, I dare say whatever they do, whatever Caribbean immigrants do, whether it's, it's good or bad, they usually very, very well organized.  So, all you can say is that, you know, although I'm, I, I'm not in support of, of any aspect of that and I believe if they do wrong, they need to pay the price for, for whatever, whatever they've done in, in terms of that, but they're not the only one.  This--this whole issue of drugs is bigger and wider.  If America, a powerful country, can't stop it from coming to the borders and having--Baltimore City alone we have over sixty thousand addicts.  We have, we, we have more addicts than we have drug treatment slots.  If America can't deal with it, what you can imagine happening to those small countries.  And one of the things that have happened because of the, the drug situation, a lot of those people get deported.  If they're found, they're deported.  And so then the islands are, are loaded with people that deported that come home that rarely have no families.  Many of them come to this country when they were two years old with their parents and have lived here all their lives.  The parents never bothered to get them a citizenship.  And so at eighteen they get into trouble with the law, they get a probation before judgment, and the next thing you know they are deportable.  Under the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Discrimination Act they are immediately deportable.  And so you find a tremendous amount of them being deported back to countries that they have no family, have no ties because really they're Americans if they been here since they were two, one and two years old.  And so it has been, it has create a tremendous hardship on many of those countries in terms of increasing crime.  And because they're angry and so the crime is increased in, in those countries.
Speaker 1: And what do you think should happen when, you know, someone from another country commits a crime here in the United States?  What do you think should happen?
Speaker 2: From another country.  I mean if they've been here for, since they were two years old, the, the fact is that we need to look at the immigration system, the, the--the, the system, the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] system--it's, it's now under the [U.S. Department of] Homeland Security.  So you really need to look at the system and look at the reasons why people come and why there are illegal people.  The, the process is so long, many time people come and they're here on different visas.  The visas expire while they're still trying to get, to get permanent residency.  And when they get permanent, even to apply to get their citizenship, it takes a long time.  And they have increased the fees so high that it make it difficult, really difficult for many of those people to acquire their, their, their legal status.  So although, again, I don't condone ille-, people being here illegally, I do understand how it can happen.  And many of these children, when they go to school here--they went to elementary, they go to--because there are federal laws that protect them.  But then when they're ready to go off to college, they can't go.  They have to pay out-of-state tuition.  And then that's why that we have a legislation trying to address that in the state of Maryland that has not yet passed.  The last one passed the [Maryland] House [of Delegates] and the [Maryland State] Senate was vetoed by the governor.
Speaker 1: What kind of legislation?
Speaker 2: It was legislation really that would say that they could go off to, to college, that they intend, that they would apply for their citizenship at that age and that they would be able to, to pay the same in-state tuition rate because most of them, their parents have been taxpayers for a long period of time.
Story_ID: 11329
Speaker 1: Do you make it back to Jamaica often?
Speaker 2: I, I used to go home much more often before my parents died.  I, I--when my parents were alive, I made it home at least three times a year.  Now I try to get at least once a year.  I do have two stepparents.  My stepmother [May Nathan] is, is about ninety-, ninety-two, and I think my stepfather [John Barr] is about ninety-three.  And so they're still very precious, and I do go back to see them and visit.  And I have, I have one brother that's still, that still lives, that lives at home that I have the opportunity to visit.
Speaker 1: And how has the island changed over the years?
Speaker 2: Well to highlight, I mean, let's face it.  It--when you go there, you, there's anything you can get in America, you can get in the islands.  I mean that's basically it, you know.  There are people who choose to live and--personally, most folks who come to United States after they're here for a while would rather be back in the island to which they have because the quality of life and the, and the old cultural piece is so rich.  However, once they, because of the socio-economic status and not being able to find a job to support their family at the level that they want to travel, they literally get trapped.  For a long time I was trapped.  And one minute I want to go home, one minute I'm here, one minute I'm there.  And many people find themselves torn for a long period of time.  Now I've gotten pretty well into the country.  I've been here for over forty years.  I've raised three children.  I'm a grandmother of five.  I've, you know, I have a root here in terms of--and there are things--and I as an elected official I, I see things and view things a little bit differently from the average person.
Speaker 1: Do you think sometimes, though, that life may have a little bit easier if you--had you decided to go back home when you were looking at some challenges as a young mother of three who was recently divorced, that kind of thing?  Do you think it may have been a little bit easier?
Speaker 2: At that time, by the time I was divorced and I, in 1980, it would have been too hard--it would have been difficult to go back home.  The children have their own friends, they're older, they're--my oldest son [Wayne Pulliam] was getting ready to go off to college, my, my sixteen year old--I had a sixteen-year-old daughter [Sharon Pulliam Faulkner] and I had a ten year old dyslexic child because the youngest child [Warren Pulliam] wouldn't, the one that I've had problems with had been dyslexic just like me.  So I--that was not an option at that time.  The option and the time that I would've probably gone home is probably as a much younger woman where I could've found the nursing positions and the jobs and lived the--the quality of life that I wanted to live probably with less, less stress.
Story_ID: 11330
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concern.  One of my hopes is that somehow we'll be get, we'll be able to provide the kind of treatment to reduce the number of, of young men and woman who are caught up in the drug, in the drug, in the drug culture and to be able to, to be able to see that they can get decent housing, drug treatment, counseling, decent housing, and a way that they can--and, and a job, a pay--a decent paying job that they can begin to rebuild their lives.  Because many of them end of with criminal convictions and once you have a conviction finding work and, and, and, and finding a decent way of life is so hard.  And that's why you have such a high recidivism rate.  And so, that's one of my hopes and dreams because it's affecting a large percentage of our population.  And it's not just African Americans.  There are more drug addicts in, in, in the Caucasian community.  The only reason why you hear it more in the African American community is because of the violence that goes along with the poverty and the, and, and how the, you know, the whole, the whole, what I could say, the psyche of, of, of the drug culture.
Speaker 1: And access to treatment facilities that are expensive and maybe out of state and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And access, yes, exactly.  Exactly, and we don't have any jobs to pay.  Many of the other folks, the Caucasian and other folks who have jobs or have families who are affluent who got insurance can send them away for some, for treatment or put them in different programs early on.  But when many times in the African American community by the time they're ready to accept treatment, they have alienated the family.  They have stolen everything that they probably steal.  They have either ended up with HIV-AIDS or hepatitis C or some other illnesses that have further devastate the, the, the, the families.  So for one of my hope is that I would live in my lifetime to see some programs put in place this is going to really address the needs of this population, truly the needs of this population all the way.  I mean there are some states that already doing a good job in, in, in, in reentry programs for, for folks coming out that have been incarcerated.  And for the, the laws to change that doesn't impose certain sentences on one group of people over another based on their, their choice of drugs--that I would like to see change.  And, and, of course, to, to make sure that there is a basic, a basic health care coverage for every human being.  It's their right.  It's a right, not a privilege that every human being should have health care, access to health care.  Those are my, those are my dreams and hopes.
Story_ID: 11331
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, Delegate, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Oh, what stand out most to me and what I'm most proud of is the ability to pick myself up, this little immigrant girl from this little island in the Caribbean [Jamaica], to pick myself up and to achieve my goals by getting the educational level, to be able to get an associate of arts, a bachelor of science, a masters degree with three babies on my hips--to be able to do that and then run for political office at a time when people were asking my senator why were you putting a Jamaican on your ticket.  To say that even in, in, in--there, there is, there is racism in--in every aspect.  And, and I wanted to say that that--when I get up on the floor of the House and I yell, "Mr. Speaker!" on a issue that I want to get my point across on, sometime I catch myself and I said, "Hmm, this little girl, born in Trelawny, Jamaica, made, went to school in England and the United States, and I'm standing on the floor of the House in one of the oldest state house in the country yelling 'Mr. Speaker!'"  Yes, sometimes I, I do feel that I have worked very hard and that is my satisfaction that I've been able to achieve those goals.
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person who tried, tried to make life better for her fellow man.
Speaker 1: And what do you believe or what would you like for your legacy to be?  And what do you think your legacy is?
Speaker 2: My legacy.  Give me an example, I don't know.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Like do you--your, your children, they worked with you down in the [Maryland] State House [of Delegates]--what, what will be here after you're long and gone that will still represent Shirley Nathan-Pulliam.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm hoping now for, now historically we've just now have a committee, a subcommittee named the Minority and Health Disparity Subcommittee in the House as a--as a part of a standing committee.  I mean its standing committee is the Health and Government Operations, but now we have a subcommittee that I'm chairing.  And even when I'm gone I hope that that subcommittee, that, that subcommittee will still be here with other chairs that will be able to, to look at these issues and just don't sweep them under the rug, but make sure that we look at the health care delivery for all people and, and, and, and not just health care--you know for me, another piece is that when I push health care, I let folks know that I don't think any less of educational programs or economic development programs 'cause I'm a businesswoman.  But at the, the--and, and the reason why--oh, you, we never even told you about my second business.  My business that I own, my, my second business is an adult medical daycare center [Extended Family Adult Daycare, Inc.] where I have the elderly and the disabled, okay, because having been a nurse going to these homes for all these years, I saw the needs and I saw the pain and I saw the hurt in these population of people.  And so I thought that if I could ever put all my little pennies together, I open up that adult daycare center, which I believe is first class.  It's beautiful.  It's a place that any elderly would like to come and spend the day and have their medical needs met.  And I, I, I did that because I just wanted to, to do something to, whether you're black or white or who or Indian or whatever you are, that I can do a little bit in increasing the quality--improving, I should say, the quality of life.  And, and so that's my aim.  And, you know, I, I don't--I can rest better when I think that my neighbor is going to bed with some food in her stomach and they're, they're not in pain.  And that's, that's me.
Speaker 1: And we, initially, we talked so much about all the different fruits in Jamaica.  I never asked you what's your favorite fruit.
Speaker 2: My favorite fruit is nesberry and, and it's a little brown fruit that is sweet as it can be.  A lot of people don't know it.  You'll have to actually go to Jamaica to see it.  But I love nessberry.  Mangoes I love, too, but nessberry is one of my favorite fruit.
Speaker 1: And is there anything else you'd like to add, Delegate Nathan-Pulliam, that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: Oh, just that as a grandmother of five--my own granddaughter did a paper the other day and she had to do a little research.  I mean, and she said, "Grandma, I didn't know you did that!  Grandma, I didn't know you did this!"  It, it, it--I smiled, you know, because it's a legacy is that--it's a rich legacy that I want my grandchildren to get a better understanding of the sacrifices and the things that I do because of them.  When I get up on the floor and I fight for rights, for, for, for issues, for abortion rights, and the different rights that I fight for, and for, for violence, for, for, for monies for, to prevent violence and abuse of women and, and, you know, family violence, and when I fight for the drug treatment--I'm fighting for those children.  I'm fighting not only for my five grandchildren, but I'm fighting for all those little lives that are out there.
