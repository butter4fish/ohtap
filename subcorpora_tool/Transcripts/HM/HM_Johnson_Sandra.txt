Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mom, Eugenia, E-U-G-E-N-I-A, Lorraine, Ford; well, maiden name was Swader; her maiden name was Swader, and she was born March the 26th, 1912, both are now deceased.
Speaker 1: Was she born in Texas too, in Tyler?
Speaker 2: She was born in Liberty, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a suburb near Kansas City [Missouri].
Story_ID: 175047
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your father's [John Ford] side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, unfortunately, I'm unable to trace the family on either side very far back.  But on my father's side, I know that I knew my, my grandmother, who was Ophelia Ford.  She lived, for the most part, in Texas, but in her later years, she lived in Chicago [Illinois], between Chicago and Los Angeles [California], where her children lived.  But we use to go and visit her quite often, matter of fact, every summer in East Texas.  And the main thing I remember about it was it was so hot, and that was before the days of air conditioning, so it was very hot.  And as soon as we got close to Arkansas and Texas, I remember those tall oil derricks, so that's a favorite memory.  And she lived on a farm, and Grandma Ford is what we called her.  Grandma Ford was a wonderful little petite person, but I was sort of afraid of her because every morning, or mostly every morning, she would go outside and grab a chicken by the neck, and she would wring that chicken's neck.  And we would have it for breakfast along with biscuits and all the other things that she fixed that were so delicious.  But I thought that was pretty serious business for Grandma Ford to, you know, kill a chicken like that.  So, you know, I was kind of leery of her.
Speaker 1: You were a city girl at the time, right?
Speaker 2: I was a city girl, yeah--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --growing up in Chicago.  I--no one I knew do--did this but her.  He husband, who was deceased, was, as far as I had been told, the principal of a school.  All of the family, the brothers and the sisters, including my dad, all were college graduates and most of them went also to graduate school and earned degrees.  They were mainly in the social work field, field of social work.  And it was interesting I'm told, the legacy is that the oldest would go to Chicago.  Many of them had graduate degrees from Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  And they would go to Chicago and work on their degree and work for a while.  And then that one would send for the next one until all six of them went through that process.  And it was through my father going to Chicago.  He didn't go to Northwestern though.  He happened to go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] graduate school, and that is where he met my mom [Eugenia Swader Ford], who also was at the University of Chicago graduate school.
Speaker 1: Now, your father's side of the family is unusual in the black community, not--
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: Because of the, you know, the high level of education--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the opportunity that they had.  And do you have any idea how the family got, got started on a path to that kind of achievement, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, not--
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about, you know--
Speaker 2: Except for the fact that my, I guess that would be--but my grandfather was, as I say, an educator, and he was principal of a vocational school in Texas.  And we have speeches that he has written in our family.  And, and of course his values, of he and my grandma, passed on to all six of those children, and they just--you know, it was almost like for my brother and I, there wasn't any conversation about if you're gonna go to college, or if you're going to be a professional person, or if you're going to pursue a career.  There wasn't any discussion about that.  It was all settled.  And I daresay that in my father's family the situation was much the same, you know, so that was a generation before that had also grown up with those kind of ideals.
Speaker 1: Now what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: John.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John, and he went to--
Speaker 1: John Ford, yeah.
Speaker 2: --as an undergraduate--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, your grandfather is a name I didn't have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: His name was John as well.
Speaker 1: All right, so he's a--is, is your father a junior?
Speaker 2: Yes, there're four of them now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: There's the grandfather, the father, my brother, and his son are all John Fords.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John L. Fords.
Story_ID: 175048
Speaker 1: Now did they have any stories in the family of how they got, how the family started and got together in the first place, stories about slavery or the aftermath of slavery, or being free people of color during slavery, or any, any of those kind of stories?
Speaker 2: Interestingly, in both my mother's [Eugenia Swader Ford] family and my father's [John Ford] family, we didn't have any meal stories about slavery.  We were always--and I'm sure we all emanated from, you know, slavery, but they, they never focused on that, and they didn't tell those kinds of stories to us as kids.  The only connection that we did have was that we had a lot of Native Americans, what we now call Native Americans, in our family.  So we were sort of intermixed, I'd say, with some of the Choctaw people who were migrating from Mississippi across Texas and on over to the Oklahoma.  So, those are the only stories, but we have no--I have no information about anything having to do with slavery--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on either side of my family.
Speaker 1: But any, any good stories, that side of the family, any, any stories that they'd tell around the table, or something about things that happened in the distant past that they, that, that, that were passed down through the family, stories, or songs, or you know?
Speaker 2: No, mainly we were very current and forward looking.  Our, the songs that we sang mainly were church songs, spirituals, hymnals, those kinds of things.  We always had a strong connection with the church.  And different members of the family and the aunts and uncles were affiliated with different, different churches possibly, but my family and I were Episcopal.  And I think that that didn't start in Texas.  I think that began in Chicago [Illinois], and it happened because my father somehow was affiliated with the priest of a very prominent church in Chicago.  And when he and my mom married, they lived with the priest and his wife for a short time in their apartment building.  And so they were very good friends, and I'm sure that's how they got to be in attendance at the Episcopal church in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now you, you--growing up, your family was a member of St. Edmund's [Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Episcopal--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago, right?  That's one of the--
Speaker 2: Yes, and I still--
Speaker 1: --prominent--yeah.
Speaker 2: --attend there when I'm in the city.
Story_ID: 175049
Speaker 1: Now, well, tell me about your mother's [Eugenia Swader Ford] side of the family.
Speaker 2: My mother's side of the family there were my mother and a sister.  And Grandma [Vassie] Willis came to live with us in Chicago [Illinois], and she was the main caretaker for me as I was growing up.  Her name was Vassie, and Grandma Willis was my very best friend, because she and I were so close, she was the person that fixed everything, if you know what I mean, when things went wrong, when things went awry.  She heard all the stories.  She taught me how to read, and she was just always there because my mom and dad always worked.  And it wasn't--it was, it was all okay, because Grandma, Grandma Ford--Grandma Willis was there.  And one of the things that I think that was so special about my childhood was the fact that our family was very, very close.  And my dad made it a point, because I guess being from a--I've gone back to him.  I'm gonna talk more about my mom too.  But being from a big family, I mean six kids in his family, he was used to getting together on Sundays after church.  And so when all of them got to Chicago, he continued that practice.  So he got the whole family together almost every Sunday, not always at our house, but with my aunts and uncles and so.  But we were together, and us kids had to sort of be accountable to all the family 'cause they might ask us anything, you know, about school or how are you doing?  Or have you been in any trouble this week?  Or, is everything going well?  And of course if there had been any trouble or anything, which there never was, woe be the person, the, the kid that was in any kind of trouble.  You know, we had to, we had to answer questions about things like that to our family members.  So, everything was kind of, with the kids, kind of on the straight and narrow.  And everybody had responsibilities and knew what they were, and you know, there wasn't a lot of confusion.
Story_ID: 175050
Speaker 1: But my mom [Eugenia Swader Ford], back to mom, she was very special.  And as I think I've told you, she has just recently passed, so I'm just real, you know, touchy when I talk about her.  She was very special, and she had been in her hometown the teacher of French and Spanish.  And she'd been quite a standout as a teacher because she was so young.  And when she came to Chicago, the story is told that her dad's friend was a fraternity man, and he knew that she was there, and she was single, and teacher and everything, didn't know anybody.  So he went to the fraternity house and to ask some of the guys who, young guys that were there, if maybe they would take this new person out for a date.  And this whole idea of a, of a, you know, schoolteacher coming from Liberty, Missouri, to Chicago and needing a date didn't appeal to them; that just wasn't something that they, anybody agreed to do.  But after some prodding my dad [John Ford] said that he would, he would, he would take her out on a date.  And so I guess she was contacted, and somehow she came to the fraternity house and met the older gentleman, who then took her to the room, I guess, or wherever it was where the, the young fellows were having their meeting.  And when they saw my mom, they all decided that they wanted to take her out on a date, but see, they had all said that they didn't want to.  But my dad, you know, stuck his chest out and said well, he was the person that was going to take her on the date.  And that was the beginning of their courtship, and they ultimately married.
Speaker 2: Okay that's a good story.
Speaker 1: So that's a nice story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Okay, so there, there, there aren't, there aren't any stories about--from your mother's family in Liberty, Missouri, about how, how things were, you know, way back or anything (unclear)--
Speaker 1: No, they didn't talk about it very much, and I have asked about it quite a few times.  But again, they talked about--because see, Liberty, Missouri, as I've learned in later life from Harry [Johnson], it's quite a historical little junction.  A lot of things happened around Liberty, Missouri, historically speaking, that my grandma [Vassie Willis Swader], who lived with us, must have known about.
Story_ID: 175051
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking about your mother's [Eugenia Swader Ford] side of the family.  And you said there was a lack of--
Speaker 2: Well, I had told--
Speaker 1: --information--
Speaker 2: --you a little story about my dad [John Ford] and mom meeting.
Speaker 1: And we were talking about the significance of Liberty, Missouri.  Now what is the historical significance of it?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, Jesse James and the James family and all of that, and you know, like it sounds to me like I just call it the "Wild Wild West."  I mean, but all of those things were happening.  And I hear, when I go back to Liberty to visit, I hear about, you know, the James brothers and all of those kinds of things.  But, and my grandma every now and then would talk about the, the cowboys and the Indians really, I mean, you know, sounds like an old cliche, but--so, all of that--
Speaker 1: Could she talk about 'em from her own experience and seeing them?
Speaker 2: Not so much though, I mean--
Speaker 1: Or just--
Speaker 2: --she, she didn't have any attachment to either one.  It was like, you know, she was, she was busy working.  And she did--
Speaker 1: No, I meant did she speak about cowboys and Indians from her own experience?  Did she actually see cowboys and Indians growing up or--and talk--
Speaker 2: She did see them, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but what they were doing or her involvement with them, she said that she, she's that--in response to questions, she's actually said that she was busy with her business, and, and they were busy with their business, and so you know, there wasn't--she never has told any stories like I would have liked to have heard.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your--didn't you have an ancestor named Jesse?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's Jesse Spader, right.
Speaker 2: Jesse Swader.
Speaker 1: Swader, Swader, right, right.  You think he was named Jesse because of--
Speaker 2: Could have been.
Speaker 1: --Jesse James being from, you know.
Speaker 2: Could have been.
Speaker 1: I just made, I just, when you said that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I just thought, I said hey, I just saw--
Speaker 2: Could have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Could have been, but I don't know that for a fact.
Speaker 1: That was a, yeah, some disputed territory.  There were a lot of violence, especially directed toward black people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on the part of--that's, that's where they were acting out, you know, the dramas, should this be a free state or a slave state and all that sort of thing, in those days, so.
Speaker 2: And as a matter of fact, that reminds me of something else.  My mom, as I told you, she lived in Missouri and went to school in Missouri up to a point.  But she could not go beyond a certain point in the--with her education in the state of Missouri.  She had to finish college in the state of Kansas, and so she went to the University of Kansas.  And interestingly, that is where I also wound up going years later, you know, just by a fluke.  So, but that was, now that's about the only hint that I ever had from, you know, passing on of stories that I had ever heard about any racial conflict, and that was in her education.  She went to, for a short time, to Lincoln University.
Speaker 1: In Jefferson City?
Speaker 2: In Jefferson City, Missouri.  And then maybe that is from, it was from that school that she had to go over to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] because they only went to a certain level at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Historically, during the Civil War, that was a real tough place for black people.  I mean it, I think there was a guy named Quantrell [ph.], "Bloody" Bill Anderson, the James brothers, and Daltons all rolled with the con--because of the ter--the--they had a con--a lot of terror going around in those day in that area, but I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, evidently--
Speaker 1: I don't know if anything--yeah.
Speaker 2: --evidently it was so much terror and so much--you know, one of the things that growing up in a city, I guess, I was always told is that we avoid confusion at all cost.  And if there is a rumble going on over there, you just be sure you're going in the opposite direction.  And so I think they really were like that.  If there was confusion, and there wasn't a lot I think in the way of newspapers, and of course there was no TV, so, you know, maybe they just stayed away from whatever was going on with things that we now know of as historical--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --events.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's hard to say--
Speaker 2: That could--I mean it--
Speaker 1: --but that was a--
Speaker 2: --could have been a very legitimate avoidance of all of that.
Speaker 1: It was the seat of like some [U.S.] Army renegades that would do things that the regular Confederate Army wouldn't do.  There's been a movie made about 'em even, you know.  But I'll--that's neither here nor there now I guess, but--'cause we don't know what specifically happened in your family.  But that area was a wild area at one time.  But, okay, so, can you tell me about how your, your--so your--oh, well, your mother ended up going to Chicago [Illinois] because of the school.  She was going, she taught, she was teaching school in Chicago, right?  She took a job--
Speaker 2: Yes, and decided that she was going--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to pursue another degree.  And so she went up to go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad had also gone up to go to graduate school.  But as things turned out, they got married, and neither of them finished their program they were working on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 175052
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us about growing up in the neighborhood that you grew up in?  And what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up around 61st and Champlain in Chicago, Illinois.  I must tell you it was totally wonderful.  As far as the sights were concerned, the people around were all African Americans.  We had the sub--the subway--the streetcar that actually went down 61st Street.  It was a major thoroughfare.  It was very, very busy with all kinds of small businesses.  As far as I knew, I wasn't really conscious of this, but it seemed as though they were all black-owned.  I could be wrong about that, but it, that's how it seemed to me.  In other words, the, the community right there around our house was totally black, and I would say now, black middle class.  All of the parents were very much like my own.  They were ambitious for their children.  They all had well-behaved children.  Well, there were a few renegades down at the end of the block, but for the most part--and they were mainly friends with one another.  And a lot of people don't believe it, but a lot of those very young people, kids I'll say, that I grew up with I am still to this day friends with.  We have kept in touch over the years, and we are still friends.  When I go back to Chicago, these are the people that I see.  And I recall living in that neighborhood until we were about--I was about eight years old.  By then my brother had been born.  The war was over.  Everybody was happy.  I, I remember back then that I thought that, and maybe mother even framed it like this, that now that the war is over, we could have a new baby.  And here came my brother, and everything was wonderful.  And I was at--during this whole period of time, from the time that I was about five, mother and dad had vision, I guess you would say, and had taken advantage of an opportunity for me to go to the Lab School.  So that was a whole different world.  It wasn't that far away 'cause I walked to school.
Speaker 1: I just wanna, just for the sake of history, this is the University of Chicago Laboratory School[s, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: An experimental school in this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --prestigious university--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a very prestigious private school.  And I was one of the first African Americans ever to attend there, me and four others.  And it wasn't, it didn't have anything to do with me.  It had to do with my parents, who were not so much sending me there or wanting me to go there, I later found out, in order to integrate, but they wanted: one, the best education that I possibly could have.  All the other kids in the neighborhood went down the street to A. O. Sexton [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], which is still school--standing there.  And they also got a very good education, I would say, and all grew up to be prominent mostly professionals.  So, but this was a different opportunity.  My parents [Eugenia Swader Ford and John Ford] also thought that the larger community could learn a lot from interaction with me and, and, and others like me.  And so it was going to be a two-way learning situation.  And when we went for the interview my mother told me very clearly don't open my mouth, don't say a word.  I was five and very anxious to talk.  I could read, and I had a lot to say.  See, I talked to grandma about a lot of things, and she and I had opinions and so on.  So, it--there wasn't any problem when I got to the interview.  I had to be interviewed.  I had to pass a test.  I don't know if everybody did, but I remember that I did.  And when I was asked a question, I wasn't at all bashful about answering.  And of course mother looked over, you know.  She gave me the look.  But it was too late because, you know, when I, I--I had always been taught when a question is directed, you look at the person and, and answer them.  And so, even though she had told me not to talk, here I was talking.  Well, at any rate, I was accepted.
Story_ID: 175053
Speaker 1: Kind of explain the physical location of University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to the South Side black community.  'Cause in those days, you know, we had a black belt community that was pretty much segregated off by housing practices and laws, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to where black people couldn't move out.
Speaker 2: De facto.
Speaker 1: But the University of Chicago was right in the middle of that.  Just kind of explain how that's situated.
Speaker 2: Well, no, it wa--it was, well, it was, to a degree, the black community was to the west of Cottage Grove.  Cottage Grove was more or less the dividing line.  We didn't too much live on the, on the east side of Cottage Grove, and that's where the University is.  And so all of that area, I would say all of the area, oh, it was, it was definitely very segregated.  And--but I will tell you this, my mother and dad and the other mothers and fathers of all of us kids knew exactly where to be and where not to be; that's how it was.  And the university, in those days, to the east of Cottage Grove was, there were not black people living over there until you got much further north that would be, much further north.  Because all the way up from Cottage Grove over to the Lake [Michigan] was whites and Jews, and that's where the, most of the children lived who went to the Lab School.  They lived along that corridor from between Cottage Grove and the Lake, and all the way further south--
Speaker 1: Like 47th north.
Speaker 2: 47th north maybe was--
Speaker 1: And then south, it--
Speaker 2: --was 47th going and north of that was, was possibly ba--black.
Speaker 1: Yeah, north of 47th--
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: --had black folks, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but all the way, I can remember that any part of, south of there was in any way black.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you what--I mean it was all white and Jewish.  I have a friend who, many year later, moved to around 67th and Merrill.  And when I spoke with her, I said what in the world are you doing over there?  And she said I live over here, and I could not believe it.  I mean I hadn't been there for some years, and as you'll hear later on, I had lived in Germany and moved to California and all that, and I hadn't been there for a while and known about, you know, where we had expanded to.  And of course, now there's, there's no place I guess on the Southside where we, where African Americans aren't--don't have residences.  But back then, no, it was not--the, the university wasn't in the middle of--
Speaker 1: Right, I'm sorry, I'm--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I'm thinking of today, but you're, you're right.  In those days, on the south end of it, it was open--I mean all of that was white--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and going all the way down.
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and pretty much on the north.  Now one of my very dear friends lived down around 35th, maybe, and Ellis, you see.  And so I know that further down to the north of the university possibly there were some black people.  But see, I didn't go--I--you know, people often question the fact, whether or not I even grew up there because my little world was so small.  I mean I was at 61st and Champlain, and school was at 59th and Kimbark, and, and, and that's the path that I took.  I really was not even allowed, if you will, to go too much beyond that.  I had friends that lived as far over as South Parkway--that's what we called it then; now it's King Drive--and church was over on Michigan.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that 61st Street, between 6--there were a couple--it was an ice cream parlor up on 63rd and Cottage, and all the kids went there.  And there was like the shrimp store that was on 63rd underneath the L and maybe Vernon or Eberhart, and it was black-owned; one of our friends owned that.  So it was like between Cottage Grove and State Street, and between 63rd and 61st, that was my, that was my whole world.  I didn't know it was so small.  But that's not to say, though, that we didn't have other opportunities and we stayed, but it's was when we left our area and say went downtown to the Art Institute, to the concerts, to the Goodman Theater, to all the museums over on 55th Street and downtown, and the zoo.  But we were accompanied by adults when we did that.  I was never, I was never just out roaming around, and I knew where I was not supposed to go and, and we all did.
Story_ID: 175054
Speaker 1: Now, you enjoyed tennis when you were growing up I suppose--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I loved it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you play in the Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] there or what?
Speaker 2: We played in Washington Park, but no, our tennis courts were elsewhere.  Our tennis courts, as I recall, were over on about 58th and Wabash.  There were some courts over there.  I didn't have too much involvement in Washington Park.  I don't know why.  My piano teacher was down on 60, 60th and South Parkway; that's where I went for piano lessons.  I had dance lessons down in the Rosenwald [Courts], 47th and Michigan.  And of course, though, when I went to those kinds of things--and I had activities.  I had drama lessons.  I went to the, to the, my drama lessons up on 63rd and I think it was Eberhart.  I had an actual drama coach.  And my mother thought that I needed to have lessons like that because she wanted me to be able to be a good speaker when I grew up.  When I was nine years old she sent me to Peter's Business College.  And as I recall, that was at 47th and South Parkway.  And that's, well, that--there was a big hub of African American activity down there at 47th and South Parkway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was near the Regal Theater, right?
Speaker 2: And that was near the Regal Theater.  I went to the Regal Theater only with my parents or with my friends' parents.  It wasn't something that I was supposed to just get on the bus and go there, you know.  I, I was, I was supervised and chaperoned all the time.  And in fact, though, one of the things that happened was that, when I was nine, mother sent me there, mother and dad sent me there.  I keep saying mother, but dad was involved in all these decisions too.  I was sent there so that I would always have skills so that I could always have a job.  And typing was something that they felt was an absolute skill that everybody should have.  And so I learned how to type.  I was very good.  And, and as you said, I played tennis.  I was well coordinated.  And, and it was very important, not only to study hard, and read books, and read the great books and all that sort of thing, but also to develop spiritually.  And we went to church every Sunday.  If you're too sick to go to church, you're too sick to have any kind of fun all week.  And, and then I also had athletics.  I was encourage to participate in athletics.  And I will say that, you know, in hindsight, looking back, athletics really I was, I was, I must say I was good at it, well-coordinated and all that, but it also gave me an outlet from my studies.  Because studies at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], even as a kid, were intense, you know.  And by the time you got to high school, it was more intense.  And by the time you got to college, it was so intense.  And so my little outlet, and the only thing that I really had approval for doing, was athletics.  I mean I was on all the teams.  I played volleyball, and baseball, and hockey, and basketball, and you know, year around, and swimming.  In fourth grade everyone at the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] learns how to swim.  And I was doing gymnastics and climbing the ropes and all those sort of things because that was, that just helped to make a full, whole person.  And that was, that was the intention for me.  That's what was planned and programmed for me.  And of course my brother came along, and the same was planned for him, except I, I think that he didn't get quite as much supervision as a young person growing up.  And this had to do with girls and boys.  See, back then it was a big to-do about girl, what girls can't do.  And even in my own family, my mother if I ask her about it, she--and my dad--they would probably deny it.  But there was a big dif.  I know that I was supervised a lot more than he was.  He could ride the bus.  He could go on the L.  He could go downtown by himself, and even when we were encouraged to get jobs--I always had to have a job.  See, at nine she's planning for me to have a job.  So, a job was okay, but the freedom that you would think would go along with all the education I was getting, that wasn't there.  And so, quite frankly, there were a lot of conflicts, because even though I finished high school when I was fifteen, I couldn't go out on a date.  I started college, you see, and I could--competing with boys and girls that were like eighteen, nineteen, 'cause they'd gone the full four years to high school.  And at the Lab School you know we, we finished, we finished tenth grade, and then if we passed the exam, we could go to college.  And I passed the exam, so I went directly to college.
Story_ID: 175055
Speaker 1: Let me ask you--backtrack a little bit and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --just ask you about the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].  Now you said it was intense and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was intense.
Speaker 1: --University of Chicago has a reputation for being intense and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and serious.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the Lab School, like who, who were teachers or that served as mentor to you there?  Or were there any that took a special interest in you?  You were one of the first--you, you're with a group of black students who were the first black students to attend the Lab School, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, and--but we all were not in the same grade.  And let me just go way back to say that when I entered in the kindergarten, I could read.  You know, grandma, grandma and I read together.  And so I didn't stay in kindergarten very long.  I was passed along to the first grade.  But in kindergarten, and I think it was pre-kindergarten, there were other back children, and then there was another one in the second grade.  So we were spread between pre-K and second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But as far as mentors are concerned, it, it's not like school is now at all.  There were small classes, so everyone, I would say everyone and all my little classmates feel as though those, that kindergarten teacher, the first grade teacher, the second grade teacher, they nurtured us all; they just, you know, it was such love, an kindness, and care going on.  And then I felt that there was, but even if there wasn't, I had such love, kindness, and care at home, you know.  I mean I was just the apple of everybody's eye, so I couldn't have stood anymore love.  I'm telling you, it was just--and in the fourth grade I remember a, an art teacher, because see, we're exposed to a lot of art along the way, you know, all these cultural things.  And this woman--there were no, there were no black teachers there.  And I didn't really realize; see, I didn't realize that I was all that different.  You know, I mean I was like everybody else.  The only difference was that when I was in either first or second grade I had a little brother, you know.  And my dad came to school one day and brought my brother, and he was show and tell for that day for me, my little brother.  So it was kind of like we're all a family here.  But in the fourth grade, this one teacher decided--told, she told me that I was really a great artist, and that made me very happy.  I wanted to be.  And so she had us make finger paint, do finger painting.  And now you know now that I, you know, am an educator myself, you can't make a mistake with finger paint.  You know, finger paint you smush aro--and, and for an art teacher, she can find something in that, in that finger painting to praise.  It wasn't like I was doing a, an oil portrait, you, you know what I'm saying.  So, she had us do finger painting, and guess what?  She put our finger painting results--pictures--in an art magazine.  I mean was that fabulous or what?  And my picture was there; my finger paintings were there; and my name was in this publication that went around to everybody in the school.  And everybody just--I mean it was a big thing.  Well, you couldn't have told me that I wasn't the next Van Gogh.  Now I know, but at the time, you know, it was little things like that along the way that boosted my self-confidence.  And by now I was also quite an athlete.  I mean even at a young age I was pretty good with athletics.
Story_ID: 175056
Speaker 1: But I had some rough minutes [at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], especially with that matter of history.  And one thing was, if I couldn't see some value in what I was learning, I really had a struggle with it, and history was one of those things.  And in the sixth grade--I've just recently had a conversation with one, with one of the other students who was in that group of five.  And he told me a couple of months ago that he had the same kind of problem with this same teacher.  And I still yet remember to this day, because when we got around to American history, there was nothing positive said.  And all of the--when he--we got around to the subject of slavery--I was the only black person in the room--and everybody turn to look at me.  We're in sixth grade now.  Everybody turned to look at me.  And as I--you just asked me, and I just told you, what did I know about slave--I didn't know because my parents, you know, the family didn't talk about that.  And so I'm wondering why they're looking at me, you know; this is really uncomfortable.  Well, every year about--and that's just about all they talked about, with regard to African American people.  Every year, now I, now that I look back, every year about the time that it got around to the Civil War and slavery, mother had to come to school because this, this, this--the teaching of history wasn't about much more than that.  And mother, I think, was trying to get the whole topic of African Americans and black contributions, and, and she would make it known that, you know, that you've really narrowed what these children are learning.  You know, let's tell the truth.  But I will say to you that even at this private, prestigious school, the history that we learned was sorely lacking.
Speaker 2: What, did they, did they--what value did they give to black people in, in the Civil War?  Did they just say that we were slaves, or did they comment any further on that or--
Speaker 1: I don't recall any, any positive things that were said--I'm speaking of history class.  Now I'm getting, as I'm telling you, I'm getting positive vibes from other teachers, other places in school, and other activities.  But as far as history was concerned, no; there wasn't anything positive that was said.  I didn't know about Buffalo Soldiers till I, till since I've met Harry.  And interestingly, isn't it, that I have, you know, I so enjoy his stories 'cause he brings people, my people into it, into the, into the telling of history.  And he tells me things all the time, and I ask him different things.  I will tell you, in college, history was one of the big topics that we had to pass.  It was more or less world history though, you know.  But, but we didn't learn history.  You know, we really--there wasn't a good done job done on the teaching of history.  I failed history.  I thought I was never gonna get a college degree.  I failed history.  And finally--
Speaker 2: At, at, at, at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yes, and finally mother said look, you gotta get over this, whatever it is.  Because obviously, if I'm doing okay in other things, I'm just, you know, I just can't get it together with history.  But I had such a block about the whole thing, because there was never anybody in it that did anything positive that looked like me, men or women, never, never.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 175057
Speaker 1: You graduated when you were fifteen by taking the test, really, and getting--and testing out--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as college material.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But that wasn't ex--that was expected.  That wasn't--you know, you might say well, that's, you know, that's really a feat, but it really wasn't.  I, I don't see it as such because we had been prepared.  You know, we--I don't say that anybody gave us the test or anything like that.  It wasn't anything like that.  But it's just that we were learning at a level that I just can't imagine not passing, and although some did--did not.  But see, I'd been there all the time.  Let me tell you, interestingly for, for educators, everyone in that school that I recall and that I've talked to since, was engaged in something that was called the reading clinic.  So, no matter what level you were reading at, you went to the reading clinic so you could read better, faster, and comprehend better, and everybody did it.  They had reading machines, and they put the page there.  And then the, the flap would come down, and you would have--you know, if you were reading at a hundred words per minute today, tomorrow you'd be reading at a hundred and ten because it, they'd speed it up, you know, so.
Speaker 1: You had to read, read on a scroll almost to, to--
Speaker 2: Yes, read on--
Speaker 1: --keep up, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, reading on a scroll.
Speaker 1: So they were, they were--
Speaker 2: And so everybody--
Speaker 1: --trying to pace your, your--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --speed.
Speaker 2: Everybody read well; everybody was encouraged to read.  You went to the library.  You didn't ask any questions about any of all of that.  We wrote essays.  I, I mean, we wrote essays, and we rewrote 'em, and we rewrote 'em.  And I thought that the English teacher was only picking on me, but all of my friends tell me that she put them through the same kind of paces.  It was really tough, but you just did it.  And you know, as I'm telling you, my parents didn't take any foolishness.  You know, there wasn't, there wasn't anything else I had to do.  I didn't even have to wash the dishes.  I had to do my homework.  And so, I guess now when people ask me who was my favorite, who was my favorite teacher, my favorite teacher, as it turns out, is my English teacher, who made--put me through those drills.  And I just, you know, I thought she was so mean.  Turns out, you know, thank goodness she did.  And I hope kids see other, you know, people as they're going through school as really caring.  She really cared about us, you know, to, to, to make us do it till it was right.  And so now, you know, I really; I love writing; I am a writer; I do a lot of it; and I think that's what sustained me in my friendships through the year, was, even before we had email and computers and all that, I used to write lots of letters.  And you know, my mother would even--I'd write letters to my mother when I went overseas to work, and mother would get out her red pen and correct 'em, and remind me of where the commas ought to go.  But it didn't discourage me.  That just, you know, it really helped me.  And by this time, I was so used to getting it right, you know, and the importance of getting it right.  So it's a wonderful skill to have, but it takes practice.  It really does.  And then, of course, reading.  I mean what will we, you know, what would we do without being good readers?  You know, that just makes life worth living, is being able to read well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't you think?
Speaker 1: Yes, I do (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know.  Yeah, you're a good--you're a reader too.
Story_ID: 175058
Speaker 1: But now, University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] is--you start there when you're fifteen, and this is in 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953].  Okay, and you're--well, tell us about the--was it--it's dif--it's more intense than the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] I guess on--
Speaker 2: It was more intense.
Speaker 1: --on some level, I guess.
Speaker 2: And then by now, you see, there are the social issues, and that was this: at that age, you know, all the other people around are--have a lot of freedoms.  They're, they're eighteen, nineteen years old for the most part, 'cause they've been to college--I mean to high school, full high school, and they're all the best and the brightest.  And they've come from all over the country and all of that.  And here I was, as I told you, confined to this little area.  I, I went other places.  I don't want anyone to think that I, you know, was really confined, but I mean on my own I didn't go too many places.  My dad [John Ford] took me where I was going.  I didn't date.  I mean that was unthinkable; don't even talk about it; don't even bring it up.
Speaker 1: Was it like that all through high school--I mean through ca--well, not all through college I guess.  It had to be--
Speaker 2: Well, not all through college.
Speaker 1: --a certain point though.
Speaker 2: I got a, I got a few little privileges when I got to be eighteen, you know, I mean a few.  The, the reigns were loosened a little bit, but not a whole lot, not a whole lot.  And the other thing, though, was that I was living in a very I'll say strict and structure--structured is a very, was a better word--household.  But at school, we were encouraged to discuss and think very openly.  I mean we were presented with all kinds of political philosophies and social ideas.  And we're reading the great masters, and many times they'd be standing there in person in our classes, you know.  And we really--
Speaker 1: Like, well, well, who, for instance?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the ones that I remember from high school, back in elementary school, was Langston Hughes.  And he came on occasion.  I think he was adjunct faculty.  See, I remember him 'cause he was about the only African American that came.  But in college, we had, well, as I told you, [William] Allison Davis, you know, was a prominent sociologist there.  There were others who, maybe, made an appearance--
Speaker 1: Was--
Speaker 2: --[HM] John Hope Franklin--
Speaker 1: He was in the history department at one point.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was he there when you were going to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, but he was never my teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, wouldn't that have been wonderful, you know.  I would have had a different outlet--look.
Speaker 1: What about St. Clair Drake or, or Hor--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --Horace Cayton.
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember any of them.  They might have been adjunct, but I don't remember of those, you know, those prominent people being on the faculty there.
Speaker 1: I think--
Speaker 2: So, but we had, we had outstanding faculty and so on, and we were, we were encourage to challenge, especially in college, we were encouraged to challenge the professor.  You know, once you've read what you've read, they might start the discuss--and we didn't have lecture classes.  They were discussion classes, and the professor would, would throw out something provocative.  And based on this, whatever chapters or book you had read the day be--the night before, you would, you would refute what he had said, you know, this authority, so to speak, you could refute what they said.  You could--but if you refute it you had to list your reasons why and all, so it was like debate almost in all of our class work.  And it was very challen--I mean I liked that.  But, of course, see, at home there wasn't room for any debate.  See, 'cause when dad said it, or mother said it, or grandma said it, that was it; you know, there wasn't any discussion.  So, you had this kind of dichotomy going on, where over here there's one set of rules, and in order to succeed over here at school, you know, you're very outspoken, you're very freethinking, you're very much encouraged to share your thoughts; whereas over here, you keep it to yourself, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --you think that's, looking back on that, do you, do you, did---have you decided to model your, your parenting in a different--well, you don't have any children, do you?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: No, right, right.  But do you think that's a good way for, for parents to raise their children?
Speaker 2: Well, it's okay.  It worked out okay for me.  It's just, you know, you learn to--because see, I was always gonna be respectful.  I mean, but there was a lot of confusion.
Story_ID: 175059
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and some of the personalities that were there and the people--
Speaker 2: Oh, and the fact that--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --home was one way and school was another.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We just--now--
Speaker 2: The expectations.
Speaker 1: Now you were in the--what, what was your major?  Your major was at the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Liberal arts at the U of C.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all the--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a background in liberal arts, and, and that was good because--well, look, whether it was good or it wasn't good, I was going--this, this was the expectation for me.  I mean my parents decided, and that's what I was going to do, and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So it wasn't--and that's, that was the degree that was offered.  To those in my status and category everybody got a degree in liberal arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the plan then.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you pursue art and dance and that sort of thing or music at the University of Chicago--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  The only thing I pursued at, at the school was, was sports activities.  All of those other things were just really to make me a more well-rounded person, you know, totally.
Story_ID: 175060
Speaker 1: I will tell you this, it's kind of a funny story in our family now.  The--you know, when you, when you take drama lessons and you go to the drama teacher, the thing that--you know, if you're really, really good maybe you'll be an actress.  Well, see, that wasn't acceptable.  You know, being an actress was not an acceptable profession for me at that time.
Speaker 2: As far as your parents [Eugenia Swader Ford and John Ford] were concerned?
Speaker 1: As far as my parents were concerned.  They were channeling me to be a teacher.  I didn't want to be a teacher.  I found out later that I liked it, you know, and I chose it later.  I chose it.  But see, there was these--and then there was dancing.  I was really good at dancing.   I was just very good at it, but being a dancer, I mean, was totally unacceptable.  And of course, you know, my grandfather owned the nightclub.  Well, that was too close for comfort.  When I got to be, you know, at a certain age and was really, really good at dancing, they cut off the dance lessons.
Speaker 2: Now those are the days of chorus productions in these nightclubs.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They had Rum Boogie in Chicago, the Regal Chorus Line, the Larry Steele's Smart Affairs, all these diff--these big dance groups--
Speaker 1: And I thought that would be a wonderful place to work, you see, but that was not acceptable.
Speaker 2: They were horrified (laughter).
Speaker 1: They were mortified.  And my fa--my grandfather owned the Archway Lounge on 61st and South Parkway.  Well, it just--you know, I mean, and, and everybody said oh, my goodness, you're probably go--well, you know, that would just make my parents just, you know, wanna jump up and scream.  And so, you know, ultimately, all those lessons got cut out.  The only thing that I, you know, probably was allowed to take on into college was piano lessons, 'cause I was learning the classics.  I really liked it, but I didn't like it was much as dancing or even theater, you know.  Theater was not easy because I had to learn long passages from different works and so on.   And that wasn't so easy, but I enjoyed it, you know, and I thought well, maybe someday I'll be a movie star.  But interestingly, too, as far as ambition was concerned, when I was--maybe before I was a teenager, the--my ambition was to be an elevator operator at Marshall Field's because they were so elegant. They wore--elevator operators--first of all, there were not any African-American ones, so I could integrate and be the first one.  And they were always well-groomed, beautiful hairdos, makeup, and they wore white gloves, you know, quite ladylike, quite clean and ladylike.  They conversed with everybody that go on the elevator.  They were very helpful.  And what could be a more wonderful work location than Marshall Field's?  And that was kind of a hub for our family.  You know, going to Marshall Field's was the thing to do, so.  Anyway, I mean this was when I was much younger.  So, that was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that was my first ambition.  Of course I outgrew that.  You know my parents weren't gonna let that linger in my head too long.
Story_ID: 175061
Speaker 1: Well, your parents [Eugenia Swader Ford and John Ford]--at least your plan seems to have given you the time to think about how you were gonna use this rich education and rich background, you know, as a career in the future, I guess.  And you had like, I guess, plenty of time to think about that, 'cause your school liberal arts--I mean there's no immediate, you know, immediacy--
Speaker 2: Well, I had--
Speaker 1: --to getting out, getting out and getting a job and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: You're right, I, I had time to think about it, but there was not a lot of--I'll just say there wasn't a lot of, of thinking about it because they had already decided that I was gonna be a teacher.  And I was pretty much determined that I wasn't.  So therefore, what was I going to do?  You know, and I had to figure out and find out what, what--where are my interests?  And of course, in a school like this, where you're learning so much about so many things, and the coursework is so intense, I liked a lot of things.  But when it finally came down to it, when I went to get a job when I was nineteen, the thing that interested me the most was psychology, you know, how does the mind and brain work?  And so I pursued jobs in that category.  Being nineteen, you know, there weren't a lot of places to work, although I had two--I had several opportunities, mainly because every year during my college years I had worked--again, I was the first black young person, college student--to work in a summer program at the People's Gas Company.  This was commodities that was located across the street from the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And they had sought out young people like myself to be keypunch operators.  And this is the front end of computer work, and this was in the '50s [1950s], see.  So, I had learned--remember, I had gone to Peter's Business College.  I could type very well.  By now I'm typing very well.  And I won every year--they had a little competition in, in the keypunch operators and who did the most or something, and every year I won.  At the end of my college study, they offered me a, a job with the gas company.  And that just wasn't what I had in mind for myself.  I really didn't know what I was gonna be doing there, 'cause I didn't wanna be a keypunch operator for the, forever.  And so I went into, I pursued jobs in the field of psychology.  And because I had gone to that school, even though I was nineteen, I was hired on by the Institute for Psychoanalysis to do research.  And the Institute for Psychoanalysis, I don't know if it's still there, but it was at, down on North Michigan.  And I worked for a psychoanalyst, and that was very interesting.  We worked on a study on maternal behavior, and I went back to school immediately.  See, by now, you're so accustomed to going to school and so accustomed to reading.  And I'm doing research and all that sort of thing, and I really enjoyed it.  But at a point, our grant ran out.  And so then this is when things kind of took a turn and I did eventually get into the education field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think because it was easy, and because it had been suggested for so long.  I used to tell people don't tell anybody I'm a teacher.  If they ask, tell 'em a ballet dancer, you know, because I really, I thought really teaching was perceived as being something very dull and boring.  And I didn't wanna spend my life being--doing anything dull and boring.  And as things turned out, it was not that at all for me, but it's 'cause I made it exciting.  I was determined to make it exciting, and it was.  Because I fell into it, and I just made it exciting.
Story_ID: 175062
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went back to school and picked up with education--
Speaker 2: Psychology.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, psychology.
Speaker 2: Psychology--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --primarily.  And, and that's where I worked for that period of time.  And then when I moved to Los Angeles [California], is when I went back to school to get my teaching credential.
Speaker 1: Okay, now why did you move to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Well, our--there were a couple of reasons.  During that period of time, shortly after I finished college, I married.  And to make a long story very, very short, my husband was killed in an automobile accident.  And I went back to Los Angeles initially just to have a little time to rest.  Our grant was over with the psych--psychiatrist that I worked for.  And before I looked for another job, I went there to kind of just be away.  It was wintertime.  I was going to Los Angeles.  I've never liked snow, and when I left Chicago it was like two degrees.  I got to L.A. and it was like seventy [degrees].  Can you imagine?  And then I was staying with a friend, and she was a teacher.  And she said oh, you're gonna love this.  You'll love teaching.  And I thought, Holy Toledo, everybody's a, everybody is ganging up on me.  But she gave me a few good reasons why teaching might be a good idea, and they all had to do with the benefits, I mean the short hours, the long summer vacation and things like that.  But it turned out that I took a job on a playground working with kids, and the kids really seemed to respond to me.  And I'd tell 'em, you know, things, and they listened, and they'd look at me, and they'd do what I had suggested.  And I thought well, maybe I can make a difference here, you know, because that's what I really wanted to do, was make a difference somewhere.  And my parents had always told me I'd be good at this.  And here I was being good at it, you know.  I was really kind of disappointed, you know, because it's like the prophecy.  And--but anyway, I thought well, I'll try it, but I had to get certified, and I wasn't certified.  So I had to start to school, and in the meantime, I worked as a counselor at Juvenile Hall in L.A.  Now that was a real experience.  I was not much older than the juvenile delinquents that were in this place.  But there were a couple of thing that happened.  Number one, I had to have a job that accommodated my school schedule.  And this was shift work, and--but I had never run in--see, these are juvenile delinquents.  They've done something criminal, for--ell, until they went to court, they're still innocent, but possibility that they've done something criminal.  So, and I was, my title was counselor.  I've told you what my life was like, you know, I was in the box, always in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and very responsive to this family over here.  And here I run into these young people who would tell me their stories or why they--what, what happened that they got to this point in their young lives.  And inside I was just, I couldn't believe it, you know.  I mean some of them had killed a family member.  You know, they'd done all kind--how--and so inside I'm just screaming, but outside my--this is where my theater came in--I was a just as cool as the breeze, like I hear this every day.  But I would go home and I was--of course you, when you have a job like this you're sworn to secrecy.  So I couldn't talk about it, but I was, I just couldn't imagine the life that someone had had that would bring them to that point, compared to the life I'd had.  You know, it was just--and so then I began to--'cause see, up till now, I'm thinking everybody lived the life I had lived, pretty much, to the, to the, to, to a great degree, all my friends, you know, mainly, although they didn't go to school with me.  But still, we were kind of all on the same plane.

Speaker 1: But now I'm meeting people that for some reason, and I'm, I'm, you know, like nineteen or twenty, and they're like eighteen.  At eighteen that's when juvenile hall stops, and you go to adult detention.  You see, so I'm not much older than them.  And--but I couldn't believe what I was hearing half the time.  Well, I must say, I was very successful though, in that job, because I was a good listener.  I mean I've never heard stories like this, so it's like hearing somebody tell you a, you know, they're telling you a novel.  It's almost unbelievable.  And--but I was just very cool about the whole thing.  And the more you--the more I acted like I really, this was just water, water off, you know, the ducks back, the more they'd tell.  I was very--and, and I don't know if it was because I had this kind of yeah, so what attitude, or because I was almost their age, that they spilled things to me that they wouldn't tell to some of these older pe--older women in the place.  And so I was very successful.  They list--see, I'd just had these, all these psychology classes.  And so they would listen to me, you know, in trying to counsel them, and I was very successful.
Story_ID: 175064
Speaker 1: You did that until you finished your education--
Speaker 2: Right, my--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --teacher's certification.
Speaker 1: Your teacher's certification.  Did you start teaching in Los Angeles [California], or?
Speaker 2: I--that's a story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you were certified there--
Speaker 2: I was certified, and it was time to get a job.  Now this is where I guess you'd say racism kind of kicked in.  I hadn't felt anything about anything.  I hadn't been--you know, a lot of people talk about all the strife and this and that, and really I hadn't--you know, I knew that by now that I was, I was different, but so what.  You know, it was kind of like that.  But then it was time to get a job.  And in Los Angeles they took all the new--now mind you, I had graduated already.  I had a degree, college degree, but now I had a teaching certificate.  And, and by the way, beyond Illinois, I don't think--you know, it used to be that when you said University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] everybody stopped and turned around.  Well, see, in California they didn't, you know.  U of C out there is University of California.  And if you didn't go to UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] or UC Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California], so what, you know.  I mean it was real different.  So, but I went to the place where all the new teachers were being placed, or at least there was a lady there, and she was sending you to the area that you wanted to work in.  And my roommate, this person who was from Daytonc[Ohio], who had kind of coached and me and kind of coached me into teaching, and the day before we--I was going to this interview, she had a big map of Los Angeles County [California].  And she said now, let's decide here; let's talk about--'cause see, I hadn't been there that long.  In the, the time that I had been there, I'd been between home, and school, and work, you know, I really didn't know the city that well.  So she said okay, where do you wanna work?  And I said well, probably in a nice middle-class neighborhood in, probably an integrated neighborhood and--so she said okay, well, that, that would be here and here and here, you know, let's say Baldwin Hills [Los Angeles, California].  So when I got to the interview, they went around, somebody went around and said now which area do you wanna work in?  And you know, went around to all the pe--there were a lot of people in the room.  And I said what we had rehearsed, which was like Baldwin Hills and maybe a couple of others like, you know, like Baldwin Hills.  And so it was my turn to go, to have a one on one with this woman, and she said so I see here you wanna go to Baldwin Hills.  And I said yes, I, that would be what I'd prefer.  And she said well, we don't have anything in Baldwin Hills.  You know, Baldwin Hills is an integrated neighborhood, middle class and so.  I said yes, that's why I'd chosen it.  She didn't know a thing about me, you know.  She said well, we don't have anything in that, in that neighborhood.  You might wanna--and she had a big map too, this same map I had seen last night with my roommate.  She said you might wanna think about going to Compton.  And so I said oh, okay, 'cause see, I didn't know too much about Compton 'cause my roommate and I hadn't talked about Compton.  So, she said so you go over there, and you sit over there, and you think about that 'cause I think that's probably where we'll be sending you, so I said okay.  So I went over and I looked at the map, and I, and I thought well, I--so, anyway, I'm checking the map out and getting it all straight in my mind 'cause I'm not going where I thought I was going to be, evidently.  So the next lady came and sat in the chair, and she's one on one.  She's a Caucasian lady.  So she's--and I'm not sitting that far way.  I could hear what they were saying, so they, the (unclear)--the woman said, "And where would you--I see here you wanna go to Baldwin Hills," so she said oh--and so the lady verified, "Yes, that's where I'd like to go."  So they said, "We have just the job for you.  We have just--does your husband need a job too?"  I'm sitting right here.  Said [clearing throat].  She had forgotten that fast that I was sitting right there and I heard her.  So she finished--(unclear)--she gave this lady a job, right where, just where I had said I wanted to go.  Now why did she do that?  I'm thinking to myself, why'd--she doesn't even know me.  Why would she deny and get--well, anyway, it blew me away.  So she finished with her, and I guess she got the job.  I don't know, but I went the grown up lady and I said Ms., you know, you made a real big mistake.  'Cause see, now, I'd heard her say this.  If it came down to, to, to pressing charges or anything like that, I knew she was out--I knew she had done the wrong thing, but if it would have come down to her word and mine, but you know, I just couldn't believe this was happen, happening.  I didn't wanna make trouble 'cause I did need a job.  So I told her, I said, "Thank you, but I don't think you're gonna provide me with any real service, so I'll see about getting my own job."
Story_ID: 175065
Speaker 1: I didn't know what I was gonna do, you know, but this is how I was treated.  And so I went back to the main office, and I looked on the board where they had job vacancies.  And I made a xerox copy and took it home and went over it with my roommate.  And I said you know, I don't like being treated like that.  It's not that I didn't wanna go to Compton.  It's that I wanted to have a choice.  This lady had a choice, and she got her choice.  I have a good record in school.  This woman doesn't know.  I need to, I wanna have a choice.  So Alice said well, I don't know what to tell you.  You have to make up your own mind about it.  I saw on this piece of paper it said Studio City [Los Angeles, California].  I said I'm gonna see what that's all about.  I went to Studio City, California.  I drove myself over there, and I walked in the office.  And the lady behind the desk, who was the principal, said come in, have a seat.  She said--and there's a little story with this too.  I'll tell you in a minute.  But she said I have been looking for, just praying for a person like you to come here to my school.  And I said really?  I couldn't believe it.  She said we have no black teachers in our school.  She didn't say black.  She said, probably said Negro--
Speaker 2: Negro.
Speaker 1: --or colored.  She said I, I have not, I've been wishing for one, at least one.  She said and we have no black children here either.  She said is that gonna be a problem for you?  I said oh, no, no.  You know, with my--hey.  She said well, I've been--and I mean, the way that she said it made me feel like I was just getting a hug.  I just met this woman.  But let me tell you a funny little story.  As with many female people I guess, I like to change my appearance.  So when I had gone to Los Angeles, I had changed my hair to yellow--well, not yellow; I guess you'd call it blond.  And before I was going for this interview over in Studio City, my hairdresser had told me--I told her this whole story.  And I said and I'm going tomorrow for an interview in Studio City.  She said--this is an African American hairdresser--she said well, you're not going looking like that.  I said what do you mean?  I've got my--you know, I think I'm really okay.  She said well, you're not going over there looking like that.  So, I said well, what are you gonna do?  I didn't know if she was gonna cut my hair or what.  I certainly didn't think she was gonna change the color 'cause I thought that was the best part.  So she, she started, she went back and got her little brown stuff out, and I came out of there with brown hair.  She said and just be quiet about it.  Go have your interview, get your job, and then we'll see where we go from there.  So anyway, when I went for this interview my hair was real dark and quite different from the way it had been just the day before.  Anyway, it was instant love with me and the new principal, my new boss.  She hired me on the spot.  Guess what?  Two kindergarten teachers quit when the first day of school came and I showed up.  They said they had heard that, you know, this was happening, and they weren't gonna work there anymore.  I said why not?  And they, they didn't, you know, they--anyway, I went to the principal and I said look, it seems like there's confusion, and I don't wanna cause confusion.  She said listen, just go back, get your room set up.  I've been trying to get rid of those two old biddies for the longest, and if this what, what did it, fine.  She said 'cause you're a member of our faculty.  I mean even now, to think about it, it just--you know, I mean it was a real turning point for a lot of things, you know.  But anyway, things worked out very well.
Speaker 2: Now what year is that when you--
Speaker 1: That was 1963.
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '63 [1963] I started there.
Speaker 2: That's a--
Speaker 1: --actually '62 [1962], about '62 [1962] I started there in Studio City, California.  And that area now is probably all African American too.  I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: Studio City, is that the same, the place where they had a TV studio or something like that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Universal is there.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Studio City in Hollywood and all that?
Speaker 1: Yes--
Speaker 2: That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Universal is there.  I did my student teaching in Hollywood.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 175066
Speaker 1: So, that's a--
Speaker 2: So you started teaching in the real world in Hollywood [California]?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And of course, it was not easy, because those people, once again, they had such high expectations for their chil--this is public school now.  They had such--they were mainly from the movie industry.  They had such high expectations for their children.  I mean I had to work very hard.  I would have anyway.  I mean teaching is not easy.  People think it is, but it is very, very hard, if you do, do it well, and do it right, and really put the amount of time in that it requires.  But I so enjoyed it, and the kids were such a joy.  I taught second grade at first.  I taught second grade Studio--Carpenter Avenue School, Studio City, [Los Angeles] California.
Speaker 2: Now, now how long did you teach there?
Speaker 1: I taught four and a half years.  The whole four and a half years was just marvelous.  I wanna say, though, to, to add on to the story I told you about the hair business.  After I'd been there a couple of years and the, the principal got to know me, and she was sending me everywhere to give workshops, and participate in workshops, and learn how to teach math a different way and all those kinds of things, I went back to my hairdresser.  And I said how about if we change my hair color back, and so she said okay, sounds like you got a good relationship going on.  So, she changed it back.  And the next day that I went to school, the principal said ah, what in the world did you do to yourself?  And I said well, I can tell you a secret now.  The day--you know, and I told her the whole story.  Said if I had seen you like that the very first time I never would have hired you.  Is that a message?
Speaker 2: Yeah, your hairdresser knew something, yes.
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'd be like that today, you know, now again, but the point is that young people, when they go to ask for a job, or look for a job, seek a job, you want to try to not be other than your environment or the circumstances will bear, you know, try to look in a way that you'll be acceptable.  I know a lot of young people don't feel that way now, you know, take me as I am, dreadlocks and all.  But it's still that way in a lot of, in a lot of places of business, corporations, schools systems, you know, that, you're, you're not accepted unless you're more mainstream.  And quite frankly, that blonde was, was quite stunning, startling.
Speaker 2: In those days especially--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In those days especially, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 178489
Speaker 1: Now what did you do after you taught at, taught school at Studio City [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: So I was there for four and a half years, and I was challenged.  I was at--I hadn't been there very long, and the parents--the principal came one day and told me that the parents would like to see me, and they would like for me to teach a math class.  And so I thought, Holy Toledo, I mean, I'm second grade now, you know.  I mean the most difficult thing we're doing is maybe two digit numbers, you know, plus and minus, so what have I--so she said listen, don't worry about it.  She said you know this stuff, you know this, so we'll just arrange for them to come, you know; write a letter--I was good at writing--write a letter, and let 'em know that you'll be expecting them.  And all the fathers that wanna come, can come on whatever day you say at whatever time you say, and give a lesson.  She said just do it.  I was so nervous, but nobody knew.  I, you know, put the problems on the board, worked for fifteen minutes, asked for questions.  All these executives sitting here could see that this person could do math, second grade level math.  So I guess, you know, that, that satisfied 'em.  We were all best friends after that.
Speaker 1: So they, they didn't--once again, they didn't recognize the stamp of the University of Chicago (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I guess they didn't understand--
Speaker 2: --I didn't advertise it.
Speaker 1: --what that was, okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't advertise it.  Maybe they didn't know.  I didn't talk about it.  And I would rather demonstrate to them, rather than say that I had--you see, because now people are thinking that, well, yeah, you went there.  You had a--there's some kind of affirmative action going back, on back over in Chicago or something, you know.  I mean they just--so I'd rather just do it, you know.  And it wasn't the last time I had to really prove myself.  And besides that, being a woman, I found there--you know, people have all kinds of hang-ups.  So, as she said--the principal knew best--just go teach the lesson; you know what to; you know how to do it; you know how to talk to people; you're perfectly a great teacher; just do it.  So that's what we did, and then things were fine.
Story_ID: 178490
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: See, in this community [in Studio City, Los Angeles, California] there were not any black people.  They even had in their mansion houses they lived in, they had Hispanic day labor, you know, and, and gardeners.  And you know, they came from somewhere--there wasn't anybody there that, like me.  And, and back then--I guess this has always been kind of a thing that I have felt just like my mother had told me years ago, we're not only going to this school so that you can, whatever you're gonna do there and integrate there.  We're going so these people can know about us.  You know, and that's how I had kind of grown up.  These people have to know about us.  So, here I was, being a teacher, and now I'm teaching them that somebody like me can do second grade math, you know, and that's okay.  If that's where we are right now, you know, and I'm the one to do it, hey, you know.  So I didn't, I wasn't offended.  You know, I think young people nowadays would be offended, and even the thought of having to prove yourself like that, but it was okay.  It was okay.  Now they know that I can do this.  And so they were very supportive.  You know, and the little children, little children never had a problem.  You know, they just--it was love for me just like it was for any of the other teachers in the school, you know, kissy, kissy, oh, mm, mm, mm, you know, and holding onto you and all that stuff.  And one of them wanted, one of them, I never will forget, was--her father was a, an accountant for some famous movie star.  And she wanted me to meet this movie star 'cause he was single, and I was single.  And so she told me his name, and I thought, Holy Toledo.  This is, you know, this is the innocence of a seven-year-old?  She said you know what, you've messed up now, she came to school one day and said.  And I said what happened?  She said I've been inviting you over 'cause he's been there a lot of times by himself, but yesterday he brought another--a girlfriend.  And I said really?  Who was it?  Jill St. John.  I said Holy Toledo, I'm thinking to myself, you know, but that's the innocence of kids, you know.  Isn't that a cute story, so.
Speaker 1: Who, who, who was the actor?  Who was the actor?
Speaker 2: I really don't remember right now--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --who it was, but if I could call his name, you--it was somebody that you would--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --know.
Speaker 1: But your competition was Jill St. John (laughter).
Speaker 2: My competition was Jill St. John.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, I just say that to say the kids are so sweet and innocent, and they weren't, you know, they weren't bothered by any of it all.  And I was okay with everything, you know, the rest of the faculty, and I did my work.  My principal always told me to--the advice she gave me was to be where you're supposed to be when you're supposed to be there.  'Cause she told me that all these people have lawyers.  All of these parents have lawyers, and if something happens on the playground, and that's where you're supposed to be and you're not there, they'll sue you, you know.  And I, so I have always been very conscious of school law and, and always where I was supposed to be.  And, and when I later became a school administrator, that's what I tell the faculty, you know, be sure you're where you're supposed to be and doing what you're supposed to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's worked well.
Story_ID: 178491
Speaker 1: So after being there for a while, I had a friend who--and she suggested to me that we look for jobs with the Overseas Dependents' Schools.  See, now, already teaching is much more exciting than I had ever dreamed it would be.  And these little children would come to school, and they--well, they'd ask you questions like why is the sky blue?  See, they were totally stimulated at home.  And I didn't know why the sky was blue.  I don't know if I can tell you now why the sky is blue, but I would have something to tell them the next day 'cause I'd spend the whole evening in the library researching, you know, why might the sky be blue, you know, and the things that seven-year-olds ask.  But I was there, you know, I was willing to put in the time to give them a logical answer that had to be presented in languages they could understand, you know.  I was doing all of that.  But anyway, my friend, my, my good friend said well, we need to, we need to do something exciting here.  And there are jobs available for teachers in the Overseas Dependents' Schools.  Well, what is that all about?  Well, the government pays you to teach overseas with the, the children of the military.  And they have these schools all over the world 'cause the [U.S.] military is everywhere.  We have bases and posts all over the place.  So, so okay, I thought it was a great idea, but quite frankly, I never dreamed anybody would select me to do something like that.  That was just more wonderful than anything I could ever think of.  To make a long story short though, we applied for the job.  And she told me that she had a friend that was gonna get her--take care of her getting into the program.  I didn't know anybody that was gonna get me into the program, so I had to fill out all those app--those, the, the application, and I did so.  But I got down to the, to the lat--it took forever, but I said you know, this is something that I'm going to do.  I'm not gonna give up on doing, on filling out this application, sure wish I knew somebody that could help me out and get me in.  Well, I got down to the end, and it, and it--and I--and it, there was a section of this application that I just didn't know what to do with.  It had to do with translating college credits from the semester system that we were on at the U of C [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]. to--or the quarterly system--we were on a quarterly system at U of C--to semester hours.  And I didn't, I just couldn't figure it out.  So, I took the application in, big, thick application, I took it in to the office where it's supposed to be submitted.  And I told the gentleman there that I was, you know, really wanting to complete this.  I had spent a lot of time doing, you know, completing it to this point, but I needed help on this last one little part of it.  He said you know, teachers are notorous--notoriously not able to fill out application forms well.  And he said have a seat.  I'll help you.  So he did, and he helped me finish that application.  And as I was leaving--I left it with him--and as I was--'cause back then you didn't xerox anything, you know.  People kept up with your papers.  I said to him, you know, I really--if you have anything to do with me getting this job, I would really appreciate it.  He said well, you've been delightful.  I'll see what I can do.  And I left, went home, and that was like before Christmas I was doing this.  I went home and forgot all about it, really, 'cause I just thought it was too, just too wild a thing for me to, you know, dwell on.  But I was already happy for my friend 'cause she had somebody looking out for her.
Story_ID: 178492
Speaker 1: Well, about, I would say about June of that year, maybe May or June of that year--
Speaker 2: And this is what year?
Speaker 1: This was in 1967.  I--and you know, some--'67 [1967], '66 [1966]--well, anyway, I was--I'd, I'd kind of forgotten about it, and I got a letter that said you have been selected to go to Germany to teach school in the Overseas Dependents' Schools.  You have forty-eight hours to respond to this offer.  And I thought, Holy Toledo, I mean, here I've been selected.  Now, of course, I went back to all the things that had happened, and I have to think that of all the people that probably applied, that man that helped me finish that application--I mean I had wonderful things to say, and I'd had wonderful experiences.  I don't mean to minimize, but I think that he probably put in a word for me.  You know, I think he probably looked out for my application.  At any rate, I called my parents and talked it over with them.  And I was really nervous about it by now.  You know, ooh, going to Germany.  I hadn't--you know, I, I didn't know much about Germany, and I didn't know the German language.  And you know, I thought, well, is this something I really wanna do?  On the one hand, I do.  On the other hand, oh, my goodness.  Called my girlfriend, no, she hadn't heard from her friend.  She didn't know if she was gonna get to go or not.  And my father said to me, you know, his question was--my mother started crying.  My father said how long do you have to stay in this program?  And I said you have to stay a year.  He said well, Sandra, this might be a wonderful opportunity.  You can stand anything for a year, you know; you can do anything.  You can stand on your head for a year, so why not try it out, you know?  So I thought about it.  Oh, I said a prayer too.  And I called back--there was a number on the letter--and I told them that I would come.  So, of course, I had to say goodbye to my little kids in Studio City, to the wonderful principal.  But she was very instrumental too in that happening, because she writ--she had given me wonderful opportunities while I was there.  She had really featured me as, you know, the person representing our school in many different meetings all over the, the county and so on.  She had--I had performed well.  I had been accepted by the community.  And so I think it was her recommendations too that, you know, made that possible.  So, with that, I was off to Germany.  When I left the U.S. I had no idea where I was going.  All I knew was that I was going to Germany.  So this was a real adventure for me.  And this happened in 1967.
Story_ID: 178493
Speaker 1: What part of Germany did they send you to?
Speaker 2: I was initially stationed in Zweibrucken [Germany], which is almost on the French border.  By the way, you had to be single to, in order to be hired at that time.  You had to be a single person.  Now it's changed.  You can be, you know, if you're married you can bring your husband along as a dependent.  You know, and all that has changed now.  But anyway, I was near the, near the French border about three hours southwest of Frankfurt [Germany].  But we flew in to Frankfurt, and we were met there.  And all the other people--
Speaker 1: So it's kind of rural Germany or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was farmland.
Speaker 1: Farm--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, farmland.  I'll tell you, the first six months there, I was totally--I thought I'd made a huge mistake, but--because it was farmland; it was rural; it was German, German spoken, English of course on the base, but outside of that it was German.  I had never heard German before.  It was cloudy; it was raining every day.  I had left the sunshine of Southern California to go there, and I just love sunshine, that's why yellow's my favorite color.  So I thought, you know, I, I had to think every day about what my dad said, you know, you can stand anything for a year, because this was not anything like anything I was ever used to.  But I did get a lot of comfort from the--it was very different, and I did get a lot of comfort from the other single teachers.  They were all new there.  And the military was a whole new way of life.  Nah, nobody that I knew had even, you know, had served in the military, especially overseas.  And there was travel.  You know, we worked hard, but we had our same long vacations.  So, here I was--I guess the first long vacation that we had was Thanksgiving.  That was like five days.  And everybody it seemed went to London.  And in London what we did was go to the theater.  I'd go to three plays a day.  And this is, I mean this was wonderful.  So you make a couple of trips like that, you know, a long weekend in London and another long weekend over in Paris [France], which was just on the train, on the, on the fast express train, was like four hours.  Switzerland was down in--and Basel [Switzerland] was--I could--it was awhile before I got a car, but so I rode the train down to Basel.  And all around Germany they have these little fests every weekend just about.  I couldn't even make all the things there were to do.  So, and then, of course, in the summer months you're already, everybody around is kind of planning, you know, well are we going to go to Majorca for Spain--to Majorca for summer vacation, or should we just do Italy?  I mean, you know, these are the kind of choices you're making.  So I'm thinking to myself maybe this isn't so bad after all.  I know what, I'll stay and just one more year and see how it all works out, 'cause I had to do my summer trip.  So that meant you kind of had to stay until the next year, 'cause you--well, anyway, the timing was such you'd want to do that.  So I stayed two years, and in, in the spring of every year, not only did you get a trip home, free trip home, and my home of record was California, so I could stop all the way across the U.S.A. to get to California, but you, so you got a free trip home.  But then you had all these opportunities for travel during the school year.  Now I don't want anybody to think that, you know, that's all teachers over there do, 'cause we worked hard, knowing that people probably would criticize us for, you know, not working hard.  We worked extra hard.  And, and it was kind of fun because we all lived in the bachelor officer's quarters, you know, which is like a hotel or a dormitory.  And we had privileges that the Officer's Club.  So, everything was pretty, pretty okay.  Our little salary was very pitiful, but it was okay.  We all ate soup and crackers and hot dogs maybe twice a week, 'cause we were all saving money to make these--pay the airlines.  We were all going on trips.  Because the point was, here you were in this wonderful atmosphere for travel, and none of us ever knew really, we talked about it a lot, when we'd have to go home, 'cause we all had families back in the States.  You never really knew, you know, when mother or dad would really need you to come home, so it was kind of like you just take advantage of the time that you had there.  Now I must tell you, some of my friends that I had back then are still there.  I have one, you know, best friend, and she's, I guess, just there forever.  You know, she's taught at--because later I moved to Heidelberg [Germany], and Heidelberg is more of a city.  I mean it has university, couple of universities, and it's more of a city.
Story_ID: 178494
Speaker 1: But--and, and that is where I met my husband [Harry Johnson].
Speaker 2: In Heidelberg [Germany]?
Speaker 1: In--no, he--I met him in Zweibrucken [Germany].
Speaker 2: Oh, Zweibrucken, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he came to Zweibrucken as the provost marshal.  Yeah, and that was quite a meeting because everybody wanted to know if I'd met the new major in town.  And at this point, quite frankly, I wasn't sure that the new major in town was eligible, and this, there was quite a wringing of the hands.  So, what happened was my, one of my friends had, who worked for the general, said well, we can check him out.  And I thought, well, how are we gonna do that all the way over here?  She said well, all you have to do is get his full name, and I can put it through to the personnel office in St. Louis.  And in three days we'll get a printout on him.  We'll know everything there is to know about him.  I thought, oh, how wonderful.  So the next time we talked on the phone, I asked him what his full name was, and he told me, unsuspecting, and I gave it to my girlfriend.  And sure enough, we got back a full printout, everything, and sure enough, he was not married, so everything was good to go.  But we had a wonderful courtship.  I didn't know at the time, really, that it was going to be a courtship, but that's how it turned, things turned out.  So, we went to a lot of events together in, in Europe and had a very nice time.
Story_ID: 178495
Speaker 1: So, I stayed there [Germany] for six years--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --one year led to another, to another, to another--
Speaker 2: --Now, how you were there during the--you said at one point that when you came back to the United States, it seemed like things had really changed a lot.  Now--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --you were, you were gone during--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --some of the major--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --parts of the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and the kind of cultural revolution--
Speaker 1: Assassination of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].
Speaker 2: --and (unclear)--yeah, how did you, did you find out about that when you were there?  Did you--how did people--
Speaker 1: That was a very--
Speaker 2: --feel about that in Germany, you know?
Speaker 1: That was a very traumatic day.  I remember till, till now, because Dr. King was revered in my family.  I mean he just was, you know, he, he was the leadership of the time, you know.  And I heard about this on the radio, on the radio I heard about this.  And I was all alone in my BLQ [ph.] room, and I couldn't stop crying.  I couldn't stop crying.  I was late to school that morning.  I'd just, you know, something that's totally unlike me.  I was so angry, and I didn't call anybody to tell 'em I was gonna be--this is something I'd never done.  I didn't call to say I was gonna be late.  I was crying.  I was weak.  I just, I just, you know, was very distraught, to say the least.  And when I did pull myself together to get there, I don't remember if I called ahead or if I just went to school, but the principal did not, in my opinion, respond well.  And he was very upset that I was late.  And I thought this is the height of disrespect, to not be sensitive to the facts of what has happened today.  And I knew that he knew.  But at any rate, it was a, it was just a very bad scene.  There were--I think that my reaction was much like the rest of the people, the rest of the African American people that were there at the time, and the troops, and everybody, and the German people, you know.  I think that everybody didn't react with anger, but when--see, you, you remember that shortly thereafter there was a lot of rioting.  And I hate to say it, but I just, I wasn't surprised, you know.  I thought, you know, because I was so angry.  I was just--
Speaker 2: Was, was there any violence on the base among the black soldiers or any, any tension real high, high tension?
Speaker 1: I would say that the tension was, was increased, yes, tension was increased.  I sort of stayed to myself.  I was, I was de--I was feeling so isolated.  I wanted to be at home, and I especially wanted to be with my family at that time.  That's how I reacted.  And I didn't, you know, pay attention to a lot of what was going on around me.  But I recall that it was, it was a real struggle.
Speaker 2: How did the Germans react to it?
Speaker 1: Well, the Germans also were very, they seemed very simp--they seemed more sympathetic to the African American viewpoint than some of the other Americans did.  And that was all a puzzle.  It was all a puzzle.  And then all of this happened before I met Harry [Johnson], so I didn't have him to talk to about it.  Yeah, I think the Europeans were very much on--you know, everybody revered Dr. King, I thought worldwide.  Especially I think that the German people had paid attention to his teachings, yeah.
Story_ID: 178496
Speaker 1: So you came back in the mid-'80s [1980s], or around the mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: No, mid--early '70s [1970s] I returned to--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay--
Speaker 2: --the [United] States.
Speaker 1: --seventies [1970s].
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, that's right, six more years passed when--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we then moved to Kansas.  And we were married in Kansas.
Speaker 1: Where were you living in Kansas?
Speaker 2: Harry [Johnson] was transferred to Fort Leavenworth [Kansas].  He was a teacher at Fort Leavenworth, and that's where we married--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I started in school immediately in the Ph.D. program at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So I was in school and working at the University of Kansas, and he was in school.  And this was Command and General Staff College [Fort Leavenworth, Kansas].
Story_ID: 175075
Speaker 1: Now we're at the University of Kansas [KU, Lawrence, Kansas], and by now, you see, I have taught--I didn't say this as we were going along, but I have taught every grade, kindergarten through twelfth.  See, and my, my focus was on K through twelve programs.  Now I'm going into administration, and now I am teaching at the University of Kansas.  So now I have moved into teaching kindergarten through college and, and, and while at the University of Kansas, I also taught a class in the principalship to graduate students.
Speaker 2: Okay, so every level now you've, you've taught at.
Speaker 1: I've covered every level.
Speaker 2: Except for graduate school and you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: --and even, even at that I had taught graduate students, yeah, the principalship.  So, I'm making--I'm kind of, you know, positioning myself for a, a, an administrative assignment, 'cause I have extensive experience, much more than most people at this point, plus I have all of this travel and experience in teaching in California and in the Overseas Dependents' Schools with this population of students.  So, I've grown up in Chicago [Illinois], gone to the privates--you know, all of those things which are attractive as a, as an educational administrator.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So now I'm going to get a doctorate degree in administration at the University of Kansas.  At this point, I was a little older than most students on campus.  That was okay.  It was wonderful.  I just loved KU.
Speaker 2: Now that's in Lawrence, right?
Speaker 1: Lawrence, Kansas.  And of course, as I said, we lived down at Fort Leavenworth, so I had quite a little commute every day.  And I'd go back (unclear) now, and I don't know how I did it, you know, driving down there on the highway in the fog, in the rain, tornadoes, you know.  But I did it.  I was determined.  I had my doctorate dissertation topic planned before I even started.  I knew where I was going.  I was focused, and what I was doing was getting in and getting out, and that's how it worked out.  It just so happened though, that, again, this getting of jobs was--I, I had investigated and found out that African Americans were not particularly school administrators in Leavenworth, Kansas.  However, there was a gentleman there who was wonderful.  He was African American.  He was the mayor of Leavenworth.  He was also an elementary school principal, and a minister at one of the big churches there in the community.  So he was kind of my mentor.  And he wished me well, and he and his wife, Lula, were just so kind to me.  And--but the most encouraging person at KU was my advisor.  His name is George Crawford, and I'm still in touch with him.  He was very encouraging.
Story_ID: 175076
Speaker 1: Toward the end of my coursework there, I had always been interested in school law, and I had to take another class in school law.  And as we went around the room that day and introduced ourselves, one of the people in the room, in the class, said that he was the superintendent of schools USD 453.  And that was where Leavenworth was located.  And I thought to myself that's the man that's gonna give me my very first official administrative job, you know, but I didn't say a thing.  I just said I was a student and Ph.D. candidate, and I was taking this law class.  I didn't give any clues.  But toward the end of class, I studied, I studied so hard.  And that, I think that's why I still yet, to this day, I'm pretty good with school law, 'cause really studied, 'cause I had to impress one person in that class, besides the teacher.  And I did well in the, in the class.  And toward the end, I introduced myself to this person and told him that oh, really?  You're the superintendent?  You know, you're the superintendent in Leavenworth?  Oh, well, I'm going to be seeking and hoping to apply for a job in Leavenworth.  I live at, at Fort Leavenworth, and so and so.  Anyway, so we had this--he said oh, really?  You know, and he didn't seem as though he was too excited, but he couldn't deny that I was probably the best student in the school law class.  And so he invited me to come for an interview, and I did.  And it turned out to be the kind of thing where, you know, you have to talk to the person that is--you have to go in, and I tell students this now, that you have to go in with things in mind that you would like to get from a job assignment, as opposed to just sitting there and answering questions.  In other words, you know, if I am the principal of this school, realizing that they, there has never been a female that has had a position like this.  'Cause the opening was at a secondary level, and the thinking back in those days was that women were not hired so readily for secondary school because the children were bigger.  And women take care of little people, little, young children, and men take care of junior high, high school children.  So I thought, you know, back in Chicago, you know, how many people did I know that were principals of school--women principals of high schools and ju--you know, so don't, let's not go there.  I can certainly handle the job, but you know, Mr. Superintendent, will you be able to--how's it gonna work when, you know, we have to expel one of these children from school?  And who are the parents gonna see about this if I'm the one doing it?  They're gonna go see you?  And you have to really be strong if you hire me, you know.  You have--I'm not, I'm not saying that I was telling him or anything, but we had to have an understanding about that before you just hire me 'cause I was a good student in this class.  And so I said let's, let's both think about this, 'cause this, this'll be a first.  This is another first.  So he agreed that we should think about it.  He probably talked to some other people, and I, I, I just think he must have.  And he called me back in and said that he was going to hire me for the job.  It was, it was really a monumental thing at the time in this neighborhood, because there'd never been a woman that had had a job at this level.  But as I recall, I was the only the person that had a doctorate degree that was a principal, you see.  So, at any rate, it was all, it was all wonderful.  I had great experiences.  People still call me to tell me that after I left, you know, we transferred out with Harry rotating to Washington, but now there are lots of women at the secondary--of course there would be.  I mean, how many years have passed?  But I'm just saying, shortly thereafter, many women hired.  As a matter of fact, they hired a female to--as the principal at Leavenworth Senior High School, which was quite an, you know, quite a statement on my performance there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know; women are okay.  But there were lots of firsts there.  I mean I was really treated as a whatnot, not so much because I was African American, because I was a woman.  And this was during the time in the mid-'70s [1970s] when women were doing very non-traditional things.  They were wiring the telephone poles.  They were doing what is, what they call non-traditional jobs.  I was in the newspaper, on the radio, on the television, you know, to explain the fact that I was doing okay with this job in junior high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I enjoyed all of it.
Story_ID: 175077
Speaker 1: All right, now in, in [Washington] D.C. here, when you relocated here, that was in--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978], right.  And what did you do here?
Speaker 2: When I first came here, interestingly enough, I went to a--see, everywhere you go, there's, there's something that one wants to focus on in terms of what's going on there.  In Kansas, of course, it was school.  I was a student in school.  But in, in Washington it's politics and government.  I went to the opening, the, the [U.S.] Military wives welcoming tea.  And I was encouraged to, to come to the White House and write Christmas cards for then-President Carter.  I quickly agreed and went, and when I got there, I was doing my job--now mind you, I've been teaching elementary school.  My handwriting is pretty good.  And I was asked to, if I wanted to stay there as a volunteer.  And I thought, Holy Toledo, you know, here again, it's just like hearing these juvenile delinquent girls tell you something startling.  But I was cool.  And I wanted, you know, I asked what I would be doing, and I--so, anyway, I was told that it hadn't been decided exactly what I'd be doing, but they had to run a security check.  This was pretty safe for me.  I was a military officer's wife, and I was really look, seeking employment though, but I would try to help him out as long as I could.  So at any rate, I got a job--I was, I was regularly assigned to the White House Office of Presidential Correspondence.  And I was reading the pret--the mail sent to the president of the United States.  However, I did get a job, and a paying job, and this is what I was really seeking.  I had come though very well equipped.  See, by now I had experiences lined up.  I had a doctorate degree, so I was very competitive.  And back at the University of Kansas, I had supervised the student teaching program.  I had, had the job as the assistant principal in the junior high school working with an international community, because that, those--it was an international group of officers that went to Command and General Staff College there in Leavenworth.  So when I came here and applied for this job I was very happy to have gotten it.  I had never worked with a population like this though.  You know, if you follow along, when I get here--
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: --I'm working with African American students, never done that before, you know, in, in totality like this; other administrators, all African Americans; the superintendent was an African American.  Now I applied to other places around the city, but I chose D.C. because I had never had an experience like this, and I wanted a new--I wanted this.  This was kind of going to be the apex of my career, and so I was very pleased, first of all, that we were here in Washington, D.C., 'cause our other alternative was Atlanta [Georgia].  Not to say anything against Atlanta, but I was really glad that, that we were here.  I mean the White House, and the elections, and politics.
Story_ID: 175078
Speaker 1: And politics, quite frankly, growing up in Chicago [Illinois] was a big part of our life.  We came up in the Daley era.  You know, everybody I know read the book 'The Boss [Richard J. Daley of Chicago,' Mike Royko], you know.  That's how it was.  And we certainly protected our responsibility or honored our responsibility in voting.  I don't think I've ever, since I've been able to vote, not voted, wherever I lived, you know, and even in Germany.  I, I was, I've always done that.  So, I was just real excited to be in [Washington] D.C., and here I was, able to work with my folks, with my kids.  You know, I just--the whole thought of it was just really wonderful.  I don't want to, you know, change that, but it was definitely not what I expected.  And I will say that I had many colleagues that I still very much enjoy seeing and talking to, and worked, working with when I was there.  But during my years at the University of Kansas, I had decided that the population of children--'cause education and administration is a very broad area.  And I had decided that those children that I was going to concentrate on, give my full time and energy to, were those who didn't have friends, who did--the, the, the neediest of the needy.  So that was often children that were struggling in school, that, and also included children with disabilities.  We're talking about the mid-'70s [1970s].  We had just passed a law called 9414--Public Law 94142, which gave certain rights to children with disabilities.  We now call it IDEA.  But, for the most part, I dealt with these children.  We call 'em at-risk.  We have all kinds of little labels for them.  But they're children that are really struggling in school.  They may not have disabilities, but they're struggling nonetheless in school.  And then, of course, if you continue with that line of need, you get into the ones that have, had disabilities.  So, the response that I got from my colleagues, many of my colleagues were so negative toward these children.  Now these are all middle-class African-American people who just to me didn't seem to have the compassion that they should have for children that are struggling.  It was the ones who were from families like I guess they came from and like I did, by the way, myself, who gave all the rewards to the children that, you know, had a family that'll help 'em.  But to reach back and give an reward to somebody that was really needy, it didn't seem like they went that way.  You know, I had to remind them that, you know, this person isn't going to have anything if we don't give it, make it available.  No, they wanted the, the council member's son to, you know, have the, have, have the reward, not saying anything against the council member's son, you know, what I'm saying?  But that's, that was--and you had to really struggle and explain when children had disabilities.  Now we have schools here for children with disabilities, and we have developed programs for them.  But when I first came here it was like pulling teeth, and it's still, to a degree, I think is.  I think--so, there was a level of awareness that I was trying to bring to the situation, to bring to bear.
Story_ID: 175079
Speaker 1: And then I worked for several superintendents.  In my years there I think there were seven, one of whom was [HM] Floretta McKenzie.  I still, you know, really admire her.  I thought that she was very good, and you know why?  She was the one superintendent who, after we had established standards for children--this is the level at which they should perform--it was very easy to relax that, because if they didn't make the grade, who was there?  I mean the parents were in our face.  But she never let go.  And I think standards are the thing that we have to keep in our public schools in order to keep the level up and the level of success for the children.  So, at any rate, without getting on a soapbox about all that, Floretta did that.  You know, I don't know if she talked about it when she was interviewed, but she did that, and I, I will always respect her 'cause it wasn't easy for her.  You know, there are easier ways to say oh, well, yeah, okay, for your kid we don't expect that standard.  We'll go with something less, but she never did.  I think that helped the kid.  It was almost like, you know, back with the English teacher a long time ago.  You know, she wouldn't let it drop, you know.  But anyway, so, those are--that's the population of students that I dealt with.  And as a result of being an advocate for them, for those children, at that time, it wasn't easy.  I had to many times testify before the city council, talk to the mayor.  It was, it got to be a, it was very political.  And that's why I got kind of drawn more and more into politics, the politics and trying to figure out, now how is this guy gonna vote on this?  And maybe I need to go make a visit him.  You know, I was real--I had to be a real advocate to have success in the job that I had.  I had to do a lot of networking.  Well, we don't have money enough for this program.  Well, maybe over here in the court system, maybe I can go talk to one of the judges, and we can have an interagency agreement.  And maybe we can make this work so that the kids get the psychological services and the social work services through the court system that they need, things of that nature that helped us along.  One of the superintendents gave me an absolutely daunting assignment.  And it was to figure out what we are doing for children that are homeless.  I had never even thought about, you know, what are we doing?  Are they in school?  What do their parents need to get 'em to school?  So I had to go--and this came about as a result of there being a death at a homeless shelter.  Some children perished, and it--everybody's attention was now focused on the homeless and are they being educated?  And the superintendent I thought at the time--it was, it was a different one, but at the time, I thought showed a lot of confidence to ask me to go investigate that.  And I thought, Holy Toledo, why me?  You know, I mean, many of these things I, I came to have to deal with were so far away from where I started out, you know, but they were so interesting to me.  So, I, I would say that once--because I accepted readily, you know, I wasn't about to say no, I'm not gonna do that, you know, or try to find someone else.  I always took on the assignment and tried to do it to the best of my ability.
Story_ID: 175080
Speaker 1: How long were you with the [Washington, D.C.] school board [sic, District of Columbia Public Schools]?
Speaker 2: I worked in the school system for seventeen years.  And at which time, it was really difficult.  It was, I mean thing--situa--during these years, issues change; the population changed.  Now--
Speaker 1: But it--
Speaker 2: --we're into charter schools; now we're into homeschooling; you know, now we're in--now we're even talking about vouchers and you know.  So, the issues had changed.  The superintendent was leaving, and so I did as well.  And we started our own business, consulting business.
Speaker 1: Okay so you worked with [HM] Dr. [Floretta] McKenzie?
Speaker 2: No, no, we started--
Speaker 1: Oh, it wasn't (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --our own--my husband [Harry Johnson] and I--
Speaker 1: --Oh, you started your own--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --oh, you all started your own consulting in--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Since '96 [1996].
Story_ID: 175081
Speaker 1: Tell us about your return to the White House and--
Speaker 2: What happened was that, of course, Jimmy Carter lost that election in, was it '80 [1980]?  Anyway--
Speaker 1: Yes, '80 [1980] to Ronald Reagan.
Speaker 2: And at that point, it wasn't that I left the White House because I--you know, another person was elected, but the--Ronald--during the Reagan years and the Bush years, they didn't have volunteers that worked in the evenings.  All of their volunteers came in the day.  They, they were women that didn't work.  And so, consequently, I couldn't work in the day, so--'cause I had my job, my, my wonderful job--and so, therefore, I, I, wasn't there during those years.  But the minute Bill Clinton was elected, I called the White House.  That was in November, and I called the White House.  They said well, he hasn't gotten here yet, so.  They said call back after the first of the year, so I did.  And I had a desk in the White House before Bill Clinton did.  I was back there as a vol--as a nighttime volunteer, because immediately he started getting lots of mail, and they wanted somebody to handle it.  I read the president's mail.  I mean, I read it, and I answered it, and I, I still sometimes can't believe that, you know, I was doing this.  I really enjoyed my job.  I made a lot of friends while I was there.  I'm still in touch with them.  And most of us stayed for all the eight years that he was in office.  Toward the end, as we all know, things got a little--matter of fact, I didn't always work in the Office of Presidential Correspondence.  I worked in the gift shop.  I worked in, worked in several other places in the White House.  There are lots of different job assignments.  But toward the end, I, I wasn't so much enjoying Presidential Correspondence.  The mail got ugly.  So I sought out another job, and I, I stumbled into a job.  They said they, they would love for me to come work in the office of the First Lady.  So I went to work in Mrs. [Hillary] Clinton's office.
Story_ID: 175082
Speaker 1: Just to backtrack a minute, the mail that got ugly was in reference to the affair with Monica Lewinsky and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --impeachment and all that other--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --stuff.
Speaker 2: --all those issues, yes, that's--
Speaker 1: Did you, did, did, did you ever meet Monica Lewinsky as an intern?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know how she got--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --into the White House.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--but did you know President [Bill] Clinton's secretary, Betty--
Speaker 2: I had met her--
Speaker 1: --what's her name, Betty--
Speaker 2: [HM] Betty Currie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Currie.
Speaker 2: I had met her, and she's a very nice person.  And I just, even yet to this day, I just can't even imagine how that happened.  You know, a lot of pe--what I'm saying is I know it did, and I'm not trying to stick my head in the sand.  But a lot of people must have known about it.  A lot of people must have known that that was happening.  That's all I can say.
Speaker 1: Did you feel--how did you feel about it as such?  I mean did you have a--
Speaker 2: Somewhat betrayed, but I can understand why he was trying to explain or not explain, you know.  I mean, it's an embarrassing situation to be in.  And as smart as he was, I mean he was obviously a smart, smart, smart person, it's, it was awkward, to say the very least.
Speaker 1: And well, Bill--
Speaker 2: And the rest of us who worked there--I mean some people get to this they are disbelief.  I'm, I, I would dare say there are some who yet do not believe the story, even though it has been documented, and he has even, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --we all know, yeah, so.  But, I mean that's how strong feelings were of disbelief at that time within the office.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and of course, it nev--we never raised the issue with--really, none of us that worked there really talked about it.  It was, it was so awful.  But it was it was just, we all just loved him so, and still do actually, that we just didn't talk about it.  We didn't fan the fire.  We didn't, you know, if when people asked us about it, we didn't talk about it at all.  So, I guess we sort of wished it away, but of course, it ever went away.  But anyway, I, I didn't choose to, you know, read ugliness 'cause I still--you know, if we were voting today, I'd vote for him again, but you know, personal matters being personal matters.  I went to work at another office, which now, once again, I'm very much enjoying.  And because--
Speaker 1: So, so you went to work for the First Lady [Hillary Clinton], right?
Speaker 2: I went to work for the First Lady.  Little did I realize that around me--the reason why I guess I had that opportunity was because a lot of the people that ordinarily worked there were off campaigning because she's running for Senator.  And lo and behold, she won.  So then at that point I asked if I was going to be asked to go to the new Senate office, and I was told of course.
Story_ID: 178497
Speaker 1: So you went to the first--the office, the, the new Senate offices of Hillary Rodham Clinton, new senator from New York [New York] here in [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are you still volunteering?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --because my other obligations now are rather extensive.  And as a result of 9/11 [September 11, 2001], hate to always bring that up, but as a result of that, it got to be more restrictive there.  It wasn't as comfortable going over to the, to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  For a while we were restricted.  We couldn't, we couldn't go.  It was--
Speaker 1: There was rumors of what was it, anthrax, and--
Speaker 2: Anthrax, all of that.  And so I am not doing that now, but what I, what I did do, because I'm committed to public service, and so what I did do last year was volunteer with the DNC, the Democratic National Committee.  And I worked as a surrogate, going around to the urban areas, where they--where I was sent, mainly working through the African American churches to promote voting, get out the vote, and promoting the Democratic ticket in that locale.  Because although [Al] Gore and [George W.] Bush headed the ticket, there were others that were involved in the local politics there.  And so we talked about the importance of voting and our civic responsibilities, and I really enjoyed that.  And I have heard that in the localities where I was--I was in Florida, I was in Fort Myers [Florida], I was in Cleveland [Ohio], others--but where I had been--those are two that I recall (unclear)--voting turnout was more than it had ever been in a presidential election, so I felt really good about those reports.  And I very much enjoyed working with the DNC, which I will probably re-engage myself with, in a few months or soon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love politics and government.  Nothing's changed about that and being a part of the process, and also trying to engage other people.  I just can't imagine that people don't vote and participate.  And I think it's particularly present--prevalent--in the African American community.  You know, we've just got to take on more of a civic responsibility about it.  People say well, one vote doesn't make a difference, but we know from the last election that it does, you know, we know, we know clearly that it does.  So, folks vote.
Story_ID: 178498
Speaker 1: What are some of your other hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the main thing that comes to mind is that, the same since of responsibility that I'm talking about I voting, I would hope the children, the children that attend public schools or wherever they attend school, that they have more of a sense of responsibility and investigation of what the future might be for them, a, a sense of responsibility, dedication to what they're doing, focusing on the right thing, and keeping our, generally speaking, keeping--paying more attention, I should say, to our health, the general health in the African-American community.  I don't think that we pay attention, or we, we think it's not gonna happen to me, or I can eat any old kind of thing, or not exercise, or all those things that you really have to pay attention to, because we are needed here on this earth; we are of value; we are beautiful; we, and we need to stick together more.  This is, this is a message--you know, I get the feeling that in our past generations, we stock together; you know, we supported one another.  We were happy when the next person got a promotion.  We cheered for them; we had a party, you know, wishing you well on whatever your newest--now it seems as though we've gotten into a crabs in the barrel kind of mentality.  Are students really acting responsibly in school?  What is all of this stuff about youth gangs and--you know, I'm, I'm not saying that I don't know the answers to some of these things.  And I think we have to really nurture our children too and build strong families, but I would say that, you know, basically, those are some of the things that I worry about, mainly with the youth.  That's why I continue to work with the youth.
Story_ID: 178499
Speaker 1: I'm working now, not only with African American children.  I work in a nearby high school, public high school, and work with their testing program, work with trying to help children write essays to get into college, you know, various different things that will help them out, little tasks, for me, but big tasks in their life, the hurdles that they have to overcome.  I'm not only doing that, I'm working with politicians on Capitol Hill and our congresspersons to hel--to, to act as advocate for children with special needs.  We need more policies and budgetary items that are directed at children that have special needs, they have so many needs.  And oftentimes, the politicians that have to vote on these matters are not, you know, need, need information.  I won't say what they don't know.  I just--you know, that it, it--there's always something that I can bring to the, to, to them, to help them with a vote on behalf of these children.  So I act as an advocate for children with special needs and children with disabilities.  I have been blessed to be also involved in a contract with an organization that is contracted through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, helping with self-improvement in schools on Indian Reservations.  That's a whole 'nother culture, and that's a learning experience for me because these Indian populations have their own set of issues and things that they are grappling with.  And I'm, I'm really enjoying learning new cultures, and each Indian tribe is another culture.  So it's quite different.  Not so different, but different, again, from the Miccosukees down in Miami [Florida], to the Navajo out in Arizona and New Mexico, the Coeur d'Alene that are in Idaho, and so on.  I mean I've been to many different places with that project, and so all of these things.  I'm, I'm, I'm very much still working with children as an advocate, particularly with children with special needs.  Also in trying to recruit people to go into the field of teaching in educational administration, I'd like to really have--be a mentor to somebody that is in that field.  And that's what I'm kind of seeking now through our graduate schools and so on, and all, you know, my networks.  And so those are the kinds of things that I'm involved in now and hopes for the future.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 178500
Speaker 1: Tell me what, what would you see at this juncture as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  Well, it's hard to say.  I'd like to be known as a person who really cared for children and worked tirelessly to try to make things better for them, bring understanding to their conditions, and also to be known as a, as a kind of pioneer in many different areas of my life.  I'd, I'd like to be known as a person who tried to bring understanding for a group of people to a few people who may not otherwise know us.  Because I would say that, you know, I've been thrown, thrust into--and that includes black people.  You know, there are a lot of black people that don't know a person like me.  And when I was out in Kansas, and I went to--I, I had--I was invited to a lot of social events and activities and different things, and I was usually the only African American that was there.  And I would leave--because see, people in Kansas, back then, they didn't know anybody--they didn't, they didn't have any contact with people like me.  It was only--you know, I mean 'cause there, there just not out there.  You know, they're not there a lot, or at least willing to interact, to, to, to make themselves available to be know, if you know what I mean.  You probably can't even imagine this, living in a place like Chicago [Illinois], but, but--so I would go to these events, and I would purposely leave early so that people had a chance to talk about me and decide that I was okay.  And oftentimes, they said oh, you're so different.  Well, no, I'm not.  You know, with the people, all the friends I have and all the people that I know, I'm not so different.  I'm different here and, and very different from anybody you might see on TV, you know, not to, not to call names.  But who do I know that's like the actor on 'Sanford and Son'?  They're not even like that, really, you know.  This is all acting, but this is all that some people have to go on when they're judging people like me.  See what I mean?  So, I guess I'm just trying to extend myself in all corners so that other people can make judgments about us as African Americans that are based on real people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and people like me.
Story_ID: 178501
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Do differently?  No, I've had a wonderful life.  And being a teacher was fantastic 'cause I made it so.  I lived every day.  I mean it was so exciting.  I could hardly wait to go to school, and the kids could hardly wait to go to school, to get there, you know.  That's how teaching turned out to be.  So that was--I guess maybe I would have gone into it with more gusto, if I had it to do over again.  That's about all I can think of.  But going overseas was wonderful.  You know, they tried to keep me overseas, and offered me a wonderful job over there, a promotion.  And I chose Harry [Johnson], and I chose to come back, so that was perfect too.  We've been married twenty-nine years.  So, everything, you know, has been very, very wonderful thus far, and I hope it continues that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178502
Speaker 1: Well, this is a photo of my husband [Harry Johnson] and I.  I'm not sure when this was taken, but probably, I would say probably since we've been here in Washington [D.C.], so since 1978 about.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he had hair.
Speaker 2: All right, go ahead with your description.
Speaker 1: This was our wedding photo.  And this would have been taken April the 12th, 1974, in Kansas, in Leavenworth, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture that was probably taken when I was maybe one.  That's probably in about 1939.  In the picture is my Grandmamma Vassie Willis, and that's me.  And the picture was taken in, to the best of my recollection, in Tyler, Texas.
Speaker 2: Next, please.
Speaker 1: Now this during my teenage years, so this was probably taken in about '57' [1957], '56 [1956], and I was in Detroit [Michigan], which wasn't too terribly far from Chicago [Michigan], where I lived.
Speaker 2: Very good, next.
Speaker 1: I've always been known as a traveling person.  This me getting ready to go on a trip.  And the picture was taken in, at [Ronald Reagan Washington] National Airport, Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Approximate date or decade, if you can't remember the date?
Speaker 1: This was probably in about 1980 I would think, and probably I was going to my national convention.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This was taken about 1979.  At this point, I was a blonde.  I'd been in and out of blonde-dom many times, so.  But this was--I was trying to keep fit, obviously, riding the bike--stationary bicycle in the basement of our house in Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Yes, this is probably a picture from the time that I taught out in Studio City, and so I would say this was in the mid-'60s [1960s].  This picture is a picture of me.
Speaker 2: Very good, next.
Speaker 1: Again, a picture of me, Sandra, and this is my high school yearbook picture, so it would have been taken in 1953, in Chicago.  This is my Chicago Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] photograph.
Speaker 2: And my brother, my mother, and I--my mother, Eugenia Ford, my brother, John Ford, and I are sitting in front of our house at 6119 Champlain in Chicago.  This photo was probably taken in about 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay, photo please. Next.
Speaker 2: Well, this is John Ford, my dad, and me on the front steps of our house at 6119 Champlain in Chicago.  I would estimate, guesstimate that this photo was probably taken in 1944.
Speaker 1: Next, please.
Speaker 2: My brother and I.  He looks like he's probably about a year old, so that would have been around 1946.  My brother is John Ford, and I'm clenching him so he won't fall off that table.  He was quite a wiggler.
Speaker 1: And these--this is two pictures of me as a, as a very young person.  I was probably about two, so that would have been in ni--about 1940.  I look like I'm getting ready to explain something to someone (laughter).
Speaker 2: Next, please.
Speaker 1: Now this is a photograph that was taken at the wedding of Harry and I in, at the chapel at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  This was April the 12th, 1974, and in the picture are my mother, Eugenia Ford, me and Harry--Harry and I, and I think that is the priest there.  I'm not sure who that fourth person is.  There were only four of us there though, so, I assume that's the priest.
Speaker 2: Very good, next.
Speaker 1: Well, I was whispering something to President Bill Clinton, and it seems as though he's really listening. This picture was taken at the White House.  And it says on the picture that it was taken on April the 19th, the year 2000.
Speaker 2: All right, next.
Speaker 1: I do have his attention.  This, I'm assuming, my brother looks like he's probably about six years old, so this would have then made this about 1951 or '52 [1952].  And this picture was taken in the living room of my aunt in Kansas City, Missouri.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: This is a very precious picture.  This is a picture of my father and some of his siblings and their children, my first cousins.  My father's on the far right.  Next to him, standing--next to him is his sister, Lillian, my first cousin, Marsha, who lives in Atlanta now, my Grandmother Ford, my dad's mom, and next to Grandma Ford is her daughter, my Aunt Ima Jean [Merchison (ph.)], next to Aunt Ima Jean is Dr. Arthur Albright, who was the husband of Lillian, standing next to my dad, and then there's me.  Beneath them are all the children of Arthur Albright, Ima Jean Merchison, and John Ford.  My brother is on the lower right, standing next to my father.  The picture was taken in our living room in Chicago, Illinois, on Prairie Avenue.
Speaker 2: This is my grandma.  This is a very old picture of my grandma as a young person.  He name is Vassie Willis.  She took care of me as I grew up and was, still is, one of my very best friends.  She played the piano beautifully.
Speaker 1: This is my husband on the right, my niece and my extended fammy--family.  Her name is Tamara Jones Martin [ph.].  She's in the middle.  And my nephew Louit--John Louis Ford, Jr., or the third, is on the left.  That was taken in June--July of 2003.
Speaker 2: We're all first cousins in this picture.  And the picture was taken in Atlanta, Georgia, in August of 2003.  I'm on the left, next to me is my cousin, Eleen Yancy [ph.].  On the front row is Cousin Catherine Lowery [ph.], next to her is Cousin Marsha Hawkins [ph.], and the two gentlemen in the back in the center is Arthur Albright [ph.] and my brother, John Ford.
Speaker 1: This is one of my very dear, dearest friends and her significant other.  Her name is Marlene Kelly [ph.], and Marlene and I went to college together.  We've been friends ever since.  We were teenagers.  We used to play basketball together.  And her significant other is Fletcher Robinson.  This picture was actually taken at the nursing home where my mother lived.  This was a birthday party we had for her.  And Collington is located in Mitchellville, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Last Thanksgiving I was the moderator for a program we had with Native Americans at my church, St. Timothy's Episcopal Church.  And these are my Native American friends.  They came and lectured for the adult forum.  And the gentleman on the right did a very wonderful in full regalia, as you can see, a wonderful Native American dance.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Harry and I, and we are standing in front of the Heidelberg Castle, Heidelberg, Germany.  We took a trip to, back to Germany in 1999, I believe it was.  And at that point in time, Harry went for a walk in the Black Forest--
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my dear mother, Eugenia Ford, and one of my best friends, Barbara Caldwell, who is a resident of Chicago.  This picture was taken in Chicago.  And the reason that it is significant is that my mother is Barbara's godmother, and our families were best friends.
Speaker 1: I've always enjoyed sports, sporting events, and this is a picture of me that was taken probably in the 1960s.  It is taken in Acapulco, Mexico.  And that's me on the left on water skis with my water ski--my Mexican water ski instructor.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This is a family photo of my brother and I, my mother and her mother, my Grandma Willis.  It was taken in approximately, I would say 1970.  My father's not on the picture, so I have to assume he had just passed away.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me that was taken at the Vatican in Rome.  I am flanked by the Vatican guards who were there at the gate to meet me that day.  And I will say that I was wearing my very best dress.  I had a matching hat, but I was a not--I was not allowed to go in to see the pope.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me and one of my cousin, Cousin Leadan [ph.], that was taken at a family reunion in East Texas.  It was, the picture, I do believe was taken in 1994.
Speaker 1: This is my mom, Eugenia Ford, and my grandma, Vassie Willis.  And they are holding their oldest grandchild and great-grandchild, Alison Ford.  She's married now, and her name is Valen [ph.].
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: Two of my best friends.  I'm standing, and again, you see Dr. Kelly, Marlene Kelly, and the [HM] Reverend Cannon Nan [Arrington] Peete.  She was just, Cannon Pete was just elevated to that position last Sunday with an ordination at National Cathedral.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This is my mom's, a picture that was taken of our family at my mom's ninetieth birthday party, which was held mar--in March of 2002.  Here you see the family, Harry, my husband; John, my brother; next to him, my niece, Alison; nephew, Louis; my brother's wife, Hillary; standing tall behind is Alison's husband, Todd; me; my cousin, Eleen; and my niece, Jill; and of course, mother's wearing the fancy white hat.
Speaker 2: Picture of three of the most important people in my life, my mother on the far right, my grandma in the middle, Mrs. Willis, and my aunt, Mrs. Emily Dorsey.  This picture was taken on the front steps of our house at 6119 Champlain, Chicago, Illinois.  It was probably taken in about 1944.
Speaker 1: This is a classic photo of my father and his family.  These are his brothers and sisters and the parents.  I will say that my father is in the back row.  Along with him in the back row is my, from left to right, my Aunt Lillian, my Aunt Ima Jean, and on the far right is my Aunt Vera--and Mrs. Ford are in the center on, seated.  And on the left is my Uncle Wilber, and on the right is my Uncle Buddy.  This picture was probably taken in Tyler, Texas, I really don't know--
Speaker 2: --This is a more recent picture of my dad and my brother, taken in our home in Chicago, Illinois, on Calumet Avenue.  I would say that this picture was probably taken around 1961.
