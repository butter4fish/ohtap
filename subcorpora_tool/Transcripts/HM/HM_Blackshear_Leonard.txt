Story_ID: 208840
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where she was born and where she grew up and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was born in Georgia, we know for sure.  She was orphaned at an early age.  Her name is Elsie Blackshear.  But as it turns out, she found, we found information about her natural parents so her real name is Sarah Screven.  And--
Speaker 1: Could you spell Screven?
Speaker 2: S-C-R-E-V-E-N.
Speaker 1: And could you tell us a little bit about your mother's story, 'cause it's a, it's a great story, just in terms of her being adopted and how you were able to uncover this information?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'd be happy to.  Throughout her life my mother, who is now the other side of eighty, had known that she was an orphan and she had lived in an orphanage.  When her father died she, she and her two sisters were taken to an orphanage in Savannah, Georgia, Catholic orphanage.  And from there she was adopted by the Singfields.  And she was raised as their daughter, their adopted daughter.  And she knew she had these two sisters but she didn't know anything about them because they stayed in the orphanage when she left and she was never able to make connections with her family.
Speaker 1: How old was she when she was adopted?
Speaker 2: She was seven years old.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And she grew up, got married, her and her husband or my father [Frank Blackshear], and the two children, there were two of us then, there are now seven, moved to New York City [New York, New York] which is where we grew up.  And she knew simply that she had these two sisters but when she tried to search, she found that the orphanage had burned down and the records were no longer available.  So, and they would have been sealed anyway.  So she was at a loss as to how to make the connection.  Fast forward now decades, and she's now around eighty years old, this process started a couple, three years ago, I think she's now eighty-two so maybe when she was seventy-nine, a person here by the name of Judy Cabral began to say, let's see if we can track down your mother's parents.  And sure enough, her first thing was to say maybe the sisters sent the records to their headquarters in New England.  And so she called the headquarters of that particular order of nuns.  And when she called the lady said no they had no records but one woman who overheard the conversation said well wait a minute there were some boxes of some old records in the basement that we came across just a few weeks ago.  And as it turns out, providentially, in those records which were from that Savannah orphanage, was her adoption record from the orphanage which listed her real name and the names of some of her uncles and aunts who had to confer, who had to give up any claim on her so that the adoption would go through.  And from learning the name, we then found the records of her parents in the Georgia records and began to find her grandparents and we began to tell her all about her family and where they grew up and all of this.  But we couldn't find her sisters, searching high and low, looking through obituaries, looking everywhere, and then we came across the obituary of her oldest sister because we knew the name and on a, on a hunch in the obituary it said her sister's name which was completely different from the name we got from her.  But we tracked down this sister and could not find her until just after she died and we came across her obituary in the paper--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it named her daughter.  And we searched around and got a phone number for her daughter and called her on the telephone.  And it turned out that she was the daughter of my mother's sister and we discovered this whole family.  And the daughter having just lost her mother, her aunt, and as we found out an uncle, 'cause there was a brother that she didn't even know she had, we discovered all of them and she was just absolutely thrilled to find her family, my mother.  And, and the, the niece, Joanne [ph.] was thrilled to find another member of the family who had been in the family, the long lost Sarah.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: Amazing story.  After seventy-some odd years that she should find her family.  And I went on a cruise just a few months ago that went through the Bahamas and when I was there, I, and when we got off the boat in Nassau [Bahamas] and we had set this meeting up in advance, I met cousins that three years ago I didn't even know I had.  It was just wonderful.  So now we have to go back to Nassau and we found our home place which is up there in one of the outer islands, Eleuthera, Eleuthera, the Bahamas is where my mother's people come from.  And I found that out just a couple of weeks ago.
Story_ID: 208841
Speaker 1: Tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Amazing.
Speaker 1: --a little bit about how your mother [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] grew up in Savannah [Georgia].  Did she ever share any stories with you about growing up there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she grew up as kind of a Jewish--I mean, she grew up in Savannah as kind of a black princess, if you understand my meaning.  And her adopted father [George Singfield] was a postman, and in those days that was one of the really high level jobs and he was in everything, and so she had a very comfortable childhood.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like during that time period?
Speaker 2: Well, she went to a high school called [Alfred E.] Beach High School [Savannah, Georgia].  And she, I'm trying to think if there were any stories--
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about segregation during that time, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Actually, no.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: As I think about it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They probably protected her from a lot of that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Sure.  Well, let's talk a little bit about your father [Frank Blackshear].  Now, starting with, actually let me ask you this, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: She is a very sweet, caring, engaging person, and to know her in one meeting is to know somebody you really like and wanna be friends with.
Story_ID: 208842
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father, starting with his name and where he grew up and that kind of thing and where he was born.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Frank Blackshear.  And as it turns out, he was born in New York City [New York, New York].  And his father [Nathaniel Blackshear, Sr.] had left his family in Florida many years prior to his birth, and had gone to Savannah [Georgia] and had gotten a college degree in Savannah but in those days if you have a college degree if you didn't go into the government or something the really high level job was to be a porter on the railroad that was like, you know, a shi shi foo foo job in those days in the black community.  So he was a porter and he ran between Savannah and New York on the trains.  His wife had died leaving him with three children to care for and they were in New York.  So he brought them back to Savannah for the family to take care of but no wanted to take care of them, all three, they would only break them up and he didn't wanna break them up.  So he left them with a kind of a fake godmother who was willing to take all three, you know, this is the African extended family concept that a lot of white communities are not familiar with but it's very familiar in the black community, we have aunts and uncles and people we're not related to--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Play aunts and play cousins.
Speaker 2: --and there are all those play aunts, right.  So this woman took care of her.  She wasn't that good at parenting, so he and his brother [Nathaniel Blackshear] were allowed to run the streets.  Now if he had grown up under his father's tutelage, it might have been different because he was essentially an educated man, but this woman did the best she could with these three kids.  And, you know, they were really like street.  So he grew up but he had great aspirations.  He wanted to get into the electronics field.  He took a correspondence course that allowed him to get Class C radio license so that he could work in the industry in radio which was, you know, leading edge.  That's like getting into the software business today, but he saw it and wanted to get into it then.  But in Georgia no one would hire him even though he had the credentials and he had the training, no one would hire him because they said, "You can be a porter in the hospital but you can't work in the electronics industry."  And he was determined to be in the electronics industry.  So he gathered us up, I'm six months old, I got an older brother [Frank Blackshear, Jr.], he gathered us all up and took us to New York which is where our family grew up, and he worked in the electronics industry.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: He was more stern.  He was the disciplinarian in the family, you know, "Just wait 'til your father gets home," (laughter) you know, everybody's familiar with that.  But he was determined that his kids would be accomplished kids.  So, and so we all have emerged as, you know, reasonably accomplished people in our various ways.
Story_ID: 208843
Speaker 1: You told us a little bit about your ancestry on your mother's [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] side, how much do you know about your ancestry on your father's [Frank Blackshear] side, like your paternal origin?
Speaker 2: Well that's an interesting story as well.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because as it turns out these--oh, I didn't tell you that when the kids were young, the father [Nathaniel Blackshear, Sr.] dies and they don't even know where, they just know he's died somewhere out on the railroads.  And so all they know is that now they have nothing, they have no parents, people, he heard that they had some land and people are pushing documents in front of them to sign documents, they don't know what they are.  And so they felt that they had given up some of their family resources, but being kids they didn't know.  So anyway fast forward, now when they were kids, someone had come through and told them in school that they had parents in Florida in a place called Marianna [Florida].  And they remembered that--
Speaker 1: That they had parents there?
Speaker 2: They had people.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --in Marianna.  And they remembered that because two of the children got to the office to hear this story but the third one, the oldest didn't make it.  So the two younger ones who had the information always lorded it over the older one that he didn't get the information about our people in Marianna County [sic. Jackson County, Florida].  So they remembered that, and he remembered it, and he told us.  And we just said fine, that's all nice.  And we've got family in New York [New York] because, you know, his brother [Nathaniel Blackshear, Jr.] came to New York too and then we had family, so that was our New York family.  And then we had an aunt [Dorothy Blackshear Carter] in Savannah [Georgia] and that was all we knew.  My brother, my older, no, my younger brother [Dwight Blackshear], is in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  So he's going to Pensacola [Florida] for some training.  He decides to stop in Marianna County which is near Pensacola.  While he's there he's looking through the phone book for Blackshears and he calls one, it's a lot of white Blackshears, and we don't know that they're related, we think they may be, we just haven't found the proof, but these weren't our Blackshears.  So he's talking to a cabbie and he says, "Oh, I know Blackshears but she's a Garris [ph.] now, why don't you call her?"  So he calls this woman, Garris, and it turns out that she is a member of the Blackshear family and they're having a reunion so he and one of our other, my uncle, go and there's all these Blackshears, all these people that look like us.  And there's a story about the older Blackshear who had twelve children, one of whom left and never came back, and his name was Nathan.  And my father's father was named Nathan.  And we started connecting stuff and we found out that this is our family.  And the next reunion we all poured into that reunion and we met a fellow by the name of Fred Blackshear and this Fred Blackshear, who is the patriarch now of the family, tells us that he is the one who years ago had come to Savannah to tell them this story about they had people in Marianna County.  I meant to say, I said Marianna, I meant Jackson County in Florida.  And that's how we connected.
Story_ID: 208844
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your grandparents, your mother's [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] adopted parents, did you spend a lot of time with them growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they were very fine people.  And we had a very nice time whenever we went down there.  In those days it was segregation so we used to drive down so, you know, we saw all the signs, you can't eat here and all of that and going down Tobacco Road [North Carolina] which is where you went when you went south.  So we learned face to face what southern segregation was about, but when we were there, we felt protected in their bosom because we didn't get exposed to it a lot 'cause we lived in a black community, we get money, we go to the theater, and we just had a grand time.  So for us it was always an interesting and exciting experience.  There was always plenty of food on the table and the rule was that he would, the--my grandfather would say, "Boy, you can have as much as you want, but eat everything you take."  And that has stuck to me (laughter) to the present day and I'm just now learning that it's okay to leave some food on the plate (laughter).
Speaker 1: What were your grandparents' name?
Speaker 2: It was George Singfield and Carmen Singfield.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Sing--
Speaker 2: I think that's the adopted grandparents.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's, S-I-N-G-F-I-E-L-D.
Speaker 1: And what about your paternal grandparents, did you know them?  And I know you said your grandfather was Nathan.
Speaker 2: Was Nathaniel, and I don't know what my grandmother's name was.  Now that's the natural grandparents, I don't have handy the name of the woman who raised them, the godmother--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --who raised them.  And my mother's natural grandparents were Will Screven and Jeanette Simonet [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from Eleuthera in the Bahamas--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and he was from South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean it's a great thing to know your people.
Story_ID: 208845
Speaker 1: So could you give us the names of your siblings and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I can give you birth order but don't ask me for birth dates.
Speaker 1: No, no that's fine--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --just birth order and names.
Speaker 2: The oldest is Frank Blackshear [Jr.], I'm the second oldest, [HistoryMaker] Leonard Blackshear; the next, number three, is Elsie Blackshear and now Elsie Chapman; the next one is George Blackshear, and George is the one who went in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps], and made the family connection; the next one, three, four, the fifth one is Carmen Blackshear, and the sixth, and she's now Carmen Shortt; the sixth one is George Blackshear; and the seventh one is Nannearl Blackshear now Nannearl, Nannearl Jordan.
Speaker 1: And I think you said George twice.
Speaker 2: Let's see, there's Frank, in order it's Frank, Elsie, I'm sorry.  The order is Frank Blackshear, Leonard Blackshear, Elsie Blackshear Chapman, Dwight Blackshear who was the Marine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then Carmen Blackshear, then George Blackshear and then Nannearl Blackshear Jordan.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Nannearl?
Speaker 2: N-A-N-N-E-A-R-L. Nannearl.
Story_ID: 208846
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Leonard] Blackshear, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Actually, the earliest memory I can keep in mind is that when I was in kindergarten, they were taking the class picture and they turned my chair a little to face the camera and they took that picture.  And I remember them moving my chair. And interestingly enough, I have that picture from kindergarten.
Story_ID: 208847
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about what holidays were like in your house growing up and special occasions: birthdays, Christmas, Thanksgiving, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were always lots of fun.  And, you know, plenty of food to eat.  And we would have the, often get together with family and have family, our cousins and aunt [Dorothy Blackshear Carter] and that and uncle [Nathaniel Blackshear, Jr.] and that type of thing.  So for us they were very pleasant and enjoyable occasions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was daily life like for you growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, we were expected to perform in school and so when we came home, it was first homework and then other things, that was the routine, but we thoroughly enjoyed the other things (laughter).  And interestingly enough, my father [Frank Blackshear] would bring things into the house that he wouldn't necessarily use but he felt were necessary to be available to us.  For example, he always ensured that we had encyclopedias plus the updates, and if he had too many updates, he would get a new set of encyclopedias or in those days it was 'The Book of Knowledge' ['The Children's Encyclopedia'] and then it became the ['Encyclopedia] Britannica.'  So he also kept music that he liked, you know, the 78s and, and 33 1/3 of jazz and, you know, 'In The Mood,' some of those kind of things or from the '40s [1940s], which was his time, and we learned to like that music.  Interestingly enough, he also had Book of the Month Club stuff with classical music.  And our cabinet thing that we had, where we stored the stuff, was stuffed with all this classical music, a lot of it largely unopened, because he probably never, he never had time to listen to it.  We became interested in it, and so we started opening it and we started listening to it, and we said, man this is good stuff.  So we would sit around, the three older ones, 'cause that was when we first made the discovery, we would play classical music, [Antonin] Dvorak, [Frederic] Chopin, yeah, all of these guys, and we would make up stories and scenes of what's going on, like in the 'New World Symphony' ['Symphony No. 9 in E minor,' Antonin Dvorak], that's a real good visual piece where you can make up a lot of stuff going on because of the tempo in the music, the 'Russian Easter [Festival] Overture, Op. 36,' [Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov] real good, lot of tempo.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: So we used to just enjoy classical music as youngsters because it helped us to image.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on and can you kind of describe your block and your community for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, we lived on a street called Remington Street [New York, New York].  And at that time, when we first moved there, it was a predominantly white community.  And it stayed predominantly white for a long time although, you know, more black people moved in.  But then there were a lot of other folks moving in, Italians, and there so that the community turned out, when we were growing up to be a kind of an international community.  And our block turned out to be a big family block.  I mean at that time we had six, the seventh one was an accident so she came a lot later, I was twenty-one when she came along (laughter).  So, the family across the street from us ultimately had, one of them had fourteen kids, another one had seven kids, another guy in the same block as us but just up the street, also had fourteen kids, actually those two families we said were in a race.  And then one family was always behind the other one until they had twins, and which brought them to fourteen and the other at fourteen, they decided to quit at that time.  So we had a lot of kids to play with.
Story_ID: 208848
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Actually one of the things, and I have to give my father [Frank Blackshear] a lot of credit, he was stern and a lot of people considered him to be real hard taskmaster and there's a lot of reason to lay that blame on him for some of the things he did but at the same time he ensured that there were certain things that happened and I guess some of this was my mother's [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] influence too, to ensure that we were exposed to stuff.  For example, I have pictures of us in various places around New York [New York], Grant's Tomb [General Grant National Memorial, New York, New York] and other places where we would go.  We would go to parks during the summer and enjoy the grassy areas.  We would take a trip to Washington, D.C. and go to all the monuments and get exposed to all of that.  So my parents made sure that we were exposed to things that help us to know more than our neighborhood.  And later on, when I was a young person when I was working with a project called Harlem Youth [Opportunities] Unlimited [HARYOU] in Harlem [New York, New York], I began to realize how important that was because in those days, when I worked in Harlem, I met many people who had never been outside of a twelve-block radius from where they were born.
Speaker 1: So what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Oh, that was the original question.  Good for you.  Well, I'd have to say there's a piece, I forget, I forgot who wrote it, escapes my mind right off but there was a piece that my sister was always playing on the piano, it was a [Ludwig van] Beethoven piece that she would always be playing for her piano practice when I was young.  So this, that piece always reminds me of my youth because I would be coming home from school and she'd be doing that piano practice.  I would go and get a nice Kaiser roll with a nice sandwich with mayonnaise on it, and I would sit around and eat that and have some Kool-Aid and listen to her playing the piano.  So that really gave me a nice homey feeling.  Also around the holidays we were always fixing up, so we would be doing painting and this type of stuff.  So when today, when we're doing painting I still get a feeling of that festive time because there was that connection between the smell of paint and the holidays.
Speaker 1: So the smell of paint, the sound of your sister playing the piano and what sight?
Speaker 2: I guess from a sight standpoint it would, I guess it would be home.  That place on Remington Street [New York, New York] had a special place in our hearts.  So I'd have to say there was a sight.
Story_ID: 208849
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about elementary school.  Can you tell us the name of your elementary school and what your elementary school years were like?
Speaker 2: Well, I know I went to P.S. 50 [Talfourd Lawn Elementary School, New York, New York], and I have few memories.  The only, I remember what I liked the most was that in the afternoon if they hadn't sold all the sandwiches, they would bring the sandwiches around in these big containers and they would let the kids have free sandwiches.  So on occasion we would have the pleasure of getting these free sandwiches, which to me was a wonderful treat to be there and, you know, in the middle of the afternoon getting these, which usually as I remember turned out to be cottage cheese or cream cheese on raisin bread.  Gee it's amazing I can remember that.  But they were really great sandwiches.  I remember my kindergarten teacher and she was a red head, and I don't know where she is now, Mrs., I can't, Casagrande [ph.] something like that, anyway I remember her.  And I don't recall having a lot of conversations with her but my mother [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] tells me that I was always putting the family's business in the street with her, you know, oh, we got a, yeah, we, we're expecting, it was this, that, and the other.  So I must have spent a lot of time talking with her.  I remember my fifth grade teacher Mrs. Gooba [ph.] and what I remember is that she was heavy but I must say that's all I remember.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I remember most my sixth grade teacher Ms. Benham [ph.].  And Ms. Benham was a serious, stern, thin, intense teacher with gray hair.  I remember her well.  And she was no nonsense.  And I have to tell you we learned a lot under Ms. Benham's tutelage.  And one of the things that she did at the beginning of the semester, she said, "For those of you who don't act right I have this eighteen-inch ruler," that she had.  No, it wasn't, it must have been, that's a long, yeah, no, it was eighteen-inch, yeah, foot and a half, rulers and she said if anybody didn't behave that they were gonna feel the ruler and she showed us that she had a drawer full of these rulers.  And we didn't realize why until as we were moving through, through the year, that if there was an infraction you had to hold your hands out and you were gonna feel the eighteen-inch ruler on your hands which she dispensed with generosity.  And on many occasion, when she applied the ruler, the ruler broke, which is why she had a drawer full of rulers.  And at the end of the year, that drawer was practically empty.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What were some of your favorite subjects in high school, I mean junior, in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I guess that wouldn't be allowed today but it got us taught back then.  Those were the days before parents would rush to the school--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --and said with the, ooh, you got some nerve hitting my kid, blah, blah, blah.  She didn't hurt us in such a way that we were injured but she did hurt us, the flat of our hands in such a way that we paid attention, I have to say that.  And I assume she's gone now which is why I relate the story.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I don't really recall, but I think that over time that I seemed to have a propensity and an interest for science and math and that kind of stuff.  But in elementary school, no, they didn't really, the day was integrated, it wasn't like this course, this course, this course.  I mean it was all integrated into the day.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It wasn't 'til you got to what we called junior high, today it's middle school, that you begin to have separate courses at separate times.
Story_ID: 208850
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you, and what kind of child were you at this time during the elementary school years [at P.S. 50, Talfourd Lawn Elementary School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I must have been a good student.  I don't remember all the details.  I do remember that had started school a year early for various reasons.  And when I left elementary school and went to junior high school, I went into what they call the SP Program, or the Special Progress, which meant instead of spending three years in junior high, I spent two years.  So by the time I left junior high I was two years up--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on my education.
Speaker 1: But going back to the elementary school years--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what, how would, what kind of child were you?  How would you describe yourself?  Were you obedient or a little mischievous, what kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I would, again I don't recall at all, but I think that I tended to be more of a good student.  In fact, I was on--I was a crossing guard.  In those days, they had the youngsters were part of the crossing guard system and each of us wore these, well they were like John Brown belts [sic. Sam Browne belts] across the chest and then around the waist and they were white, I remember that.  And, and then you had in the middle of it a badge that said triple A on it, and you are--you had some responsibility and authority.  And at that time, interestingly enough, I was the lieutenant of all the crossing guards.  I wasn't the captain, I reported to Anthony Favarulo.  And I thought that I could do a better job leading the crossing guards than he did 'cause he was, you know, not assertive, he let things go when things needed to be done.  But I think probably in those days and in that time they would probably not have favored my being captain of the crossing guard.  So I had a grand time as the being the lieutenant, the number two of all the crossing guards.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was good.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Did you have dreams and aspirations during the elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Wow, you keep asking me about this stuff and, you know, I'm figuring well, okay.  I talked about the chair being moved we were done (laughter).  But I think in those days I must have had--I knew I read a lot of comic books, so I probably had, you know, heroic visions.  And we listened to the radio and, '[The] Lone Ranger' and all those guys that were on the radio.  And I even remember some of those intro songs to this day.  But the interest that I had probably tended towards investigatory stuff.  My mom [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] tells me I was always experimenting with stuff.  Always taking things apart, so I think I had a lot of interest in scientific investigation.

Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church, and if so, what were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Yes, we attended church regularly, and we were required to.  My father [Frank Blackshear] got away with it a lot and he didn't go, but mom [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] was regular and that meant we were regular.  And at the time I went to a church called Brooks Memorial [United] Methodist Church [New York, New York].  And I was active in the youth programs.  I was active in the Cub Scouts at that time in the church.  And I advanced to the highest level in the Cub Scouts which was Webelos.  And then I went on to the Boy Scouts [of America] but that's a little bit later.  But I was a very good Cub Scout and in the Cub Scouts I advanced to den chief, which meant that I was one of the guys who ran a little group of scouts.  So I was in leadership in the scouts, I guess I was in leadership in the scouts and I was in leadership in school--

Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about junior high school.  What was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: The junior high was [Edgar D.] Shimer Junior High [School, New York, New York] about--
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-H-I-M-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in junior high school?
Speaker 2: I think, again, I don't recall all the details but your questioning seems to find some of them.  But I think in junior high I wasn't as good a student because I remember seeing red on my report card and in junior high in the SP Program, seventy-five [percent] was passing, normally sixty-five was passing but in SP seventy-five--
Speaker 1: What's SP?
Speaker 2: Special Progress.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We were in it, that's the accelerated program in junior high.  So, and I was probably beginning to discover the world at large and wasn't paying attention and stuff but I was still an investigative and inquisitive kid.  And I do remember one time working with a magnifying glass in the back of the school one day and setting something on fire but it wasn't anything earth shaking.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: But I distinctly remember that.
Speaker 1: And who is influencing you at this particular time in your life when you were in early adolescence?
Speaker 2: I think that at Shimer there was a teacher, Mrs. Ritner [ph.], I think that was her name.  And she was a math teacher who really had an influence on the youngsters both in terms of helping them to see what they could and should do in life, and helping at least me to get a wonderful appreciation for the world of mathematics 'cause she was my math teacher, but she was so much more.
Story_ID: 208853
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school that you attended?
Speaker 2: It was [Edgar D.] Shimer Junior High School [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: Oh, high school.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I went to John Adams High School [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, high school was different because when I went to high school I had caught up with my brother, and so now we were both in the same grade.  And I imagine that was some embarrassment for him because here I was, younger than he was, and I was in the same grade.  So, and I was beginning to feel my oats and I was a sharp dresser and all that stuff.  And, you know, I would give no quarter and sometimes I had mouth.  And sometimes, I would get into an altercation and he wouldn't come to my aid because it was like you get in it, you get out of it.  Although, in a lot of other cases I'm sure he would say hey, don't mess with my brother.  And to me there was a little bit of concern there because his name was Frank [Blackshear, Jr.] and among all his peers, and he was a really outgoing, friendly guy.  To know him for an hour is to have a guy you wanna be friends with.
Speaker 1: So he was like your mother [Elsie Singfield Blackshear]?
Speaker 2: He was like my mom, still is--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: -to this very day.  And they would call him Frank but instead of calling me [HistoryMaker] Leonard [Blackshear] they would call me Little Frank (laughter).  So, but we got along, we got through high school.
Speaker 1: And what--were you involved in any clubs or activities during high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I can't remember the clubs, what I remember more of was sports.  And the sport I decided to go out for was track, which again my brother was in track.  And he also played basketball, I wasn't as much into sports but I decided track, you didn't have a lot of equipment, all you had to do was run so that was easy to learn, so I figured I could do it, all I had to do was learn to run fast (laughter).  Seemed pretty simple.  So I went out for track.  So we both ran, and I never did that well in track, and he, in fact, did very well.  And, in fact, he did a 440[-yard] relay during his time that ended up being a record that ended up in the almanac unbroken for many years.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And so that's something he points to with pride and I point to it with pride as well.  I'm just not that big on sports but I tried.
Speaker 1: And during high school what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: My thoughts about college were that I was expected to go (laughter).  So I wanted to go to college and take engineering.  And which is probably as those who have been through it, it is a very rigorous program but I thought I could do it, and a lot of that was probably influenced by my father [Frank Blackshear].
Speaker 1: And who, do you remember some of your friends in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some of them were people from the neighborhood 'cause we were all going to school together.  We didn't, we weren't like clubby like that and I never had that clubby feeling even in college with people.  But I do remember that in those days, the neighborhoods were changing and gangs were coming into the focus.  And in our areas, between us and high school, there were two gangs operating, and we were expected to be in one or the other gang, which was tough for us.  And the rule that was handed down by my father was no gangs, or pay with your life.  So that was a tough spot for us because we had to be in a gang but we weren't allowed to be in any gang.  So what we decided to do, I mean the three older ones, 'cause there are the big ones and the little ones and the first three were the big ones, so what my brother and I decided to do is that we would go the diplomatic route, and we made friends in both gangs.  So we were allowed to pass because we weren't affiliated with any gangs and we were likable guys.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of activities were the gangs involved in at that time?  Were they--
Speaker 2: They were fighting.  I remember one guy very well, I had known him from sixth grade, I think he got through sixth grade copying off my paper.  So I had known him and he was a guy who was known for attacking people with a crowbar, you know, this kind of stuff, real violent guy but we got along fine.  And there were guys like that out there and we passed through.  And I remember when we were living in fear one time, there was a known numbers operation that got started in the neighborhood which we had heard about and we had let our father know about, and we were horrified, I mean terrorized to find out that our father had called the police on the numbers operation.  And we were terrified that if the word got out, we were literally toast.  So for months we were walking tiptoe through the neighborhood for fear that these people, some of whom we know, would find out that we were involved in the operation being shut down.  So we had some, (laughter) we learned how to survive in a changing environment.	And it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 208854
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from high school [John Adams High School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Besides Mrs. Ritner [ph.], no.
Speaker 1: Who do you think most influenced you during the high school years?
Speaker 2: Probably in terms of performance, you know, in terms of you better get this, would be my father [Frank Blackshear] and my mother [Elsie Singfield Blackshear], 'cause for different reasons they encouraged us and inspired us.
Speaker 1: And what were some, some of the things you did with your spare time?  Did you like ever have a job during high school, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I had a lot of jobs.  And I can remember one job I had, I was a page at the library nearby.  And I remember that job very well.  My job was to take all the books that were on the cart and then go down through the various, you know, shelves and then refile all the books.  That was my job.  And I kept getting caught by the librarians reading the books, and to the point where I think I got laid off because I was spending too much time reading books.  And it's interesting because years later, I was involved in a project in Rotary [International] that I started called Books for International Goodwill [(B.I.G.) Annapolis, Maryland] where we ship hundreds, or have shipped hundreds of thousands of book overseas which we can talk about later, but the thing the rule was that anybody who was helping us to sort books, if they came across a book they liked, they were not asked to read it but to put it aside and keep it and take it home because their time was more valuable to us sorting than spending the time reading.  And that must hearken back in some way to those days when I used to read in the library.
Speaker 1: What other kinds of jobs did you have in high school?
Speaker 2: I had a job as a stock boy at a local department store.  And I was pretty good.  But, you know, those times, you know, black and white in those days but probably a little harder for blacks.  But, unfortunately, I was probably a little cocky because I remember one day that they, that my boss was showing off the work of the stock boys, and we were lining up all these flats which are like things that you push, at waist high you push 'em, and then they're flat on the bottom, and you use 'em to push around boxes and this type of stuff.  So we were lining up all of these flats on a little line along the tile, and this guy was a real, you know, you had to do what you were told, but he was not an enjoyable boss.  So to be, and I shouldn't have done this, but I was being funny, when the other guys were lining up these things on this line, I was acting like a flight controller on an aircraft carrier giving signals to planes coming in for a landing, that kind of visual stuff where your hands are going back and forth and then when the plane comes to the right stop, you wave 'em down like you shut off your engines, all that kind of stuff, which I learned by being out at the airport watching the planes being brought in with the guys bringing the planes and the parking so I know how they did it plus you saw that on television, so I was doing that stuff.  I don't think my boss liked that 'cause shortly after that I got laid off (laughter).  Boy I was, I must have been a cheeky kid (laughter).

Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from [John Adams] High School [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: In '59 [1959].  And that was a couple years early.
Speaker 1: And where were you thinking you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, keep in mind, I think my birthday's in June, and I had just turned sixteen and I was going off to college.  And I wanted to go to The City College of New York [New York, New York], which had the best engineering program in the city.  And I applied and I was so disappointed when they didn't accept me, because they said my grades weren't good enough.  So I ended up being--going into despair, and wondering if I ever really wanted to go to college, but my dad [Frank Blackshear] said, "You're going to college."  And he pushed me and made me apply to one of the other city colleges which was Hunter [College, New York, New York], which was just then, it was a girls school was becoming co-ed, and I was accepted there and went to their male campus which was way up in the northern part of New York City in a borough called the Bronx [New York, New York], I lived in Queens [New York, New York].  So I went there to start my college.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: Well, first you have to appreciate that to get to Hunter College from Queens I had to like start out like, 5:30 in the morning to get on the subway to go all the way up to the Bronx to start school to get there for, I mean, I had to get up at 5:30 and then be on the train by 6:30 to get up there for an eight o'clock class.  So it was not, I was worn out--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --by the time I got to school but I went through the courses.  And I think I started out being a good student but then I got involved in community projects.  Throughout my life I ended up working in the community, getting involved in the community, if it wasn't the Cub Scouts it was the Boy Scouts [of America], if it wasn't the Boy Scouts and church, it was MYF [Mobilization for Youth], I was president of MYF, I was a troop leader in the Boy Scouts.  So I keep getting these positions of responsibility which take time.
Story_ID: 208856
Speaker 1: And then when I was going to college [Hunter College, New York, New York], I got involved with HARYOU and then got involved with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  What's HARYOU?
Speaker 1: Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited.  It was a major program that was getting underway in Harlem [New York, New York] to help deal with youth programs, and I was there during the research phase with a person by the name of Kenneth [B.] Clark, who today is a renowned--he's passed now, but he was a renowned child psychologist.  He was running the program.  So I was working in the youth component that they had there and it was taking up time and taking away from my school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it shouldn't have, but it did.  And I wasn't doing that well in school because of that community involvement.
Speaker 2: And so what happened?  Did you have to make a choice between the community involvement and school?
Speaker 1: It eventually, I didn't wanna make that choice, so it eventually came to the point where I was having a difficult time doing the day thing at the campus.  They were having a difficult time having me there 'cause my grade point average was declining so we both agreed that probably I should go into the night course downtown at the downtown campus, which they did.  And I probably went on payroll at HARYOU, which is to say I didn't leave the program--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I got more involved in the program.
Speaker 2: And they, they had a really big budget for the early '60s [1960s], didn't they?
Speaker 1: Yes, which was shocking.  But the Kennedys were behind this and it was a showplace thing and the people that were behind it were so distinguished that for, I think, like a three-year youth program in central Harlem they applied a budget of two hundred million dollars.
Speaker 2: And what kinds of programs were you all developing?
Speaker 1: All kinds.  They had after school programs and daycare programs.  We had programs where youth would learn how to operate businesses.  We had paramilitary organizations where kids could learn discipline and how to function in a disciplined, structured environment.  We had all kinds of programs going.
Speaker 2: And what was your responsibility with the organization?
Speaker 1: My program, keeping in mind that I was fairly young--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --because now I'm getting around, I guess, seventeen, eighteen, I was a youth organizer in helping to get youth involved.  They felt that one of the ways to get youth involved was to have a youth corps.  And I was part of that youth corps and one of the organizers to be out in the community making young people aware, get them involved in the programs, working in the programs to learn about the programs.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that was my job.
Speaker 2: And how were you balancing working during the day and going to school at night?
Speaker 1: Not well, 'cause my grades were suffering in school 'cause I wasn't doing my homework.  And it wasn't a matter of capability, it was a matter of you gotta put in the time to do this stuff, science is hard.  You know, I mean, I remember when I was--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you don't study.
Speaker 1: --taking physics--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and when I was taking physics and I was studying I would get five questions to answer over the weekend and I would usually wait 'til Sunday morning to start, and to answer those five questions took all day Sunday.  That's the way it was, if you were gonna do well in your physics, 'cause it was really hard.  So but if I wasn't doing it all day, I wasn't doing well in physics.  I mean it came down to that.  So my grades suffered to the point where I said I probably should drop out--
Speaker 2: What were your--
Speaker 1: --of college.
Speaker 2: --what were your parents [Frank Blackshear and Elsie Singfield Blackshear], more particularly your father's thoughts about that?
Speaker 1: Well, needless to say, he was somewhat eviscerated (laughter) because I was coming home late too, 'cause I was at all these things with these young people and then getting on the subway in Manhattan [New York, New York] and coming home, it was hard and sometimes, I had befriended Malcolm X while I was up there and he lived Queens and I lived in Queens, so many a night he would either stop by there or I would go down to the Temple [Mosque No.] 7 [Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York], which is what he was the minister of in Harlem, and he would give me a ride home, which was great, 'cause I got home earlier than if I had to take the subway, and we had an opportunity to have a lot of interaction, but normally I would get home late.  And my father said that he was in charge of the house and that he had his requirements and if I couldn't meet his requirements then my option was to be out of the house.
Speaker 2: So what did you opt to do?
Speaker 1: I left the house.  So now here I am, I guess I was about eighteen at the time, full of vim and vigor, I'm sure I'm on the right course of life, and so I'm moving over to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association, YMCA] which also happened to be the headquarters of this youth program.
Story_ID: 208857
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your relationship with Malcolm X, how it was that you came to meet him and develop this relationship.
Speaker 2: Well, I was curious about the Muslims, so I had gone down to the Temple [Mosque No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York], they have a restaurant, well they had a, in those days they had a restaurant at the temple.  It wasn't what it is today which is much more of a show place.  In those days it was much more demure.  But I would go there to eat and they had nice bean pies that they were selling back then.  And I got to meet Malcolm and I got meet his right-hand man, named Captain Joseph [Gravitt; Imam Yusuf Shah] who was in charge of the Fruit, which is the Fruit of Islam or the FOI.  So and we got to be great chatting buddies, and I was well read on stuff so, and Malcolm was too, very well read.  So we had very good conversations.  So we became friends and he invited me to the temple and I'd come to some of the meetings at the temple to hear some of the presentations, when they had services and, and they would try to recruit me for the temple and they never recruited me but they always tried.  So because we got to know each other, and I would go to some of his rallies and Malcolm's presentations were very timely because he would not be, how would you say, overt by people, well these people claiming they're experts and they're Ph.D.s--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and all this stuff.  And they would come out with all their facts, Malcolm would come out with all his facts and cite all his references to make his points, which to me impressed me as an intelligent, aware, sensitive, unafraid black man who wasn't afraid to speak out.  So that was Malcolm.  And I enjoy, I was glad to have the opportunity to be friends with him at that time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I was glad to have the opportunity to have conversations with him when he was giving me a ride home.  And I was especially glad for the ride home (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why weren't they able to convert you?
Speaker 2: Because I thought that there were some aspects of their policies that I could not accept, like when you go to the service, all the women sat on one side and all the men sat on another side.  And there were other strictures and policies that I thought, you know, like I did not, I did not particularly agree with the fact that all white people were devils, and that was a main thing.  And their main method of conversion was tapping into black anger and using that, the hatred that comes out of that anger as the conversion process.  And I wasn't as angry because I knew a lot about both sides of the issue and I knew that anger was counterproductive.  So it was hard for them to tap into that root, which was their major source of conversion to get me into the group.
Story_ID: 208858
Speaker 1: And what was it like living at the Y [Young Men's Christian Association, YMCA]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I kept a lot to myself in the Y.  I had a room which I later learned was a corner small room that, because I didn't know about the Y they put me in, because the other people in the Y had a lot of bigger rooms.  And much to my surprise later, I learned that the Y had a lot of gay guys living there and I didn't know that.  But I do recall sometimes hearing tipping up and down the halls late at night but I didn't know what that was all about and nor do I to this day.  But my stay at the Y was pleasant.  I had, you know, they had good food in the restaurant downstairs and a decent clean room upstairs, which became packed with my books.  But I would say it was a pleasant experience.  And I worked--and the space that I worked in, was in some office space in the Y, so it was a short commute.
Speaker 1: And do you remember how much it cost to stay there then?
Speaker 2: I think at that time it was running me about fifteen dollars a week.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that wasn't bad until I got released from my job at HARYOU [Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited, New York, New York] and had no income.  And then I couldn't afford that fifteen dollars so things were getting really rough in those days.
Speaker 1: So once you got released from your job at HARYOU, what were you thinking you were gonna do?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't sure because I was now out of school, out of work, you know, I came out of school [Hunter College, New York, New York] because I was committed to this youth program.  A lot of the kids in the program who weren't as committed, felt that my commitment made me a threat to their agenda and they were from the neighborhood.  And there were things disappearing, they saw this as just a big thing of a bunch of people coming into the community, wanting to do all this stuff, and they were just talking advantage of it, you know, getting all the freebies and all the perks.  And unfortunately I was for the program and for the success of the program, so then I was an outsider and possibly a threat.  So they started talking about me to my boss and saying things about me that were untrue.  But the boss was like into, I'm in touch with the community blah, blah, blah, so he believed them.  He wasn't from the area either, he was a very well-known writer too, by the way.  I won't call his name, he's passed now but he then let me go on the basis of their testimony which was untrue, which I told him was untrue but he, his thing was to keep peace on the streets I had to go.  Which was totally unfair and was black-on-black injustice.  But that being the case, I was still on the street (laughter) call you or call it what it may.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you ever think you were gonna go back home?
Speaker 2: No.  My mom [Elsie Singfield Blackshear] said I could come home and, but I did not feel that it would be appropriate because of the issue of the fact that I felt this need to be doing this community stuff which sometimes took me out, kept me out until times that my father [Frank Blackshear] was not gonna agree with, so I thought that for policy reasons that it would not be appropriate for me to be at home.  Oh, what do they call it, for policy differences (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I decided to remain apart (laughter).
Story_ID: 208859
Speaker 1: --But then you got a job, I think in the beauty business?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had found a job--
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: Gee, I can't even remember now.  This would have been in '63 [1963], '64 [1964], in that time frame.  And I get this job and my job was really high tech, taking empty jars of cold cream and going to this machine and pushing the handle down just long enough to get enough cold cream in the jar and to create a nice little twirl on top and put the cover or put the little thing in to hold the cold cream down and then putting the cover on the jar and then putting the jar with the other jars.  That was my high tech job.  And what this outfit was, it was a beauty business that had offices up on Fifth Avenue [New York, New York], where this jar of cold cream that cost fifty cents to make, they were selling it for five or ten dollars uptown but that's the way they do it in the cosmetics business even today.  I mean that's how they can afford to have all this showy stuff and glitter and freebies and perks, it's because they have a big margin on the sale of cosmetics.  They said a woman will pay a dollar for soap because that will make her clean but she will pay ten dollars for cold cream because that will make her pretty.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And soap and cold cream have largely the same substances with just a minor variation.  So anyway, I drift.  So that was my job at this place.  But meanwhile I'm thinking, this is simple stuff, I can do this.  All you need is to get these barrels of these things put 'em in a vat, mix it up with a couple of other things, put a little scent in it which they had bottles of scent, and then you squeeze this stuff into a jar and you sell it for fantastic prices.  I can do this (laughter).  So, but I said why start a new business, I'll just buy this one (laughter).  And so I'm knowing these Muslims and these guys are all about starting businesses.  I'm saying to me, I bet if I get these guys interested in selling their business, that these Muslims that I know will back me because it'll be another business.  So I'm now telling the guy now, hey, I'm here less than a year, okay.  And my thing is filling jars so, you know what I was making (laughter).  So I'm telling these guys, look will you be interested in selling this business.  And that mean, they were like astounded that they would get that kind of an offer from me, a black kid who's, and these, it's a white business, a black kid that's coming in to fill the cosmetics jars.  So then they became afraid because they said there's a competitor of theirs in Chicago [Illinois] who wants to get their business and they figured that I'm there as a spy for them getting to know their business, and now I'm offering to buy it as part of the conspiracy to get their business.  I don't know about all of this but because they suspect me of being a spy of this other company I never heard of, they laid me off.  And then when I thought about it years later, I'm thinking, how in the world did I suspect that the Muslims would back me in this business because Muslims don't wear makeup and they would not back the purchase of a cosmetics firm.  And I'm saying, duh, why would I even put myself in the position.  But, you know, young and cocky, not thinking, you know.  So, gee, I guess, I've lost a number of jobs that way (laughter).
Story_ID: 208860
Speaker 1: So here you are again without a job.
Speaker 2: I'm without a job.
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: So, I'm struggling.  Man, I'm struggling to hold on.  And I remember one instance when I was down to my last thirty cents and I had, and I was, I had taken up smoking, and I had to decide whether I would use that thirty cents to buy a hamburger or buy a carton of cigarettes.  And at that time well, you know, they both cost about the same then, I decided that I would buy a carton of cigarettes because the cigarettes would last longer and the smoke was at least a little filling.  So I mean, I was really running into problems here.  But then a miracle.  I got a job in a pre-management program at Lerner Shops [New York & Company, Inc., New York, New York] because they were looking to get more African Americans involved--
Speaker 1: And Lerner's is?
Speaker 2: --in their program.
Speaker 1: They sell women's clothing?
Speaker 2: They sell women's clothing.  And they're all over the country today.  And it's a business where they have a management training program, and the vestibule job is senior distributor.  And so they have, had big offices downtown where I was working as a senior distributor, and my job was to study computer printouts that they were getting to see what the sales were at the various stores in the 125 stores I was responsible for on the East Coast.  And I would look at, well what's been selling, so how do I restock these stores.  So I would make these long lists of how to, what the resupply was for these stores and then they would go out on the floor and they would pick this product.  Now my specialty happened to have been bras and girdles.  So I have seen more bras and more girdles than most women will ever see in life, and I learned a lot about how women's sizes vary by ethnicity, and by stores that cater to certain ethnic neighborhoods the bra sizes are different and the girdle sizes are different in terms of the size spread, and its fairly consistent by ethnic group.  Probably has something to do with diet too, probably less genes and more diet.  But I thought that that was an interesting phenomenon.  Meanwhile the job is a union job so I'm also in the [International Ladies'] Garment Workers' Union [ILGWU] even though I'm in the vestibule for management.  Meanwhile I'm getting active in the union because I'm in the union, I get elected foreman of my shop, 'cause I didn't mind going out on the floor and picking garments, it was a lot of Puerto Ricans out there, so I would go out and I would pick with everybody because I never held myself out to be better than anybody, no I wasn't a, quote, management trainee and I wasn't full of all that.  I was a guy out there working trying to make some money.  And they appreciated that, and they elected me shop foreman.  And then that meant I had to go to the union meetings downtown at the ILGWU union hall.  And, you know, I would speak out and I guess they thought that I was intelligent and had good ideas because then they tried to recruit me as a union organizer, which I declined.  I mean they really pressed hard 'cause they, guess they thought I'd be a good organizer, but I didn't, and I stayed with Lerner Shops until I went into the [U.S.] military.
Story_ID: 208861
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1964.  And I was going into the [U.S.] military just at the times when all the Harlem [New York, New York] riots were erupting.  So I was going into the military to the symphony of gunshots in my neighborhood.
Speaker 1: And what branch of the military did you join?
Speaker 2: I went into the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: And what did you do in the Air Force?
Speaker 2: I went into guided missiles, the technical aspects of guided missiles and we did a lot of--we were responsible for maintaining them.  And in the military at that time we had little guided missiles that you put on planes, we had big guided missiles that went into silos, so we had a lot of missiles.
Speaker 1: So why did you decide to leave the management job [at Lerner Shops; New York & Company, Inc., New York, New York] and go into the military?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a very interesting story.  In those days for young guys they had something called the draft.  And you were required to be registered at your draft board.  And I had dropped out of [Hunter] College [New York, New York], which made me eligible for the draft.  So the Selective Service [Systems] had sent me a letter saying that you are qualified, and you are now required to report for a physical.  So I said, "Uh oh, they're on to me."  So I went down for this physical which was an interesting story.  It was a place called Whitehall Street in downtown Manhattan [New York, New York], anybody in New York that went, from that time, knew that that's where you went to get your physical.  And I went in there thinking, okay, there's going to be a little poking and prodding and then I'll be out in a little bit.  But the crowds were huge, I mean all kinds of people from everywhere were down there to do the physical.  And then came the alarming news, everybody had to get naked.  And I don't mean a little naked, I mean completely naked.  And they gave you a little bag about so big with elastic on it that you could put on your wrist and that's where you put your rings and your valuables, and they gave you a little card so that that was what you gave to the doctors at each station to put the notes on, and that was your entire attire.  So hopefully you weren't having any inappropriate thoughts because that little card wasn't gonna help you (laughter) if the guys know what I mean.  But (laughter) and so we was, we were marched around through there like cattle going down pens.  And, you know crowded in, close lines, and you didn't wanna get too close to the guy in front of you because you didn't know which way he would go so, and you didn't wanna the guy in back of you getting to close up on you but with that in thought that's how we moved through.  And they would take us through all these stations and poke and prod and take examples until you got to the station that everybody always talked about that had been through this before, and that's where you were lined up in a room and you were told to bend over and spread your cheeks and I don't mean show your teeth.  And then the doctor would come with his gloves on and he would poke and prod and just make you generally uncomfortable.  And you were still buck naked and you went on, you went to sit with a shrink and he interviewed you.  So you're sitting here with this shrink, you don't need to be naked, where are my clothes?  But no, you were buck naked until you finished.  Shrink, the sociologist, whoever, and then finally at the end they let you get your clothes back.  But anyway, that was your selective service health interview at Whitehall Street.  I think they do it differently now, I don't know.  But, and then, I decided I better go in the Air Force 'cause I wasn't gonna be a draftee because that was kind of like a negative thing and they always knew who the draftees were because it was in your serial number.  You could read the serial number and say, oh, this guy's a draftee.  It was like oh, okay.  He didn't wanna go in, we had to take him up off the street.  So I enlisted and just in time too, because just before I was to go, the selective service had sent me a letter telling me that I have, that they have the pleasure to inform me that I have been chosen to serve my country and I am to report at such and such a place at such and such a time, and just in case that I had a transportation problem, there was a subway token glued to that letter, which meant, be there buddy or we're gonna come and get you.  So, of course, I called and told them that I had already made other arrangements and that was that.
Story_ID: 208862
Speaker 1: And so you joined the [U.S.] Air Force in 1964?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences--how long were you in the Air Force?
Speaker 2: For four years.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like those four years?  You were finally getting an opportunity to study electronics?
Speaker 2: Yes, well actually what happened is I went out to training school in Denver, Colorado, which is a fine city.  They're not too bad on African Americans there, they got a lot more Hispanics, or they did at that time so they were hard on the Hispanics, 'cause they were in the majority.  So what I decided to do even then, was to go back to school and I started going back to school at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado].  And I even went up to their main campus and took some computer courses.  And in those days computers put out punch tapes, the little ones, and so I learned, began to introduce myself to computers.  So, which turned out to be a good thing, years later.  So then I was doing very well in all my courses A's, Bs, I didn't know a C.  So, and I must have done well in my training because after I finished training they asked me if I would stay in Denver and help them to do the maintenance and whatnot on the equipment that they used at the school.  So I found myself in Denver for two years as a result of that.  And so in the meantime, I was spending a lot of time going to school and I was also going to church.  Actually it turned out that I went to a church that my black friend introduced me to, which was a church he went to that was a white church, but I didn't care.  So church was church.  So we had a church home and I had work, I had school, I had a lot to do.
Speaker 1: And so were you thinking then, what were you thinking you were gonna do though with your life?  Were you thinking that you would just stay in Denver and work, or were you thinking you probably perhaps take advantage of the G.I. Bill?  What were some of your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well, in those days, since I didn't have a degree, in the Air Force you had to have a degree to be an officer, and I wanted to be an officer, so I got involved in something called the Airman Education and Commissioning Program [AECP] there.  And they were telling me what the requirements were, you know, you had to have good grades, and they said your previous grades didn't look that good so you had to bring your average up, which meant, which is why I was going to college because I wanted to eventually be admitted into that program.  And I know I had to do A's and Bs, it didn't matter what the course, I was doing A's and Bs.  So I was committed to that program of becoming an officer.  And so that was a motivation factor for me when I was out there.  And my experiences in the church turned out to be somewhat less than positive because I got active in the young adult program in the church and we begin to do all kinds of interesting things.  I felt that the kids were too isolated so I began to push for programs that have the--if the kids didn't wanna go out into the community, the community would come into the church.  So I had them to bring in--we searched around and found a guy who sold pornographic literature.  We had him come in and talk about why he did it.  We had a sociologist come in from the university to talk about prostitution in the Denver area, how it works and why it's there, and who's in it, and how you can tell.  Like in Denver, if the prostitute was available they put out an American flag and if they weren't available, the flag was gone.  That's how you knew when you went passed a place whether it was okay to go in, you know, that kind of stuff.  I mean these guys were well informed.  And so then we said, well, why don't we have a prostitute to come in, learn from her the what and the why, and that's when the church began, I guess this is suspect whether our adult program was sane.  So they said no to that which turned out that if we had investigated more fully, we found out, at least in Denver, the prostitutes consider churches to be unlucky, so they wouldn't have come to the church anyway.  But anyway later on I left the church because the pastor and a couple of the elders had pulled me aside and said to me that there was some concern in the church about my behavior.  I said, "Well, what do you mean?"  'Cause I was very friendly, when I came in in the mornings to church service, you know, I would hug the ladies because, I know they probably hadn't hugged, hadn't had a hug all day, the old ladies.  And 'cause I was, I thought that was being friendly.  Well, it turned out that these old ladies, I'm talking about old ladies, that they were concerned that I was like hugging them because I was coming on to them, and they were concerned because they felt their husbands might be concerned about my hugging them.  I was completely dumbfounded.  The, here I was trying to be friends and these people were coming at it from a whole different agenda.  What offended me was not so much that these guys had to pull me aside and talk to me but that these women who I was hugging didn't say to me, hey look, you know, here's how I'm feeling about your hugging me.  That they had to go to the hierarchy and have the hierarchy address me.  So I realized that maybe this nice, friendly Christian church had some other kinds of tones that I didn't wanna be a part of, so I left.
Story_ID: 208863
Speaker 1: --Got orders to transfer me to Germany.  And I went to a place called [Bitburg Air Base] Bitburg, Germany, which years later I learned that they had a lot of Nazis buried there [at Kolmeshohe Cemetery].  Not, not, what was it?  The black-shirted guys [Schutzstaffel, SS].  I can't remember the name right now but the super Nazis, but anyways, it'll come back to me.  But a lot of them were buried there when, 'cause there was big news article about it when [President Richard Milhous] Nixon had gone there to speak, I mean not Nixon, but [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan had gone there to speak and they said, oh all these guys are buried there, he shouldn't have been there.  I didn't know back then.  But anyway--
Speaker 2: So what did you do in Germany?
Speaker 1: In Germany I was responsible for missile maintenance and I did a lot of reading, 'cause I guess I wasn't as sociable as some of the other guys.  I was (unclear)--they spent a lot of time playing pinochle, and I didn't wanna play pinochle, because I didn't wanna get into that, because a lot of the guys they would get a six pack of beer each and sit down at night and kill a six pack each playing pinochle.  And then on the weekends they'd get a case each and spend all day into the night playing pinochle.  And once they knew you knew pinochle, these groups would wanna strong-arm you into getting involved 'cause they needed to complete their rounds.  So I didn't wanna be strong-armed so I didn't wanna learn pinochle.  So that left me out of a lot groups.
Speaker 2: So you did a lot of reading, a lot of studying, and what were you thinking you were gonna do with your life at this point?
Speaker 1: Well, when I went to Germany, first thing I did is I got involved with the education center because I was continuing my education, taking courses on campus from the University of Maryland, because I'm still working on the Airman Education and Commissioning Program [AECP], I'm gonna be an officer.  Also I got involved with the chess club which was my outside recreation, and I really liked it because it was a mixed club, black and white, and we didn't play in the American circuit by going to the American bases, we played in the European circuit, so we went out into the economy, we would go to Belgium, to Holland, to, you know, all different places, all around Germany.  And we would play the locals and natives in those countries in their international press tournaments.  So it was really interesting for us.  And they liked to see us coming because we weren't as strong as them so they said, "Oh, here come the Americans," that's another country but also we were a lot of good wins.
Story_ID: 208864
Speaker 1: You were in [Bitburg Air Base, Bitburg] Germany until what year?
Speaker 2: I was in Germany from 1968 to 19--from 1966 to 1968.
Speaker 1: Kind of at the, you know, during a lot of--there were a lot of civil rights activities taking place in the United States, and so what were some of your thoughts about being so far away, were you hoping, wishing you were closer to be involved or--
Speaker 2: Actually, I felt disconnected from a lot of that and I really didn't feel the full brunt of it because you're over there in Germany.  You have to remember too, that I didn't feel the full energy of that because my access to information was military television.  And you didn't get that much through military television.
Speaker 1: You weren't getting letters from family members at home and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Not so much.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But our family wasn't that much involved in the civil rights activist kind of stuff.  And it was more stuff on German television because it was more unfiltered.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But if you didn't have an in-depth understanding of German, you couldn't get the full flavor of what was being, what was being said.
Speaker 1: Throughout this time, had you still maintained your relationship with Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And our, and probably if I had, when he departed the Muslims [Nation of Islam], which he was doing during that time, I would have probably been more interested in getting involved with his organization [Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI)] because his organization was talking about an understanding of a new brotherhood of Islam worldwide--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and he had stepped away from the devil, you know, the white devils and that type of stuff.
Speaker 1: So you left the [U.S.] Air Force in 1968 and you came back to the [United] States [of America].  What did you do when you came back to the States?
Speaker 2: Well, understand this, that the reason I didn't stay in the Air Force even though I was offered a hefty reenlistment bonus and a promotion if I reenlisted, the people that interviewed me for the Airman Education and Commissioning Program [AECP] said to me that they would not admit me to the program, which is a full boat ride to a college degree and the commission is what that was, that they wouldn't admit me to the program because they thought that I would not successfully commit, complete a science program and they were looking at my earlier grades and not at my later grades.  So they said, no.  And with me, I saw that that part of the [U.S.] military, I wasn't gonna, if they didn't want me as an officer I wasn't gonna stay with them.  And then at that time I also became more and more myself and had my own little civil rights things in Air Force and then I left.
Speaker 1: Was that a good lesson to you to, how the past can be, kind of come back to haunt you in that, you really have to do your best every time with--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I think that letting my grades lapse in junior high school [Edgar D. Shimer Junior High School, New York, New York] and not being attentive in high school [John Adams High School, New York, New York] affected my ability to get into The City College [of New York, New York, New York] which was my dream.  I could handle the work if I paid attention, and paid attention in my earlier courses--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause you knew your capabilities.
Speaker 2: I knew my capabilities.  But, and my father [Frank Blackshear] said you had to go to school but they didn't say that here's why it's important.  I mean I took the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test], I didn't do as well on the SAT as I could have because my first exposure to the SAT was when I went in to take the exam.  I knew nothing about all these pre-study courses, and why you had to get a thousand or more on the score because it meant full boat to college.  I didn't know any of that.  If I had known, I would have, a) done better in my courses, and b) I would have prepared for that test, and I know I would have got above a thousand, but, you know, that's past--
Story_ID: 208865
Speaker 1: You come back to the [United] States, and then what do you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I'm doing is saying okay, I'm back.
Speaker 1: But do you decide to go to college?
Speaker 2: I'm going to college, so.
Speaker 1: Where did you enroll in college?
Speaker 2: I'm putting out applications everywhere and I got admitted to Fordham University [New York, New York], oh, no it was Yeshiva [University, New York, New York], it was either Fordham or Yeshiva, I forget which, but anyway I'm admitted to this college in New York, I'm also admitted to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] whose courses I had been taking overseas.
Speaker 1: So you decide to go to Maryland?
Speaker 2: I decide to go to Maryland.
Speaker 1: And how did you do at Maryland?
Speaker 2: I did very well in Maryland in the physics curriculum.  And I, in 1970 I got my degree in physics at the University of Maryland, so there to those people who thought I couldn't do it, do a science program.
Speaker 1: And so what did you do after you got your degree in 1970?
Speaker 2: Well, after I started looking around to see what I could do with my fresh degree, I found that to do any real substantive work in physics you had to have a Ph.D.  And I realized that a physics degree wasn't gonna take you a lot of places.
Story_ID: 208866
Speaker 1: So did you get a job right away or did you decide to go back to school?
Speaker 2: No, I decided to work, and I was gonna get into, I had started getting into data processing for employment when I was in school.  I went to the University of Maryland Data Center [College Park, Maryland].  I was living in Baltimore [Maryland] but going to College Park [Maryland], which is probably about thirty, forty mile commute, so I had to take the bus and it was again, a lot of early morning stuff like I was in New York [New York] but I did it 'cause it was what I had to do.  But I got a job in Baltimore working at the University of Maryland Data Center.  And the reason I convinced them to let me run their computers at night we're talking big computers with tapes drives and all that kind of stuff, is because I told them I had computer experience at the data center at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], University of Colorado [Denver, Denver, Colorado] when I was in Denver [Colorado].  So actually I had to work with a small computer that spit out little paper tapes and that kind of stuff, and I saw the other stuff and I had touched the other stuff so I had my hands on the other stuff, so I was able to say I was familiar with the equipment and I was familiar with computers, and I figured everything else I could learn on the job.  So they hired me.  And I learned fast (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there for less than a year because then I moved on to be the night supervisor for an IBM data center north of Baltimore in Towson [Maryland].  So, you know, IBM, so, you know, I had to go, it was more money.  And I was able to get that job because they felt I had familiarity with computers and running the data center because I was running this night shift data center for the University of Maryland, which was actually nothing more than taking trays of cards which were programs, stuffing 'em in one end of the computer, taking 'em out and taking the printout and putting 'em with the cards (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and how long were you with IBM?
Speaker 2: I ended up with IBM for about three years 'cause once I graduated from college, I went with IBM first as a systems engineer, and then I went with IBM, and then I went into marketing at IBM.
Story_ID: 208867
Speaker 1: Tell me about the project, the projects you worked, the marketing projects you were working on [in Towson, Maryland] for IBM (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well, I was marketing.  Well, first my territory was interesting because when I was assigned a territory, shortly after I was assigned, there was a [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] rally in the heart of my territory.  And there was a lot of concern about what that would mean for me, my safety in the territory, and my ability to sell hardware in the territory.  So there were a lot of management meetings.  And finally they pull me in and said what do you think?  And my response was there wasn't much going on with the Klan and it wouldn't be, either, there wasn't much going on with the Klan and it wouldn't be a problem or they had a big operation and maybe I could make a contact and go down there and sell 'em a computer (laughter).  So they said, this guy will be all right.  They left me in the territory, I made my sales goals but while I was doing that on the side, I was working on a concept that I thought would be good for IBM, which is kind of cheek, I mean I'm cheeky with this Klan stuff and now I'm thinking, a first year sales guy, I'm gonna help IBM.  And the fault I saw was IBM was like the cobbler's son who has no shoes.  They--
Speaker 1: So what was your idea?  What--
Speaker 2: Well, this is what I'm telling you, I saw that the salesmen didn't have good computer tools to work with to manage their territories.  So I developed something that eventually became the Selectable Territory Analysis Reports, the STAR reports, I always gotta give something a good name.  And what that was, was a whole series of programs that allowed a salesman to go through their territory using the computer, using all these data cards that you can get from some of these data services like Dun & Bradstreet [Inc.].  We had tapes that we were paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for in the company for these tapes all over the country that gave name, address, CEO, type of business, size of company, all the stuff that a salesman usually found out on their first contact when they were chasing smoke stacks, which is what we called then cold calling.  So they did their cold calling at the computer.  So now they found who were the good prospects in their territory using the computer and they would go and knock on the door with a good prospect, and IBM had materials of all kinds of industries but you couldn't carry it all with you so you didn't know what to carry.  So with this thing, when you identify the prospect and his industry, you went and called on him with your material, with the benefits for that industry.  The short story is that it meant that salesmen made fewer calls to close a prospect and they made fewer calls to find a prospect 'cause they were well prepared.  So that is a big savings 'cause if it took four calls to close a guy, if it took ten calls to find a guy and four calls to close a guy, you're talking about reducing those ratios, increasing productivity of the sales people and which it did.  This is serious money.  So when IBM began to look at it they assigned some resources to help me clean it up and make it into a whole program.  Then we begin to market it up through the region, up to Armonk [New York], which is where even today we bow as we go by, if you're in IBM, 'cause that's like headquarters.  So it went up to Armonk and they said, man this is great.  So at all the new business offices, which is where they do the cold calling across the country, they introduced the Selectable Territory Analysis Report system online, merging it, we merged it with IBM's database.  Plus at each site we had a little thing that held all of IBM's materials about all the industries, so the salesperson could go in, do their prospecting at the computer, identify the prospect, and then go through all this literature and find the brochure that related to that prospect, go into the storage room, get some copies of the thing and then go call on the guy.  This is saving the company tons of dough, in my opinion.  I asked for 2 percent of the savings.  That's gotta be pretty cheeky (laughter).  IBM declined and they gave me a nice regional award and then gave me, in the data processing division, they gave me a data processing division award and they wrote me up in the paper and gave me, you know, a nice little, a cash award and end of story.  IBM then said we'll take it from here.  So, and I was doing that while I was meeting my sales quota.
Speaker 1: And so how long did you stay with IBM?
Speaker 2: It was about three years from beginning of the time when I was going to school [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland] and running their data center on confidence and 'til the point in time when I left--
Story_ID: 208868
Speaker 1: I took a leave of absence [from IBM] really because I was making, selling to a community group that was really trying to do a lot of good things in the black community but they were suffering for lack of talented staff, the executive director of this group--
Speaker 2: What's the name of the group?
Speaker 1: It's the Anne Arundel County Economic Opportunity Committee [sic. Anne Arundel Community Action Agency, Annapolis, Maryland], and it's the community action agency in this area.  They're still there.  This executive director has passed.  She convinced me to take a one year leave of absence to come down and help them while I could afford to, I wasn't married, I didn't have any, you know, wasn't entangled in a whole bunch of financial responsibilities.
Speaker 2: And what year was this?
Speaker 1: This probably was, by then it would have been about '72 [1972], somewhere in there.
Speaker 2: So you go work for the Anne Arundel--
Speaker 1: Anne Arundel County Economic Opportunity Committee, say community action agency.
Speaker 2: And what were some of your responsibilities there?
Speaker 1: There I was, I helped them to set up a marketing program for a family health center that they were just getting funding for and they needed some marketing skills on how to market this product.  So I worked there, and then they had me working with a unit that was doing business development, helping people to go in business or save their business and this type of stuff.  They got some, some funding for that and the executive director was having problems and had to leave, and they had a competition, I applied and I got the job as the executive director for this new, for this thing called the Community Enterprise Development Association, we called it CEDA, C-E-D-A.
Speaker 2: And so this is 1974?
Speaker 1: This is probably 19--yeah about that time.  And meanwhile my life is changing, I'm getting married [to Patsy Baker Blackshear], my year is up.  I ask IBM for another year figuring they would say no, but they said yes.  And so I take another year leave of absence.  I'm working on business development in Anne Arundel County [Maryland] for minorities and veterans, 'cause it was veterans then too, which is white and black.  And so I'm settling in.  I'm realizing that though I know business development, I don't have credibility in the right circles.  So how do I get credibility?  I says, "Well I know what to do, I'll go back to school, I'll get my M.B.A., and that's instant credibility--"
Story_ID: 208869
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to school at American University [Washington, D.C.] on the other side of Washington [D.C.].  Now, I'm working south of Annapolis [Maryland], I'm living in Baltimore [Maryland] and I'm going to school, ugh, it was a thing.
Speaker 1: So this was in 1975?
Speaker 2: In, this would have been in '74 [1974], '75 [1975] period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got my M.B.A. in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: So you got your M.B.A. in 1975.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so what did you do after you got your M.B.A. in 1975?
Speaker 2: Well, I was still working in business development.  I have now moved from Baltimore to Annapolis 'cause I married a woman [Patsy Baker Blackshear] that was I was dating in northern Virginia.  And ha, ha, I'm in Baltimore, working in Annapolis, and dating a woman in northern Virginia, we get married, she's from a town of 250 people, I'm from a town of eight million people, so we both decide to move to Annapolis which is a town of 33,000 people, but it's more sophisticated than you might expect for a small town.  So we both gain and that's where we've been to this day.
Speaker 1: And so what did you do after you got your M.B.A.?
Speaker 2: I stayed with that project [Anne Arundel Community Action Agency, Annapolis, Maryland].  I went into a third year at, asked for another leave of absence, and then IBM said well, well, maybe, maybe, but eventually they gave me a third year.  At the end of three years, I'm still doing this business development work but IBM is saying no we can't do it, we gotta cut the string, your technology is getting too old.  So eventually I'm now getting up to '77 [1977].  And the program is changing, and I see it coming.  There's a move towards for-profits and fewer units.  And I said "Well, what am I gonna do?"  So I decided that I'm helping all these other people go into business, why don't I go into business?  Which is what I did.  Got something started in '77 [1977] and then began to make some revenue going in '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: What was the name of your business you started?
Speaker 2: The business was called Associated Enterprise Development [TeleSonic, Inc.].
Speaker 1: And what, what kind of work did you do?
Speaker 2: Actually, it was technology related information systems.  I remember our first contract was from the Control Data Corporation [Minneapolis, Minnesota].  And what our job was, was to help their people to develop an online experience for going into business, in this case it was the gasoline business.  And one of the guys that worked with me, he was retired, had helped setup gas stations so, and I knew about business development, so we were subject matter experts.  And that's how we got the company going with that Control Data Corporation contract.  And the simulation was, became a part of their PLATO system, which at the time was the last word in computerized education systems.
Speaker 1: And so, and you continued to operate your own business?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 208870
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about when you became involved with Alex Haley and the Kunta Kinte Foundation [sic. Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Foundation, Inc., Edgewater, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, over the years the business [Associated Enterprise Development; TeleSonic] is developing.  Well, I guess, gee, it's amazing these times are overlapping now.  The 'Roots' phenomenon, 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family' Alex Haley] comes out in '76 [1976].  The movie comes out in '77 [1977].  And it's a big, big, big hit.  So I watched it too, and I said, boy, this is really great stuff.  Then, but to me it was a nice experience.  And I'm getting involved in the community again in Annapolis [Maryland], I guess I keep getting involved in the community.  So one of the things that comes up in the community group I'm in, is that we oughta have a plaque, this is '79 [1979], we oughta have a plaque at the [Annapolis] City Dock [Annapolis, Maryland] to honor Alex Haley.
Speaker 1: Why at the City Dock in Annapolis?
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting because I'm now learning, and 'cause I didn't pay attention in the movie, pay attention to what's going on, in the movie and in the book, Kunta Kinte gets off the boat in America at the Annapolis City Dock.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I suddenly realize wow, what a connection as African Americans this is something that we should be saying to the world.
Speaker 1: Was the community receptive to this idea of having a plaque?
Speaker 2: At first no.  And I wasn't leading that effort.  It was a fellow by the name of [HistoryMaker] Carl Snowden, was a community activist at that time in the community.  He's now a leader of the community, black or white.  And he pulled together two organizations, Voters Organized to Educate and the Anne Arundel Coalition of Tenants [Inc.].  These are real grass-roots organizations.  They go to the mayor at that time, a fellow by the name of Johnny [John C.] Apostol, and say we'd like to put this plaque at the city dock, this is '79 [1979], to honor Kunta Kinte's arrival.  He says, no.  And why?  He says because, and this is famous, and this is in the records it's so famous, he says well if we put a plaque down to him then the Greeks will want one, he's Greek, and the Italians will want one, next thing, you know, the whole city dock will be covered with plaques and I don't wanna get that started.  So, and he left before his time was up and that's another story.  But an election came and the plaque became an issue.  Now, there was a Democratic candidate and a Republican candidate, normally the African Americans would vote heavily for the Democratic candidate.  But the plaque became an issue.  And Democratic candidate would not commit to support the plaque.  The Republican candidate did commit to support the plaque so a substantial percentage of the black vote swung to the Republican and he won, much to the chagrin of the Democrat.  And true to his word, he had in '81 [1981], the plaque, raised all community funds, was laid in the city dock and Alex Haley came and that became our first connections to Alex Haley in 1981.  He came, the governor [Harry R. Hughes] came, county executive came, everybody came to be part of that.
Speaker 1: And what was Alex Haley's response?
Speaker 2: He was delighted.  He had already been getting a lot of accolades but to him Annapolis was a special thing.  He said when he finished his book, no, no it, it was either '67 [1967] or '69 [1969], when he reached the key point in his book and he was doing research here in Annapolis and he found himself here on September 29th of that year and he said, and its quoted later, he said that there was no place else that he thought he could be but at the Annapolis City Dock thinking of his ancestor Kunta Kinte and his arrival there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he said that he even became tearful at that.
Speaker 1: And did you get an opportunity to get to know him well throughout this process?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes because first came in 1981, came the plaque laid on the ground, inlaid.  A side story about that, forty-eight hours after the plaque was there it was stolen and a card was left saying you have been visited by the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and everybody was in an uproar because of all the people that had come, Alex Haley he was, you know, the last word and the governor and everybody.  It was such an embarrassment it made all, it made the AP [Associated Press] wire.  It was in the front page of the Wall Street Journal even, it was so embarrassing.  The governor was offering to pay, the community says no they went up, raised more money and they raised money for the plaque and a granite emplacement, and a new plaque and an inlaid granite was put there, and that was the first notoriety and the first what I would say the consecration of this, memorializing this spot.  And Alex Haley offered to pay, I mean but it had to be the community.  So--
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite story about Alex Haley--
Speaker 2: Yes, I'll tell you that.
Speaker 1: --from your personal--
Speaker 2: Then we went on, next step is this, we decide we're gonna have a commemoration at the city dock.  And we had the first commemoration in '87 [1987], Alex can't be there so his brother [HistoryMaker] George [Haley], comes who is really an accomplished person in his own right--
Story_ID: 208871
Speaker 1: And then by '89 [1989] we're having a festival, the Kunta Kinte Heritage Festival and Commemoration [sic. Kunta Kinte Commemoration and Heritage Festival; Kunta Kinte Heritage Festival, Annapolis, Maryland], 'cause we're doing other things besides the festival.  We're inviting Alex [Haley] to come to the festival.  In '90 [1990] he's now coming to the festival, and he's been to the festival several times, well he did before he passed, he came several times and he spoke, and he was so pleased to see this, and he had given us permission to even use the name Kunta Kinte in writing before we started using it, 'cause we're careful about things like that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, I remember distinctly one time he was speaking at the [Annapolis] City Dock [Annapolis, Maryland] and after he spoke there was a reception about a quarter of a mile away at a place called the Banneker-Douglass Museum [Annapolis, Maryland], which is named after Frederick Douglass and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Benjamin.
Speaker 1: --Benjamin Banneker, both Marylanders.  So he had said, we got these limousines 'cause, you know, we believe in the treatment.  So we got these limousines and for all the VIPs to take them up to the reception.  So Alex comes over to me and he says, "[HistoryMaker] Leonard [Blackshear], do I have to take the limousine?"  Well, he's the guest of honor.  Well, no.  What would you prefer?  He said, "That walk is not far," he says, "is it okay if I walk, because I'd rather walk and meet and greet the people."  And that was the real Alex Haley.  He was really about people and interacting with the people.  And I remember that so well, the several of us walked up the street, up Main Street in Annapolis [Maryland] with Alex in tow as the guest of honor and he was meeting and greeting people in the street and we walked all the way up to Banneker-Douglass Museum where the ceremony waited for him.  And then we went, we proceeded on.  I think that that request, and it said volumes about who Alex Haley really was.  And we remembered that story when we started thinking about the Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial [Annapolis, Maryland] that we built at the city dock in Annapolis years later.
Speaker 2: And what year was that built?
Speaker 1: The memorial was built actually over a period of ten years.  And the conceptualization started in '92 [1992], and the last part of it, it was built in stages, the last part of it was completed and dedicated in 2002.
Speaker 2: And the memorial actually has Alex Haley like a bronze statue of him reading, correct?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Actually the memorial has three components, and one component is exactly right, it's a sculpture, life-size sculpture of Alex reading to three children, one Asian, one European, and one African.  And he's sharing heritage stories with them with the concept being that people need to take time to share heritage stories with young people so that they don't become rootless.
Story_ID: 208872
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] George Haley, Alex Haley's brother, is standing with [HistoryMaker] Leonard Blackshear at the 1992 Kunta Kinte [Commemoration and] Heritage Festival [Kunta Kinte Heritage Festival, Annapolis, Maryland]--
Story_ID: 208873
Speaker 1: So what are the other two components of the [Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley] Memorial [Annapolis, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I talked about the sculpture, which first I will say is, is the most popular part of the site because people just love to take their picture with Alex [Haley].  They put their babies in his arm where he's holding a book, it's a nice platform, they take pictures.  The kids assume the same poses as the bronze kids and they take pictures.  It is one of the most photographed locations in the City of Annapolis [Maryland].
Speaker 1: About how many people visit it each year?
Speaker 2: About a million.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I'm sorry, what are the other two components?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the other two components are, there's across the street from the, well, next to Alex there's something called a story wall which is ten plaques along the wall in which we have an excerpt from 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] identifying the person who spoke it.  And then we have an interpretation of that very brief to broaden the message and then we specify on the bottom what the concept is.  And then we have a graphic around the wording that reinforces the wording itself.  So it's a real strong presentation.  And we do that ten times for ten different things.  And, but the first one, the plaque is a dedication to all enslaved Africans in America.  That's what the story wall is geared to.  And then it talks about Africans and what they've done and the millions that were brought over here and enslaved.  And then later on it talks about concepts of love, heritage, family, you know, challenge, the, you know, the perseverance, values that help Africans to survive but values that are universal.  As a consequence, people really walk along the wall, they study it, and people have told us who their favorite plaques are.  They really love this one or they've adopted that one.  Some people come through, if they see something on the plaques they take them off.  They, the people in town help us take care of the memorial.  So that's the story wall and really has a lot of deep meaning there.  Then across the street from the site where there the story wall and the plaque is, there's something called a compass rose, which is a nautical thing this being a nautical town it's appropriate.  And it's oriented at true north and it's a fourteen-foot inlaid granite thing in the sidewalk.  And then at the center of that compass rose is a four-foot round globe that is oriented properly to all the continents and the countries in the world.  And then at the center of that is Annapolis so people can stand right there and face the countries, country, or countries of their origin and be truly facing those countries and make a connection with the generations, 'cause Alex was as many people know, the father of popular genealogy in America.  So those are the three components and by the compass rose there's also a kiosk that explains Kunta Kinte, his story, Alex, his story and the meaning that we have applied to the entire site, which is a message of reconciliation and healing--
Story_ID: 208874
Speaker 1: And speaking of reconciliation and healing, let's talk about the project that you're working on today in 2004, the slavery reconciliation walk [A Slavery Reconciliation Walk of Penitence and Forgiveness].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, that's a real exciting thing that has seemed to draw waves of interest.  And it grew from the fact that in this area, interestingly enough, because of things that we have been doing, that people are more and more comfortable talking about slavery.  In a lot of areas it's still kept under covers and people don't wanna address it, but we worked with a wide ranging community group and had a slavery round table with the leaders of these groups, and we all agreed that slavery was not only important but it needed to be interpreted everywhere in the--we have a lot of colonial homes that need to be interpreted there.  The tour guides, it needs to be interpreted there, research people, it need to be interpreted there.  So with that environment, we felt that we could do something called--working with this European group called The Lifeline Expedition [London, England].  And these people have done walks over the years, The Lifeline Expedition project out of London, England, they've done walks in England, walks in France, Spain, Portugal.  And what these walks entail are white people walking as penitence, and the symbols of their penitence is yokes and chains like you'd see in a slave coffle.  And then black people walk with them as forgivers.  And they walk through towns showing people sites related to the slave trade and they say some words of education, and then they say some prayers.  And the idea is to alert these people to the legacy of slavery, racism in their midst, and to say, now's a good time to begin to address that, and to talk about reconciliation and healing.  And that's their message.
Speaker 1: And why has it been so controversial?
Speaker 2: Well, it's not been that--interestingly enough, it's drawn attention in Europe but it hasn't been really controversial there.  What happened is, they, this year they're gonna do their, the Europeans, their U.S.A. tour.  And they were gonna start that tour in Boston [Massachusetts] and work their way through major cities down to Charleston [South Carolina].  Some guy in the State of Washington told the guy in England to look at Annapolis [Maryland].  They went to our website, saw the [Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley] Memorial [Annapolis, Maryland], saw our messages of reconciliation and healing and said, "We better talk to these people."
Story_ID: 208875
Speaker 1: So why has it been so controversial in the U.S.?
Speaker 2: Well, it, because once we began to move on it, the first media thing went out with a misinterpretation.  The misinterpretation was that this walk as I described was going to be whites walking as slaves in chains, and depending on the version you heard, with blacks either in front, or in back as slave holders.  And so this was a reenactment but with the reversal of roles.  And that ignited a firestorm of response, as we suspected it would because in America, who have not yet come to terms with slavery, that's incendiary stuff.  And the newspaper was wrong to have done that, which later they regretted that they did that incorrect thing but it was out there, the AP [Associated Press] picked it up, the radio stations picked it up, and the TV stations got wind of it.  They got excited, so anything related to it was hot.  So it got out of pocket.
Speaker 1: Well, are you not surprised that it was a little controversial in the United States compared to Europe since this is, you know, where slavery occurred, and the reenactment, so are you not surprised that it was so controversial here?
Speaker 2: We're not surprised that the misinterpretation was so controversial.  And, you know, they've had their issues in Europe too.  There's a lot of discrimination there.
Speaker 1: Right, but when we think of slavery, we think of slavery from the U.S. perspective.
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you a little bit about the African American community's response [to A Slavery Reconciliation Walk of Penitence and Forgiveness], because, have some expressed some feelings of, you know, almost being insulted by this?
Speaker 2: Well, you're right.  And this is a surprise to a lot of white folks that African Americans as well as white folks were insulted and offended by black people walking in chain, I mean, white people walking in chains, simulating slaves.  And the reason they were offended is this, they said that, you know, essentially, that white people walking for an hour in downtown Annapolis [Maryland] simulating--in their Nike shirts and Reebok shoes as simulating, thinking that they could simulate 250 years of brutal slavery is offensive, and they were against it.  And, of course, some say, why are you bringing all this up in the first place, you know, slavery is gone, the legacy of slavery we don't wanna talk about, let's stuff it back in the can.  So for a lot of reasons both communities had problems with that imaging.  We got the paper to quit it and lately they've been writing some wonderful, supportive editorials.  And we have an op-ed piece coming out in the paper soon.  So the local paper has gone the other way.  The AP [Associated Press] turns out to have a new understanding and appreciation for what we're trying to do.  As it turns out, the new manager up there, he's been there a year, was one of the guys that helped write the story wall so he has an intimate feeling of familiarity with the project and with the [Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley] Memorial [Annapolis, Maryland] and its part in all this.
Speaker 1: What is that you're hoping people will learn from this?
Speaker 2: Well, actually let me say this.  That The Lifeline Expedition [London, England] people know what they're doing when they're using yokes and chains as the symbol of their penitence in their walk because if they wore arm bands and, or shawls or something like that talking about reconciliation and healing, nobody would pay attention.  But when they're wearing yokes and chains, they get attention.  And in this country they're getting more attention because there's such a great sensitivity to this issue.  What we're hoping to do is this, number one, we have focused the walk into being an educational walk with an appreciation of both sides of the issue, black and white.  But it culminates in a dramatization of the four steps of healing that we have taken from the International Reconciliation Coalition that fit in with a lot of other books on forgiveness and we want people to focus on and understand that there is a four step program to healing for racism in America.  That's the purpose of the walk.  Also we're introducing a longer term program of creating what we call reconciliation study circles where people will come together and talk about issues related to race in general or its impact in our community and specific like in education or housing.  And the rules will be that there's no demonization, no humiliation, because those are the two of the main reasons people don't talk.  So we take that off the table in these study circles.  And the purpose of the study circles is to get people to talk, to agree on the action, they take the action, and our vision is that Annapolis becomes the first city of healing in America.
Story_ID: 208876
Speaker 1: When we talked a little bit about Alex Haley and your work with the [Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley] Memorial [Annapolis, Maryland], you also do some work with genealogy, and have you found that there was a huge interest in this, in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], and has that interest continued with African Americans trying to trace their genealogy and their ancestry?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.  We've had some dealings with the LDS or the Mormon-- Church of [Jesus Christ of] Latter-day Saints.  They run probably the largest genealogy data base in the world and they have a family history center in Ogden, Utah, Salt Lake City [Utah] that gets a lot of traffic.  They told us that before 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] they would get about a thousand people a day coming through their library.  Immediately after 'Roots,' that number jumped to two thousand.  And today its three thousand people a day coming through the family history center looking for connections to their roots.  They revere today the Haley family because it is--they know for a fact that Alex has had a direct impact on popularizing genealogy in America.  They got the numbers to prove it.
Speaker 1: And why do you think it's important for people to do this kind of work, to trace their genealogy and their ancestry?
Speaker 2: Well, when people begin to understand their roots, they begin to understand where they came from, and if they're looking for the good so that they can praise it they find it, and they find that there's a lot of good in their past and in their family that helps to sustain them into the future.  They find a family member who went through great tribulation and despite it all prevailed.  That family member tells them that maybe there's something in their genes that can help them to persevere and survive or they're gonna model themselves after that family member and persevere and survive against all odds.  That's what learning about your genealogy can do for you.
Speaker 1: And why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Well, your genealogy places you and your family in history because you can look at it as a time line, when you discovered that your ancestor, and great, great whatever, grandfather fought in the Union Army for an African American, and that that person was at the Battle of the Crater which we, we know how to find that out, in Petersburg [Virginia] which was a famous battle, or that they were in the 53rd Massachusetts [Volunteer Infantry].  I mean, that brings such a point of pride to people to know that their family was so engaged and so involved, that's meaningful to get that information.
Story_ID: 208877
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say there are probably three projects that--I've done a lot of projects in the community and I guess, you know, over the years I've never gotten away from the community.  And the Kunta Kinte Heritage Festival [Kunta Kinte Commemoration and Heritage Festival, Annapolis, Maryland], which I had the pleasure of helping to get started with the help of a lot of people.  And the festival today is on the must-attend festival list of a lot of people and thousands and thousands of people come to that festival every year.  I don't run it anymore.  It's still held here in Annapolis [Maryland].  There are great people that do it but I'm pleased to have started that.  The second project is the Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial [Annapolis, Maryland] because that was a hard fought struggle because this is a southern town and some people felt it wasn't appropriate to have a black man at the [Annapolis] City Dock [Annapolis, Maryland] even if he was Alex Haley or that such a memorial shouldn't exist, but it's there and the town loves it.  People from out of state make pilgrimages to Annapolis for that.  All of a sudden people say, oh, there's some economic development stuff here.  We've developed a beautiful county brochure that we can't keep on the shelf, it's so popular, that talks about African heritage in the county, that's my second project.  And my third project, now I told you about that experience that I had when I was a page in the library and got released 'cause I spent too much time reading books, my third project has to do with my connection with Rotary [International].  Now I encourage all African Americans to get involved with Rotary.  A lot of African Americans talk about Rotary but what they should do is get in Rotary and work with Rotary to accomplish things in the community.  Well the project that I started in Rotary was called Books for International Goodwill [Annapolis, Maryland], or B.I.G.  And the B.I.G. Project is a very simple thing.  We collect books, we find places around the world that need books, and we ship books to those places.  And I'm proud to say that that project currently has shipped over a million and a half books all over the world, all volunteer, the books are contributed to us, it's still going, we probably ship two or three hundred thousand books, and it's about two hundred thousand books a year now.  And we ship a lot of books into Africa, into Asia, and even into Eastern Europe.  And I'm so pleased to see that we can take books that would normally have been discarded and send them to people who desperately need books of any kind.  So I'm very pleased with that project, which is still operating, still going and is very B-I-G, BIG (laughter).
Story_ID: 208878
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: That's interesting because one could always say, if I decided this or decided that I'd be this, you know, if I'd stayed with IBM I would have been a high muckety-muck because they wanted me to come to Armonk [New York] to work with the STAR [Selectable Territory Analysis Report] Program and so--
Speaker 1: So do you regret not staying with IBM?
Speaker 2: No.  Because if I had not stayed with IBM, I probably wouldn't have met, no, well, I knew her then, probably wouldn't have married my lovely wife [Patsy Baker Blackshear].  And also I wouldn't have gotten involved in this message of Annapolis [Maryland] because what has essentially happened is that Annapolis is becoming the place of beginning for Africans in America because of Kunta Kinte and all the symbolism of him around here, and African Americans have no Ellis Island [New York, New York].  And now they have a place called Annapolis, they have a memorial [Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial, Annapolis, Maryland], they have activities, they have a learning place.  And I have to say, that if I had stayed with IBM that this memorial, this meaning would not be here.  Because as all projects need a sparkplug, I was the sparkplug but I hasten to add, it would never have happened with the support of hundreds of people, elected officials, volunteers, to make that project happen.
Story_ID: 208879
Speaker 1: And what haven't you done yet, that you'd still like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, we have these study circles, these reconciliation study circles that we have to roll out and lead the city [Annapolis, Maryland] to becoming the first city of healing in America because as I say before, racism is like a cancer in our society.  And with the program that we're developing around the slavery reconciliation walk [A Slavery Reconciliation Walk of Penitence and Forgiveness], we are looking at applying a chemotherapy to that cancer, and we think the people here are interested and willing to be healed, and we think that we're on the process of Annapolis becoming the first city of healing in America.  And that is our next program besides the other programs we run.  That's our big vision goal that we're working on now.
Story_ID: 208880
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, probably--I don't really worry about credit, I recognize that success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan.  And there are many things that I've done in the community [Annapolis, Maryland] that others have taken credit for and I have found that I don't mind because my Maker knows who did what, and when I stand, I'll stand for a lot there.  But what the people know that I have done, that I would like to be remembered as a person who having passed through, made a difference.
Story_ID: 208881
Speaker 1: This is the sculpture portion of the Kunta Kinte-Alex Haley Memorial [Annapolis, Maryland].  And here we have Alex Haley sitting on the wall, sharing heritage stories with three children.  The young lady on the left is Asian, the young man in the middle is a European American, and the young lady on the right is African American.
Speaker 2: And about what year was this photograph taken?
Speaker 1: This photo would have been taken in 1999.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you need a clip?
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is a photograph of myself, sitting with the members of the Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond [Richmond, Virginia] and it was taken in April of 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is you right here?
Speaker 2: Oh, I am the seated second from the right.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: You mean you can't tell who the black guy is?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of myself presenting at a business meeting, no, no, I guess that would have been a political meeting in 1993.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you, can you identify the other gentlemen in the photograph?
Speaker 2: I know the fellow on the left is named [Robert O.C.] "Rocky" Worcester.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: W-O-R-C-E-S-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Worcester.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, yeah, and the other two gentlemen I don't know, the one on the right is me.

Speaker 2: Okay.  Super.  And then we'll go down to the second one.
Speaker 1: The bottom picture is a picture at the same event but showing all of the siblings.
Speaker 2: And can you identify them?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Standing up in the back from left to right is George Blackshear, Leonard Blackshear, Frank Blackshear, and Dwight Blackshear.  Starting from the left sitting is Nannearl Blackshear Jordan, Elsie Blackshear Chapman, Elsie [Singfield] Blackshear, my mother, Frank Blackshear, Sr., my father, and Carmen Blackshear Shortt, my sister.  I should add that Frank Blackshear standing in above is Frank Blackshear, Jr.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where did it come from?
Speaker 1: What was the date on the back of that one?
Speaker 2: Ninety-nine [1999].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Sorry that I put it back.  Okay.  Ready.
Speaker 1: This is a picture that I had taken, is what you would call your board of directors shot, that you use for your press releases, and that you use for your press releases and if you go on a board of directors and they need a picture, you give 'em this picture.
Speaker 2: And the year?
Speaker 1: So--the year on this one is 1999.
Speaker 2: Okay.
