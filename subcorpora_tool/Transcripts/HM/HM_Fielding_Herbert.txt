Story_ID: 485242
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: My mother is Sadie Emma Julia Gaillard [Sadie Gaillard Fielding].
Speaker 1: Can you spell it for me?
Speaker 2: Sadie, S-A-D-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emma Julia.
Speaker 1: Emma, E-M-M-A?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And J-U-L-I-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gaillard, Gaillard is her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Spell that, please.
Speaker 2: G-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's where my middle name comes from.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, tell me about her mother, your grandmother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her mother was Emma Dorell [Emma Dorell Gaillard].
Speaker 1: How are you spelling Dorell?
Speaker 2: D-O-R-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her father?
Speaker 2: Her father was Julius, I think his middle name was R, Gaillard [Julius Gaillard].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you go back to your great-great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 485243
Speaker 1: But on my father's side, I can only go back to my grandfather because there's a sort of a mix up in the old family where my grandfather's name--and this is strictly family, you know, talk--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and over the years, they've said that my grandfather came from Dorchester County [South Carolina] and his name--his family name was Phelon, P-H-E-L-O-N, and they were apparently very fair-skinned black people who--and they operated a business in Summerville [South Carolina], and then all of his siblings went north and became white, and he refused to do so and came south--he came to Charleston [South Carolina] and changed his name from Phelon to Fielding, and so that's as far as I can go back on my father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Okay, well, tell me your father's name.
Speaker 1: My father's name?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Julius Park Levy Fielding [Julius P.L. Fielding].
Speaker 2: Can you spell--
Speaker 1: L-E-V-Y.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And his father's name was Phelon?
Speaker 1: I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the name?
Speaker 1: --my grandfather's--
Speaker 2: Grandfather?
Speaker 1: --name was Julius R. Fielding because my brother who drowned when he was thirteen had that same name. He was not--he was not a junior but he was--his name was Julius R. Fielding.
Speaker 2: So both your grandfather's names was Julius R.?
Speaker 1: Julius, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Interesting.  And what about your grandmother?
Speaker 1: My grandmother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: On--
Speaker 2: Your father's side.
Speaker 1: On my father's side?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Her name was Felicia Fielding Goodwin [Felicia Wright Goodwin].  Well, she--her, her maiden name was Felicia Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T, and then she married my Grandfather Fielding, and when he died, she married Grandfather Goodwin.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Let's, let's start by talking about your grandmother and grandfather, Julius and Emma.  Do you remember them at all?
Speaker 1: No, not, not on my father's side.
Speaker 2: On your mother's [Sadie Gaillard Fielding] side.  On your mother--
Speaker 1: I mean, on my mother's--I don't have any real memory of them, either my grandfather [Julius Gaillard] or my grandmother [Emma Dorell Gaillard] on my mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I only have memory of Grandpa Goodwin and my grandmother on my father's side.
Story_ID: 485244
Speaker 1: Well, then tell me about your mother, Sadie Emma [Sadie Gaillard Fielding].
Speaker 2: My mother--
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any stories about her growing up?  Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born on Norman Street.  It's on the west side, uptown Charleston [South Carolina], and her father [Julius Gaillard] was a butcher.  He, he had an abattoir they called it where they brought the cows and the pigs in and they slaughtered them right on the Ashley River and then he had a wholesale butcher shop there and then he had a retail butcher shop on Spring Street, and he also had a retail butcher shop in the slave market on Market Street.  And my mother really learned--she was a professional butcher because she learned it in the trade with her father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: I think my mother had a high school education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she share any other stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did she share any other stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My mother came in that era when, you know, that it's a carryover from slavery when they had the so-called house Negroes and the field Negroes, and you had a, a strong class system in Charleston which really existed all the way up to the civil rights demonstrations when that class system started to break down.  But my mother came from that high society side of the caste system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about that.  Tell me what were some of the stories that she told you about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, well it was really a--almost a segregation system within the black community, and I think it emanated--it came all the way from slavery, and, and it carried over.  And strange thing in my life, my mother was on that side and my grandmother [Felicia Wright Goodwin] who really raised us was on--extremely on the other side.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother on your father's side raised you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 485245
Speaker 1: On your mother's [Sadie Gaillard Fielding] side, did anybody talk about their parents or your grandparents being in slavery?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think--I think that was one of the things that came up in our--in our family all the way.  They seemed to be proud of the fact that they were always free.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: And that's part of that old caste system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Tell me your relationship with your mother.  What kind of relationship did you have with her?
Speaker 2: Very close, but as I said, this building is very old.  In fact, it's over 250 years old.  And when we moved here, I was five years old.  The second floor and the third floor was our living quarters, and all in the back which is now a showroom and office, is where we lived.  We lived in the back part with my [paternal] grandmother [Felicia Wright Goodwin] and mama and daddy [Julius P.L. Fielding] lived up here in this section.  And mama and daddy were busy running the business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] on a daily basis.  So really when, when we came home from school, we came home to grandmamma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your grandparents [Emma Dorell Gaillard and Julius Gaillard]--we're still talking about your mother's side, did they own property?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Where did they own property?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, I--they were--they were pretty well--fairly wealthy people and they owned property all over the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Is there anything else you wanna--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --tell me about your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother was a very quiet but strictly business kind of person.  And in fact, she ran the office part of the business and my daddy did, you know, the funerals and the embalming and everything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did your mother have sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother had three sisters and six brothers.  And the funny thing about that, my grandfather as I said was a butcher, and he left here at the invitation of Booker T. Washington and went to teach butchering or whatever at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and all of the children went with him to Tuskegee except my mother.  She was the only one that stayed here.  So, that side of my family really went to Alabama and we were the only Gaillards left here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And do you know why your mother didn't go with him?
Speaker 2: I think it was the time when she got married.  See she--my daddy started the business in 1912 on King Street and then in 1916, he moved from King Street to corner of Short [Street] and Logan [Street], which is two blocks away from here, and I checked the--I've got a copy of the marriage license, and my mother and father got married that same year.  So that's probably why she didn't go with him, my grandfather--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Tuskegee.
Story_ID: 485246
Speaker 1: Well now, let's talk about your father's side of the family.  So, you remember your Grandfather Fielding [Julius R. Fielding] and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And your [paternal] grandmother [Felicia Wright Goodwin] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My Grandfather Fielding ran a--what they call a livery business.  He had a big house on Tradd Street and had a livery stable in the backyard, and he had those, what do they call it, Clydesdale horses, and they hauled material all over the city from the train station to businesses and things of that nature, and I understand he had a real good business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was right there with him on Tradd Street until he died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I believe that was when they moved to 61 Logan Street, which is right down the street from here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother, I don't know when, but sometime after Grandpa Fielding died, she married Grandpa Goodwin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Grandpa Goodwin was a barber.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll talk about him in a minute.  Now, your grandmother--which grandmother started the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]?
Speaker 2: Grandma Goodwin.
Speaker 1: Goodwin, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was the first president and there were two other ladies with her that founded the YWCA [Coming Street YWCA, Charleston, South Carolina]--
Speaker 1: The YWCA.
Speaker 2: --on Coming Street.  And they had the original charter for YWCA in Charleston [South Carolina].  And unfortunately, I think it was during the Depression [Great Depression] when money was real short.  Somehow, the white--a group of white women were able to, to get the charter from them, and they took it and they started a Y down on George Street.  And it was years later when we came home out of the [U.S.] Army and out of school and everything, and the Y at that time was insisting on integrating.  And the white women who then had my grandmother's charter, they were refusing to integrate.  So, my brother [Bernard Fielding] who's a lawyer (laughter), they sued and they got the charter back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you, you actually lived with your grandparents, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They lived--
Speaker 2: --with grandmother.
Speaker 1: Grandmother--
Speaker 2: Right here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me some stories about you and your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Tell me some stories about living here in this house with your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was quite interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother was a--she was a real strong community worker and a heck of a cook, and, and a strong disciplinarian.  But, all of us grew up with her in the back and it was--it was during that period that we came up through the Depression years, when things were really rough.  And--but she managed to keep things going.  And I'll never forget, one time there was a grocery store over on the corner and grandma sent me over to the grocery store to get something and coming back from the grocery store, I found a twenty-dollar bill in the gutter.  And I brought it and I was happy as the devil, and she made me find out who that twenty-dollar bill belonged to.
Story_ID: 485247
Speaker 1: So how long did your Grandfather Fielding [Julius R. Fielding] live?  Do you remember how old you were when he died and she [Fielding's paternal grandmother, Felicia Wright Goodwin] remarried?
Speaker 2: I don't re- oh, Grandpa Fielding?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No, that was long before any of us were born.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Because I was a little boy, and I remember Grandpa Goodwin at 61 Logan [Street], and he used to bounce me up and down on his knees.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: But I never, never really knew my Grandpa Fielding.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me what your Grandfather Goodwin, what was his first name?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't--I really don't know.  That's strange but I never remember what Grandpa Goodwin's first name was.
Speaker 1: You just--what did you call him?
Speaker 2: Grandpa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you have any other stories about your Grandfather Goodwin?  You say he used to bounce you on his knees.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories about you and he?
Speaker 2: Well he had a barbershop down on Broad Street which is, you know, is the business street, and his barbershop was right on the corner of Broad and Church.  Church Street is right--one block away from where Porgy and Bess lived.  And incidentally, my father [Julius P.L. Fielding] buried Porgy not long before he died, and there's a big tombstone over on James Island [South Carolina] about Porgy right now.  But Grandpa Goodwin--in those days, you know, the barbershops were strictly segregated, so Grandpa, he only cut white people's hair.
Story_ID: 485248
Speaker 1: Was there any talk about people on your father's [Julius P.L. Fielding] side being in slavery?
Speaker 2: No because, like I said, I only go back to that Phelon, and one of these days, I hope to be able to trace that thing and really, really check it out.  Because as of right now, it's just a thing that's been handed down in the family over the years.
Speaker 1: So you think that they were children of slave owners because they were so fair?
Speaker 2: Probably were, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And, see, there was a whole lot of that mixing up, you know, in those days.  In fact, my grandma, Grandma Goodwin [Felicia Wright Goodwin], was very fair, but Grandma Goodwin had two sisters, Aunt Mary [ph.] and Aunt Emma [ph.], and Aunt Emma was a medium brown and Aunt Mary was real dark brown, but they were grandmamma's sisters.  And I'll never forget Aunt Mary used to come in and she'd always say, "The blacker the bird, the sweeter the juice" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Any other stories about your grandparents on either side?
Speaker 2: No.  Except evidently when my [maternal] grandfather [Julius Gaillard] left here and went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], his brother who was--we called Uncle Willie [Willie Gaillard], continued the business, and he had a big market down in the old slave market on Market Street.  And my mother's [Sadie Gaillard Fielding] cousin ran that market and we got all of our meat and fish and everything from them.  That was the family thing.
Speaker 1: How much education did your father have?
Speaker 2: My father went to--finished Avery Institute [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina] and attended South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  It was South Carolina Agricultural and Normal Institute at the time.  I think he only did about two years at South Carolina State and then he left and went to New York [New York] to embalming school [Renouard Training School for Embalmers], and came back here, and he started the business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] in 1912 at the corner of King [Street] and Queen Streets.
Story_ID: 485249
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Sadie Gaillard Fielding], she no longer did any butchering but began to help your father [Julius P.L. Fielding] with the funeral business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when they got married?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  When you think back to your childhood, tell me about the neighborhood since this is the same house that you grew up in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood then when you were coming up.  Now, you--1929 starts the Depression [Great Depression].  Did you--did your family--were you impacted by the Depression?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember when we first moved up here.  In fact, before we moved in, daddy brought me up here one day and, and at that time, this was a, like a tenement building, everybody rented a room.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And out there in the hall, where the computer room is now, that was a bathroom.  They evidently have a bathroom on each floor and everybody had a room and shared the bathroom.  And I'll never forget, I was a little boy, when we came in here, that same room right out there had a big bathtub and the bathtub was jammed full of moonshine liquor bottles (laughter).  Evidently, they were making the moonshine right in here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me about the neighborhood.  Who were the people that lived in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: This neighborhood was pretty well--it was predominantly black.  In this block from Magazine Street all the way up to Beaufain [Street] was all black on both sides.  The block from Magazine down to Queen [Street] was mixed.  Every other house was white, black, white, black.  And then we lived in the block from Queen to Short [Street].  That was mixed, you know, white and black.  And we--our house was right on the corner.  And then we played in Lo- on Short Street.  Short Street at that time was all black.  And now, I think there's only one, maybe two black families left on Short Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when I asked you about your family being impacted by the Depression, are you saying that people were making moonshine to help be able to make a living or to have money or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they did because I remember there were big houses across the street where that project is now, and those folks, a lot of the fellows were making the moonshine out on the islands and they'd bring it in in these big high-top automobiles and they'd sell it all around the neighborhood.  But that was just a small part of it.  Most of the people were really doing service type jobs, if they could get one.  And that's when daddy went into the--in the bartering business.  And I've got some old records in the back that show where families came in to make funeral arrangements and they had no money.  So what he did, he would arrange to a complete funeral for a half a cow or some tomatoes and vegetables and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 485250
Speaker 1: Finish telling me about the bartering that your father [Julius P.L. Fielding] did for funeral ser- arrangements.
Speaker 2: Oh, I think that that really was one of the moves that he made that really helped to build the business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] up.  Because the people just didn't have any money in those days, and he simply arranged to have them pay with meat and vegetables and things of that nature, and he would make a record.  He'll put down, you know, one cow and one hog and so many barrels of tomatoes, and corn and what have you.  And as they brought the things in, he'd just check them off.  And he had--he got so much that he had to build a barn in the backyard to keep all this stuff, and it was more than we could eat, so he had to share it with other folks in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Now, tell me about your Aunt May [sic.] and Emma.
Speaker 2: Aunt Mary [ph.] and Aunt Emma [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought--okay Mary?  Yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Aunt Mary, okay.  You remember family discussions with them?  Family discussions with them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was usually religious part of the family discussions because, see, Aunt Mary and Aunt Emma and I think my grandmother were originally Episcopalians, and Calvary Episcopal Church [Charleston, South Carolina] was right around the corner on Wilson Street.  And I think that what happened when my Grandmother Felicia [Felicia Wright Goodwin] got married, she evidently switched with--I don't know whether it was Grandpa Fielding [Julius R. Fielding] or Grandpa Goodwin, but she switched from the Episcopal church to the United Methodist church, and they went to Centenary [Centenary United Methodist Church, Charleston, South Carolina].  So as children, when we came up, we really came up partly in the Episcopal church and partly in the Methodist church.  And right now, there's only two of us left, my youngest brother [Bernard Fielding] and me, and he's Methodist and I'm Episcopalian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were some of the discussions that you remember?
Speaker 2: In the family (laughter)?  You don't remember too much because--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --you know, that was during the days when they would say, you know, "You go outside and play."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: You--we got family business to talk about and it, it puts you out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 485251
Speaker 1: Tell me about your brothers and sisters, your siblings.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there was Emily [Emily Fielding] who was the oldest, and she was born at 61 [61 Logan Street, Charleston, South Carolina] and then Julius [Julius R. Fielding], who was next to Emily was also born at 61, but Julius got, got--drowned on, on the Stono River when he was thirteen.  And then we had--I had a sister, Dorothy [Dorothy Fielding], who was eleven months older than me, and Dorothy--my mother [Sadie Gaillard Fielding] had flower gardens in the front of the funeral home [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] and she had--you know how people put bottles around, and she had some embalming fluid bottles and the fluid was red and looked like strawberry and my sister drank some of it, and she died from it.  She was--I think they said she was only three years old and I was two years old at the time.  But then, that's when we moved from 61 up here [122 Logan Street, Charleston, South Carolina], and when we moved here, shortly after we moved here, my brother, Timothy [Timothy Fielding], was born here, and then later on, five years later, the last one, Bernard [Bernard Fielding] was born here.  So all of us were born at 61 except Timothy and Bernard; they were born here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All born at home with midwives?
Speaker 2: I guess so because--you know, I only remember, not Bernard, but I remember with Timothy, I was in kindergarten right around on Wilson Street at Calvary Episcopal Church [Charleston, South Carolina], and when I came home, I found Timothy in a basket.  You know, they had the old clothes baskets and they put a pillow in it and I found him in a basket when I came home from around the corner.  In fact, the--you can't do it now, but there's a picture right up there on--that shows my brothers, Julius and Timothy, standing in front of the funeral home in 1930.
Story_ID: 485252
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Summerville [South Carolina] store.
Speaker 2: Summerville store?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh, that goes back to the Phelons.
Speaker 1: Oh, what about them?
Speaker 2: The Phelons ran a--I think it was a dry goods store in Summerville.  And, and like I said, they--evidently, their business broke up or something and all of the children went north and became white except my [paternal] grandfather [Julius R. Fielding]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who came down here.
Story_ID: 485253
Speaker 1: So now, when you start school, what elementary school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Avery [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina].  It was Avery Normal Institute at that time.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your experience in the elementary grades.
Speaker 2: My what?
Speaker 1: In the elementary grades, tell me about your experience in school.
Speaker 2: My grades?
Speaker 1: During your elementary years at Avery, tell me about what you did in school.
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember mostly at Avery the--we were--it was in two separate buildings.  The lower building was the elementary school and then the big building that's there right now was the high school.  And we came--I came through that period with the real strict teachers, Miss Clyde [Alberta Clyde] and Miss Butler [ph.], and they taught real well.  But then later on, I don't know why, but I think my father [Julius P.L. Fielding] thought I wasn't doing too well, so--and he took me out of Avery and sent me to the sister school.  All of these were AMA, American Missionary Association schools, and I went to Lincoln Academy in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and that--that's where I graduated from high school.
Story_ID: 485254
Speaker 1: What year did you go to Lincoln [Lincoln Academy, Kings Mountain, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I left Avery [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina] in the seventh grade.  I finished the seventh grade at Avery, but then when I went to Lincoln Academy, I went into the ninth grade.  I skipped the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In North Carolina, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It was in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, near Gastonia [North Carolina].  It's not anymore--it's not there anymore.
Speaker 1: So if--did you skip a grade--why did you skip a grade?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it had something to do with the age problem, but I just know when I went up there, I went from the seventh grade to the ninth grade.  And really I graduated on time at the average age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the teachers at Lincoln Academy, how were the teachers there?
Speaker 2: How were they?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: They were real good teachers.  And Lincoln Academy had an extended industrial arts program much more than what Avery had.  Avery had industrial arts where they taught carpentry down in the bottom floors.  And I took--I went through the industrial arts program at Avery but at Lincoln Academy, they had much more because they had farming and other stuff incorporated into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers that you remember that might have encouraged you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, Dr. McDowell [Henry Curtis McDowell] was the--what do you call it--call him, the headmaster at Lincoln Academy and his son--his grand- no, his son [Curtis F. McDowell] is now still there.  The school is not there but they have a church there.  It's a congregational church.  And Reverend McDowell is up there right now with that, and Dr. McDowell was a real fine fellow.  He had been a missionary in Africa for a number of years and he came back here, and became the headmaster of that school.
Speaker 1: Who were the students at that school?  Who were the students there?
Speaker 2: We were--most of the students were predominantly from North Carolina, but there were a lot of students from down here in South Carolina and other states, too.  I would think that there was probably--we had two big dormitories, a girls dormitory and a boys dormitory, and then a lot of the students came right from the local community.  It was probably about five or six hundred students in that school.
Story_ID: 485255
Speaker 1: Now, when you were at Avery [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina], Avery was a school that tended to have students that were, let's say, privileged somewhat (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  That was--that's always been a kind of a sore spot in the city of Charleston [South Carolina] because there was just sort of a rivalry between Burke High School [Charleston, South Carolina] and Avery, and then later on came the, the Catholic school and it was a part of that old caste and class system.
Speaker 1: Did you see it come into play when you were at Avery?
Speaker 2: I didn't realize it.  I guess I was too young to, you know, realize it at the time, but as I think back, right now I could recognize that it existed there.  And to a great extent--not to a great extent, but to some extent, it still exists this very day.
Speaker 1: Was it the same type of atmosphere in North Carolina [at Lincoln Academy, Kings Mountain, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  Unfortunately, no.  It--I mean fortunately.
Speaker 1: Fortunately.
Speaker 2: Fortunately, no.  It was an entirely different atmosphere and--but it was the same school.  Both of them were American Missionary Association schools.
Story_ID: 485256
Speaker 1: What other activities were you involved in, in high school?
Speaker 2: I did a little bit of sports, mainly in basketball.  I tried out once or twice for football but I was so little, they made me the water boy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was music a part of your life at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, or I was on the glee club, and I sang tenor on the glee club for a number of years.  See, at Lincoln Academy [Kings Mountain, North Carolina], it was much more of a religious atmosphere than it was at Avery [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina].  We used to have vesper services in the afternoon, and the glee club, they would send us out over the state to other schools.  And I really enjoyed that up at Lincoln Academy.
Speaker 1: When you went to Lincoln Academy, was it the first time you were away from home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it sure was, um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did that transition work for you?
Speaker 2: It was fine.  I had no real problems whatsoever (laughter).  We stayed in the boys dormitory and I remember the lady in charge.  Ms. Westerband [Geraldine Westerband] was in charge of the dormitory.  And they had strict hours.  You had to be up at a certain time, you had to be in bed at a certain time.  The lights had to be out and the radio had to be off.  You didn't have a television, but had radios.  And I liked to play the radio late at night.  So I had learned a lot about electricity from a friend of a mine all the way from Short Street [Charleston, South Carolina].  So I ran a wire around the baseboard and had a tack on one side and a tack on the other side on the door, and when she would open the door, it would break the circuit and the radio would go off, and she'd come in and look, and she knew she heard that radio, but it was never on, and she never figured out how I (laughter), how I had that thing rigged up.
Speaker 1: What did you like to listen to on the radio?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: You don't remember?
Speaker 2: I was a youngster in those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of music was playing?  Do you remember during that time you were in high school?
Speaker 2: It wasn't that--it wasn't this honky tonk, knockdown, drag out that you hear.  I never appreciated that.  I've always had an appreciation for more of classical music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  So, did you have a prom when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: Did I have a what?
Speaker 1: A prom?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes they had a prom.
Speaker 1: Did you go?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: In fact (laughter), that's another story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got put out of high school two weeks before graduation because I got caught sneaking in the girls dormitory, and so I tell folks a lot--I say--you know, I went and graduated from four years of college [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] but I never graduated from high school.  I got my diploma, but I never--you know, I was never able to walk in the graduation (laughter).  I was a little bit devilish in those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, tell me what other classes or clubs you belonged to while you were at Lincoln.
Speaker 2: Lincoln Academy?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not really anything specific.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did a lot of tennis and basketball, and spent a lot of time in the industrial arts shop.  I liked that woodworking.  In fact, that's where I learned a whole lot about woodworking.
Story_ID: 485257
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from--well, did you leave Lincoln Academy [Kings Mountain, North Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lincoln Academy, 1940 I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1940.
Speaker 2: Must've been 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you--you took pilots training?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Pilots training.
Speaker 2: Pilots training?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's when I went to West Virginia [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: Was that right after high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to West Virginia in 19--in the fall of 1940 or--either--I'm not sure whether, either '40 [1940] or '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had--there was an airport right next to West Virginia State and we--they had these small single engine planes, we called them Piper Cubs [Piper J-3 Cub] and I took pilot training there.  And then they came in and, and they built a chemical plant where--on the airport, but what they did, the school took the same Pipers and put pontoons on them, and we flew them off of the Kanawha River.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So this is the time World War II [WWII] is going on.  Are you drafted?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  We were--I was in West Virginia State.  I remember one night we were--we were playing cards and the thing came on the radio that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], and that's--kind of just about stopped everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let me back up a little bit.  You leave Lincoln and how do you decide that you wanna go to West Virginia State College?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  That's another story (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: See, when my mother [Sadie Gaillard Fielding] and father [Julius P.L. Fielding] died in 1938--
Speaker 1: They both died in 1938?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about three or four months apart.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And my father had left a will, and my mother was listed as the principal person in the will, and would've been now executor and everything else, but she died three months before he did and he never changed the will.  So there was two contingent gentlemen in there who was my father's friends, Dr. MacVall [ph.] and Mr. Rudolph [ph.], so they became our guardians and administrators of the will.  And the funny thing is, daddy had also said in the will that the business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] had to be sold.  And they recognized the fact that the business was a valuable thing, so what they did--they had to comply with the will, they formed a corporation and they sold the business to us, the four of us that were living, Emily [Emily Fielding], me, Bernard [Bernard Fielding], and Timothy [Timothy Fielding].  And then there were two gentlemen here that worked with my father for a number of years, they ran the business and my sister got out of school [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] and came down, and she ran the office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So who told you about West Virginia State College?
Speaker 2: Mr. Rudolph, who happens to be my younger brother's godfather also, was a very stern businessman.  He was in the real estate business and very successful, and he was a strong Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] graduate.  And one day, he just--he called me up to the office and he and Dr. MacVall were there and they said--they handed me all the papers.  They had made all the arrangements and everything and paid all the tuition and everything for me to go to Hampton Institute, and I said, "I don't wanna go to Hampton Institute."  Oh, he was very indignant because he was a real strict fellow.  And I--it finally came down to a point.  I got up and I walked out and I said, "I'm going back downtown to Logan Street, and whenever you get the money from Hampton and you decide to send the money to West Virginia State, then I'll go to school, but I ain't gonna go to school until you send the money to West Virginia," and that's how I went to West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So how long were you in West Virginia, just a year or some months before (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, about a year and a half I think.
Speaker 1: Year and a half?
Story_ID: 485258
Speaker 1: Then war [World War II, WWII] broke out.  And finally, I was in cadet, you know, RS- R--
Speaker 2: ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]?
Speaker 1: ROTC training at West Virginia [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], but I always wanted to fly.  That's why I was taking pilot training at West Virginia.  So I wanted to volunteer to go in the [U.S.] Army Air Corps, but I couldn't do it because my sister [Emily Fielding] was my guardian and I had to get her permission, and she gave me the permission to do it, so I came home, and I volunteered for Army Air Corps.  At that time, it was not United States Air Force, it was Army Air Corps.  It was a part of the [U.S.] Army.  And when I came home, they sent us over to Sullivan's Island [South Carolina] to take the examination.  It was about twenty of us and we all went over there and took the exam, and out of the twenty, there's only three of us passed the exam to go into the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces].  It was two white boys and me.  And lo and behold, those two white boys are sent immediately to the Air Force, and they sent me to Fort Bragg [North Carolina]--not, not Fort--but Fort Jackson [Columbia, South Carolina] first in the service corps and then from Fort Jackson to Fort Bragg, and from Fort Bragg to New Orleans, Louisiana, in a port company, and I raised sand but I couldn't do anything about it.  But I never gave up.  I kept fighting, trying to get into the Air Force.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So tell me about basic training.  How was that for you?
Speaker 1: The basic training was in New Orleans, a little camp outside of New Orleans called Camp Plauche [Camp Harahan, Louisiana] and I was fortunate.  I was sent down there on a troop train and when we got off the troop train, this big fellow, a sergeant, came up to me and he said, "Young man, you're from Charleston [South Carolina]?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Your name Fielding [HistoryMaker Herbert U. Fielding]?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Come here."  He had been stationed here, and they sent him from here to New Orleans to form this new company, and he had been friendly with my sister, so he made me--he asked me, he said, "Can you type?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  "Okay, you're my clerk," and he made me the company clerk.  So I really didn't have any, you know, strong basic training.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was--other guys were walking around with a rifle, I was walking around with a typewriter (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, you learned how to type in high school [Lincoln Academy, Kings Mountain, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And college.
Speaker 2: And college.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So tell me some other stories about the Army.
Speaker 1: Army?  Oh, boy.
Speaker 2: Well the Air Corps, you know.
Speaker 1: The--well, when I first went in, I wasn't--definitely wasn't in the Air Corps, but I kept trying and finally, this--a general order came through.  I used to watch every day, see what new was coming up.  And [U.S.] Congress set up--by a special act of congress, they set up a training school for engineering at Prairie View College [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] in Texas, and this was strictly for college level soldiers.  And fortunately, I got pulled out and sent to Prairie View.  And when we got down to Prairie View--I was down there about three months, we were taking basic engineering training, and then all of a sudden, things were heating up over in Europe and they were getting ready for D-Day, so one morning, they came in and pulled us out at reveille and said, all enlisted men who volunteered from [U.S.] Army Ground Forces or [U.S.] Army Service Forces had to be returned immediately.  And my roommate at Prairie View was a guy by the name of Otis Finley [Otis Finley, Jr.].  Finley's father was a colonel in the Illinois National Guard, so we had some connections.  And I hunched Finley, I said, "Finley, we didn't come from Army Ground Forces or Army Service Forces.  We came from specialized training at Prairie View."  He said, "Right."  And I said, "We're going down to headquarters right after reveille."  And we went to headquarters.  And when we walked into the headquarters, this lieutenant was there and I explained to him, I was a staff sergeant at the time, and he looked at the papers and he said, "Sergeant, I think you're right.  I'll change it."  We had already had our heads shaved and our duffel bags were on the troop train to go to Tuskegee [Alabama], to the 99th Fighter Squadron [99th Pursuit Squadron] in Tuskegee.
Story_ID: 485259
Speaker 1: You were telling me about you were getting ready to go to Tuskegee [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when we went into the headquarters and I explained the situation to this lieutenant, and he agreed, he said, "I think you're absolutely right.  I'll straighten it out and you'll go on the troop train to Tuskegee."  And this colonel was sitting in the back room and he came out front and he said, "What is this all about, lieutenant?"  And the lieutenant explained to him.  He said, "I don't know about that."  And he said, "Let me check it out."  And he went back in his office and he came back and put on the desk, [U.S.] Army regulations.  Army regulations about that thick.  So he started flipping through the Army regulations.  And he just kept flipping, flipping, and I finally--I said, "Colonel, if you tell me what you're looking for, I'll tell you where to find it."  He said, "What do you mean?"  I said, "Well, colonel, I've been company clerk, I've been battalion clerk, and I've been regimental clerk.  I know the regulations."  And that--I--that's all I said.  I know the regula- if you tell me what you want, I'll tell you where to find it.  And he got all hot and flustered, and he finally came up, he said, "That special act of [U.S.] Congress set up this training under the supervision of Major General Summerall [Charles Pelot Summerall].  Major General Summerall was commanding general of [U.S.] Army Service Forces, so, therefore, I would construe that you are part of Army Service Force."  I said, "Well, colonel, just as easily as you could construe that we're part of Army Services, you could construe otherwise because it said supervision, it did not say command."  He said, "What do you mean?"  I said, "It was not put directly under his command.  It was strictly under his supervision," and I wanted to go to Tuskegee, and he said no.  And that's when I told him--I cussed him out.  And they put me in the guard house and--but they finally-- they knew that it was gonna create a racial issue, so they pulled the guards off and, and they put me on the troop train, sending me to Camp Shelby, Mississippi (laughter).  That's another whole story.
Speaker 1: Was that the train--was that when the general didn't want any blacks in his troop?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or is--well, tell us the story.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, we were sent down there, assigned and joined to the 69th Infantry Division, and the train was mixed up, you know, with black and white soldiers.  And when we got to Camp Shelby, the train stopped at the gate, and the train commander, I think he was a major, came through and he pointed us out.  He said, "You, you, you, you," he took all of the black soldiers and told us to follow him, and he put us on the last car on the train.  And they disconnected that car and left it sitting there and the rest of the train went on in to Camp Shelby.  And then later on, this brigadier general, one-star general, came by and the windows were open on the train.  You could, you know, could hear what--wasn't any air conditioning.  And I actually heard the general say, "I don't care what that colonel in Keesler Field [Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi] said, there ain't gonna be no niggers in my division."  And he made us stay there in that troop train until they sent a telegram back to Keesler Field and made the colonel rescind the orders and put us in a replacement pool, and would not accept us in the 69th Infantry Division.
Story_ID: 485260
Speaker 1: So, where did you go?
Speaker 2: We went on into the base [Keesler Field; Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi] in the replacement pool and I think we stayed there about two or three days, and then from there, they put us on one of those--we went to Myles Standish [Camp Myles Standish, Taunton, Massachusetts], outside of Boston [Massachusetts], and they put us one of those tankers for overseas, and we went overseas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right straight overseas.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, what happened when you went overseas?  Where did you go?
Speaker 2: We went--we landed in Liverpool, England, and then we went from Liverpool to Renfrew [Scotland].  It's a little town outside of Glasgow, Scotland, and we stayed a while up there.  And then we went from Glasgow, Scotland, to Southampton, England, on the--down on the English Channel.  And, and then we went from Southampton over to France.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Anything that you--any stories about overseas that you wanna tell?
Speaker 2: Over there?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, it's a funny thing.  When we went to France, we were--they put us in a quartermaster trucking company and our job was to haul hundred-octane gas to General Patton's [George S. Patton] tanks.  And we had a convoy.  We would have a jeep in the front with a .50 caliber machine gun and we had ten trucks with gas, and then a jeep in the middle, and ten trucks and the jeep on the end, so you had three trucks, three jeeps and twenty trucks.  And I was riding the middle jeep with the .50 caliber machine gun one day and we were going up to the front, and I looked on the side of the road, and these guys were sitting on the road, and I saw the patch, 69th Infantry Division.  And I said, "I'll be darned, here comes my division."  And so help me, it was right near Christmas in 1944, when Jerry [German Army] broke through, and they had a--there was a British division on the left, the 69th in the middle, and another American division on the right.  And we were--we had to dump--I guess we were about twenty or twenty-five miles from the front and a limey, British guy, comes through on a motorcycle and he said, "You guys better get the heck out of here as fast as you can."  I said, "What do you mean?"  "Put as much of that gas on them trucks and get on out of here."  I said, "Where we gonna go?"  He said, "Just head for Paris [France] and keep going until somebody tells you to stop," so we did.  We took off.  And I--we didn't get too far before Jerry blew up the rest of the stuff that we left there.  And I found out later on when Jerry broke through, he ran slam over the 69th Infantry Division and wiped them out almost to the man.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So, I said, on many a days, segregation was a good thing in some times.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, it saved your life there, didn't it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)Um-hm.
Story_ID: 485261
Speaker 1: You come out of the service in what year?
Speaker 2: Forty--came out in January of '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you go back to college?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you go back to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went back west--went straight back to West Virginia [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in the interim, I had--I'd been lucky.  I got to go to three schools over there after the war [World War II, WWII] was over and we didn't have enough points to come home, they opened up these army schools.  And I first went to Sorbonne [University of Paris] in Paris [France], but I didn't stay because it was strictly French and I couldn't keep up with the language.  But I transferred from Sorbonne to Biarritz [Biarritz American University, Biarritz, France] down in southern France and I took business administration there.  And then I left Biarritz and I was transferred to Glasgow University [University of Glasgow] in Glasgow, Scotland.  And I continued business administration there.  And I got those credits from overseas so when I came back to West Virginia, I really finished a whole semester ahead of time.  I finished in three and a half years instead of four years because of the [U.S.] Army training.
Speaker 1: Well you said you didn't have enough points, what does that mean, to come home?
Speaker 2: They, they had some system, a rating, rating you at that time, and you had to have a number of points in order to come home, and I don't know why I didn't have enough points.  But it worked out just as good anyhow, because I really got to go to school and got to see a whole lot more over in Europe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you majored in business administration?
Speaker 2: Business administration.
Speaker 1: At West Virginia (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have--huh?
Speaker 1: At West Virginia also, you got a B.A. there?
Speaker 2: No, I got a B.S.
Speaker 1: B.S., I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And with a minor in accounting, accounting and auditing.
Story_ID: 485262
Speaker 1: Did you plan to come home and work in the family business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] when you graduated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Originally, no. I didn't.  When I--in fact, when I first went to college [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], I was majoring in chemistry.  I wanted to go into chemistry.  But then as things progressed, and Dr. MacVall [ph.] really was the main influence.  He kind of turned me around and told me, you know, you come back here and you're gonna have to go back in the business.  I really didn't want to, but I'm glad I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, when you come home, your sister [Emily Fielding] is helping to run the business here, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was president and chairman of the board.  See, we founded--when they incorporated it--in fact, they had to wait until January of 1939 when she became twenty-one so that she could be appointed as our guardian, and also she could run the business.  She had to come home from college.  She was in South Carolina State [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] at the time.  She had to come home and start running the business.  And later on, she finally went back to South Carolina State and finished.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was here to meet you when you came home?  Tell me about your return trip.
Speaker 2: When, when I came home, I came back to Dr. MacVall and Mr. Rudolph [ph.] who I told you, you know, were old school, old Charleston [South Carolina] society and not very venturous as far as, you know, community is concerned.  But they were solid businessmen.  And fortunately, I had a background in accounting, and Arthur Clement [Arthur J. Clement, Jr.] who was the district manager of North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina], was also president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And they were having trouble with the treasury, and Arthur called me one day and asked me if I would come in and audit the books for the NAACP.  I said, fine.  And it didn't take me five minutes--I had a good background in accounting and auditing.  It didn't take me five minutes to find out something wasn't right.  And I started digging and I dug up, you know, I think several thousands of dollars that wasn't there.  But, the NAACP was strong organization at the time.  I think we had over three thousand members and it was not--it wouldn't have been a good thing to come out and say, you know, the treasury of NAACP is two or three thousand dollars short.  So, Arthur and I negotiated with the treasury to put the funds back little by little, and I just held off.  Everybody was, you know, why was it taking me so long to audit the books?  Well, I had audited the books a long time before that, but I was holding off because I didn't want this thing to get out.  And sure enough, he finally came up with everything and, and I made a report one Sunday afternoon at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] building and, and that, that got me hooked into the NAACP, and from the NAACP, I got hooked into Esau Jenkins with the Citizens Committee [Citizens Committee of Charleston County].  And frankly, Esau and Arthur Clement were--really became sort of like mentors.
Story_ID: 485263
Speaker 1: These gentlemen were definitely community minded, and so was your [paternal] grandmother [Felicia Wright Goodwin].  Tell me about some of the things that your grandmother did in the community [of Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Oh, my grandmother, she started the YWCA [Coming Street YWCA, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And really I think that's where my background and my whole philosophy comes from that.  Because I used to walk from here to the YWCA on Coming Street every Sunday afternoon, to vesper services, and they would have, you know, food and stuff.  And there were young girls that came from out of town, and they were coming here from various parts of the state to get jobs and things, and they would put them up in the Y.  And, and then grandma--grandmamma started with the--she had several other community organizations that she worked with.  And one of the greatest things, during the Depression [Great Depression] when things were real bad, she had a cousin, two cousins, who worked for these wealthy white people up on Long Island [New York], and like three or four times a year, they would send grandmamma these great big wooden barrels as tall--almost as tall as I am full of clothing, and she'd sort out the clothes and distribute them to--right here in the neighborhood and out on the islands.  And then she started the candy and the apples and stuff, and every, every Thanksgiving and Christmas, she'd have candy and apples.  In fact, they would buy the candy in the great big barrels and we had to sit in the back rooms and wrap each one of them, three or four pieces in a piece of paper, and then we'd distribute them to all of the schools.
Speaker 1: So--and this was back in the '30s [1930s], right?
Speaker 2: That--yeah, that was back in the times when things were rough, real rough.
Story_ID: 485264
Speaker 1: So you started with the NAAC [sic. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] as one of your first service organizations and you began to work with your sister [Emily Fielding] here at the funeral home [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, tell me what happens next?  'Cause it's 1946 and then we go on to the--into the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: I started working here at the funeral home, and at that time, I got really involved with Esau Jenkins and the Citizens Committee [Citizens Committee of Charleston County].  And what--Esau had a nonpartisan charter for the Citizens Committee, and our basic aim was getting black folks registered to vote.  It was right after 1948 when the Waring decision came down, Judge J. Waties Waring [Julius Waties Waring].  I guess you've heard of him?
Speaker 1: Okay, tell, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Judge J. Waties Waring was a white aristocrat, but a federal judge, and he broke up the segregated Democratic Party and forced the party to, to let us in.  And at, at the time, Esau was running the Citizens Committee and it had a nonpartisan charter, so we couldn't directly involve in partisan politics.  So what Esau used to do, he'd call a Citizens Committee meeting and we'd go through the routine in--usually in a church and about a half an hour, forty-five minutes, and then Esau would adjourn the meeting and then call me up front and say, now--tell me to run the meeting--run the meeting and we'd turn it into a political meeting.  And that's how we started the political action com- in fact, Esau taught me how to form the Political Action Committee [Political Action Committee of Charleston County].  It came right out of the Citizens Committee.  And, then we started fighting for positions in the Democratic Party.  And that went from one thing to the other, and we built up--in fact, at one time, the Political Action Committee of Charleston County was the strongest political organization in the State of South Carolina.  Nobody could get elected without the endorsement from PAC and, and that's how we built--we started running folks for the house [South Carolina House of Representatives].  In fact, I was in the first group to run for the house in 1952.  I ran with J. Arthur Brown and Frank Veal and myself.  And we knew we couldn't get elected because in those days, you ran at-large in the county and they had two things in there.  You had to have a full slate--they had this full slate law.  The eleven members to be elected from Charleston County [South Carolina], you had to vote for all eleven, and if you didn't, your vote didn't count at all.  And so when you go in there and you cast--say you got a thousand black votes and you got ten thousand white votes, you got to take your thousand black votes and put them on the black folks and you also got to put them on eight white folks, do you see what I mean?  So there's no way in the world you can catch up.  So we ran in 1952 really knowing that we couldn't get elected, but we ran to encourage black folks to get registered, and we got a whole lot of folks registered.

Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to ask you about any old superstitions and voodoo customs that people believed during that time.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I came in--well, you know, I've been in the business all my life.  I was born in it.  In the early days, we had a lot of that, mainly out in the rural areas when people used to put like old medicine bottles and if like a cough syrup, and they'd take the top off and turn it upside down on the grave so that that medicine would soak down into the grave.  And I've seen many a times when we would put like a live chicken in the box down in the grave and cover it up--and cover it up in with the person.  And there used to be a thing, quite often, folks used to make a cross out of two sticks and cover it with cloth, and place it on the person's chest or place it in their hand.  And then--and when folks, when somebody got killed, they would get--have a stick and they'd put the stick in the person's hand and that stick was supposed to be used to protect themselves when they go to the great beyond, all sorts of things like that.
Speaker 1: What--do you know what the purpose of the chicken in--the live chicken in the grave?
Speaker 2: I--no, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I--but I've seen it done a number of times.  Not, not recently, now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I know.  We're talking about--
Speaker 2: A long time ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'd like to know just what that's all about.
Speaker 1: What other superstitions were there?
Speaker 2: Mostly superstitions like that were--they were done in the cemetery most of the time.
Speaker 1: Were there--in the low country, were there any other rituals, you know, like drumming, announcing--
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord, yes.
Speaker 1: --the death.
Speaker 2: I forgot about that.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, that still goes on.
Speaker 1: Does it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The--they had what was considered the burial societies and there's--quite of a few of them still exist.  They join together in a group, and usually at the funeral, they will have a ceremony.  They march around the grave and they take evergreen, and each person throws evergreen into the grave, and then they have the drums and they beat the drums and they sing.  It's mostly on James Island [South Carolina] and Johns Island [South Carolina].  And quite a bit of that still goes on now.
Speaker 1: And what about--have you ever heard about babies being passed over in coffins?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Babies being--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in coffins.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: It's a funny thing you have to remind me on.  That is still very prominent now.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.  What is that about?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm telling you, sometimes it gets pretty strange 'cause sometime they come with--now, I don't know with babies, they come with great big kids.
Speaker 1: Tell me what happens.  I mean, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Somebody--
Speaker 1: What's the whole thing?
Speaker 2: --gets on this side of the grave and some--and they hand the child across the casket, across the grave.  And sometimes I have to kind of hold back on it because if the grave looks kind of precarious, I don't want somebody falling in the grave, and I'll ask them to wait until I get it covered up and then pass it across the grave.
Speaker 1: That's so that that spirit of the person who died would not haunt the person?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I--you know, it's a funny thing.  I just never really asked questions about these things.  It--I guess because it's so common, I just expect it.  But those other things I told you about with the chickens and the medicine, that's gone.  But that business with the children is very prevalent still now.

Speaker 1: I have watched the progression of funerals over the years.  When I--when I first came home and I--when I got started and Mason [Charles Mason] and Brown [Frederick Brown] were running the business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina], they taught me I think the same way that they learned, on-the-job training.  They didn't do a whole lot of talking but, you know, I learned to watch their eyes and they would communicate that way, let me know, you know, whether I'm right or wrong.  And in those days--in the early days, folks were still, you know, scrapping for money.  And I'll never forget, you know, a family would come in and they would let me go ahead and serve the family and take them to the showroom.  And I'd come back--in them days, if you had a thousand dollar funeral, you was raising sand.  And I'd come back out and, you know, I got a family and I said to Fred, Fred Brown, who actually--Fred came here with my father [Julius P.L. Fielding] right out of high school, and he lived here with us.  And I'd go to Fred, I said, "That family wants this thing and this funeral's almost $1000."  And he said, "What's the name?"  I said, "So and So."  He said, "Don't worry about it."  I said, "Huh?"  "They come from the country?"  I said, "Yeah."  "Them country people will pay you."  He said, "Now, if they come from the city, you better watch them (laughter)."
Speaker 2: All right.  Now, your brother [Bernard Fielding] goes to law school, is that right?
Speaker 1: Yes, he went in the--he finished Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  His godfather was a Hampton graduate, and he went in the [U.S.] Army, and he was in field artillery in the Army.  And then he came out and I took him myself to law school at Boston [Massachusetts].  He went to Boston University law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], and he finished Boston, he came back, and started practicing law.  In fact, his first client was the funeral home.  We put him on a retainer, representing the funeral home, and he's been the lawyer for the funeral home ever since (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  And he graduated, so I think it was in 1958, is that right?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: It was about 1958 that he graduated from law school?
Speaker 1: I don't remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: But I guess.  That, that sounds about right, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 485267
Speaker 1: So, now we're moving into the era of civil rights which you were very active in.  So, tell me, did the funeral home [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] in 1960--what was the story about you going to seek help from Johnson in Columbia [South Carolina], Johnson Funeral Home [Palmer Memorial Chapel] in Columbia?  Was that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Where did you find--
Speaker 1: Is this a story you want to tell us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--that was during the demonstrations, and we had a lot of kids in jail.  And the--one of the--the leader of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was I. DeQuincey Newman, and Newman was also in jail.  And Newman called me down to the jail--and not only Newman was in jail, but he had a young son who had to go to jail with him.  And we had run out of paper bonds.  Everybody had put up all their property, so it got to the point that we had to have cash bonds to get these kids out of jail.  And I. DeQuincey called me to the jail, and he told me--he wrote down this name, he says, "Mr. Willis Johnson."  I said, "I know Mr. Willis Johnson.  Mr. Willis Johnson and my daddy [Julius P.L. Fielding] started the funeral directors association."  He said, "Well, I want you to go to Columbia and you go to Mr. Johnson and tell him we have to have $100,000."  I said, "Okay," and he said, "We've already made arrangements.  They got a small private plane at the private airport, we'll take you to the downtown Columbia airport."  I got on the plane and went and had a little briefcase, and I went straight to Mr. Johnson and he was eating breakfast.  And I--he took me and sat me in the booth, and I told him what I wanted.  And Mr. Johnson picked up the--and this is in--really in hard times.  He picked up his telephone and he called a fellow, he says, now I got one--he's a soft-spoken guy.  He said, "Now I got one of my boys here from Charleston [South Carolina] and he needs some money.  Now, I'm gonna give him about $20,000, what can you do?"  And within a half an hour's time, it might've been even less than a half an hour's time, Mr. Johnson had $100,000 in cash money, and we put that $100,000 in that briefcase and I came back to Charleston, went, went straight to the courthouse.  And (laughter) they looked at me, where in the heck did this dude get $100,000?  And, it was just like that.  You know, and it was really encouraging that black folks, black businessmen could come up with that kind of money with no security whatsoever.  They didn't ask me to sign anything.  They'd just give me $100,000.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So, tell me, what were they protesting that they got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was--
Speaker 1: --arrested, yeah.
Speaker 2: That was in the sit-in period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They were sitting in here in Charleston?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, all over the place.
Story_ID: 485268
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the things that were going on during the Civil Rights Movement in Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: You know, the Civil Rights Movement in my estimation, as far as Charleston was concerned, was more than just breaking down segregation.  It was a time of tremendous social change in the black community because Charleston had been known for years just like New Orleans [Louisiana] with this strong caste system and class system, and that if that demonstration on the Civil Rights Movement did one thing, it broke down that separation in the black community as it was bringing these young people out.  It not only brought the young people out, it brought out a whole lot of old folks, and I think that was--that's one of the greatest periods in our history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about some of the things that your organization did to get people to register to vote.  You said that that was one of the main goal of your organization--
Speaker 2: See--
Speaker 1: --was to get people to vote.
Speaker 2: That brings me right back to why I say you need--you really need to somehow do an interview on Esau Jenkins.  Esau came from way down on Johns Island [South Carolina], had a very limited education, but he was a real, dedicated, conscientious person.  He started the Citizens Committee [Citizens Committee of Charleston County].  He started the Progressive Club on Johns Island, and I went with him several times.  We went to the Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina] and we got the idea from the Penn Center to come up with the credit union.  We started the CO Federal Credit Union [Charleston, South Carolina] here.  And I understand right now that his family is in the process of restoring the Progressive Club on Johns Island.  And Esau used to run a bus.  He would bring the people from the islands into the city to work and to jobs.  And in those days in South Carolina, you had to read and interpret a section of the [U.S.] Constitution in order to get registered.  And these are people now who were basically illiterate.  But, Esau found out, as we all did, persons who are illiterate had a heck of a good memory.  And Esau would teach them sections of the Constitution, bringing them into town on the bus, and when they'd go down to the registration board, they'd rattle that off and, and get registered.  And we were getting money from a VIP out of Atlanta, Georgia.  We got a dollar for every person that we got registered and that kept the program going.  And out of that program came the Citizens Committee, and out of the Citizens Committee came the Political Action Committee [Political Action Committee of Charleston County], and all of it, you know, tied together.
Speaker 1: People who joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] sometimes did not get contracts or jobs or lost their jobs because they joined the NAACP.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know--can you tell me anything about that?
Speaker 2: The greatest one was Miss Septima Clark [Septima Poinsette Clark].  She is very famous because of that.  She was a long time school teacher from, from the olden days and she taught school on the islands, and she taught school in the city, and then she became a member of the NAACP during the time I told you when Arthur Clement [Arthur J. Clement, Jr.] was president.  We had over three thousand members, and they started clamping down and making these teachers deny their membership with NAACP.  Miss Clark refused.  She wouldn't let them deny her--I mean, she would not deny her mem- so they fired her.  And that's when she tied in with Martin Luther [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Esau at the center in Tennessee [Highlander Folk School; Highlander Research and Education Center, New Market, Tennessee]--I forgot--I'll think of it.
Story_ID: 485269
Speaker 1: That's when I first met Martin Luther [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] myself 'cause Esau [Esau Jenkins] had a little Volkswagen bus, and we used to drive from here to Monteagle, Tennessee.  And Martin Luther would come there I think from Atlanta [Georgia], and we used to have little conferences and all up there in Tennessee.  And Miss Clark [Septima Poinsette Clark] joined that group and she started teaching, and then she formed the educational schools.  In fact, there's one on Johns Island [South Carolina] named after her right now.  But all, all of that came out of Monteagle, Tennessee, with Martin Luther King and Myles, Myles Horton.  Myles Horton was the name of the fellow that ran the camp in Tennessee [Highlander Folk School; Highlander Research and Education Center, New Market, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Do you remember any conversations you had with Martin Luther King?
Speaker 1: Yeah, at that time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, I had a lot of conversations with Martin Luther at Myles Standish, and then Esau and I got tied in with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and at that time, it was a rivalry between the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and SCLC.  And we stuck--Esau and I stuck mostly with SCLC, and we'd go on conferences all over--mostly all over the South with Martin Luther.  I remember one time we were in a conference with Martin Luther at, I think it was Memphis [Tennessee].  I think it was Memphis, Tennessee, and Martin Luther was up on the stage and speaking, and this white guy--Esau and I were sitting on the front seat in this big auditorium, and this white guy was sitting right next to me, and all of the sudden, he jumped up and ran up the steps and got up on the--and had on brass knuckles, and started beating on Martin Luther, and boy, Martin Luther had guards all the time, and those guards grabbed him and they were fitting to tear him up.  And, and Martin Luther himself came.  They--he wouldn't let them.  He took the darn brass knuckles off the guy.  I think that was in Memphis.
Speaker 2: That's something.  Were you a part of the March on Washington?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Tell me about that day.
Speaker 1: I woke up--I don't know how in the devil I did it, but I was tired.  We had gone on a train.  They, they started a train way down in Florida and it stopped on the way and we picked up the train here, went straight on up and went into Grand Central Station [sic. Union Station, Washington, D.C.].  And--I think it's Grand Central Station.
Speaker 2: In D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: In D.C.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I don't know the name of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The big station.
Speaker 2: --train station.
Speaker 1: And, and I think we walked from that station to the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] and there was a bunch of us here from Charleston [South Carolina], and I got lost from my crowd.  And I was tired and I laid down on the grass and put my coat under my head and went to sleep (laughter).  And I--when I woke up, Martin Luther started speaking.  When--that's what woke me up and I'll never forget that as long as I live.
Speaker 2: There were so many people.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was just like that.  It was jam-packed.
Speaker 2: But how were the people treating one another?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was--it was like a love feast, you know, everybody.  And it didn't matter who you were or what color you were or anything.
Story_ID: 485270
Speaker 1: The '60s [1960s] was a time of a lot of assassinations also, starting with Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and Malcolm X.  Tell me, what were your thoughts about the assassinations that were going on?
Speaker 2: I guess that that all started, I was working here in the business [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] and at the time, we had claims for families, they had to go to the social security office in order to file a claim for their death benefit, and I had taken a family to the social security office around on George Street and all of a sudden, some of the clerks in the social security office started crying and screaming and going on.  That's when President Kennedy got shot.  And then it was just one thing after that.  And the night that Martin--the night that Martin Luther got killed, I was running for the house, and I had a meeting, a committee meeting at Brooks Restaurant [Brooks Motel and Restaurant, Charleston, South Carolina] on Morris Street.  And J. Arthur Brown and I were in the meeting and, and the word came that Martin Luther got shot.  And boy, all hell broke loose.  And they, they took J. Arthur and me and several other fellows and we had to ride all night long to keep the kids from setting fires and messing up, and I mean, all night.  We rode until day break the next day, putting out--breaking up little gangs.  And, fortunately, we didn't have any real, you know, any serious stuff, but it could've easily been.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, let me--
Speaker 2: That was the most tense time in the whole history of this thing.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you, since you are in the, the funeral business, have you ever buried anyone who was lynched?
Speaker 2: Was what?
Speaker 1: Lynched.  Or even your father [Julius P.L. Fielding], do you know about?
Speaker 2: I know--I remember when we--I was little and we were here and daddy was still--daddy used to--they used to hang the fellows in the jail right around the corner, and I remember daddy burying one or two of those fellows that got hanged, but that wasn't lynching, that was legal hanging.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Did you ever know about any cross burnings or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Not real- not really first hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew--heard about them.  But Charleston [South Carolina] was a more moderate city and Charleston, if you go way back in history, you know, I'm hearing what all the old folks say, Charleston was pretty much integrated.  The majority of the police in the early days in Charleston were black.  The firemen were black.  And the city was pretty much mixed.  It just started segregating in later years as we came along.
Speaker 1: And what do you think the cause of that is?
Speaker 2: I don't--I think it probably is a part of that--an offshoot of that plantation mentality, you know.  The black folks were not considered equal, but they were considered a part, like family in a kind of a subordinate kind of way, but it got along.  And it really didn't get, you know, the strong racial tensions until later years, when other parts of South Carolina were just the opposite.
Story_ID: 485271
Speaker 1: So, what year is it that you decide to run for the house [South Carolina House of Representatives]?  You start gearing up around '68 [1968], is that right?
Speaker 2: I ran in '68 [1968] and, frankly, it was pretty well designed at that time that I was supposed to get elected because we had built PAC, the Political Action Committee [Political Action Committee of Charleston County], to a real strong position and I was the chairman.  I was the founder and the chairman of PAC, and it was just understood that I was gonna get elected to the house in 1968, but one of my good friends threw a monkey wrench in the works and decided to come--he was a young lawyer.
Speaker 1: Who was this?
Speaker 2: George Payton [George A. Payton, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's dead now.  George decided to come out and run against Mendel Rivers [L. Mendel Rivers].  And we all said to George, Mendel Rivers is the chairman of the armed services committee [U.S. House Committee on Armed Services] in the house [U.S. House of Representatives], and is just pumping millions and millions of dollars into the Charleston Navy yard [Charleston Naval Shipyard, North Charleston, South Carolina], the Charleston Air Force Base [North Charleston, South Carolina], and everything.  In fact, they were saying at the time, "If Mendel puts anything else in Charleston [South Carolina], the whole thing's gonna sink."  And all we said to George, you can't beat Mendel 'cause you ain't running--you're not really running against Mendel, you're running against all that money that's coming into Charleston, but he insisted on running against Mendel.  And his running against Mendel, that just pulled all the rednecks out, and it sunk my election.  I came pretty close, though.  But that really set me up to get elected two years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were elected to the house in 1971.
Speaker 2: No, I was elected to the house in 1970.
Speaker 1: In 1970.
Speaker 2: We started serving in January of '71 [1971].  We were elected in November of '70 [1970], me, Jim Felder [James L. Felder], and I.S. Leevy Johnson.  And we were the first three since the Reconstruction period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were some of the things on your agenda when you went to the house?
Speaker 2: Well, I was sent there, and it was understood that the main thing that I was sent to the house for is to break down the at-large system, and the first bill that I introduced when I walked in that house in January 1971 said 124 single-member districts, no more full slate, and no more poll tax.  The bill never passed, but fortunately, Armand Derfner, who's a very prominent lawyer here now, was working with the Americans For Civil Liberties [sic. American Civil Liberties Union] or something in Washington, D.C., and Armand Derfner started drawing plans for single-member districts in South Carolina, and he would send the plans to Matthew Perry [Matthew J. Perry] who's now or used to be my lawyer, and is now a federal--he's the senior federal judge in the state.  And then Matthew Perry would bring the plans to me in the house.  We didn't--in those days, we didn't have the house office building.  Your office was your desk on the floor.  And you had a little space between the two.  I was in the left seat, and Joe Riley [Joseph P. Riley, Jr.], who's our mayor now was in the right seat.  And I had all of that space between my seat and, and Joe Riley's seat jammed full of maps for--to set up the single-member districts.  Of course, I could never get it passed, but it started the ball rolling and finally, the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] came down and said the single member districts coupled with at-large voting and the poll tax was unconstitutional, and they forced the house to go to single member districts in nineteen--(pause) 1974.  In '74 [1974], seven more guys came in.  See, in '72 [1972] when I ran for reelection, I got elected, but Jim and I.S. didn't get elected.
Story_ID: 485272
Speaker 1: --You were talking about your reelection, that you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --reelected and those were not--
Speaker 2: In 1974--no, in 1972, I ran for reelection and I got reelected, but Jim [James L. Felder] and I.S. [I.S. Leevy Johnson] lost the primary, but then Ernest Finney [Ernest A. Finney, Jr.], who became chief justice of the supreme court [South Carolina Supreme Court] and Bob Woods [Robert R. Woods], who was a Presbyterian minister from Charleston [South Carolina], and B.J. Gordon [Benjamin James Gordon, Jr.] from Williamsburg [Williamsburg County, South Carolina].  B.J. Gordon was I. DeQuincey Newman's nephew.  The three of them came on, so in the beginning of our--my second term, there was four of us in the house [South Carolina House of Representatives].  I was the only carryover, but Ernest and Bob and B.J. brought a lot to the table.  And we were fighting then for the single-member districts.  And that was one night when I filibustered all night long for single-member districts.  And the old man Sol Blatt [Solomon Blatt, Sr.], who had been speaker of the house longer than anybody in the world, Sol Blatt was sitting in the last seat in the middle aisle in the house, and he came walking right--about three o'clock in the morning, came walking up the aisle, and evidently he was angry.  And, I was filibustering on his own rule because prior to that, he had ruled himself--see, when you filibuster it has to be germane to the main subject.  Sol had ruled earlier, and I found out that the Bible is germane to anything.  So I just got up there and started reading from the Bible and he couldn't say it wasn't germane 'cause he himself ruled that it was.  And evidently that must've made him mad and he came walking up and he pointed his hand in my face, I was behind the podium, and he called me a boy and said, "Who in the hell told you you could come here to represent my people from Barnwell," he came from Barnwell County [South Carolina].  And, boy, I got mad and I guess I turned red white and blue, and I came out from behind that podium and I was fixing to knock the heck out of that old man.  And Ernest Finney who's on--became chief justice, Ernest came up to me and put his arms--he said, "Boy, you can't hit that old man," (laughter) and I, I backed off.  But I finished filibustering the rest of the night.  In fact, I filibustered until about seven o'clock the next morning.  And then Arnie--Arnie Goodstein [Arnold S. Goodstein] who was from Charleston and a friend of mine, Arnie picked up and he filibustered the rest of the day.  So between Arnie and I, we filibustered two days.  It--but I--that really set me off with Sol.  Of course, I had never gotten along with Sol the whole time I was in the house because he was like a little dictator.  He--in those days, we didn't have single member districts.  We were at-large.  And what they had created was rural and urban legislators.  And the rural legislators outnumbered us from the urban areas.  And Sol had put together a strong coalition with those urban--I mean with the rural legislators, and he could do whatever he wanted to do.  And on a roll-call vote, you got three minutes and Sol would bring up a roll-call vote, and he'd wait about a minute and then he'd flip his switch, and when he'd flip his switch yes and it lit up on the board yes, the--you see all of those rural guys chiming in.  But the rules said he was supposed to make--wait three minutes before he--and everybody else votes before he votes.  And every time he did, I'd challenge him and he'd get mad as the devil.  He'd look down and, "What you want now, Mr. Fielding [HistoryMaker Herbert U. Fielding]?" (laughter).

Speaker 1: So what happens between 1974 until 1983 when you go back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's when--
Speaker 1: --return to the house?
Speaker 2: --I got in--that's when I got into trouble with Sol [Solomon Blatt, Sr.].  The first--the first thing that really took me off with Sol was when I filibustered--no, before that, his son came up for--was nominated for a federal judgeship in the United States justice department [U.S. Department of Justice].  That was a long time before that because there was just three of us in the house at the time.  I.S. [I.S. Leevy Johnson] and Jim Felder [James L. Felder] who were both lawyers, and when Sol Blatt's son was nominated for federal judge, they automatically signed off on it with the United States justice department.  And I said, "I ain't gonna do that."  They said, "What do you mean?"  I said, "If he's anything like his daddy, I'm not gonna sign it unless I get an okay," and I told him I want an okay from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and B'nai B'rith.  And I couldn't get it.  I couldn't get it from either one of them I guess, so I wouldn't sign off on him, and Sol held that against me.  And that's the year that they charged me with failure to file an income tax return.  And Matthew Perry [Matthew J. Perry] was my lawyer and we went to court.  And Matthew said, "You know, it's just a slip."  And in fact, I had paid all the taxes anyhow because the taxes were withheld and it wasn't a matter of evading taxes because the taxes were already paid, the only thing, I just didn't file a return.  They took me into federal court.  And Matthew said, "We ain't got nothing to worry about.  Ain't nobody ever been thrown in jail for failure to file," and they did check the record and honestly, nobody had ever been in jail for failure to file an income tax return.  I'll be darned if they didn't sentence me to one year in jail, and I didn't find out until years later that they had a meeting at Sol Blatt's house the day before we went to court, and Sol told that they had to give me some time even though it was a misdemeanor.  And that's what--I didn't have to come out of the house, but I am--I felt embarrassed and, and I resigned.  And then I went back to the house later on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you do during those years?  Because we have like nine years here.
Speaker 2: Same thing I'd been doing all along, working with Citizens Committee [Citizens Committee of Charleston County] and PAC [Political Action Committee of Charleston County] and doing political campaigns, pushing everybody else to the house.
Speaker 1: Did you work with the Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina] at all?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Did you work with the Penn Center?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  Esau [Esau Jenkins] and I used to go to the Penn Center regularly, um-hm.
Story_ID: 485274
Speaker 1: So in 1983, you returned to the house [South Carolina House of Representatives], is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '82 [1982], '82 [1982], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, '82 [1982] you're elected, okay.  And you stayed there until '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.  And that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then '85 [1985]--
Speaker 2: And that's--
Speaker 1: --went back.
Speaker 2: That's when I made another real--I instigated and got the single-member districts in the senate [South Carolina Senate], and my partner, John Matthews [John W. Matthews, Jr.], and I, it was me, John, Theo [Theo Mitchell], and somebody else.  There was four of us that transferred from the house over to the senate, but see, I. DeQuincey [I. DeQuincey Newman] was already there because one of the senators had died, and I. DeQuincey had gone in on a special election the year before, so when we transferred over to the senate, I.D. [I. Dequincey Newman] was already there.  But then at that time, it was five of us in the senate.  Now, shoot, it must be about ten in the senate now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, nineteen--this is 1985 that you're elected to the senate and you stayed there until--
Speaker 2: Ninety--
Speaker 1: --nineteen ninety-two [1992]?
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were some of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that--
Speaker 1: --the things that--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: --happened while you were there?
Speaker 2: That's another one, one of the big mistakes I made in life.  I drew the plan for the first black congressional district and it was sort of understood that I was supposed to be the congressman.  But then my good friend who had really helped me draw the plan for the first congressional district decided to run, and he won.
Speaker 1: And who was this?
Speaker 2: Jim Clyburn [HistoryMaker James Clyburn].
Speaker 1: Oh, Jim Clyburn, okay.  All right.  So tell me--but you were in the senate from '85 [1985] to '92 [1992], what were some of the things that you--that you did while there?  What came out of your stay in the senate during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, even back in the house--when we first went to the house way back in the early '70s [1970s] when there was just three of us, we were concentrating on getting blacks on commissions and organize--statewide organizations across the state.  Most of them were gubernatorial appointments or elections from the house and the senate.  And we got the state board of barbering [South Carolina Board of Barber Examiners] integrated.  I led the fight to get the state board of funeral service [South Carolina State Board of Funeral Service] integrated.  At that time, they had, I think it was six members, and all of them were white, and all of them were nominated by the white association.  And Governor Riley [Richard Riley] helped me--not Governor Riley, Governor West [John C. West] helped me, and we kicked up the number from six to nine and had three recommended from the black association and the six coming from the white association, so--and now, it's--I think it's just about even now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we did that with the funeral service board, with the medical board, the pharmaceutical board, the barber board, the beauticians, all of those statewide boards, we got them all integrated.  And then we started getting magistrates appointed across the state.  And when I got to the senate, I got to be chairman of the senate delegation and we really got some strong black magistrates appointed at that time.
Story_ID: 485275
Speaker 1: You succeeded who as chairman?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Okay, who did you succeed?  You leave the senate [South Carolina Senate] and you were a chairman in the black caucus [South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was chairman of the legislative black caucus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was in '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then Joe Brown [Joe Ellis Brown] came behind you?
Speaker 2: Joe Brown?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Wasn't he the chairman or was he the chairman after you?
Speaker 2: No, Joe Brown came a long time behind me.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you leave the senate in '92 [1992], and what are some of the other things, what happens next?  What are some of the other things you're working on?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came out of the senate, that was--the mistake I made, I could've run for the congressional seat and maintained my senate seat, but I decided not to do that and I gave up my senate seat, and when I lost congressional seat, then I just didn't have anything, so I came back and started working in the organizations.  And also at that time, I did some lobbying for a while, and I did that for a while, but it--that really wasn't my cup of tea, so I didn't--I just backed off.
Story_ID: 485276
Speaker 1: So now, do you have more than one funeral home?
Speaker 2: Yes, we have--well, see this is the original downtown [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina], and then we built Charleston Heights funeral home in North Charleston [South Carolina] in our fiftieth anniversary, and then we built the Yonges Island [South Carolina] funeral home down near Edisto [Edisto Island, South Carolina] at our seventieth anniversary, and we're now in our ninety-fifth year.  And we're looking seriously about moving out from here and building a modern funeral home, but we want to stay in the area downtown, and it's hard.  It's the devil to find as much property as we've got here.
Speaker 1: Well, who runs the business with you now?
Speaker 2: You saw Mark [Mark J. Fielding], my nephew, and my son, Frederick [Frederick A. Fielding], and then my middle son, he's not in the business but he's on the board.
Speaker 1: Well, tell--first, let's start by you telling me your son's name--your children.  Tell me all your children, tell me their names.
Speaker 2: Julius is the oldest, and he is--he's Julius P.L. Fielding III--no, no, he's Julius P.L. Fielding II.  My grandson is Julius P.L. Fielding III.  See, Julius is named after my father [Julius P.L. Fielding], but he couldn't be a junior so he's--that makes him the second.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Herbert [Herbert S. Fielding] is the middle boy and he's not a junior either.  He's Herbert Stent instead of Herbert Ulysses.  And then Frederick, the one you met, is the youngest one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Frederick is a--his son is named Palmer Augustus Douglas Fielding, and that's a marriage of two funeral homes because Palmer's grandfather on his mother's [Lorin Peri Palmer] side and I were classmates in college and embalming school [Renouard Training School for Embalmers, New York, New York], and when I was in the senate [South Carolina Senate], Frederick was working with me as a--no, he wasn't working with me, he was working in the lieutenant governor's office, but in the state house and he met Bobby Palmer's [Robert John Palmer] daughter, and they got married, so Palmer, my grandson has a funeral home here and a funeral home in Sumter [Palmer Memorial Chapel, Sumter, South Carolina] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they say that usually funeral businesses are run by families.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is it true that it's very hard for someone who is not part of a funeral home family to break into the business?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is--it isn't too easy.  Course we've gotten two or three new funeral homes coming in right now and fortunately or unfortunately in a way, that's one of the things that I'm very much involved in right now, changing or strengthening the state laws governing the funeral practices because, unfortunately, a lot of the young fellows coming into the business do not adhere to the real high ethical standards, and they have a tendency to bring their profession down.  And they're on the borderline of, you know, violating ethical laws.  We're fighting hard to change that right now.
Speaker 1: Well speaking about that, you remember the case with Ray Brent Marsh, I think is his name, the guy that had the crematory [Tri-State Crematory, Noble, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--
Speaker 1: --remember that case?
Speaker 2: That put--oh, yeah, that put a black mark on all of us.  In fact, we still get--you get dust blown in your face because of that because it broke down the trust of the people.  And that's just what I'm telling you I'm fighting against right now.  We're trying to maintain those high standards that came in the early days--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when my father and that crowd came along.
Story_ID: 485277
Speaker 1: Tell me about any social organizations that you belong to.
Speaker 2: Not very social to a great extent.  The biggest I guess you call a social organization I belong to is my fraternity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and I--fortunately, I just came from our conclave in Little Rock, Arkansas, and, and I received my sixty-year pin.  I think it was about five or six of us that got a sixty-year pin.  One fellow there I think got his seventy-year pin, but when you start getting up in that category, they're thinning out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  We didn't talk about you pledging in college.  So you pledged while you were in college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --West Virginia [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, I stayed in the pledge club I think longer than anybody else because I pledged before I went in the [U.S.] Army and they pulled me out and I go to the Army and spend three years in the Army, all that time I'm still in the pledge club.  But then I went in the fraternity right after I came back out of the Army.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: No, I think I'm just proudest of the time that I spent in the house [South Carolina House of Representatives] and in the senate [South Carolina Senate] because I was able--was able to accomplish a heck of a lot.  And when we first went in the house back in 1971, it was really building from the ground up and, fortunately, we were not rejected when we went in there.  In fact, there were--the vast majority of the white fellows in the house accepted us and helped us to accomplish things.  And that kept building as we kept building more and more blacks in the caucus [South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus].  And then when we went over to the senate, we gath- we had enough clout to get things done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that's even growing right now.
Story_ID: 485278
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you, and we didn't talk about your wife at all.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about your wife at all.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, my wife is--when we got married, she was a secretary and she was secretary all of her life except for a good while, she ran the project--the federal project--what do you call it--OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] projects, and she retired from that.  She's been retired.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Thelma.
Speaker 1: Thelma.
Speaker 2: Thelma Stent Fielding.  And she's at home now and basically, she's got heart problems, as we all do when we get (laughter)--
Speaker 1: What year did you get married?  How long have you been married?
Speaker 2: We got married in '46 [1946], the year we came out of the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, Christmas Eve of 1946, and my youngest son, Frederick [Frederick A. Fielding], was born on Christmas Eve on our tenth anniversary (laughter).
Story_ID: 485279
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, would there be anything that you would change if you had to do it over again?
Speaker 2: If I could, I would certainly change some of the early segregated days, but I know I can't, so--
Speaker 1: No, I mean things that you have done.  Do you have any regrets of anything that you have done?
Speaker 2: No, I think the main thing that I regret was getting into that trouble with the Internal Revenue department [Internal Revenue Service] that caused a real break in my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, that was really kind of unavoidable type of thing, but--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: No, I just--
Speaker 2: I look back on that and really if that hadn't happened--and I don't blame anybody for it.  That was my own fault.  I didn't file the doggone returns, so there was no way to deny it.  But if I hadn't run into that situation, I probably would've advanced to a very high position in the house [South Carolina House of Representatives].
Story_ID: 485280
Speaker 1: Because your story is so beneficial to the future generations and they will be able to access this information, what message would you send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: I guess, persistence.  I'm sure that it may be different now than when I came along, but there are just as many stumbling blocks out there in the street as there was when I was coming on.  They're probably of a different nature, but they're there, and the only thing you can do is just persist and keep fighting and maintain high, very high ethical standards and compassion.  I see so much envy and rivalry now, especially among young people.  That won't get it.  We got to keep fighting, and we got to fight for the good of the whole, not just for yourself, not just to be able to drive a BMW and high class Cadillacs and that kind of stuff.  I see too much materialism now among a lot of these young folks.  Everybody wants to outshine the other guy.  I learned, you know, you gain by what you give.  These young folks out here now, they could care less about what you got or anybody.  All they want is, you know, dollar, dollar, dollar, and outshine everybody else.  My car is more expensive and better looking than yours.  I can care less what the heck my car looks like.  If it gets me from the office to the house when I need to go, that's all the heck I need.  That's the kind of thing that concerns me now.
Story_ID: 485281
Speaker 1: What would you tell someone who is ready to look into going into politics, into the legislature, maybe run for the house or for the senate?  What one good piece of advice would you give that person?
Speaker 2: Start on the bottom.  You got so many of these young fellows jumping out here now, and the first thing he wants to do, he wants to run for the governor.  And I say, what kind of--what you got to say you can be the governor?  You ain't never done a dad-blame thing in the community.  You ain't never been involved in nothing.  You got to earn a place in politics and anything else.  You don't wanna just jump in there 'cause, you know, I got a Ph.D. from University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina], I'm smart as hell so I could be the governor.  I say, (makes sound) (laughter).  You got about, about, about as much chance of getting to be the governor as a snowball got to last ten hours in hell (laughter).  My own son, Herbert, several years ago, he came out, he wanted to run for the house.  I said, "Herbert [Herbert S. Fielding], you ain't ready."  "I, you know, I can do this now."  He got out there and he ran.  He did pretty good but he didn't win.  And I told him, you start--in politics, you start in the precinct and you work your way up from the precinct step by step by step.  You earn what you get in politics.  You don't just walk in there and grab it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything else that you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I want to thank you for taking your time, your precious time to do this interview.  It has been inspiring and we just want to say thank you for allowing us this opportunity.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm just happy.  I hope it'll benefit somebody down the line.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 485282
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead and tell us about it now.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my father, Julius P.L. Fielding, right after he returned from Renouard embalming school [Renouard Training School for Embalmers] in New York [New York] in the year 1912.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Okay, sir, I'm ready.  Tell me about this one.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me on the left, and next to me is the current senator, Robert Ford, who is in the same senate seat that I was in while I was in the senate [South Carolina Senate], and the other gentleman on the other side of the flag is Tommy Moore.  He's a senator and at the time this picture was taken, he was running for governor of the state, and of course, the other gentleman on the right side is now Commissioner McKinley Washington [McKinley Washington, Jr.] who also served with us in the senate.  He is now the chairman of the South Carolina Industrial Commission.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me and several other funeral directors from across the country, and we were on the legislative committee lobbying the gentleman in the middle with the red tie who was the congressman from the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina.  We were lobbying for upgrading of the funeral service laws just last year.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, I'm ready.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me when I was in the house [South Carolina House of Representatives] along with several other house members and some senate members.  We were sent to Washington [D.C.] to meet with Senator Strom Thurmond on the reapportionment matters back in the 1970s.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Okay, I'm ready sir.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me and now congressman, Jim Clyburn [HistoryMaker James Clyburn].  That was made in a restaurant in Columbia, South Carolina, shortly after Jim got elected to the United States Congress in 1992, I believe.
Speaker 1: That's a picture during my second term in the South Carolina Senate.  The lieutenant governor, the man in the middle, was Nick Theodore, and several of those gentlemen are now dead.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Sir, I'm recording, if you could tell me about this photo, please.
Speaker 1: That's a 1930 picture of my father and my mother [Sadie Gaillard Fielding] along with the young child in the front, which is my younger brother, Timothy [Timothy Fielding], who is now dead, and the child way over on the left on the bicycle was my older brother, Julius Fielding [Julius R. Fielding], and he drowned when he was thirteen years old.  But that's the way the funeral home [Fielding Home for Funeral Services, Charleston, South Carolina] looked in 1930.  Of course, we have changed the exterior quite a bit since then.
Speaker 2: --embalming school in this country.  They came from France, from Paris, France.  The old man, Auguste Renouard, started the school, his son [Charles Renouard] was there when my father went there and when I went there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, tell us about this one.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my father in the top left corner as he was in Renouard embalming school in the year 1912.  I went to the same school in 1947, and Dr. Renouard, the gentleman in the middle, recognized me when I walked in the door.  And, in fact, he called me by my father's name.
Speaker 1: You say this was the first embalming school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
