Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story behind the spelling of Gene?
Speaker 2: There--
Speaker 1: People always ask.
Speaker 2: There is a, a story behind the spelling of Gene, probably not a pretty exciting one.  But my father [William Thomas, Sr.] worked for some individuals, an individual, and she spelled her name G-E-N-E, and he, he--they named me for her.  I like the spelling of my name because nobody ever forgets it.
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true.  And now is--what is your date of birth and place of birth?

Story_ID: 634638
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a, a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I do have a favorite food, and that is ice cream (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I have a favorite color, and that is blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I love the summer; that's my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination is anywhere in the Caribbean islands, and I've been all over them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I do have a favorite phrase, and that is: it is what it is.
Story_ID: 634639
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's [William Thomas, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'm a- gonna ask about them separately, so we don't get them mixed up, and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's name is Thelma, T-H-E-L-M-A, Janice, J-A-N-I-C-E, Hunt, H-U-N-T, that's her maiden name, Thomas, T-H-O-M-A-S [Thelma Hunt Thomas].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Mom's date of birth is July 31st, 1926, and she was born in Mount Sterling, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: All right, now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing in Mount Sterling, or are they from some other place originally?
Speaker 2: I think my grandfather--we, we think--my grandfather's name was William Sherman Hunt [William Hunt].  And we think he may have originally been, and I've been looking, from Virginia, and then the family relocated to Kentucky.  And he mainly worked as a laborer, worked as a chauffeur, probably did a little bit of, of agriculture but really, pretty much a, a day laborer, working for a lot of white people in, in Mount Sterling as a chauffeur, as a gardener, any of those things that didn't really require a high level of skill.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Florine, Florine White Hunt.  And the reason I was hesitating a little bit is I believe that her mother's maiden name was Pearsall, P-E-A-R-S-A-L-L.  So I always heard her talk about the Pearsalls.  And I think that was my grandmother's mother's maiden name, so that would have been my great-grandmother's maiden name.  And she was from the Mount Sterling, Kentucky area also.  And, and let me really correct that.  I, I really believe it was my grandmother who had, may have had some roots in Virginia, not my grandfather.  I think my grandfather's original roots, William Sherman Hunt's original roots were Mount Sterling, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any stories about slavery or the, or Reconstruction, emancipation, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Not about the emancipation, but always about where their, where they were, their, kind of their--what do I want to say--economic strata in, in Mount Sterling.  They were, they--because the, they didn't have a lot of education and weren't afforded a lot of education, they spent a lot of time doing work for Caucasians in Kentucky.  My grandmother did a lot of day work, also known as, you know, just being a maid in someone's home.  And my grandfather did, as I said before, a lot of work around chauffeuring, gardening, those kinds of things, whatever he could pick up.
Story_ID: 634640
Speaker 1: They actually ended up coming to Ohio because conditions were so bad; living conditions were so bad.  He wanted, my [maternal] grandfather [William Hunt] wanted to get the family out of Kentucky.  There were five live births and one that, one child that did not--one of my mother's siblings that did not survive.  And so, actually a story that my mother [Thelma Hunt Thomas] has told me is that she, when she was in high school, was asked--my grandfather was looking at the want ads in Ohio, which--really wanted to move to Ohio and saw that there was an opening for a gardener and a babysitter for a family here in Bexley [Ohio], which is a suburb of, of Columbus [Ohio].  And my mother actually wrote the letter for my grandfather and s- and sent it.  And the gentleman that, or the family that my family ended up working for, the Luckys [ph.], Mr. and Mr. Lucky, Mr. Lucky actually drove to Kentucky to see what kind of, of person and family my grandfather had, because he had received this letter.  My mother, if you ever were to see my mother's penmanship is perfect.  And so he received this letter in this perfect penmanship, and he wanted to know who this family was.  So he drove to Kentucky actually to--I guess it would have been an interview.  And at, at one point they wanted my grandfather to come without his family.  And he said he would not come without the family, so he ended up moving the entire family to Columbus.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's quite a story.  That's, that's a drive from Columbus to Mount Sterling of--
Speaker 1: About three, three and a half hours.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he--'cause we do it pretty regularly for the family reunion.  But, but he drove there to see my grandfather and to find this man and who he was and who his family was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, about what time--do you think that's--is that around, say, the turn of the century or maybe 1915 or so.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Oh no.  I would say--well, yeah, it, it--my mother was born in '26 [1926].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She was about seventeen years old, so that would have been the '40s [1940s].  It was, it was the early '40s [1940s], about '43 [1943] or--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --something like that.
Story_ID: 634641
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Thelma Hunt Thomas] say about growing up?  She grew up I guess in Kentucky and, and in Columbus, Ohio?
Speaker 2: She grew up in very segregated Mount Sterling, Kentucky, and then come--came to very segregated at that time Columbus, Ohio.  And my mother is dark, and she's even darker than I am.  And one of the things that she remembers is being, it being talked about, about how dark she was and all that.  She was next to the youngest in the family.  My uncle was the, my uncle Kenneth [Kenneth Hunt] was the youngest.  And so, you know, that was not a very pleasant thing for her.  When she came to--she did not want to leave Kentucky and beg my grandfather [William Hunt] for her to be able to stay there.  And he said absolutely not; all my kids are going.  But she then came and had to finish her high school at East High School, which is located right here in Columbus at each--on East Broad Street.  Many people remember it as East High School where black kids went and just a, a wonderful school.  In the '40s [1940s], East was a predominantly white school.  My mother was one of only a handful of kids.  She, I think, either spent a year or just a semester there, so she didn't really have an opportunity to really get involved with, with a high school life there.  So, her early years in Columbus were not as much fun as today's seventeen year old high school student would have liked to have had.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And they were difficult.
Speaker 1: So what did she do after high school?
Speaker 2: So after high school, she--after high school, my mom went to--let me think a minute--Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] for a year.  My, my parents really--my grandparents [Florine White Hunt and William Hunt] really wanted her to go, go to college.  My grandparents did not finish high school, and they wanted all of their kids to finish high school.  And they saw an opportunity for my mother to go to college.  And I think the separation between her and my grandparents was so much she, she came home after a year.  And then my mom went to work for, as a secretary in various black owned companies.  She worked for the Monmouth--it's not in existence anymore--Insurance Company [Monmouth Insurance Company (ph.)].  And I think it was spelled M-O-N-M-O-U-T-H.  It was a black owned insurance company that really built their business on what was called small industrial insurance policies, or life insurance policies, where people would pay a dollar down and a dollar a week and you know, where you'd have the insurance man actually come to your house and collect on those little policies.  So my mother worked for that company.  And then she, she spent most of her years really help put me through college working at the Supreme Life Insurance Company [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America] that was owned [sic.] by John Johnson, John E. Johnson [sic. HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], I think.  And, and I think she was really very proud of that.  She worked for this black-owned company where this man who had this insurance organization.  It was based--I believe their home office was Chicago [Illinois].  And I think he was the same man who owned--I may not be right about this--but Jet magazine and some other organizations.  But John E. Johnson was his name, the Johnson family.  I don't know if that's the same people that owned Ebony and Jet and, and all of those.  But, but she worked for Supreme Life until she retired, which was just about twenty years ago, when she was sixty-five I think.
Story_ID: 634642
Speaker 1: Now let me ask about your father.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give me your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  His name is William Thomas, no middle name, Sr. [William Thomas, Sr.]
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July 7th, 1929.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Gainesville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now, okay, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Ines Hadaway, H-A-D-A-W-A-Y, Thomas [Ines Hadaway Thomas].  And my grandfather's name was Jeff Thomas.  I, I--we can't--I've even tried to find--I can't find much out about Jeff Thomas.  Actually, my father and his two brothers and my grandmother came to Columbus [Ohio] when he was about nine years old.  He was really little.  And they came to work for the Sims family [ph.], the same family for which I'm named for, the, the female.  It was Bill [Bill Sims (ph.)] and, and Gene Sims [ph.].  And he worked at a place called Sims Electric Company [Columbus, Ohio], which was an electric supply company.  And, and that was the only job that he ever had 'til he retired.  He started working there when he was nine or ten years old.  He worked there after school as an elementary school student and actually ended up dropping out of high school, worked their full time, and worked there until he retired, which was about twenty years ago when he was sixty-five years old.  And he went to elementary and junior high here in Columbus, went to Central High School, and dropped out of high school when he was in the tenth grade to--or at the end of the tenth grade I think it was, to help take care of the family.  My dad also was in the service.  He was in the [U.S.] Army and spent some time at Tuskegee in, in Alabama [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: So this is during World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Yes.  My dad--
Speaker 1: So, he was--was he--he was there at the same time as the Tuskegee--
Speaker 2: Airmen?  He absolutely was.
Speaker 1: Was he, was he a part of that at all?
Speaker 2: He, he wasn't--he, (laughter) my dad talks about--I don't think he was an official Tuskegee Airmen.  And I think one of the reason is because he didn't finish high school, and so he wasn't afforded the opportunity for that training.  But I do know that my dad, probably unbeknownst to a lot, flew planes when people (laughter) didn't know that he was actually flying planes out of that, that air base.  But he, he spent his entire time in the service at, at Tuskegee I believe.
Speaker 1: He was at the airfield in--I say right now, just for the benefit of somebody watching this, there's been debate among the Tuskegee Airmen as to who qualifies--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as a Tuskegee Airman.  And I think the ground crew has won out.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as the years have gone on, there are so few of them left.  Those who are around them, as a ground crew, and enlisted men now actually can claim--
Speaker 2: He sees himself as one of them.  And, and I think there--he won't talk about it much.  You know, sometimes you can get him to talk about it, but he won't talk about it much.  And I think it's because, you know, he believes that he should be feated and celebrated as, as the other members are.  I don't think he--there's--that in any way he believes that they should not be celebrated in the way they are, but I think he's saddened by the fact that, that he is not.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I know they struggled with that for years.  I think they're now accepting the fact that the enlisted guys (unclear)--or the crew were just as much a part of it.
Speaker 2: And I think the movie ['Red Tails'] tried to depict that a bit--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --also.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's something he can--so he spent his whole service at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He didn't go to Germany.  He didn't leave the states, but he spent his time there.
Speaker 1: Now did he have any stories about George Washington Carver or any of the figures at Tuskegee, P.H. Polk or any of those people?
Speaker 2: He, he really won't talk about it much.  He's just, he just won't talk about it that much.
Story_ID: 634643
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from your father's side about the end of slavery, emancipation, Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: None of that, but again, similar to my mother [Thelma Hunt Thomas], the, the hardship of life in '40s [1940s] and you know, and not being--and '30s [1930s] and, and really not being able to access education the way that, that you would like to.  And one of the things my dad [William Thomas, Sr.] told me one time is if he thought that if he had ever been able to learn to speak a foreign language, he could have done international business.  I mean, so he--that just is to say he had a vision that was much bigger than his access to education would allow him to actually realize.  And I think that's why both he and my mom were so insistent that my brother [William Thomas, Jr.], my sister [Janice Thomas Parks] and I got the, the best education that we could and as much.
Speaker 1: Now both your mother and your father have stories that are similar in a sense that--I take it from what you said about your father that, that the Sims [ph.]--he met the Sims in, in the South.
Speaker 2: I think he did.  I think my [paternal] grandmother [Ines Hadaway Thomas] knew the Sims in the South and then ended up coming north to, to, you know, find a better life and, and to work here.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's--it's funny that both sides of the family have a similar story where white people actually go down and recruit them all.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  I mean, I, I really think that my family, my--if, if you were ever to meet my parents, you would never know that they had so little education.  They are very well spoken, they write well, they speak well, they carry themselves very well.  I mean, it's not like, you know, either one of them write with broken English or can't spell or any of those things, because they can.  And I think that my grandparents, as a tribute to my grandparents and possibly their parents too, who raised them to even though they couldn't access high quality education, they exposed them to as much as they possibly can so that they could, within their means, you know, take care of themselves.  So, they're, they're really well spoken, well read individuals.  They, they, the--one of their routines right now, before they even get out of the bed, to this day, they'll have coffee, and they will read the paper from cover to cover.  There were always magazines and newspapers in my house when I was growing up.  You know, a staple in our house was Ebony magazine and Life and Look.  I remember those huge magazines on the, on the, the coffee table in the living room, because my parents were always reading, trying to be better, trying to do better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know what that had to do with anything, but for some reason I felt the need to say that.
Speaker 1: Well, that has a lot to do with this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause a lot of people didn't have that.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: It's true.
Speaker 1: --it (unclear), and it says a lot.
Story_ID: 634644
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's an interesting story and might be how my husband [Stanley Harris] and I ended up staying together so long.  But my parents are still living.  And they will celebrate their sixty-fifth wedding anniversary on May 10th, 2012.  And they actually lived next door to each other on a street that doesn't exist anymore because the freeway came through and, and, and eliminated it.  But they lived on Mound Street.  And my dad [William Thomas, Sr.] went to Central [Central High School, Columbus, Ohio].  My mother [Thelma Hunt Thomas] went to East [East High School, Columbus, Ohio].  And my grandmother had no interest in my mother (laughter) dating my father, and so that's exactly why she did, I'm sure.  And so, she was the girl next door, and they got married.
Speaker 1: Yeah, on Mound Street.
Speaker 2: On Mound Street right here in Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 634645
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have, and where do you rank in the--
Speaker 2: I, I'm the youngest of three.  My brother is William Thomas, Jr.  And in fact, he will--I'm proud of him.  He'll receive his Ph.D. from Claremont in California [Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California] on May the 15th of this year, 2012.  My sister--and so he, he's, he--we all grew up here in Columbus [Ohio].  And he lives in Los Angeles [California] now.  My sister, Janice [Janice Thomas Parks], passed away in 2012.  And she's about eighteen months younger than my brother, and then I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so, so your sister just passed away?
Speaker 2: About ten years ago.  I'm sorry, 2002.  I apologize (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --two thousand two [2002].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She passed away in, in March of 2002.
Story_ID: 634646
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and their mannerisms, their habits, their talents, their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, I think I'm a good blend of both of them.  But I think, as I get older, I'm looking more and more like my mom [Thelma Hunt Thomas].  And I think my temperament is exactly like my father's [William Thomas, Sr.].  I, I, I, (laughter) I suffer fools lightly.  And that would be (laughter) that would be my father.  It's just I just (laughter), I just, I just, I'm just don't want to put up with the nonsense.  My mother is a very genteel individual.  She sings.  She's very genteel, very loving.  Not to say my father's not loving, 'cause he really is very sensitive person.  But it's like he is very clear about what he thinks, how he thinks it ought to be, and how we ought to go forward.  I think I take that from him.  I used to think that I--my temperament was like my mothers, but ten years in the superintendency [of Columbus City Schools], I think it's exactly like my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 634647
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest memory.  Here--I have a few, but one I was talking to my mother [Thelma Hunt Thomas] about recently.  I, I grew up on the East Side of Columbus [Ohio], went to Garfield Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio], which was largely an all-black, African American school.  Went to Woodland Christian Church [Columbus, Ohio].  My church was African American.  My whole life was, was with African Americans.  One of the earliest memories I have is being on the bus with my mother.  I think I was five or six years old.  And I saw--I, I really don't think I had seen anyone from my father's [William Thomas, Sr.] office [at Sims Electric Company, Columbus, Ohio] prior to that, so I had no idea that the Sims [ph.] at that time were--that he worked for were white.  And I remember seeing a white woman on the bus and asking my mother about that because it was just--even though, you know, obviously I was watching television.  And I don't know why that memory sticks in my head, but it was so foreign to me.  It wasn't what I saw in the neighborhood.  It wasn't what I saw at church or even in the grocery store, you know, where we, where we went to the grocery store at that time.  So, that was an early memory.
Speaker 1: So just the presence of a white person in the neighborhood was something that made--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --remarkable--
Speaker 2: Yes, remarkable, very unusual, very, very unusual.  And I remember asking my mother if she was black, because I'd seen light skinned blacks.  And I don't know if I said black or Negro or colored or what I may have said.  And I was born in 1953, so that probably would have been the late '50s [1950s], you know, early '60s [1960s].  Or, if I--or you know, asking the question if she were a light skinned black, or was she white, or, or what was she.  You know, I just wanted to know what she was, so.
Story_ID: 634648
Speaker 1: You grew up on the East Side of Columbus [Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Did you all grow up in the same house the whole time or--
Speaker 2: We did.  We, we--my grandparents bought this house on Garfield, 344 North Garfield [Avenue].  And in our house lived my grandparents, my--my mother's, these were my mother's parents [Florine White Hunt and William Hunt]--my mom [Thelma Hunt Thomas] and dad [William Thomas, Sr.], my brother [William Thomas, Jr.] and sister [Janice Thomas Parks] and me, my Uncle Kenneth [Kenneth Hunt], my Aunt Bobbie [Bobbie Winton Hunt], and my Uncle Bill [William Hunt].  So we all lived in the house, and I thought it was wonderful.  When I was in the second grade [at Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio], my parents were able to afford to buy a house out on Brentnell [Avenue].  And this is another early childhood memory: I remember telling my mother that we didn't need to move.  Why are we moving?  We had a house.  And that I really didn't want to go to this new house because I had grown up around my grandparents, my uncle, my aunt, and everybody together.  And I thought that's what we were supposed to do.  But, so we lived in that house until my parents were able to buy the house on Brentnell.  Then we moved--we lived in that house.  My parents actually lived in that house through my brother, my sister, and I graduating from high school [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] and really through me graduating from college [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana].  They didn't move out of that house until the year before my husband [Stanley Harris] and I got married, which would have been 1976.  So they lived in that house basically from 1960, about 1960 'til about 1976.  So we grew up, we grew up then between my grandmother's house, my grandparents' house on Garfield and then our house on Brentnell.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, well, tell us, so you start out on, on Garfield.  What--is there a name for that community?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  It was near--Mount Vernon Avenue is the, is the, is the street that everyone will remember, because Mount Vernon Avenue was such a, a vibrant street.  But it, there wasn't a name for the community itself.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so Mount Vernon was the strip.  And this, this is the East Side of Columbus?  Would you say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the East Side of Columbus, yep.
Story_ID: 634649
Speaker 1: We were talking about Mount Vernon area [Columbus, Ohio].  And we always ask this question like this, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Wow, well, the, the--let me start with the sights.  As I was growing up on, at Mount Vernon Avenue, it was just a busy, busy place.  There were, there were black owned businesses, there were Jewish owned businesses.  There was a theater called the Cameo [Cameo Theatre, Columbus, Ohio] that--right on Mount Vernon that I used to go to on Sundays after church [Woodland Christian Church, Columbus, Ohio] with my brother [William Thomas, Jr.] and sister [Janice Thomas Parks], unfortunately had to drag me along after, after I got to a certain age; they didn't want to.  But that's where we could go to the show for little of no money, probably fifty cents or, or so.  There were, there were a, there was a, there was a place that my mother would never let me go in that had the best sweet potato pie.  Oh, we--I got to eat sweet potato pie out of there, but she never let us go in.  Oh, I'm trying to remember the name of it right now, 'cause the family lived right down the street from us on Garfield [Avenue].  Mm.  I'm gonna think of that place.  It is the--almost had it.  It was a great--it was--people went in there.  Today they would call it a greasy spoon, but it was full of soul food.  You could get greens and sweet potato pie and fried chicken and, and all of those things.  And I cannot think of the name of it.  Almost had it again.  It'll come to me.  The, the one thing that I remember of my neighborhood is even people who, or--I mean, there were bars up and down the street, but, but it was never really viewed as an unsafe place.  My parents [Thelma Hunt Thomas and William Thomas, Sr.] would let me go to Mount Vernon Avenue, go to the store, go to Doc's Pharmacy [ph.], which was right at Garfield and, and--no, it was at Monroe [Avenue] and Mount Vernon.  We'd have to walk past a bar or two to get to the Cameo.  But what I remember is, and I'm not glorifying bars or anything like that, but I remember the respect that people had for children, for families.  And even those who frequented the bars would not let anything happen to kids, so--and, and would tell us to get away from certain things.  So, I just remember a, a neighborhood where it seemed like everybody knew everybody.  I'm sure that's not the case, but they, they somehow knew who belonged and who didn't, and where kids were, were honored and were protected by everybody.  There was an open air market on Mount Vernon at one point when I was little called the Eastside--I think it was called the Eastside Market [Columbus, Ohio], the Eastside--'cause there was a North Side market [North Market, Columbus, Ohio].  There was, there were, were markets in different parts of the city that were open air where you could get fresh fruits and vegetables.  I can remember seeing people come by selling watermelons different times, the watermelon truck or other kinds of things that you might not have had immediately available to you.  And so, it was, it was a place where there seemed to be a lot of--I didn't think about it till an adult--individual entrepreneurs out there doing different things.  You would see--I remember somebody called the trash man, the man, and he was the guy who would come and pick up things like broken tables or anything that you might be throwing out.  Because what I didn't realize is he was either repairing them, or he was using them for parts, and that was helping him to actually make money.  So there was a lot of in- individual entrepreneurship going on.  You know, those, those were some of the things that, that, that I remember growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One other thing that I think is real important, and we're really trying to get back to that with the, the school district [Columbus City Schools], there were a lot of parades that happened up and down Mount Vernon Avenue.  Some of those parades were from East High School [Columbus, Ohio], the high school that served that area.  And when you heard the sound of the parade, you'd run down the street because you didn't want to miss the parade.  Others were parades like from the Masons and the Shriners, who would be having their annual meetings or whatever, and those parades would be going on.  Why is that important?  It was such a sense of community, that you would see adults and children and everybody together kind of coming together around a, a common cause.
Story_ID: 634650
Speaker 1: What about sounds?  What sounds do you remember?
Speaker 2: A lot of traffic going up and down Mount Vernon Avenue [Columbus, Ohio], buses, people moving around, hustling and bustling.  You know, as I said, the, the parades obviously were a big part of that.  We would see those, especially in the summer.  Also you'd see sometimes a lot of individual vendors out there.  You'd hear people, you know, calling out.  You'd hear the milkman.  We, we had a, a milkman who actually delivered milk and would knock on the door.  You'd hear him yell out, "Milkman!"  You'd hear the trash man talking about, "Trash man!" picking up your--so you hear people re- you kind of actually lived out loud other people's lives because you heard them--they actually were yelling out to you the different kinds of things that they were doing to keep their lives going.  You'd hear people--different parents called their children in different ways.  Some people came to the door.  You'd hear them call their name.  Other people would whistle for them.  You know, other people would make different sounds, whether it's with a, with a pot or something.  But you knew whatever it was, whate- whatever your parents--whatever way they had to communicate with you, you knew you'd better listen for it and get home.  So you, you actually heard people actively living, as opposed to how we live now, and that is everybody pulls into their--push the button, pull in your drive way, push the button.  Your garage goes up, you go in, garage door goes down, and you just kind of quietly live in your house.  This was kids outside playing, parents sitting on front porches, grandparents talking to each other across the porch about different things, people who were, again, making a living in different ways, calling out saying look, I'm here, I have something to offer you, or I have something I'd like to pick up from you.  It was, it kind of allowed us all to, to intermingle our living with each other, if that makes sense.
Speaker 1: It does.
Story_ID: 634651
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  Well, Garfield, we know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I started preschool actually at the Neighborhood House [Columbus, Ohio] and went to preschool (laughter) my mother says I went to preschool there exactly one day, and didn't like it, and, and didn't continue.  But I did kindergarten through sixth grade at Garfield Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio], and then my parents [Thelma Hunt Thomas and William Thomas, Sr.] moved.  We moved to Brentnell [Avenue], and which was on the North Side of town.  And at junior high, even though we moved when I was in--and this is probably important.  We moved--even when I was el- elementary school, I was allowed to stay with my [maternal] grandparents [Florine White Hunt and William Hunt] to finish my elementary years.  'Cause my mother went to work, didn't want me coming home by myself at the end of the day, so, stayed with my grandparents and finished sixth grade, then went to permanently stay with my parents at the end of sixth grade and went to junior high at Linmoor Junior High [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School] and graduated from Linden-McKinley High School [Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio], both on the North Side of Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay now, going back to Garfield, now do you, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Loved it.  I loved school.  And all of my teachers were--and this is not why I loved school.  But at that, at Garfield, all my teachers, my principal, the custodian, everybody was African American.  And there was a real high expectation for what I would do.  You may or may not have noticed that I don't mind talking, and so that was the case even in elementary school.  And for that reason, I had a lot of opportunities to learn things, to stand up in front of people, to be emcee, the mas- mistress of ceremony for various kinds of things.  But I, I loved school.  I loved reading.  I loved school.  I loved learning.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know in some cities even in the North you, you, you'll have a black school sometimes (unclear) but a white teaching staff, so that--but black teachers had an opportunity to teach in all-black schools in Columbus (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In Columbus, actually for a while that's the only place they had an opportunity to teach.  So, they taught at Garfield Elementary, at Felton Elementary [Felton Elementary School], Clearbrook [Clearbrook Middle School], there was some, some elementarys--Pilgrim [Pilgrim School; East Pilgrim Elementary School], right on the East Side [Columbus, Ohio], then Champion Junior High [Champion Junior High School; Champion Middle School], and East High School.  That was kind of breaking up.  But you know, there were more opportunities expanded about the time I came along.  But still, when I was in elementary school, every teacher at Garfield was African American there, and the principal.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did, when you were going to school, did you realize that at the time that, that the black teachers could only teach, teach in the black schools or--
Speaker 2: I had no idea.  And actually, by the time I came along, again, that was, that was changing.  Because by the time I got to Linmoor--and I'm trying to think--by the time I got to Linmoor, there were two black teachers that I remember at Linmoor Junior High.  It was a much bigger school obviously than Garfield had been.  There were probably about--I'm just guessing now--probably about eight hundred kids, maybe a thousand students in that junior high school, and there were a couple of black teachers.  But that was just changing at that time that black teachers could teach other places other than the Near East Side [Columbus, Ohio] schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634652
Speaker 1: I know today as superintendent, you probably know the history of Columbus' schools [Columbus Public Schools; Columbus City Schools] on some level.
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: But if you--where did black students start in Columbus [Ohio]?  Did they start in Garfield [Garfield Elementary School] or was there another school that they--that they designated as a black school?
Speaker 2: There were several elementary schools on the East Side [Columbus, Ohio] where a lot of the black children went to school.  As I said, Garfield, Clearbrook [Clearbrook Middle School], Pilgrim [Pilgrim School; East Pilgrim Elementary School], those were largely, you know, black schools until, you know, folks started moving around.  And then, and, and there were always in Columbus, there were always pockets of black people, even in, in schools that, that were not the traditional black schools.
Speaker 1: So, segregation wasn't by law but by custom--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) or, and in what they call de facto segregation.
Speaker 2: That's right, and also by--what do I want to call it--the codes that were used when--restrictive covenants, because people--there were restrictive covenants at one time in Columbus where individuals could not live in certain neighborhoods or you know, maybe black people couldn't go south of Broad Street or, or something like that.  So, those restrictive covenants then also dictated where children went to school.  And by and large, initially kids went to school on the Near East Side [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the houses had in their contracts that they could not be sold to a Negro--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --or in some cases a Jew and a Negro and other--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  Those restrictive covenants would not allow houses to be, you know, to be sold to, to black folks.  And, and I'm sure that Jewish people were, were in that also.  And so, that kind of led to gerrymandering, really, you know, and really restricting where, where blacks could go to school.
Story_ID: 634653
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite subject at Garfield [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I loved to read.  I, I loved reading, and I still love reading to this day.  And then I fell in love with writing when I, when I got into, to high school.  But, but at Garfield it was reading.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, they were all wonderful.  And, and if you pressed me, I could tell you what every one of my teachers' names was.  But I think a teacher that stood out most to me was Anna Bishop.  I had her in, at fourth grade.  And I, I didn't realize how, until I became an adult, how prolific--she then became Dr. Bishop--but at that time Mrs. Bishop was.  She was a poet.  She wrote music.  She wrote music and, and actually taught it to us.  I remember a song that she wrote about Columbus [Ohio] that I still remember: "Have you ever thought about all the places around?  Many parks and buildings are found in our town."  I can hear her singing it.  "Take a little walk around for an hour or two.  You will be surprised at the things you can do.  There are libraries, parks, and zoos, museums too, factories and shops galore.  What are you waiting for?  Have you ever thought about all the places around?"  I can't believe I can remember this.  "Have you ever thought about all the places around?  Many parks and buildings are found in our town," written by Anna Bishop.  And she, she had us singing all of the time.  And I, and I now know, and especially for children of color, that the arts are an extremely important part of the learning process.  And you will laugh at this: one of the reasons I did not become an elementary teacher is because--I, I never ask anybody this, but I just assumed that you had to be able to play the piano, which I could not do.  I could sing, but I couldn't play the piano, and because every one of my elementary teachers, there was a piano in the classroom.  They played that piano.  It was part of our curriculum.  It was part of how we learned things.  I mean, I even learned--I don't know why it's useful information, but I even learned the states and the capitals (laughter) through a song that I still know.  But those men and women, and mainly women, made a big impression on me about how you carry yourself, how you think, how you present yourself, now you speak, just, just, just how you are.  It was, it was a great experience.  And I think for that reason, when I went on to Linmoor [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School, Columbus, Ohio], which was a ma- majority white school with majority white teachers, I was placed in what was then called the advanced or the accelerated classes.  And you know, they didn't have to take me out of those.  I mean, I was prepared, and I, and I was very confident that I could compete with, with anybody who was there.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you miss Garfield when you're at Linmoor?
Speaker 2: I missed my friends.  But--I missed my friends, but it wasn't, it wasn't like a longing, because I was, I was ready for this new adventure.  And so I made new friends and you know, had leadership roles at Linmoor, and became the senior class vice president at Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio], and you know, went to Girls State [American Legion Girls State], did all kinds of things.  And I think it was because I was--I left Garfield very confident in myself, who I was, and that I could compete with anybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634654
Speaker 1: You moved when you were about, you said you were about what, what age (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The family moved when I was seven, but I stayed with my [maternal] grandmother [Florine White Hunt] and finished Garfield [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] until the end of sixth grade, which would have been twelve I guess, if you're--
Speaker 1: Twelve?
Speaker 2: --twelve in sixth grade.  And then, and then I went to Linmoor [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School, Columbus, Ohio] for seventh, eighth, and ninth grades.  It was a junior high at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1965 or?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, 1965 exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The same year my brother [William Thomas, Jr.] graduated from high school, I went to seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did--was your family politically attuned to what was going on in the, in the Civil Rights Movement and?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  They weren't, they weren't what you could activists, but they talked about it, and it was on television all the time.  As a matter of fact, April 4th is my birthday, April 4th, 1968 was the day that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] unfortunately was, was assassinated, and that was big conversation in my house.  But my family was very attuned to what was happening.  I was in the fifth grade, as a matter of fact, when John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated, and that was huge conversation.  And again, we got a lot of information from magazines like Life and Look and Ebony that were always in my house.  And, and you know, you, you read about what was going on also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let's get--I know Dr. King was assassinated I guess when you were in high school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was fifteen years old.
Speaker 1: Fifteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the, I guess I would have been in the tenth grade, tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you did well in Linmoor, and you said you were class president and--
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was in student council at Linmoor.  I was class vice president at Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio], at the high school.  I jum- I jumped ahead.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Any other activities?  Did you sing or anything, or did you--
Speaker 2: I was in all the singing groups at Linmoor.  I also was the cheerleader manager at, at, at Linmoor.  Teacher helper, you know, worked in the office.  And I was on the student council.  I was in the choir.  I was in the glee club at Linmoor.  Is there anything else that I did there that I can remember?  I think, I think that might have been it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so you, you say your family kept up with the Civil Rights Movement through the media and the papers and the magazines and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And also at our church we had--we belonged to a Disciple of Christ church [sic. Disciples of Christ], Woodland Christian Church, which still exists, 143 Woodland Avenue, right here in Columbus [Ohio] on the, on the Near East Side.  And so, in our church there was always conversation about what was going on in the, in the Civil Rights Movement.
Story_ID: 634655
Speaker 1: And I was very fortunate also with teachers, some black, some white, when I was in high school--I know I've probably moved too fast there--who really wanted to make sure that the group of us who were in leadership in our high school really understood who we were and what was emerging.  I just spoke to someone earlier today about Jayne Jakobsen, who was a white female librarian from Kansas.  And she was the librarian at my high school.  And there were a group of us that she made sure that there was a set of literature that we read.  We'd come in that library and every week she had a different book she wanted me to read.  So I was introduced to Richard Wright and, and, and Ralph Ellison, and you know, 'Black Boy' [Richard Wright], 'Native Son' [Richard Wright], the 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison], 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley], and a number of other pieces of really important literature and, and poetess [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, and all--by Jayne Jakobsen.  I was introduced to all this literature by Jayne Jakobsen, a white female from Kansas, who wanted to make sure that we at Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] really were aware of who we are, aware of this literature.  And she wasn't pushing anything.  It was like you need to figure out what you think about this.  Never any judgments, never any--she just wanted to make sure that it was in our hands.  She was the librarian.  She wasn't my English teacher.  She was the librarian, and she latched onto us and just wanted to make sure that she was contributing to making strong men and women and people who could think.  And, and actually, that's a kind of a theme of all of the educators that I came in contact with, from those African American teachers at, at Garfield [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] to teachers and principals to my teachers at mostly white, some black, teachers and, and educators at Linmoor Junior High [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School, Columbus, Ohio] who wanted to make sure that we were a part of the leadership, that we had that opportunity to be exposed to different things, to Jayne Jakobson and the educators at Linden-McKinley.  It's kind of a common theme that somebody saw something in me.  And I keep saying us because at every level there were a group of us.  It wasn't just me that these educators kind of mentored to make sure that, that we were the best that we could possibly be.  And I think it's one of the reasons that I'm an educator today, because of that strong foundation that I got all the way through.  It was because of Jayne Jakobsen that I ended up at the University of Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana].  Notre Dame was an all men's school, and it was, even when I graduated from high school in 1971.  She invited--she knew people there.  She knew the law librarian there.  She invited folks from Notre Dame to come and recruit at Linden-McKinley.  And they recruited, who is now my husband [Stanley Harris], along with some other young men, to go to Notre Dame.  And so, that was in the fall of '71 [1971].  We had graduated from high school.  We were entering college the fall of '71 [1971].  I went to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  And then the following--and my then boyfriend went to Notre Dame.  At the end of our sophomore year--at the--I'm sorry--at the end of our freshman year in college, Notre Dame admitted women.  I applied and I got in.  And, and it's--I still say that that's Jayne Jakobsen because she had the vision to see that these African American kids--Linden-McKinley was becoming a, a largely black high school then, but that these kids at this high school could compete.  And she made that opportunity available to my boyfriend, now husband, and he took it.  And I followed when I had the opportunity to go to this great school.
Speaker 2: That makes me wonder about Ms. Jakobsen, if she was a volunteer with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] at one time or maybe 'cause they started to frequent schools down south and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and started trying to--there's--I, I saw a documentary where they said that they had to try to learn black history to teach it to the kids in the South.  They didn't know it themselves (unclear).
Speaker 1: There was something that influenced her.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and I wish that she were still alive and I had the opportunity to ask her that question, because that, that wasn't a question to me then.  It was just like, okay, you know, we all love Ms. J., as we called her, and she said to do this, so we're gonna do it.  And it never occurred to me at that time, you know, how unusual that was that this white woman from Kansas for goodness sake--
Speaker 2: Was she a young woman?
Speaker 1: She was--Ms. J., I would say that she was probably in her forties at that time.  I would say she was probably in her forties at that time.
Speaker 2: It would be interesting to find out what she--you know, if we--I don't know how we can do it now--found out where she (unclear)--
Speaker 1: You know be able to you know 'cause there are some people who are still around, who are still living, who knew Mrs. Jakobsen, who were colleagues of hers.
Speaker 2: And her resume may still be in this building.
Speaker 1: It, it certainly could be, yeah, so we could, we could find that out, we could find that out, we could find that out.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah I'd like to know that.
Speaker 1: Most definitely.
Story_ID: 634656
Speaker 1: Well, I guess, is there anything about high school we need talk, talk about before we, we just, we get you to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: We, we do.  You, you mentioned the Civil Rights Movement, and Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] became a focal point for civil rights right here in Columbus [Ohio] during my senior year.  When my brother [William Thomas, Jr.] graduated from Linden-McKinley in 1965 it was a majority white school.  The Linden area [Columbus, Ohio] itself was, was majority white.  By the time I got there in nineteen s- in, in--actually I went there in the tenth grade, in '68 [1968], to graduate in, in 1971, the school was, had become about 50 percent black and maybe a, a little bit more than, than 50 percent.  It had changed really very rapidly.  Whites were moving farther north, moving out; blacks were moving in.  And there were some natural--there were some tensions that were going on, some that were spilling over from the Civil Rights Movement and you know, and just the natural tension of a change going on.  Quite unfortunately, that year we experienced, beginning Black History Month, there was a big black history program.  And one of our classmates, one of her white classmates--in fact, he was in honors, in accelerated classes with all of us.  We knew him well, didn't know that he was harboring some things like this.  But during that, during that program it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is this 1970--
Speaker 2: This was 19--this was the, this was the, it would be second semester of my senior year, so it'd be like 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: February 1971, just before graduation.  We're in a, we're at a black history assembly.  The whole school is there, which was really just pretty much presenting a panoramic, panoramic view--I remember this--of blacks in America from 1619 to the present.  And everybody was excited.  We were all excited about the assembly.  There was a balcony.  Students were in the balcony.  And right in the middle of the assembly, Rick [ph.]--I won't say his name.  The, our classmate threw some papers over the, the balcony.  And in the papers it talked about how whites were being discriminated against and discip- unfairly disciplined in the office and they weren't leaders in the school anymore, and you know, and this was all wrong.  And so two things happened: one, the assembly was disrupted; and then two, anything that, that was below the surface erupted into fights and kind of disorder going on in the school.  For, so much so that the police had to be called in over several days, and the school was closed for several weeks because it was, there were what some have called riots, I don't like to call them riots, but fights had, had broken out in, in the school.  And that was a real turning point.
Story_ID: 634657
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking about disruption at Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] in 1971.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, 1971.
Speaker 1: So what was the upshot?  You said the na- the police came down to the school and?
Speaker 2: The police came.  Kids were fighting, and, and the administration couldn't get control of it.  So, there--this lasted over several days.  Some of us who were school leaders, elected leaders, student council, senior class officers, all of that, we were asked to come in and have discussions about what was needed, because there, there were two things going on.  One is black students started to say we need more African American teachers.  We need more African American studies.  We need to know more about ourselves.  And how interesting the person like Jayne Jakobsen had really been trying to push, you know, a certain segment of the population in that direction, really understand--I mean, she, she had the sensitivity to know, to look to see what was going on in the broader society and to help those of us who were experiencing some of this change to, to really come to grips about it ourselves.  She was more enlightened I think than the administration was and becau- and, and quite unfortunately.  So you had black kids saying we need more African American teachers, we need more African American history classes, we need all of these things.  And we have white kids saying I feel disenfranchised; this isn't the school that I knew before.  How can we come together?  And so, again, unfortunately, the administration didn't get out in front of it the way Jayne Jakobsen was trying to do in trying to raise awareness of, of students about, you know, what was happening in, in the broader society.  It finally ended that in May--I think school was closed off and on, off and on for a couple of months and then finally in May for a couple of weeks and then it reopened.  We came back, took exams, and went from there.  The upshot is, and the longer term piece is the school was never the same.  Families began to move out of the community.  A school that had had--my high school class had over four hundred students in it, and there were two thousand students in that high school.  Today the high school has about seven hundred students in it, and the community is trying to get revitalized.  We just renovated the high school, and we certainly hope that that is--and we're working with the community to, to help that to become a catalyst for redevelopment in, in the community.  But I, I think the community has had a hard time--this is forty years later--recovering from that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, schools really play an important part in the community.
Speaker 2: They, a very key role, schools play an extremely key role in, in the community.  And, and I think that that institution, because of that unstableness, well, the institution itself suffered, but I think the community has suffered because of that too.
Story_ID: 634658
Speaker 1: Now, I wanted to go back to 1968 'cause it was on your birthday that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in 1968, and you were fifteen.
Speaker 2: I was fifteen years old.  And I was very sensitive about the Civil Rights Movement.  I had, I had asked my mother [Thelma Hunt Thomas], I said, "Why can't we move back south?  Because I want to be involved."  I was seeing young people at lunch counters and in marches and all of that, and I--there was something that was kindled in me that I really wanted to be a part of that.  And so in, in, on April 4th, 1968, it was actually we found out about it just as my [maternal] grandparents, the Hunts [Florine White Hunt and William Hunt] that I had talked about earlier, came to my house.  They were coming over to--we, we are big birthday people--cut cake and eat ice cream to celebrate my birthday.  And it was just at that time that we--it came on the news that Dr. King had been assassinated.  And I never before, and I don't think ever since, saw my mother and grandmother cry.  But I did see them cry that--it was like a loss of a personal family, a close family relation.  And it, it was very difficult.  And I remember asking questions.  What's gonna happen with the movement?  What, what happens?  I don't think I called it the movement, but I think, you know, what, what happens now that, that Dr. King isn't here?  And no one had any, any answers to that question.  But it, it was, it was a tough, it was a tough time, a very tough time.
Story_ID: 634659
Speaker 1: So when, when you graduate from Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] in '71 [1971], it's with this shadow of racial discord in the school.  And, now did you graduate with honors (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I did.  I graduated with honors and went on to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], did well enough at Ohio State as a freshman that I was admitted after I applied to Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana], and finished my degree at Notre Dame in English, was an English major at Notre Dame.
Speaker 1: I don't want to zoom too fast here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) at Ohio State now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ohio State at the time, what was Ohio State like, and what, what was your major there?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a freshman.  And I was headed to becoming an English major, but I just had to get all of those initial courses out of the way.  I knew I wanted to be a teacher.  Ohio State was a very interesting place then.  Even more than today, to me, blacks were visible on campus, I mean extremely visible on campus.  And I've had the opportunity to obviously spend a lot of time on Ohio State's campus in, in my role as, as superintendent [of Columbus City Schools] and meetings and other opportunities, speaking engagements.  And black students are there, I, I don't--the, the visibility is not what I remember it.  Now maybe it was because I was going there, and I was in different places, and, and, and I saw African Americans.  There was, and I, I can't remember if it was my freshman year--and I think it was, just before--an African American president of, of the student body, and that was Mike White [Michael R. White].  And Mike White talked about how he was going to be mayor of Cleveland [Ohio].  And in fact, he did become mayor of Cleveland, and I think he was mayor of Cleveland for a couple of terms.  But he was African American, and that was a big deal.  And everybody's Afro was bigger than anything you ever wanted to see.  I remember Mike White's Afro being just a huge puff of hair that everybody had.  But--
Speaker 1: Now, did you know [HistoryMaker] Ray Miller and--
Speaker 2: I knew Ray.  Ray's a couple of years older than I am, and he was on campus and very active then.  The, the, the, I think that the majority of the leadership that came from Ohio State's campus, African Americans on campus at that time, were young men and women who were in fraternities and sororities.  They were very visible and very clearly leadership material.  And so I think that maybe blacks seemed so visible to me because these fraternities and sororities were so active on campus.  And, and, and, and also, Dr. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --Dr. Nelson [William E. Nelson, Jr.] was there.  And you know, and the black studies department was emerging, and so there was a lot of emphasis on, on African Americans at that time.  Or it--or so it seemed.  I don't know if it was true.
Speaker 1: Was Ako Kambon still the--(unclear) when you were there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember Ako, but Ako I don't think had changed his name then.  I guess his name was Jerry Robinson [sic. Jerry A. Roberts] or something like that.  But I don't remember Ako.  I remember Ray, and I remember Mike.  And again, they're, they're a couple of years older than I am.  But I, I don't remember Ako on campus at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  So did, did you spend very much time in the--now was Dr. Frank Hale [Frank Hale, Jr.] still there?
Speaker 2: Dr. Hale was, was there.  He was absolutely there, someone who will be missed.  He was there, and I think black studies, you know, the black studies department was emerging at, at that time.  And I, I had little bit different situation.  I didn't live on campus.  I lived at home and drove in to campus.  And so, I worked really hard to make myself a part of, of activities, but there could have been some things that I missed because I, I was a commuter student.
Speaker 1: And you also were in love, and your (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was.
Speaker 1: --and your man [Stanley Harris] was at Notre Dame, so.
Speaker 2: The love of my life was at Notre Dame, and so my interests were really there, thinking about how can I get there or how can I get him home, one or, or the other, so.
Story_ID: 634660
Speaker 1: Now there's a brother that I met, Ph.D. in Norfolk, Virginia [at Norfolk State University]--he's either in Norfolk or Hampton--who's, who is in charge of a, like a talent search for black students for internships and all that sort of thing, based at Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana].  I think he was there when you got there.  And I can't think of--
Speaker 2: I don't know who that was.
Speaker 1: --think of his name was.  I keep thinking his name is Harris [sic. HistoryMaker Harrison B. Wilson].  We just interviewed him this--last month.
Speaker 2: And he was there the year--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was--
Speaker 2: I was there from '71 [1971] to '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Father Hesburgh [Theodore Hesburgh] was one of his big supporters and had an office there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Father Hesburgh--
Speaker 1: --on campus--
Speaker 2: --was the truth.
Speaker 1: --doing, you know, great things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They recruited black students for internships at major corporations and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Now my husband [Stanley Harris] would probably know him because he was a business major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my husband would probably also say to me, "Oh, you know who that is, girl.  You just can't remember anything."  But yeah, he--
Speaker 1: He's--
Speaker 2: --but he was a business major.
Speaker 1: Yeah, his office was actually was based at Notre Dame--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and for many years.  Yeah, for many--for about thirty years he--
Speaker 2: He probably recruited my--because my husband went to work for one of the big eight accounting firms after he graduated, so he probably helped him get there, I would, I would guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, well, so, you get a chance to go to Notre Dame.  So you're, you're part of this history making group of the first Notre Dame co-eds?
Speaker 2: There were eight black women on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--eight black women undergrads, I should say, on campus, because there--I am told, and I did not know her; my husband remembers her, that Condoleezza Wright was in--Rice [Condoleezza Rice] was in graduate school while we were there.  And I'm sure my husband remembers her because he knew every woman that was on campus, I am sure.  (Laughter) But, but there were eight black undergrads when I went there as a sophomore.  And that was--and I think they had only admitted maybe 100, 150, if that many, women altogether, and only eight of us were black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was that like?  Here you're on an all-male campus, you know, women for the first time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, were you distracted any by the, all the (laughter)--?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause, 'cause, 'cause my honey was there.  I, I wasn't distracted.  I was--I will tell you that I was amazed and figured out how much I hadn't been exposed to.  I felt very--one thing I--you know, remember I talked about this confidence that I felt when I went from Garfield [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] to, to Linmoor [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School, Columbus, Ohio]?  Felt pretty confident when I got there.  I got into classes and at first was a little tentative and listened to people and what they had read and what they'd been exposed to.  I thought okay, I'm good; (laughter) you know, I, I can, I can do this.  But what, what was amazing to me is the amount of wealth that I was--around which I was surrounded.  I remember talking to one person in my dorm, and she talked about the fact that her father owned the Texas Rangers.  And I remember calling home and asking my father what does that mean that you--?  I mean, because I had never heard of anybody owning a ball club.  I didn't understand that kind of wealth and that kind of, of exposure at that time.  And, and, and you know, I don't really think, again, that I realized that I was blazing a trail.  Yeah, I knew I was among the first women.  And yeah, I knew there were only a handful of us African Americans on campus.  But I really didn't understand the trail that I was blazing at that time.  I always knew that it was important for me to do my best no matter what; that's what you are taught at home.  And as an African American, I was taught in my household that you better be twice as good if you are going--that, I heard that from my [maternal] grandmother [Florine White Hunt], from my parents [Thelma Hunt Thomas and William Thomas, Sr.], you know, all the time: if you're gonna make it, you're going to be twice as good, because there are a whole lot of factors in this world that are, are mitigating against you.  So, you can't just meet the standard; you've got to go above the standard.  I'm glad that I had that in my background, because I think that helped me to be successful.  And it's really foreign.  I mean, Linmoor was foreign too, when I went from Garfield to, to Linmoor.  Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] was less because I had the Linmoor experience.  But this was a really, a foreign experience for me.  But I think because my academic preparedness and the fact that I had this foundation of confidence coming all the way through--this foundation that made me confident coming all the way through I think that helped me to be successful.
Story_ID: 634661
Speaker 1: Now was there--did you experience any pushback for, for, you know, being a black woman on the Notre Dame campus [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I don't think I felt the black woman thing.  I felt the woman thing clearly, because there were men that did not want us on campus at all, to the point that--streaking was big then.  I was, and I remember being so insulted by this.  Streaking was big at that time, where you know, people would take off their clothes and run naked across campus.  Well, the men would run naked through our dorms to be just disrespectful because they just really didn't want us on campus at all.  I'm sure that there was some racial discrimination, but I think I was almost in a cocoon with these eight black women.  We hung out together.  But I made some really good friends, who are my friends today, who, who were not African American, you know, females, you know, on that campus.  But I think I was in a cocoon because I also hung out with my husband [Stanley Harris] and his friends.  So, you know, I didn't spend--and I, and I spent a lot of time studying, because the last thing I was gonna do is--okay, you got into Notre Dame.  The last thing I was gonna do was to flunk out, or even come close to flunking out, or not do well.  So I spent a lot of my time in the library, in my room studying.  And I only really participated--I, I was appointed to, for a year, student court.  I was asked to, to be on that student disciplinary court.  But I didn't do a lot of activities because I was so focused on making sure--and I had to work while I was there.  And I, and I was so focused on making sure that, that I did well, that I could get into a good graduate school, if that's what I decided to do, and that, certainly that I would graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were there any women instructors at Notre Dame?
Speaker 2: Maben Herring, Dr. Maben Herring.  She was an African American.  She was my advisor.  And I was amazed that she was even there.  And interestingly, she is the only--and, and maybe there are others, but she is the only female instructor that I remember.  And I will also tell you interestingly, she is the only prof- I can tell you all of the names of my elementary teachers and probably could go through junior high [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School, Columbus, Ohio] and high school [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] and do the same.  She is the only professor's name I remember from undergrad school.  I don't even remember any other instructors' names.  And so if you ask me about my most vivid memories from Notre Dame it would be Maben Herring and Father Ted Hesburgh [Theodore Hesburgh], because he was such a big civil rights activist.  And we would see Father Hesburgh on campus.  He would stop and talk to us, not just us, African Americans, but students period.  He was very visible.  But nobody else do I even--I'd have to work hard to come up with another name.
Speaker 1: What did Dr. Herring teach?
Speaker 2: She taught English.  She, she was--I was, I was--so she taught literature courses, and she was my advisor as an English major.
Speaker 1: So she--what, what aspect of literature did she teach, what, what kind?
Speaker 2: You know, right now I don't remember that.  Maybe she taught American lit.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe just American lit.  She may have, have taught some others, but I didn't have her.  I remember my Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] class at Notre Dame, but I don't remember Dr. Herring, Herring being my instructor for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634662
Speaker 1: Did you get married while you were a student there?
Speaker 2: No.  My parents [Thelma Hunt Thomas and William Thomas, Sr.] said if you get married while you're a student, all visible support gets cut off.  Adult people, when you're, you're--those are adults when you get married, so Stan [Stanley Harris] and I were pretty clear that marriage was not gonna happen until after we graduated.  In fact, after we graduated from Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] the same time, he went on to work in Chicago [Illinois], and I came home to teach.  And at the end of my first year of teaching we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you come back to Columbus [Ohio] this is 19--
Speaker 2: Actually I guess maybe it was my second year of teaching.
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy [1970]--
Speaker 2: We came back in '75 [1975], and actually got married in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I guess two years.
Speaker 1: So, I guess you taught English in Chicago public--in Columbus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I taught English and drama at Everett Junior High [Everett Junior High School; Everett Middle School, Columbus, Ohio] when I was teaching.
Speaker 1: Did you have drama at Notre Dame, I guess?
Speaker 2: I didn't have--I didn't take theater classes there, but--well, I must have taken some theater classes because it was enough to get me certified as a, as a drama teacher.  So, yeah, I guess I did take a couple.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What was that experience like?  Now here you're back in the, in the Columbus Public Schools [Columbus City Schools].  You, you grew up in the--
Speaker 2: This is where I wanted to be.  And I was worried when my then--he wasn't quite my fiancee then, but my then boyfriend moved to Chicago, 'cause I thought oh, boy, I'm not gonna realize my dream, but he, he decided to move home.  So it was, it was wonderful to be able to come back to, to teach in Columbus City Schools, and I was, I was very happy to be able to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a sense of giving back so much that had been given to me, so much that had been poured into me.  I had the opportunity to do something similar with students right here in my own community.
Speaker 1: Where did you teach?
Speaker 2: I taught at Everett.  I only taught in one place, and that was Everett Junior High, and I taught English and drama there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so, so you were there one year you said?
Speaker 2: No.  I was actually there for, from 1975 until I think it was December of 1979, when I went out on maternity leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I taught there for about four years--
Speaker 1: Now how did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) four and a half years.
Story_ID: 634663
Speaker 1: How did the busing crisis enter into what was going on when you were in the Columbus Public Schools [Columbus City Schools]?  I know there was, everyone's in a busing (unclear).
Speaker 2: We did.  So in 1978 [sic.], that was when the court order came for desegregation [Penick v. Columbus Board of Education, 1977].  Judge Duncan [Robert Morton Duncan]--and, and then it was stayed for a year.  And then in 1979, a year later, it was actually implemented.  There was a stay because the, I think the, the school district was challenging the order.  And so that went through courts, and then in 1979 it was actually implemented.  And actually in Columbus [Ohio] we had one of the most peaceful desegregation implementations of any place in the country.  When I was a senior I think at Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana], I watched with interest on what was going on in Boston [Massachusetts].  And if you'll remember, Boston was one of the most violent implementations of desegregation.  And so I was personally very worried about what would happen in Columbus when that, when that--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I was worried about, I was really worried about the--what would happen in, in Columbus should we ever desegregate.  And the leadership of this school district did a absolutely ingenious job of preparing.  In that year that the stay was going on, even though the, the, the, there was this challenge, they took that year to really plan for the implementation, and it was, it was peaceful.  There was a jingle called 'Think of Us Columbus' that the Milenthals [Hameroff Milenthal, Inc.; Hameroff Milenthal Spence, Inc., Columbus Ohio] put together.  They hired a, a PR [public relations] company, and, and they showed children getting on the bus.  And, and, and the message was think of us, Columbus.  And that's the children, as this desegregation order is going through.  There were individuals who were hired actually to work in the community, liaisons to work in the community, to ease that in the school community, ease the transition.  And it, it really, it really went very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was very peaceful.
Speaker 1: That's, that's a lot different from Dayton [Ohio] I know, 'cause in Dayton they shot the desegregation specialist dead.
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh.
Speaker 1: Charles Glatt, remember him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do remember that now.  None of that, not a, not a bit of violence in that.  And it's not to say that people embraced it.  They didn't.  As a result of that, you know, and a result of the, the well defined ring of sub- suburbs that have been built, we began to lose students because--at that time.  When I was a senior in high school [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio], that was the, the year where we had the most students in Columbus City Schools, a high of 110,000 students in enrollment.  And shortly after, and, and as you can see, Columbus was very late in desegregating too when you talk about '78 [1978], '79 [1979].  That's really late in, in that process.  Given that Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka] was in 1954 (laughter), that was, that was (laughter) a lot of years later, over twenty years later.  So, but still it was a, a very peaceful implementation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think the--there, there's a stay though, according to what we have here, that the [U.S.] Supreme Court granted a stay to the Columbus schools against--so they didn't have to have them force the busing (unclear).
Speaker 2: But that was for a year, and then that was turned over (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Then it--okay.  That was turned over.
Speaker 2: That was turned over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634664
Speaker 1: Now you started graduate school too during this period of time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I actually started grad- I started teaching in 1975, and I think in 1976, the spring of '76 [1976], I started graduate school to work on a master's degree and work on qualifications for a principal's license.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, and you, you got your master's in (unclear) in 1979.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was graduate school like, and what were the (unclear) of graduate school in those days that you had?
Speaker 2: So I went to--I, I, I taught all day, and then several nights a week went to graduate school, was writing papers, and doing all of that.  And I had, of all of my professors in graduate school, I had two African Americans, Russ Spillman [Russell J. Spillman] and Lonnie Wagstaff [Lonnie H. Wagstaff], both of whom really took a special interest, or so I felt.  Maybe I just think I'm special, but both of whom took a, a special interest in, in my development.  I had shared, especially with Dr. Wagstaff, my special interest in becoming a high school principal.  I mean, I wasn't just doing this.  I, I really wanted--that, actually at that time was my career goal to be a high school principal.  And, and, and Dr. Wagstaff really helped me to, to think about that.  It was--coming from Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] and only having had Dr. Herring [Maben Herring] as my only African American professor in that time, and I had none at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] when I was a freshman, getting to graduate school and having these two individuals, these very well lettered, well studied, well tutored men as, as my professors was really a, a, a special treat.  It really was--it was unique.  And I, as I think about my graduate school experience since then, taking classes as well as then working on my Ph.D., I have not had additional African American professors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you aware of Charles Ross [Charles O. Ross] then, of the independent Black Student Movement?
Speaker 2: You know, I, and, and I probably need to go back to the Linden-McKinley High School [Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] experience.  So, you know, I talked a little bit about the student who disrupted the schools, the fights, all, all of that, what black students were saying, et cetera.  Dr. Ross was at the center of that.  Dr. Ross helped a group of students at, at Linden-McKinley, actually raise the African Amer- the African--what was--the national African flag?  Why can't I think of that?
Speaker 1: The red, black, and green.
Speaker 2: Red, red, red, black, black, and green flag. Actually (laughter) it got, where, on the flag pole outside of the school, it got raised in front of Linden-McKinley, I mean, really kind of threw some fuel on the fire.  And so that was my first introduction to, to Dr. Ross.  He was very much in the mix of things, really trying to--I think he was really trying to bring to the forefront--I don't think that his intent was disruption, but I think he was trying to bring to the forefront some things that needed to happen, like what I was talking about, or African American studies, really the hiring African American teachers, making sure that the needs of, of the students were, were being met.  So, that was my introduction to Dr. Ross.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And then I had--the funny thing is then I had, when I was a high school principal I had his stu- his sons, at least one of his sons, I think I had his youngest son as a student when I was a high school principal.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I know they used to have a cultural awareness weekend here, it's--annually.  So, now, when you finished--now, what was your thesis, what, what--I have to ask you that.
Speaker 2: At, at the master's level I didn't have to write a thesis.  I had the opportunity to either write a thesis or to test and to, you know, take three days of, of tests, and that's what I chose to do, because at that time I was expecting our son [Wade Harris], who was born in Ja- I, I graduated in August, and he was born in January.  So, I had decided prior to that, when I first--'cause I first thought about writing a thesis a year earlier, but when I found out that I was expecting I decided to go the other route.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did write a dissertation obviously later, but I didn't write a master's thesis.
Speaker 1: And so, so what--now, in 1980 you were assigned as assistant principal of a school in Columbus [Ohio].  I mean which, which one was it?
Speaker 2: Central High School, which is now a part of COSI [COSI Columbus, Columbus, Ohio].  Central was right downtown here in Columbus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And actually, I stayed there through its closing.  It was closed by the board of education [Columbus Board of Education; Columbus City Schools Board of Education] in June of 1982.
Story_ID: 634665
Speaker 1: All right, Central High School [Columbus, Ohio].  So you were assistant principal there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay there (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was there for two years until the school closed.  Because of declining enrollment, the, the board of education [Columbus Board of Education; Columbus City Schools Board of Education] that year closed several schools, and Central was one of those.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, how was the experience of being an assistant principal?  Did you like that?
Speaker 2: I loved it.  I was twenty-six years old, or twenty-seven years old I think when I, I got my first assignment, not much older than, you know, the eighteen year old students who, who were there (laughter).  But I loved the opportunity to do a couple of things.  One, to be with the students, hear what they had to say, and then try to share that with staff, about, you know, policy issues or changes that, that we ought to make.  It was a little frightening because (laughter) the principal of the school was my high school principal.  And so he was the gentleman who had been my high school principal.  And then there were--and I had opinions about how I thought that he had handled, you know, that really tough situation at Linden-McKinley [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio], and now I'm working for him.  And then there were--I can remember at least one, but I'm thinking there were two teachers who were on the staff who had been former teachers of mine, and now, in effect, I'm their supervisor.  And so that was a very challenging situation, but not negatively.  They were--it, it worked very well, but it was very interesting.
Speaker 1: It's something that they didn't imagine (unclear).
Speaker 2: They never imagined.  But you know what, they were--there was a sense of pride, because they felt that they had some part in my success to that point.
Story_ID: 634666
Speaker 1: Along this time, now, I've got it on my outline--I don't know what significance it has.  It probably is significant to you on some level.  But Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] created the U.S. Department of Education in 1979, so--
Speaker 2: And, and you know I think that I wasn't really aware of the significance of that.  You know, I really hadn't, my, my policy thinking had not risen--had not rose to that level at, at, at that, at that time.  So I wasn't sure--I'm sure that at for me it didn't have any immediate impact.  I mean I'm sure it did have impact, but I wasn't aware of the impact that it had.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that, the--Ron- Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] of course was elected in '81 [1981].  And he has U.S. Secretary of Education Terrel H. Bell, and I, and I don't know much about him really.  But does that, does that--do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: I remember him.  I remember the name.  I remember when that happened.  And I think that might have been, it probably would have been Jimmy Carter.  I was gonna say I, I think that might have been the time when, when there were real conversations about head start and, and, and, and again, that's probably Jimmy Carter and not Ronald Reagan, so.  I remember Terrell Bell's name but not much about the policies that were enacted at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know the Republicans were calling for the abolition of the U.S. Department of Education.
Speaker 2: And we're back to that, you know.
Speaker 1: And they're doing it now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as we speak, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's cyclical.  And, and I think part of that is because of, you know, there is this whole thought about what is--or the question about what is government's role in education.  Since it's not spoken to in the [U.S.] Constitution it becomes the states' right and states' responsibility.  But we also see that in some states that responsibil- there are some gaps in how they're approaching that responsibility.  So, the question has to be, what is the, the role of, of the feds in, in education?  And in countries where we are--with whom we are trying to compete, like Finland and others that, that are ranking so high on the, the global scale with education, there's national curriculum, and there's national involvement in education.  So, how do we balance having fifty states with fifty different sets of standards and fifty different approaches at least and fifteen thousand school districts that are doing things in more than fifteen thousand ways, and then at the end of that, expect that we're going to have a unified outcome for our students?  And so that's why I'm, you know, I'm always leery when there's the question about the, the, the role of the feds in education, because if we're going to compete, we really need to look at these countries with whom we are saying that we want to compete and what their structure is.  And that's not the only thing we need to look at, but what's their--what structure is in place that helps them to reach the kind of success for the majority of their children as they are?
Story_ID: 634667
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-six [1986], after six years as assistant principal, you were promoted to principal.
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: Now, and did it come on time, or do you think it was late, or what do you, what do you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I think it was right on time.  And in fact, I was promoted right in the middle of a school year.  And it gave me the opportunity to see the school in motion as the principal.  I, I was thirty-two years old, 1986, soon to be thirty-three years old.  And so a relatively young woman promoted to the high school principalship, I think that the organization may have seen themselves taking a risk, because at that time I was the youngest high school principal in Columbus City Schools [Columbus Public Schools; Columbus City Schools], and a female, and one of only, at that time, I think two or three females who were high school principals at that time.  So, I don't think it was late at all.  Some may think that it was early.  I didn't think that it was early because I, I felt prepared for it, and it, it was a great opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What school were you the principal?
Speaker 2: So initially, I was principal at Briggs High School [Columbus, Ohio] from 1986 to 1987, really just eighteen months.  And then the central administration asked me to go back to Mifflin High School [Columbus, Ohio], where I had served as assistant principal, and serve as principal.  And, and I served there until 1991, when the superintendent then at that time asked me to supervise schools.  So, I'd still be there being a principal if he (laughter) hadn't asked me to supervise schools probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, what was it like being a principal (unclear) in these schools?
Speaker 2: I had a lot of energies, and, and that's what it took to, to be a principal.  It, it was, it was, it was, it was the job that, before this one, that I enjoyed the most, again, because I got to help establish policy.  I wasn't far away from the students, which is one of the reasons I went into the business.  So I got to continue to work with students and parents, but I also had one foot in the policy arena, you know, in talking with the superintendent and others.  And, and I also had the opportunity to develop teachers.  And, and so that was very satisfying to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have like a philosophy in terms of how you approached, you know, dealing with parents and that sort of thing at the schools?
Speaker 2: And, and it's the philosophy that I, I have today, and it's the same approach that I use with parents and, and students as, as well as other com- and teachers and other community members.  It, it's a philosophy of inclusivity.  You know, I want to hear what you have to say.  I want to hear your opinions.  I want to work with you.  I'm not here to dictate.  Look, I have no problems making decisions at all.  But I do want to hear your ideas.  I know that I don't have the only idea, so that's one.  But the second thing is, is all children, all of, all of the time.  In my mind, there wasn't a, a special set of kids that got all the good stuff, and these are the kids that are going to college, and these are the kids--.  And I think it's, it's, it's, it's probably largely because of my background.  As much as we could expose all of the students to, and as hard as we can push them all to do their best, I want them to get as much education as they can possibly stand.  High school graduation was a minimum.  And then we need to look forward past that to what we need to do next; how we need to prepare you so that you can take the next level of learning, whether that's gonna be a four-year baccalaureate de, degree, a two year technical degree, or you know, a certificate of some kind at a technical school, we need to make sure that you're prepared.  So those are my two philosophies: I want to include folks in the decision making, and it's all kids all the time.

Speaker 1: What were the highlights of your years as, as principal?
Speaker 2: Wow, highlights, there were so many.  You know, one of them remains the same every year, and that is I live for graduation, because I think that's, that's what this is, is all about.  And I think another highlight in my career, specific highlight, would be when--and, and, and you might find this odd as, as I put this together.  Our school [Mifflin High School, Columbus, Ohio], we--the superintendent [of Columbus Public Schools; Columbus City Schools] at that time gave us the opportunity to apply for a status called scout school, where we could be a school, one of five high schools that were blazing a trail for the others.  And we had to come together, put our plans together in a collaborative way, and we did that.  And we interviewed, and we applied, and I thought we did very well.  The strange thing about it--well, not strange thing, I mean I--this is a highlight: Even though we did not get that status, we were not afforded that status, I later found out one of the reasons we were not is because the superintendent had in mind that he was gonna promote me at the end of that year, and he didn't want our school to get that status and then have to have a new principal.  But, I didn't know that at that time.  And I still thought it was a good thing because our staff came together in a way that they never had before.  And I think that if I had stayed there, we would have reached heights that, you know, and made, and, and, and had success, the kind of success that we had not before.  So, it was a good experience for us.  It was a, it was a highlight for me personally and professionally because it really showed me the power of collaboration.  I al- always believed that, but it really showed me what can happen when you work well together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I guess, I can't help but think that it's unfortunate that when you start mastering something, then they pull you--they kick you upstairs to something else.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.
Speaker 2: And, and it e- it's something that I struggled with as a superintendent, because we find ourselves falling into that trap.  Two things happened.  These principals are, or whatever the person may be, it may be a director of a department, but they are mastering the content.  They're getting somewhere.  They're making, they're, they're showing success, and they're showing results.  And then we have an opening.  And we see that they've got the talent to do it, so we struggle with moving them.  Or, do we leave them there?  But the other piece of that is these hard chargers also want new challenges.  So how do you satisfy that and also continue to make the progress in the school, the department, whatever it may be that, that you know you need to make?  And I think succession planning is part of that too.
Story_ID: 634669
Speaker 1: Now, we spoke earlier of I guess a--that a change in demographics of Columbus [Ohio] and how people live, how they used to live when you, you were growing up and how they live today.  What was the biggest challenge in dealing with parents, new kinds of parents and new situations and new communities?
Speaker 2: Couple of things.  One is not having a sense of community.  I think that is a, a real challenge and the fact that so many of our families move so often.  I mean, you heard me talk about living--being in one elementary [Garfield Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio], one middle school [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School, Columbus, Ohio], and one high school [Linden-McKinley High School; Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio].  There were two reasons that my parents [Thelma Hunt Thomas and William Thomas, Sr.] didn't move me when they moved to Brentnell [Avenue] and we moved away from Garfield [Avenue].  They didn't want me to be in another elementary school.  You know, they thought all of their kids should be in one elementary, one middle, and one high school, so they didn't want that.  They, even though they aren't formally educated, intuitively they knew that couldn't be a good deal.  You know, it's disrupting their learning.  She knows these teachers.  Those teachers know her.  So we'll make the sacrifice.  Let her stay with her [maternal] grandparents [Florine White Hunt and William Hunt] because we believe it's that important.  And I was in the second grade when we moved.  And so I, I stayed in that school until I was in the sixth grade.  So essentially, at four--it's not like I didn't see my parents; I saw them every day.  But, but for four years I, in effect, lived with my grandparents so I could stay in that school.  So this whole sense of community and stability is, seems to be changing in our educational environment.  Our families move a lot, and not only poor families out of necessity, but even our middle class families.  You know, jobs change, all kinds of things happen.  Our families move a lot, and our families don't, aren't necessarily attached to one community.  Being attached to one community, I had individuals in the Mount Vernon area [Columbus, Ohio] and then individuals in the Brentnell area when I moved who knew me, who encouraged me, who talked to me all the time about the next step, who helped me improve my confidence levels al- all along the way.  And I think that that is an issue that some of our parents may not see as being as important as it really is.  Our kids thrive when they have a sense of belonging.  I belong here, people know me, I know them, and so then I can continue to progress, I can succeed.  But when every year or every couple of years it's a new set of friends, it's a new set of teachers, it's a new neighborhood, that, you know, that sense of instability manifests itself in the educational enterprise.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634670
Speaker 1: This is 19--it says '91 [1991] that you--they brought you into the morgue down here to become supervisor of principals.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did that come about now?
Speaker 2: In, actually, it was 1989, supervisor of principals, and 1991 was assistant superintendent.  I actually was asked by the superintendent [Ronald E. Etheridge].  It was not an interview process.  There were five of us.  He was going through a reorganization at that time.  And there were five of us that were actually selected, and I was one.  I was the one with the high school principal experience that, that he liked, that he wanted to be a part of the group.  And so at that time I had--I was given twenty-seven schools to supervise, elementary, middle, and high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, what did that en- you had--did you have to actually go to these schools and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --and inspect?
Speaker 2: That was my job, absolutely.  In fact, our office was not in the central office building.  All of us had office space that was actually in a school, one of the schools we were supervising.  And my job was twofold: one, to evaluate the principals, I was responsible for the evaluation of those twenty-seven principals; and two, to actually visit those schools and visit classrooms and talk with the principal about academic performance and what their plans were, what their goals were, how they were improving.  I was also there to troubleshoot for them if they had some issues that, that I needed to kick down some barriers that may have been prominent in the school district [Columbus Public Schools; Columbus City Schools].  My job was to troubleshoot for them also.
Speaker 1: Now did, were you surprised by what you found when you went out to these twenty-seven schools?
Speaker 2: In some of them, yes.  And, and I, I, some of them, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of teaching and learning that was gumming--going on.  Second area was I was also learning, because while I had had experience at the middle level and the high school level, knew those two levels very well, I did not have as much experience in the elementary level.  There were eighteen of those and, and, that I had.  And so I was in a huge learning mode, and I was very surprised at the, the capacity that elementary teachers had to have and the expanse of their responsibility: teaching all the subject areas, teaching students from a variety of different achievement levels, and really making that work.  So, I, I was surprised at some things that I found out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but on the whole, do you think that things were going better, or going worse than you thought?
Speaker 2: I think they were going probably a little bit better than, than I thought.  We had some issues, and, and we had some mechanisms in place to deal with those.  But I think they were going a little bit better than I expected.
Speaker 1: What did most of the principals--or was there a--I guess, can you generalize about what most of them were, needed help doing?
Speaker 2: I think it's the same thing they need help with doing today, and that is understanding how to be in charge but yet be collaborative.  I think that for many of them, they feel that that is--those are competing priorities.  And they don't have to be, because I, I think many think that being in charge is telling everybody what to do as opposed to assimilating information and then making decisions, having people feel that they are a part of the decision making.  Even when the decision doesn't go exactly as you expect it, I still had some input, I'm part of it.  I'm part of the team, and I'm building.  And, and I think that's, you know that's really a, a tough thing for people I think in any industry; it's not just around education.  How do I--how am my collaborative, yet I know that the buck stops here, and, and I've got to make tough decisions sometimes also.  I, I think that's very tough for people in education, because many of us go in because we are sensitive people.  We want to help people.  If you talk to, you know, ten educators in a row, all of them are gonna say well, I really went into this because I really want to make life better for--so--for other folks.  So unfortunately, inherently, that makes educators individuals who have a hard time, you know, drawing, sometimes drawing the line in the sand and say okay, enough.  You, you can't do this anymore, you can't--.  So it's, it's, it's a tough, it's a, it's a tough line to walk I think sometimes for educators.
Story_ID: 634671
Speaker 1: I guess it's in the early '90s [1990s] too that the, the whole charter school phenomenon is sort of popping up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about charter schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--you know, charter schools in Ohio came about--actually, in the mid-'90s [1990s] I had the opportunity to go to the Ohio Department of Education as assistant superintendent.  Charter schools were the--that policy was being formulated at that time.  And the conversation in Ohio was that charter schools were designed to really be competition for traditional public schools and to drive traditional public schools into higher performance.  Now, that's evolved over time.  Charter schools are public schools, and I think different states fund them in different ways, sponsor them in different ways.  I think there could be a role for charter schools if we could come together and collaborate around them.  And so, if we're gonna give a set of schools fewer restrictions than others for a specific purpose and a specific outcome, you know, I think it would be great if they were under the umbrella of the school district, working with the school district.  Having competing systems I'm not sure is getting us where it was intended to get us.  I'm not sure we're, we are serving our students as well as we should, because they are finding themselves just in this constantly moving in and out--we have students who are constantly moving between our system and charter schools and another school.  I mean and it's just, it's too much movement, it's too much mobility, and I think it's, it's gonna negatively impact the final outcomes for our students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think there's a role.  I think we need to just think about them in much different ways.  How can charter schools--I think this is the question that needs to be answered: how can charter schools help traditional systems improve?  And I think if we approached it that way and, and we were working together, I think we'd see a much different outcome.
Story_ID: 634672
Speaker 1: Now, in '93 [1993], you went back to Ohio State to work on your Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ohio University.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's Ohio University.  I'm sorry.  This is in Athens, Ohio, Ohio University.  And so you--are you working on an Ed.D. or a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Ph.D, okay.
Speaker 2: It was a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And so what was the, the, the su- I guess the di- the--
Speaker 2: Dissertation--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --topic?  Yeah, so, my dissertation topic was an examination of a communication between urban superintendents and urban teachers union presidents in twenty-one districts in Ohio.  So I really wanted to examine what was the nature of that communication and, and what was their perception of their communication and how they worked together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Teachers unions have come under a lot of fire (unclear).
Speaker 2: They have.  They have.
Speaker 1: And they've been vilified actually by a number of people.  And so, so what were your findings?
Speaker 2: That basically that that their perceptions were that--it's ju- really funny, that the teachers union presidents felt that they, that, that they were highly communicative with the superintendents, and the, and the superintendents believed that the teachers union presidents were not.  The converse was also true: the superintendents felt that they were highly communicative (laughter) with the teachers union presidents, and the teachers union presidents felt that, that they were not.  And, and I took that myself because I knew that I wanted to be a superintendent.  I knew I was probably going to be in Ohio, or at least that was my desire, to be a superintendent in the State of Ohio.  So I knew that there were strong unions here.  And, and I really wanted to use that as a basis for how I approached working not only with the teachers union presidents but with the, the, the unions of any of our organizations and, and school districts.  And it goes back to my general philosophy of collaborating.  Because while I know unions have a role, I know I have a role.  There's still a lot of gray area in there where we can come together on issues that are not around bread and butter issues that really impact teaching and learning.  And I, and I wanted to be able to do that effectively.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so could you--did you work on the Ph.D. while living in Columbus [Ohio], or did you--?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Driving to Athens, living in Columbus.  I did have to do a couple of summers of residency down in Athens.  But, but yes, I was living here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you, you finished your Ph.D. in 1999?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634673
Speaker 1: We have--go through a couple of administrations during this period of time, in terms on a national level.  George H.W. Bush [sic. President George Walker Bush] said he was the education president, so all our problems would--
Speaker 2: Be solved.
Speaker 1: --be solved, yes.  What was his administration able to do from your perspective?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I, I think that he--I'm trying to remember who was in the White House when Goals 2000 [Goals 2000: Educate America Act] was, was there.  And Goals 2000 I think was the begin- and this happened in the, the, the mid-'90s [1990s].  And this was the beginning I think of the standards movement.  And--
Speaker 1: This is Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], yeah, from--
Speaker 2: Was that Goals 2000?  Was that Clinton?
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992] to 2000 was when (unclear).
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Okay.  And so, and so that was, that was--and so what year was, was, H.W.?
Speaker 1: He came in in the 2000 election and you know, took office in 2001.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just in time for 9/11 [September 11, 2001].
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, that's right.  And so, we had started that standards movement under, under Clinton and then with, with President Bush we had No Child Left Behind [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001].  And, and while I think there are elements of No Child Left Behind that are exactly right, for example looking at each student group--I refuse to call student groups subgroups because that means somebody's lower than somebody else.  But looking at the achievement of every student group, I think he was absolutely right on that, where I think there was--where I know that there was a failing is testing every student every year.  And so that has really I think disrupted the teaching and learning process.  There certainly could have been a way--I, I am not anti-assessment, because I do think we need to know exactly where we are and if we are approving--improving and if we are, are making progress.  But there are different kinds of assessments, and you, you don't have to assess every student every year.  There are samplings of populations that can be done.  It's more expensive, but at some years there are portfolios that can be put together so that we can see the progression of student learning.  So I, again, I think his, his notion, the notion of knowing where student groups are and how they're performing, how African Americans are performing, Latinos, girls, boys, all of that, extremely important.  Testing every student every year has, is, is, I believe, driving some level of creativity right out of our system.  And we, and, and the United States is noted for creativity.  People came here to our universities from around the globe because of our creativity and what we have to offer.  We should be developing our own children at the K/12 level [kindergarten to twelfth grade] to be able to be successful in those kinds of environments too, and, and this constant testing is not getting us there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember when I was in school, and they gave us the California mental maturity test [California Test of Mental Maturity] so they can--one grade and then there'd be another two or three years before you got another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Got another one, yeah.
Speaker 1: --test.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I think there's--and, and again, you know, I, I think there, there are different ways to, to approach assessment.  And I think we have landed on the cheapest way.  This is the cheapest way to do that.  And I don't--we're not seeing any appreciable change in our systems.  And this--let me give you an example.  One of the provisions of No Child Left Behind was that by the year 2014, 100 percent of our students were to be literate in--there's to be 100 percent literacy in reading and mathematics.  One of the reasons the current administration, President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and his administration, are offering states the opportunity for waivers from that is because it is clear that 80 to 90 percent of the school districts in the country would not meet that target.  So what have we said?  I mean, what did we really do with all the millions of dollars that we've spent in assessments, in professional development, all the time that we spent in te- in testing?  What have we really accomplished with that?  And I would tell you not much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mike Fulwider [Michael Fulwider] will die that he knows that I said that on film (laughter).
Story_ID: 634674
Speaker 1: How would you do it?  I mean, I mean, if you had an i- if you could have control of it and, and everything that, you know, you know how would you--what would be your idea (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, first of all, I think we've got to look at systems change.  You know, I don't think that I would--I would start with the end in mind, what goals we wanted to achieve.  But I don't think that right after that then I would develop a set of assessments.  I would look at what does the system have to look like to produce these outcomes.  The fact of the matter--and when I say the system, I'm talking about the educational enterprise in the United States period.  The fact that we still are on an agrarian calendar when we are not farming, there's not eno- there's not one of my kids in Columbus City Schools who's gonna spend the summer in the fields picking corn; they're, they're not gonna do that.  So, the fact that we're on this agrarian calendar, and that's how we fund schools, and that's where we are, is a problem.  If we want to get these high level outcomes, you know, we need to look at Finland and, and other countries whose students are in school--I mean, I was in, in, in school maybe two hundred days a year or, or more.  And how do we--if that's, if that's--and, and what's the quality of what we're doing?  Should our students be working on portfolio assessments or research assignments that are--that go--that spread years, that as a high school student I know that I've got this research topic that I'm going to be doing.  When I walk in as a ninth grader, and that my education is based on or part of it is driven by this strand of research that, that I'm going to do?  There are different way--and so, and we can have assessments all along the way that can be validated.  It takes more time.  It's not instant.  It's not--and one administration's not gonna be able to say, "Look at what I did, and now all of our students are fixed."  That's not the way students learn.  That's not the way learning should take place.  It is cumulative; it is over time, and they should have the opportunity to demonstrate what they know beyond a paper and pencil assessment.  And when we think about the technology now, our kids are learning in, in such different ways.  The way they even take in information is much different than the way that we take in information.  So what are we really learning about them and what they know with these paper/pencil assessments?  And I would submit not much.
Story_ID: 634675
Speaker 1: Now here's an idea that's in the notes here, and I don't know what it really means.  But what is integration based on income?  What's that mean for schools?
Speaker 2: There, there's--I'm thinking of Montgomery County schools [Montgomery County Public Schools].  One of the things that that superintendent [Jerry D. Weast] really worked on over a number of years is, how do we make sure that our schools are not, as far as socioeconomics is concerned, doesn't have a large concentration of upper income kids or lower income kids in, in one school.  That, that his--and actually there are some studies that have show this.  I think Dr. Powell [HistoryMaker John Powell] at, at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] did some, some work on this for, at the Glenn school [John Glenn College of Public Affairs, Columbus, Ohio], that when there is socioeconomic integration of students, that students have a greater opportunity to be successful.  There's modeling going on, and so--and, and not just there's modeling for the, the kids that are from lower socioeconomic standards.  I mean there, there's, there are things that students from all ends of the spectrum can learn from each other, and so they tend to do better in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When there's not as much--and especially I'm sure it's, it's true, you know, it's, it's more difficult in a school where you have high concentrations of students from low socioeconomic strata, just because there are so many additional things that you have to do.  So if you have fewer of those students, you can still meet their needs, accelerate them, as well as meet the needs of the, the students who are not from that strata and, and, and move the school farther faster.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, some folks would look at that askance because it's like you're take it--it's just like integration, racial integration, you know, busing for racial integration.  You're taking me out of my neighborhood so that you can kind of, you know, have a false positive, and it's probably not a false positive, but that you can create this situation that's not naturally created.  So, no, it's not without its, its natural--its, its controversy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's, it's to try to make sure we're not a stratified--income stratified--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --society with people out of touch with where they live.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Everybody knows the--because here we are all working together.  And you know, we're learning together, working together, and I grow up in understanding that there are people who have all kinds of challenges.
Speaker 1: So it says this was launched in Raleigh [North Carolina] in 2000 and in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2002.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Are, are people doing that here in Columbus [Ohio] or--at all, or anywhere in Ohio that you know?
Speaker 2: We're, we're not doing it in Columbus.  The only other place that I'm aware of it is Montgomery County [Maryland], in, in the D.C. area [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 634676
Speaker 1: Tell us now, now in, in the mid-2000s at Columbus [Ohio] it says here that it was a sort of crisis in the schools [Columbus City Schools], revenue losses and that sort of thing.  Can you, can you speak to that?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I've been superintendent here in Columbus for, this is my eleventh year now in 2012.  And we have--we, we are partially funded by the state, partially funded by lo- and largely funded by local property taxes.  And when the state revenue turns down, that certainly has an, an impact on us also.  And so we had to engage in, in some pretty significant budget cuts.  And what--and really we were, we were cutting our--we were containing our budget growth is what we did.  So, we just didn't let our budget just naturally grow with, with inflation.  And so that meant we had to do some layoffs.  We had to look at some programmatic changes and, and all of that kind of thing.  And in fact, since 2008, we've reduced our budget growth by about $130 million.  We've still been able to make progress, but I'm still concerned that we don't have a final solution to school funding in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Do you think that we were on the way to that at one point, or?
Speaker 2: I think that, you know, I think that every administration, every governor's administration has their ideas on solving school funding.  Governor Strickland [Ted Strickland], you know, had his evidence based model that he wanted to fund.  He thought these are the things, these are the elements that make a successful school, a school successful.  We need to fund those things.  And, and he was willing to work--what he stated was he was willing to work with the legislature to find the funds to, to do that.  Governor Kasich [John Kasich] sees that differently, believes that schools should have the flexibility to fund the programs that they believe are effective.  He's strengthening the accountability system and reducing revenue to the schools and saying that, you know, you have to--this is what we've got.  This is, this is, you know, what you need to--understanding this is the revenue that you will get, and these are the outcomes we expect.  Now, what I'll give you is the flexibility to get there.  So, you know, both approaches have some merit.  But I think we still haven't landed on the approach that's going to get us the outcomes that we need.
Story_ID: 634677
Speaker 1: Now 2001, you were named the school superintendent here in Columbus [of Columbus Public Schools; Columbus City Schools].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what position did you hold just prior to that, and how did, how did all that take place?
Speaker 2: So I was deputy superintendent for operations at that time.  I had one programmatic area that the superintendent also wanted me to keep on, keep under my belt, one academic programmatic area.  And what happened was the, the, our prior superintendent, Dr. Smith [Rosa A. Smith], decided to retire from the superintendency and go to work for a foundation [Schott Foundation for Public Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so I applied for a position, threw my hat in the ring, and was one of the--I can't remember now if it was three or five finalists.  And the board [Columbus Board of Education] selected me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now this is--how is, how are the schools basically run in Columbus [Ohio]?  I mean, I know in Chicago [Illinois] they, the school board [Chicago Board of Education] appointed by the mayor at one time.  And the, the mayor just took over the schools at a certain point.  But what, what happens here in, you know, Columbus?
Speaker 2: In Columbus, we, we have a independent board of education that is seven members who are elected at large.  So they're not elected by wards or, or anything like that, but they are elected at-large, and they, they are elected in odd years.  So, four will be elected during one odd year campaign, and three in, in another odd year campaign.  Their responsibility is to select and hire the superintendent, two direct reports in Ohio statutorily; the superintendent and the treasurer report directly to the board of education.  And so, those seven individuals select the superintendent.  And typically, in Columbus that comes with community input.  I mean they don't do it in a vacuum, and I'm sure that most districts don't do that either.  But they select the superintendent, and then they're responsible for extending the contract to the superintendent, evaluating and then extending the contract.

Speaker 1: And you've been superintendent now for eleven years, which is, after coming from Chicago [Illinois], this seems like a long time to me.  Our superintendents [of Chicago Public Schools] are like, typically last two or three years, and then they--and they're usually from some other place, bring them in, and then they leave.  Now, how, how do you account for your longevity here, or is that not atypical of Columbus [Columbus City Schools]?
Speaker 2: Columbus had some years, I think when I was growing up, when superintendents stayed for a long time.  And then there were the years in the '80s [1980s], '90s [1990s], and early 2000s where they, it was more like the typical stay of the urban superintendent; it was, it was very short.  And so I, actually when I got this job, I thought, you know, based on past history, if I could stay for five years, we would have gotten the superin- the district on a firm foundation, and then I would move on.  I never had it in my mind that I would be superintendent this long.  And I, I think--I hope that the community will see after I'm gone that stability really does, does help, because I think we've been able to make some good progress.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What would be the highlights of your term as superintendent during--what I'm, what I'm saying, I'm not just saying--I'm saying this is a boom time for, for Columbus as a city.  The mayor's [HistoryMaker Michael B. Coleman] been in office at thirteen years.
Speaker 2: He has.
Speaker 1: And people see this city as a city that's growing.
Speaker 2: So, for me, high- you know, highlights are always gonna be focused on what my base responsibility is, and that's students' academic learning.  And, and we're trying to graduate our students who are career and college ready.  So let me name a few things that, that are highlights for me.  When, when I got the job originally we were in the lowest academic rating on the state report card.  And so I just thought we've got to give folks some hope that this district can move forward.  So, we developed a plan to move from academic emergency to academic watch, and we did that.  And then we moved up another rung on the level to--report card to continuous improvement.  And at this point, we're trying to move ourselves to effective, because we think that's very important.  The other thing that we did is we identified graduation rate as a key goal for all of us, from the kindergarten teacher to the advanced placement calculus teacher, and so, and everybody in the community.  Our graduation rate was 54 percent when I started.  Under the current calculation, our graduation rate for the class of 2011 was 85.1 percent.  And we were very, very pleased with that.  We started tracking the scholarship grant and aid that our students get, what the, each graduating class gets.  So, in 2001, or--I believe it was like $22 million.  We had a high of $60 million in 2010.  Last year it was $47 million.  But you can see that we're graduating more of our students.  We're getting more scholarship grant and aid.  Our kids are, are, are more qualified to do that.  And then the last thing that I would say is an absolute highlight for me is that we have many organizations in the community that we have developed partnerships with--for our students and for our families, and, and they keep coming.  And these partnerships were really working hard to align them to make sure that they are helping us to make sure that our kids, when they do graduate, are career and college ready, that they're ready to go to the next level.  We have not had the community turn us down on, on many things.  We've passed every bond issue and every levy that we put on the ballot since I've been superintendent.  We passed it.  We've passed it on the, on the first time, knock on wood.  We'll likely have another one on the ballot in 2012.  We've kept our promises to the community, and I think that's one of the reasons that they continue to support us.  That's a highlight.  And then I'll, I'll tell you just a personal professional highlight has been the opportunity to bring the president of the United States to one of our schools.  For our students, our custodians, everybody who was helping to get ready for that, that was an absolute highlight.  And I would say it whether--and, and it is important to me that it is [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama, Obama because he is the first African American president that--in the United States.  But regardless of who that would have been, we would have been excited to entertain the president of the United States and our students having that exposure.  Our, our staff was simply thrilled, and our kids were, who had the opportunity to, to be there, absolutely were, were thrilled to have that opportunity.

Speaker 1: He went to Fort Hayes [Fort Hayes Arts and Academic High School, Columbus, Ohio] as--I guess I have to ask this question.  I probably, I don't know, I probably shouldn't, but.  Is Fort Hayes considered the jewel in the crown of the--?
Speaker 2: It's one of the jewels in the crowns.  (Laughter) We, we, we have several more.  But the Obama administration [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] chose Fort Hayes.  But one of the reasons they chose, obviously it's a high performing school.  But the other reason they chose is because he wanted to talk about construction and school construction, and we've done some great renovations over there.  And in fact, Fort Hayes at one time was, was, was controlled by the [U.S.] Army and really owned by the government.  And they've worked with us over time to bequeath that land to us, so now we have all of the acreage.  So it was the renovations that we've done there that he wanted to highlight, and the fact that it was a former Army constellation, and that we've had that partnership, and the fact that it's a high performing school, and it is one of the jewels in Columbus City Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 634680
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about now--you visited Ghana in 2004--
Speaker 2: I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) went to six cities and went to the slave castles and to the, the holy sites.  And so, so what--tell us about that visit and how that took place.
Speaker 2: I, I was driven to do it in 2004 because in 2002 my husband [Stanley Harris] and my son [Wade Harris] and I took that trip.  And I told my husband at that time, "I'm bringing students back."  We're gonna have an opportunity to bring students back.  And we have a school, the Columbus Africentric school [Columbus Africentric Early College, Columbus, Ohio].  I thought that was the perfect place to, for, for us to have students who would have this opportunity, and we hoped to do that again.  It was a very moving experience when it was just my husband and my son and I to see a place where African American ancestors came from.  I had never set foot in Africa before 2002.  To take students back and to watch their reaction and to hear them say I'll never be the same again.  I--we took students to Af- Africa, we took students to Africa who had never been on an airplane before.  I mean, so these are students who had not had a lot of exposure to things outside of their neighborhood and certainly outside of their city before taking that very impressive trip.  And they had to go through a rite of passage, learning things before they went, or they would not have had the opportunity for the trip.  So experiencing that learning with them was probably even more powerful than having the first visit with my husband and my son a few years before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any special consultants in the city to help you with that kind of (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did and I'm, and I've got an--I'm having trouble thinking of names right now.  But we did have special consultants who worked with us, trained our students, worked with them all along the way, got them ready, got their parents ready.  We did have some chaperones who went with us.  Obviously not all the children's parents went, but we wanted the, the parents, all of the parents, to understand what their children were going to experience so that they could support them when they came back in, in, in their learning.  The students were able to visit the University of Ghana [Accra, Ghana] and be on that campus, all of the slave dungeons, the Cape Coast [Cape Coast Castle, Cape Coast, Ghana], and we were able to do that, and Accra [Ghana], Kumasi [Ghana].  We were able to--our students actually helped to paint a school and did some community service while they were, were there.  We took school supplies to students while we were there.  It was, really it was, it was both a learning and a community service to or for our students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a continuing relationship with Ghana at the present time?
Speaker 2: There, there are some relationships that the Africentric school has, not all of the ones that we connected.  We are going to be trying to reconnect, because we think that's a, a very important thing to do.
Story_ID: 634681
Speaker 1: Do you think that the high school graduation rate here will reach 90 percent soon (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It's gonna reach 90 percent.  Quite unfortunately, the, the state has re- it has a new formula for the graduation rate.  And they are no longer allowing us to count students who might be--what we were able to do is to count students who should have graduated in previous years, regardless of how far back that previous year was.  And we won't be able to do that again.  So, while we might not reach the 90 percent graduation rate exactly on the time schedule that we intended, we will reach the grad- 90 percent graduation rate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I read here that in 2010, twelve Columbus City Schools' high schools are ranked among the nation's best by--ranked, ranked by U.S. News and World Report.
Speaker 2: We were very proud of that.  And, and that best is based on I think some really smart thinking.  It's based on progress.  It's based on student poverty and the percent of our students who are in an advanced placement courses and upper level courses.  And they did their own independent analysis of our data and said that twelve of our schools were ranked among the best students who are--schools that are educating high poverty kids.  I was very proud of that, very proud of our schools.
Story_ID: 634682
Speaker 1: What are some of the new initiatives that you're launching here at Columbus City Schools?
Speaker 2: Some, some of the things that we have done and, and then some of the things that we're, we're doing going forward, we were one of the first schools--we were the first high school--we had the first high school in Franklin County [Ohio] that had a, launched an International Baccalaureate program.  That's Columbus Alternative High School [Columbus, Ohio].  And I think we have graduated either three or four classes of students with this IB diploma, which gives our students access to universities globally.  And so there are some universities across the globe who would be interested--not just in the United States, but across the globe--interested in our students because they've taken this very, very rigorous curriculum.  We have other schools at lower levels who are interested in pursuing the IB curriculum also, International Baccalaureate curriculum.  We had partnerships with virtually every college and university in this region and some outside of the region, including--well, the ones in the region would include Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], Columbus State [Columbus State Community College, Columbus, Ohio], Capital [Capital University, Columbus, Ohio], Ohio Dominican [Ohio Dominican University, Columbus, Ohio]; all of those.  But we also have relationships with colleges and universities outside of the region, like Ohio University [Athens, Ohio], Miami [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio], Ashland [Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio].  And what this allows us to do is give our students some additional opportunities for early college learning.  We have, for example, partnership with DeVry [DeVry University, Ohio] where we have students who, at the end of their tenth grade, if they qualify, they can actually take their last remaining two years of, of colle- of high school education on DeVry's campus.  Simultaneously, their fulfilling the requirements for an associate's degree while finishing their high school diploma.  So, in June, we have about twenty-five students who will get their high school diploma and an associate's degree from DeVry.  And so we, we think that's very powerful.  We have several other partnerships like that, where our students are spending their senior year on college campuses, and they're earning, they're amassing a year's worth of, of college credit in our senior and sophomore program [Seniors to Sophomores].  And, and we are extremely proud of that.  We have a middle school redesign, where we have redesigned our middle schools so that our, our students can be more successful.  And we have a very strong focus on reading and math literacy across the curriculum in Columbus City Schools.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a question I--the science, you know, the STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Thank you.  STEM, STEM is extremely important to us.  We have a STEM, an entire STEM feeder, as we call it, elementary, middle, and high schools in a feeder pattern that are working on STEM.  The Linden-McKinley feeder [Linden-McKinley STEM Academy, Columbus, Ohio] is a STEM feeder, and they're making great progress.  We also are starting a STEM feeder with the West High School [Columbus, Ohio]--schools, that, that feed into West.  And then our goal is to have one STEM feeder in every region.  We also have STEM clubs.  And one of the strongest ones we have is Northland High School [Columbus, Ohio].  In fact, we have the largest pre-collegiate STEM program.  We believe--we've been told by the, by NSBE, the National Society of Black Engineers, that we have the largest pre-collegiate STEM program in the United States.  And so, Northland High School, for example, just won three national recognitions at a STEM competition that we are very--every year they bring us back national recognitions.  And this is an after school STEM club that is, is very large.  They probably have fifty to sixty kids that are part of this club.  And these students compete nationally, and, and they do very, very well.

Speaker 1: I know that several of the Columbus schools [Columbus City Schools] participated in The HistoryMakers back to school program [Back to School With The HistoryMakers].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I thought I'd ask about it.  It's not even on the outline.  But I did a lot of calling about that.  So, what was the assessment of that?  Now, now how did it work out?
Speaker 2: Our schools love The HistoryMakers.  Those that participated loved The HistoryMakers program, loved the visitors that they had.  Our students were very, very engaged with the individuals who came in.  And I know that we have some of our teachers that have become engaged with the website and are, you know, using some of, of those materials.  We will do it again next fall and hope to make it bigger and better.  It's important for our students to, to hear the stories of individuals who are, by anybody's standards, are extremely successful and hear what their, what their trajectory has been.  And I think our students are surprised to hear folks, to hear somebody like Marty Nesbitt [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt], who is extremely successful and is a friend of the president of the United States [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], talk about his humble beginnings right here in Columbus, Ohio, and what his mother [Margaret Latham Nesbitt] made him do, and what going to school was like, and, and why they should study, and why they should stay focused.  These are messages that we give our students every day, but I think hearing them from individuals who are not their teachers every day that they expect to, to say that really does have an impact, and our kids respond.  And Mr. Nesbitt was with--not with one of our high schools, but with--and not with one of our specialty magnet schools, but he was with one of our traditional middle schools.  The students--and I was there with him--the students hung on his every word.  And they had very good probing questions to ask him.  And what it was clear that they realizing was hey, this guy is just like me, and there's really no reason that I can't be the next Marty Nesbitt.
Story_ID: 634684
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I, I am concerned about our families.  I am sitting here today not only because of my strong family unit, and I had a very strong extended unit, but because of families also that lived in my neighborhood who were as concerned about me as, as they were their own children.  Families that were in my church [Woodland Christian Church, Columbus, Ohio] who were cheering me all along the way, who, when I got into Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana], you would have thought they got into Notre Dame, because that was their success too.  And I, I believe the foundation of our race is, and what makes us strong--it's really true for anybody, but I can only talk about what I know best, and what I know best is, is black people, 'cause I'm black.  And, and I believe that the foundation that holds our race together is the family.  And if our families continue to dissipate like they are and not have as their focal point raising their children and staying focused and doing whatever it takes, then that frightens me.  We can be and do anything when we have a strong family.  I'm an example.  Your family doesn't have to be highly educated, but they do have to care about what happens, and they do have to have some standards, and set some morals for you, and hold you to a standard, and have high expectations for you, and to the best of their ability, get you in circumstances that are gonna be positive for you.  What I see is not enough of that happening in our community, or, or maybe I should say less and less of that happening in our community.  So, we can turn that family situation around.  If we could come through slavery, that horrible atrocity, slavery, and still hold ourselves together, if we could come through black codes and come through Jim Crow and all of that and still stand strong, if we could come through fire hoses and, and beatings and lynchings and still strong--stand strong as a family, we can get through these economic issues, we can get through these drug issues and some of these other issues and bring our families back together.  My, my greatest hope and dream is that we will begin to refocus on the family, because out of that family we're, we're gonna have success.
Story_ID: 634685
Speaker 1: We always ask this question too: when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I'd say the graduation rate and, and partnership in Columbus City Schools.  And I guess the overarching one also would be that every kid every day, regardless of their zip code, regardless of their color, regardless of what their family situation is, getting our staff--I think we're turning a corner where our staff believes that each student--it's our responsibility for each student every day, to really push them so that they can graduate and they can be college and career ready.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there any major regret or anything that you wish you had have done or could go back and change?
Speaker 2: I don't think there's a major regret.  I just wish that--I mean every year I've learned something new, and I wish that I knew everything that I know now (laughter) that first year that I walked into the superintendency; we would be so much farther along.  So I don't, I don't even regret some of the, the mistakes that we've made because I think we've learned from them, and I think we're stronger for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634686
Speaker 1: One thing I didn't ask about that's popped into my head now is the, is modern technology.  And how, how do you manage to stay ahead of that as new devices are created all the time and, and the way that you were saying children learn or students learn is, is modified to all the new things they come in contact with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we are, we're very blessed in this community [Columbus, Ohio] that, that our community allowed us to pass a bond issue and an operating levy in 2008.  And part of the bond issue allowed us to upgrade our technology, our computer technology in our schools.  And what we--the, the technology we went to will allow us to continue to upgrade without a great infusion of additional cash.  And so we're, we're very pleased with that.  We are struggling, I think with everybody else, to figure out how to use these handheld devices that our students have and how to make really good use of those for our students.  And we're, we're, we're grateful for the partnerships that we have with the library [Columbus Metropolitan Library] and other public institutions that allow our students who may not have technology in their homes to use that technology in, in a really major and, and powerful way.  So, we are, we are investing.  We'll continue to invest in new technologies.  Right now we're looking at the iPad and how we might use those at the lower grades to help accelerate some learning with, with our students.  And we'll, we'll capitalize on the partnerships we have to help fund some of those also.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like we live in an age now where kids want to text each other and--
Speaker 2: Rather than talk.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So it's a--I don't know.  It's a--
Speaker 2: Well, we, we have speaking, listening, and reading and, and as--speaking and, and writing, and listening as part of our literacy strategy too.  So, it will not be unusual for you to walk into Columbus City Schools classrooms and see our, our students presenting, because we don't want them to lose the ability to communicate verbally.  And it is a bother, I mean you will find kids sitting on the same sofa texting each other as opposed to talking to each other.  So we at least want to make sure that they have the experiences so that they understand how important this verbal communication continues to be.  That's not going away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 634687
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Now, you, you have children, and what, what do they do?
Speaker 2: I, I am, I am married to my high school sweetheart [Stanley Harris].  We met in high s- well, actually met in junior high [Linmoor Junior High School; Linmoor Middle School, Columbus, Ohio].  We have been, we will have been married thirty-five years in June, 2012.  We have one son.  And Wade [Wade Harris] and his beautiful wife and my perfect grandchildren, grandsons, Nathan [Nathan Harris (ph.)] and Noah [Noah Harris (ph.)], actually live in New Jersey.  My son is a, is a graduate of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He got his M.B.A. at, at Babson College [Babson Park, Massachusetts] and worked in corporate for about five years and then decided to leave corporate, and he started his own radio show ['Wade-O Radio Show'].  And so he's, he's doing that on the East Coast.  And, and we're extremely proud of him.  He is, he is really doing a nice job.  My daughter in law is the perfect daughter in law also.  I'm also very fortunate that my parents [Thelma Hunt Thomas and William Thomas, Sr.] are still living.  They are, they will be eighty-six in July.  And they're healthy, and I'm very, very grateful for that.  And my brother [William Thomas, Jr.] lives in California where he's pasturing a church and will receive his Ph.D. in May, 2012 here, so we're, we're very proud of him too.  So, I have a, I have a great family that I--that keeps me supported as I do this very difficult work.
Story_ID: 634688
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you about that you think we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: You know, I probably should have talked about our building program, and I didn't.  We have this building program that, that I probably need to talk about, Capital Improvements, where we've, you know, built and renovated thirty-five schools in Columbus [Ohio].  And, and our hope is that we will be able to convince the voters that we should continue this process, and it's been great.  When we started our first new school in 2002, opened our first new school in 2004, we hadn't built a new school in, in twenty-six years or so.  And so we've been able to upgrade the technology, modernize the schools, and prepare them even for year round use, and we're very pleased with that.
Story_ID: 634689
Speaker 1: Now I noticed one thing that I neglected to talk, talk about.  But when I even was sitting out here waiting for us to have the opportunity to do this interview, I was noticing the artwork on the walls.  And I know the arts are a big part of Columbus public schools [Columbus City Schools], and the City of Columbus [Ohio] seems to be focused on arts.
Speaker 2: We, we are very proud in, in Columbus City Schools that we have not cut our arts programs.  Even with all this cutting of budgets that we've done and, and containing our budget growth, we still have a full complement of arts programs in our school district at every level: elementary, middle, and high.  And in fact, just recently, some of our young artists will have their artwork featured in the public transportation buses here in, in Columbus.  So, our students are a part of the arts.  It's not just our arts high school [Arts and College Preparatory Academy, Columbus, Ohio].  We have arts at every level in every school, whether they're--they're a traditional school or a specialty school.  And it's not just the visual arts; we have the performing arts also.  And, and our families, I think, some of our families stay with us because we have these strong arts programs in our school.

Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a person who was focused on other people; that would put other people, and especially kids, their interests before my own.  And hopefully they'll be able to look back and see that I did a few things that would help children and families to be successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.  It's my pleasure.
Speaker 1: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you.
