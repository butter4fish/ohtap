Story_ID: 639363
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your, your mother, what is her full name?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Martha Williams Lewis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she's still alive.  And, and she's my mom (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: Sawyerville, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And do you know her date of birth?
Speaker 2: (Background noise) No (laughter).  I think she was born in 1925.  So and her birthday would be in January, which is odd but my mom doesn't celebrate birthdays so, because she doesn't, that's why I don't remember her birthday.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background and her family?
Speaker 2: My mom's an only child.  She had a half-sister.  She was raised by her aunt in, in Sawyerville which is kind of a rural community in, in the southern half of Alabama.  She moved to Birmingham [Alabama] as a young girl to continue her education in the Birmingham public school system, that is where she met my father [Ward Lewis, Jr.], and, and then after that they moved away from Alabama.  So she was raised as a single child, but raised by her auntie.  And her aunt was really more of a mother like figure for her 'cause her mom was--was not able to raise her.
Speaker 1: Do you recall her telling you any like family stories when you were young?
Speaker 2: No, because mom was an only child.  I think her childhood was a little bit more difficult being raised by an aunt as opposed to being raised by her natural mom, kind of put her in a little bit different position.  So, it was, it was a loving relationship with she and her aunt, but, but her aunt also had her own family.  So she raised her two kids and my mom at the same time, and that, you know, created a little bit of competition if you will so.  I think my mom's childhood was one that was, was--it was a good childhood, but it wasn't textbook, and as a result, she doesn't talk about it a lot.  But she doesn't talk about it with pain, it's just, it's not the first thing out of her mouth.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about your grandparents on her side of the family?
Speaker 2: I do.  Her grandparents?  My grandparents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your grandparents.
Speaker 2: My grandparents, okay.
Speaker 1: Well, her parents.
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I knew both of my mom's parents.  Her father, Robert Williams, in fact my brother has his middle name.  And my grandmother, my mother's mom, Beatrice McGinister [Beatrice McGinister Williams] was her name.  And I knew my grandmother better than I knew my grandfather, 'cause we tended to spend more time with my grandmother, my maternal grandmother.  She also came to live with us for a period of time.  Once she got a little older, she moved in with my mom.  And so I got to know my grandmother pretty well.  In fact she was--she was buried in, in the Detroit [Michigan] area which is where I'm from.  My grandfather and my grandmother were separated.  My grandfather remarried, so he continued to live in, in Alabama and we would go and visit him whenever we were down in the South.  So usually on average about once every two to three years we'd get a chance to see him.  And so I had a positive relationship with my grandparents on my mother's side, just got to see my grandmother more than I got to see my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Did they ever tell you any stories about going back beyond them, which would be your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: They did Tom [Thomas Jefferson], but the problem was I was little and I didn't listen very well.  My sister listened a lot better and so even today if I wanna know stories about beyond my grandparents, I usually have to re- either ask my mother or ask my sister.  But they would talk about more the time when they were coming since this was the Deep South.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There is, their recollections around growing up were more painful because it was just the, the times that they lived in, and particularly in southern Alabama it was a different experience.  So I do know that they talked about, you know, coming away from the farm getting more into the urban areas.  That was a better life then being on the farm, but, but I didn't retain as much of it as I might like to have.
Speaker 1: Do you know whether or not your great-grandparents had lived through slavery?
Speaker 2: They did.  I can't tell you exactly how much slavery they lived through, but I know that they were, they were there in Alabama during the slavery period.  And what they did and exactly what role they played in the places they grew up, I, I can't tell you that.
Story_ID: 639364
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father, his name, his date of birth if you know.
Speaker 2: My father, his name is Ward Lewis, Jr.  He was born in September of 1923.  He was born in Newbern, Alabama which is a small town about fifty miles south and, south and east of Tuscaloosa [Alabama].  And he was raised on a farm.  He was one of thirteen children.  He's the, he's the oldest living child because he had an older brother who died in childhood, so he was the oldest of, of thirteen.  And the farm that he was raised on was owned by my granddad [Ward Lewis, Sr.] and, and so he was a farmer.
Speaker 1: Does your family still own any land in Alabama?
Speaker 2: They do.  The farm that--not the farm that my dad was raised on because they ultimately moved from that farm to a different location, it's still in the family.  And in fact my aunt lives on the property in the house that was built by my granddad.
Story_ID: 639365
Speaker 1: What are some of your memories of your father [Ward Lewis, Jr.] while, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well my dad, I was fortunate in that I was raised in a two parent family.  We didn't have much money at all, but it really didn't seem that way until I got older and then I realized I was poor.  But my dad was always around.  So he was always a figure in my life.  He was always working 'cause with--I come from a large family and it was really important that he had a couple jobs in order to make enough money to feed and clothe us all.  So, my recollections of my father were more, he would kind of come in between jobs; he usually would have two jobs.  And he would come in and eat or he would sleep and then he would go to his other job.  And so we would see him kind of as this passing figure, except on the days he didn't work.  So if he was--Sundays he would typically not work.  And then we might do something together as a family, whether it be, you know, cooking in the backyard or maybe going for a ride or just kind of being around one another.  But typically he was like a, a Sunday dad because he was working the other six days of the week.  Some days on Sundays he worked too.
Speaker 1: What kind of work did he do?
Speaker 2: Well he, like many people who immigrated from the South, he worked in the auto companies when he first came to, to the Detroit [Michigan] area.  And in fact he had two jobs, it was interesting.  He took a job at a company called DeSoto Motor Company and there was an old DeSoto car, one of the many brands that have gone off into the sunset.  And he also worked for Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan].  So he worked for Chrysler and he worked for DeSoto.  Well DeSoto paid like twenty cents more an hour than Chrysler and trying to work the two jobs was killing him because he was just working, you know, pretty much like two ten hour, ten hour shifts and he knew he couldn't do that.  So he had to make a decision as to which job to quit, and he chose to stay with DeSoto because they paid twenty cents more an hour than Chrysler.  And then DeSoto subsequently went out of business.  So from an employment perspective that was the last of the stable jobs.  And then after that, because of the recession in the auto industry that occurred in the '50s [1950s] he lost his job in DeSoto, couldn't get another job and so then he, then he did a variety of things.  He worked, you know, as a mechanic, he worked as a, as a, as a junk man, where you go in alleys and pick up junk material and sell it.  He, he did anything he could until he finally got a job as a custodian part time and then that's what he ultimately retired from was as a school custodian.
Speaker 1: Let me go back a second, what kind of work did your mother [Martha Williams Lewis] do?
Speaker 2: She didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With eight kids it was usually a kid on the way or, you know, a kid in the house, and there was no such thing as daycare back in that time.  So if you had a child you either had the older children watch the child or you were a full time mom.  My dad was pretty traditional coming from Alabama, and he really did not want my--want mom to work.  She did a little domestic work for a small period of time, but by and large she was a homemaker, and, and was really a rock in our house because she was always there for us.
Story_ID: 639366
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about your father's parents?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my, my father's parents were--as my, my mom's parents [Beatrice McGinister Williams and Robert Williams] divorced, my father's parents were together until, until they passed away.  My father--my grandfather, his name was Ward Lewis, Ward Lewis, Sr.  But he actually--his original name was Tinker.  And he actually changed his name from Tinker to Lewis.  And I don't know exactly why, but I understand there was a rift in the family of some sort.  My grandfather just said he didn't wanna be a Tinker anymore, so he became a Lewis which is why I'm a Lewis.  But he was, he was born in 1900, and he was born in Alabama, but I can't tell you where, but it wasn't far from Newbern [Alabama] because I know he didn't stray far from where he was originally born.  So he was born in 1900 and he died in 1980.  And my grandmother, her maiden name was Bryant [Velma Bryant Lewis], she was a Bryant.  And I don't know where grandma was born other than it was in Alabama, and it probably wasn't far from Newbern.  And she died after my grandfather died, she probably died in 1985 [sic. 1988].  But they were together until death.  And as I said, they gave rise to thirteen offspring and a host of nieces and nephews including me.
Speaker 1: Now do you know how your father--your grandfather came up with the name Lewis?
Speaker 2: I'd have to ask my sister.  It's like if I had a lifeline I'd use one now to call my sister or my mom [Martha Williams Lewis].  But I do believe that one of his relatives [Lewis's paternal great-grandfather, John Lewis] was named Lewis, and so he chose to take Lewis because either an uncle or an aunt was named Lewis and so he decided that that would be the name he would take as opposed to Tinker.  Maybe also he didn't like the baseball combination Tinker to Chance, I don't know.  But he chose the name Lewis and that was our family name from that point forward.
Speaker 1: Now you said he had thirteen siblings?
Speaker 2: My father [Ward Lewis, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Your father (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father had twelve siblings, thirteen including him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know their names or dates of birth or--?
Speaker 2: I know their names.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know their dates of birth.  And--but I did have a relationship with all my aunts and uncles, some more than others on my father's side, obviously my mom only had a stepsister and I didn't know her very well.  But my father's family I knew well because we would get together for reunions and that type of thing.  And since my dad was the first born son and we were the oldest nieces and nephews, we kind of had a chance to interact with that part of the family more.
Speaker 1: Can you give us their names?
Speaker 2: I can try.  Uville [Uville Lewis], Louvenia [Louvenia Lewis Renshaw], Cloe Ann [Cloe Lewis Dixon], I'm trying to go in order, who am I forgetting?  Then Douglas [ph.], Silas [Silas Lewis], Connie [Connie Lewis], Benjamin [ph.], Terr--not, Terr, Velma Mae [sic. Vera Lewis Grant], Thomasina [ph.], Silas, John [ph.] if I didn't say John, Benjamin if I didn't say Benjamin, I lost count 'cause I got out of order.  I think I--I know who I forgot, there was--if I didn't say Ann--I should say Cloe Ann, then there's Esther [ph.].  So if somebody's counting, check me on my math.  I think I got all my uncles and aunts in, but I could've missed them 'cause I didn't go in order 'cause I can't remember their order all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think that's--you got them all, so you had Silas twice.
Speaker 2: I did have Silas twice?
Speaker 1: So that--that was still twelve.
Speaker 2: Okay, good.  Thank God my mom was an only child--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) so I didn't have to remember that side of the family too.
Story_ID: 639367
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of your earliest childhood memories?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--my sister [Lolita Lewis Ransom] is five years older than I am.  And well I don't remember it because I was a baby.  My sister said that everybody was overjoyed because I was the first born boy and because there had been such a gap, my mom [Martha Williams Lewis] being an only child, they thought that she was going to be an only child.  So my sister wasn't very happy about it because it took away her only child status, but the rest of the family was very pleased that there was a boy child to carry on the name.  And so I remember a very warm relationship with my relatives.  So any immediate relatives we had in the area, as a--from my earliest memories, it was always a positive experience to go and visit them, interact with them.  This was before the days of hotels and motels.  When you went to visit, you went to stay with relatives--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so I always remember being very well received wherever we would go, in part because the family was happy that there were now boys in the family.  So that was a, that was a good thing, I do remember that.  I do remember, you know, having vacations be focused around visiting relatives, so that was a mainstay.  There was no Disneyland [Anaheim, California], there--or there was a Disneyland but it wasn't available for us to go and partake of it.  There's no going to Niagara Falls or anything like that.  We would go visit Uncle So and So or cousin So and So, or Aunt So and So.  We'd go back down to the farm or we'd go to St. Louis [Missouri] or Cincinnati [Ohio] or we'd come to Chicago [Illinois] to visit relatives, and that was always the high point.  And it was always a real positive experience to go and visit relatives, and also in turn to receive relatives.  When relatives would come to town.  I remember that was always a time when you kind of really scrubbed the house up and get it all cleaned up.  And you would typically have to give up your sleeping quarters because there wasn't a lot of room and the relatives would get whatever the best sleeping arrangement was.  So my earliest memories around, you know, kind of growing up were around family and around relationships with relatives as a positive part of my life.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite aunt or uncle?
Speaker 2: I did.  My Aunt Louvenia [Lewis' paternal aunt, Louvenia Lewis Renshaw] who--I don't think I put Louven- did I say Louvenia? I did not say Louvenia. That's one I missed.  So my Aunt Louvenia was my favorite aunt.  Because Aunt Louvenia would encourage education. That was what she talked about all the time.  She was a nurse and she and her husband Alvin [Alvin Renshaw] lived here in--in Chicago.  And from the time I was--my earliest recollections, she would be very, very supportive of me, very, very supportive of anything that had to do with education.  If we graduated from kindergarten, she'd send a little note and said, you know, "Way to go. Keep up the good work."  So Aunt Louvenia was always very special and she did it in a real quiet way.  And she was very supportive of our family so.  And I think I took a special shine to her.  So, Aunt Louvenia is the one who stands out in my mind.  In terms of uncles, you know, I, I've got a great set of uncles, but I think the one that I probably admire the most because of his quiet way of doing things is my Uncle John [ph.].  My Uncle John lives in Cincinnati.  And the thing about Uncle John that always impresses me is no matter what we have as a family, if you're having, again a small event whether it be graduation related or some special occasion in your life and you ask Uncle John to come and be there with you, Uncle John's there and he brings his family and he's always there to celebrate whatever family matter there might be.  And so I admire Uncle John's leadership if you will in that regard so much.  And I've always kind of admired how he's always been there to support his family that I would say that, you know, on that basis he's the uncle that I admire the most and one who I always look to as a, as a go to uncle if you will.
Story_ID: 639368
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: I have seven siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was their gender breakdown?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What was their male and female breakdown?
Speaker 2: It's, it's four and four, four boys and four girls including me.
Speaker 1: Could you give us their names in chronological order?
Speaker 2: I can do that.  So my oldest sister, her name is Lolita [Lolita Lewis Ransom] and so she's the oldest, so she's five years older than I am.  Then my next sister is Marva [Marva Lewis] and Marva is two years younger than I.  My sister behind her is Brenda [Brenda Lewis Morris] and Brenda comes two years younger than Marva.  Next my brother Timothy [Timothy Lewis], there's usually a two or five year window between our ages.  Timothy is about two years younger than Brenda.  Then it will be Perry [Perry Lewis] and Perry is my next brother.  Then my brother Robert [Robert Lewis], there's like a five year gap (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --between Perry and Robert roughly.  And then my youngest sibling is Donna [Donna Lewis] and Donna is the baby of the family.  So that would be my seven siblings--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in order.  Correct order (laughter).
Speaker 1: Very nice.  What do you recall about--I mean that's a pretty large family, what do you call about--recall about growing up with that many brothers and sisters?  What are some of your memories of that, those relationships?
Speaker 2: Not a lot of privacy and not a lot of space (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In fact it's interesting, of the three things I promised myself when I got to be an adult, it relates to kind of growing up and it isn't a bad thing, it's just you relate to things.  I always wanted to have more bedrooms then we had, then I had people in the house.  So I've always said gosh when I get to be an adult I wanna live in a house where there are more bedrooms then there are people.  I always want to have a dollar in my pocket because that was something that was not always possible.  And I always wanted to have something to eat, because that also was something that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --wasn't always possible.  So I guess by backing into those three commitments, growing up with so many siblings, we never had any inability to talk to somebody 'cause there was always somebody around.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There's usually something going on and sometimes it was good and sometimes it wasn't.  So, constant activity.  You know, but it wasn't negative.  I mean the fact that we had seven or eight--I had seven sibs, there's eight in the family, it wasn't a bad thing.  In fact for us, it was the norm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So other people would go, "Gosh what a large family you have," and for us it's like well it's just our family.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It isn't large or small, it just is, it's just what we are.  The other thing with the spacing of twenty years between the oldest and the youngest girl, there's a twenty year span.  It wasn't that all eight of us were ever at the same place at the same time.  So typically, in fact when I went away to school, my youngest sister was born.  She was born when I was probably a junior or senior in high school [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan].  So for all practical purposes I've kind of grown up and my youngest two sibs and I really didn't have a lot of time together when they were younger or when I was around the house.  So it was never like all eight of us were there at the same time.  Typically when we come together for reunions, it's when we all gather and then we kind of look around and go wow that's a lot of people.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But that's just the way it worked out.
Speaker 1: Were you closer to any particular sibling?
Speaker 2: Probably my oldest sister Lolita.  I, I've relied upon her so much more so.  I think Lolita and I spent more time together than I have with any of my other siblings.  You know, we kind of have pairings almost, it's almost like my oldest sister Lolita and I tend to be more connected because we have more things that we kind of grew up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --doing together.  Then my sister Marva and my sister Brenda were kind of like an ordered pair as well, because they tended to do more things together--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --just based on the way they kind of fell in the birth order.  The same thing with my brother Timothy and Perry, again because they were close and they kind of grew up together, they're, you know, more connected.  And then finally Donna and Robbie because they were the (background noise) backend of the, of the train.  They ended up being more connected because of that.  So I think it fell into that, that pattern just simply because of, you know, how we kind of, you know, were born.
Story_ID: 639369
Speaker 1: Looking at your, your mother and your father's personalities, who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: I would say Tom [Thomas Jefferson] that I probably take more after my mom [Martha Williams Lewis] than my dad [Ward Lewis, Jr.], although I have a lot of his tendencies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My mom is very low key, very even keeled, you know, she's a very thoughtful lady.  She's--she--this is where I'd like to take after her more, she's very well read.  She reads, you know, voraciously.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I used to when I was little and I think I got that from her.  But I got away from it as I got older, just because of other things that kind of interfere with my time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But because she reads a lot she's very knowledgeable about wide, rare topics.  She's got wide ranging interests and so I kind of see a lot of myself in my mom or a lot of my mom in myself.  My dad is more of an action oriented person, so he always was somebody who wanted to do things--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --rather than study things.  And so that's his tendencies, where my mom was more thoughtful, much more of a planner and much more deliberate about the things that she would do.  And, and so I think I see more of my mom in myself and maybe that's why I'm a banker today--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --as a result.
Story_ID: 639370
Speaker 1: Do you know how your mother [Martha Williams Lewis] and father [Ward Lewis, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: They met in Birmingham [Alabama] at Parker High School [A.H. Parker High School] and I can't remember exactly how they came together but it was at, in Birmingham, Alabama at Parker High School which was the high school, I don't even know if it still exists (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but that was where they first connected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did your family move to--
Speaker 2: To Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: --Detroit?
Speaker 2: I was born in Michigan.  My sister Lolita [Lolita Lewis Ransom] was born in Birmingham.  So they moved to Detroit before I was born and I think that they moved there when Lolita was still little.  So she would've been three, so that would've been like sixty-two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all your schooling, elementary [Grant Elementary School; Grant Early Childhood Center, Ferndale, Michigan] and high school [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan] was in the Detroit area?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Now it was Ferndale, Michigan?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where is that in relationship to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Just across the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's just like a--it would be now, I guess, something like, you know, (unclear) or you know, (unclear) in terms of it being right across the street adjacent.  The borderline for Detroit is called Eight Mile Road, just like the movie ['8 Mile'] by Eminem.  And there's a number of little communities that sprung up on the side of either side of the border and so I happen to grow up in a place--Fern- Ferndale is a technical mailing address, the community I grew up in is actually called Royal Oak township [Michigan].  It's a, it's a municipality that is--it's all African American.  Well it's not all, there's a portion that isn't, but by and large the majority of it was African American.  It was kind of a--I call it a little poverty pocket that spilled over.
Story_ID: 639371
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Grant Elementary School [Grant Early Childhood Center, Ferndale, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Every Lewis, went to Grant Elementary School, all eight of us.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And was--it went to the sixth grade, K through six [kindergarten to sixth grade]?
Speaker 2: K through eight [kindergarten to eighth grade].
Speaker 1: K through eight--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then you went--what high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Ferndale High School [Ferndale, Michigan].  Every Lewis graduated from Ferndale High School.
Speaker 1: What kind of activities were you involved in, say first in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary school, I was involved in band.  There wasn't a lot of stuff that you could be involved in elementary school.  The school had the typical curriculum, but you know, you'd have gym as opposed to organized athletics.  But they did have band and I did participate in band, both concert band, as well as marching band.  And I had a pretty wide array of activities in elementary school, but again there weren't many external programs.  I was involved in exchange program in elementary school, where there was a neighboring school in our district that would exchange students, so I did do that.  Those were probably the principal things that I did, you know, outside of the core academics in elementary school, just because there wasn't a lot of offerings.
Speaker 1: What instrument did you play?
Speaker 2: I played the bass clarinet and the clarinet.
Speaker 1: And how did you get into--I mean did you take lessons or did you learn while you were in school?
Speaker 2: Through the school, it was a public sch- it is a public school, Grant still exists.  And I just had an interest in band.  My sister [Lolita Lewis Ransom] had played the trumpet and so when it came time to sign up for band, it was another extracurricular activity, it didn't cost any money which was, a main, a key success factor and I thought that the clarinet seemed like it was pretty interesting.  My hands were a little bit larger so trying to get the fingerings on the clarinet became a little more challenging.  So the band instructor suggested a bass clarinet which is a lot more like a saxophone and has wider spacing between the keys, was a little more comfortable for me, so I started playing bass clarinet.
Speaker 1: Do you still play?
Speaker 2: I can play, I haven't played for years, but I still would be able to play if I were given one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's been a long time since I've hit my last note.
Story_ID: 639372
Speaker 1: What street did you live on growing up?
Speaker 2: I lived on Bethlawn Boulevard [Ferndale, Michigan], B-E-T-H-L-A-W-N.
Speaker 1: And what was your address, do you remember?
Speaker 2: 21377 Bethlawn.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you describe the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was--Royal Oak township [Michigan] was, at the time we first moved there, a rural area.  Detroit [Michigan], as a city, kind of grew from the river out and the borders were designed, Eight Mile Road is literally eight miles from the center of downtown Detroit.  So if you got eight miles from the center of a major metropolitan area back at that time, you really were in more of a rural farm like area (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So a lot of people who immigrated from the South liked that because it was more--it reminded them of being in the South in a, in a, in a farm like environment.  So a lot of the houses in Royal Oak township were what they call shotgun houses where somebody who was not architecturally trained kind of took a look and said, "Well, I think I'll build a house."  And so some of them were not sized right--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --or built up to code, but it became an amalgamation of, you know, homes that were built properly and homes that weren't built properly.  So it's a real eclectic mix of architectural structures.  But it was, it was technically suburban--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as opposed to them being in the city proper, and most of the homes were owned by families, you know, working families or people who, you know, had steady jobs or steady employment.  So it was, it was a, a good place to grow up.
Story_ID: 639373
Speaker 1: Your family owned their house [in Royal Oak, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: They did.  They did own their house.
Speaker 1: And you talked a little bit about, you know, when you grew up that you wanted to have enough bedrooms.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What--How many bedrooms did you have in this particular house?
Speaker 2: Well, when we first got there we had two, and my parents [Martha Williams Lewis and Ward Lewis, Jr.] stayed in one and whoever was a kid stayed in the other.  As--what I talked about a shotgun house, it was actually originally a--we lived off of a park and so the park district had a, like a, I guess, a housing unit that they were gonna use for either the person who was in the park or to store things.  And so we actually obtained it.  And so it was kind of a build it as you go structure.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So we kind of had the first floor and then over time we kind of dug out the basement and had more of a basement over time.  As resources made themselves available, built a second floor to build more bedrooms.  So ultimately when they left it was two bedrooms upstairs, one bedroom downstairs and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and a semblance of a small basement.
Speaker 1: What were the most children that were in the house at any one time? You said that, you know, you weren't all there at the same time. Do you recall when the most of you were there?
Speaker 2: Seven, would've been the most there at the same time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because when I was in high school [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan] before I went to college [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], was when my youngest sister [Donna Lewis] was born, so there would've been seven at the house at that time, because my oldest sister [Lolita Lewis Ransom] had moved out, so seven.
Story_ID: 639374
Speaker 1: Going back to your education, you went to Ferndale High School [Ferndale, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: What kind of activities were you involved in there?
Speaker 2: At Ferndale, because it was a wide array, I mean Grant Elementary School [Grant Early Childhood Center, Ferndale, Michigan] was an all-black school, it happened to be in Royal Oak township [Michigan] which was all black and so it was a more limited environment there in terms of options.  Ferndale was an integrated school because it incorporated several school districts, so there was a much broader array of activities and resources available.  So there I got involved in stu- student government.  I was involved in athletics.  I was involved in--I took a foreign language so I had some involvement in the language clubs.  And some after school activities like homecoming and that type of thing.  I got more involved in those social activities, but those are the main things that I, that I found time.  I did not, I did start out in band the first year or so I was at Ferndale, but I had to, I had to drop out of band because it conflicted with athletics.  So, I stopped participating in band even though I enjoyed it, but I just didn't have time to do it.
Speaker 1: What sports did you play?
Speaker 2: I played football and track.
Speaker 1: What position did you play in football?
Speaker 2: A defensive--well in high school I played offensive guard and defensive linebacker--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that was, that was what I played in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What foreign language did you take?
Speaker 2: French.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 2: French was my favorite subject believe it or not.  I really enjoyed French.  But I enjoyed history, I enjoyed social studies, I enjoyed reading and literature.  I did, I didn't enjoy, not that you asked me that, but I didn't enjoy the hard sciences as much, so I tended to stay more towards either, you know, things that involved reading, things that involved, you know, social studies like history or like culture--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --world culture, those appealed to me.  And I tended to, to gravitate towards those whenever possible.
Story_ID: 639375
Speaker 1: Did you have any particular teachers that stand out to you or influenced you?
Speaker 2: In high school [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) High school.
Speaker 2: --or in elementary school?
Speaker 1: Well let's start with high school and then I'll go back and ask you about elementary school.
Speaker 2: I prob- I'd reverse the order Tom [Thomas Jefferson]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because in elementary school there was a teacher who had a great influence on my life and career that really kind of I think spilled over to high school.  In our elementary school, we had a--well it was a all-black environment as I explained, and a lot of people looked at the academic achievement of Grant [Grant Elementary School; Grant Early Childhood Center, Ferndale, Michigan] as really kind of being substandard to some of the other schools in Ferndale [Michigan] and that was because of a lot of socioeconomic issues that affected the academic performance.  The teachers were very committed to the students and if you showed a spark, the teachers would more than support you in that regard.  And so, in particular one of our teachers, her name is Barbara Weary, or Barbara Weary Brown [ph.], took a shine to our class.  And more often than not, what would happen as a class would come, so if you were a third grade class, she--the teacher would be assigned to you and then at the end of your third year you'd go on to another teacher.  She liked our class so much that she kept us for three years.  So from the third, fourth and fifth grades, she basically kept our class together and she was our teacher for all of those three grades.  And she, and we called her Mrs. Weary, Mrs. Brown, she had just a real major impact on me in terms of really kind of challenging me to do better, challenging me to do more, challenging me to reach full potential and not to take the easy way out.  And knowing me so well that even when I got to high school, she would continue to check on me and find out how I was doing and really knew some of the teachers in high school so that she would reach out from beyond the elementary school experience, if you will, to make sure that even when I got to high school I was doing well.  So that was probably the most influential teacher that I've had in my, in my career relative to education.  In high school, I didn't form the same kind of relationships with any of the teachers with the exception of my French teacher because I took four years of French and her name was Barbara Krenensky [ph.].  So, the relationship there was more of a love for language and the love for studying language, as much as a relationship between myself and Mrs. Krenensky.  So she would be my favorite teacher only because I was with her for four years--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --with four years of French.  But the relationship was very different as opposed to Mrs. Weary or Mrs. Brown, because she actually was genuinely interested in me as a person.
Story_ID: 639376
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: In, in high school or in elementary school?
Speaker 1: Both, let's start with elementary.
Speaker 2: In elementary school I was a, I was a pretty good student.  In fact, I would usually get to teach the class.  My wife [Jacqueline James Lewis] laughs all the time and when she says, "Why did you get to teach your class?"  Because I read the books and I finished them in fairly short order, the textbooks and the--Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Weary [Barbara Weary Brown (ph.)]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --would know that and so if she had to do something else then she would let me teach the class.  I always thought that was kind of fun.  So I was a pretty good student in elementary school.
Speaker 1: How did your classmates feel about that?
Speaker 2: They didn't mind actually.  They knew it was not ego driven and it was not special status, and so we actually had a pretty good relationship overall.  So a lot of the classes I would get to lead would be either history or reading.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I was always able to read, so I would read to the class or help the students who needed help reading, learning their reading lessons.  So we didn't have any issues around jealously or anger or envy when it came to academics in school.  And the other equilibrium in elementary school was sports. It was kind of like the great divider, and so if you had a sport that you played that helped to balance it all out, because that way you weren't an egghead which would've put you in a different status.
Speaker 1: Now did you also play football in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Any other sports?
Speaker 2: Baseball, but I wasn't very good at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What kind of student were you in high school?
Speaker 1: I would say Tom [Thomas Jefferson] I was a classic underachiever.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I actually got distracted by things other than academics when I got to Ferndale [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan].  It was just a--Grant [Grant Elementary School; Grant Early Childhood Center, Ferndale, Michigan] was like a small insulated environment. You're going to school with the same kids since kindergarten.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You've known them, you know, all your life and we all kind of went through as a group.  You have families that knew one another and so it was just a real close knit environment.  Ferndale was--in Michigan they have four classes of schools, and class A is the largest.  And so my starting freshman class was almost a thousand students.  So you go from a class where you got the same, you know, forty kids that you've known since you've, you know, been on this earth 'til now you're in a, in a incoming freshman class of almost a thousand and you're overwhelmed with all the newness and activities and so forth.  So I kind of got distracted with a lot of things that had nothing to do with academics and I didn't have very good study habits because I was, I didn't have to study very hard in elementary school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'cause the pace was a lot slower because you had to meet up to the average.  So you put all that in combination and I did well in some classes that I just naturally had an affinity for like French or like history or social sciences, but there are others, classes that I, I didn't do as well in and I didn't know how to apply myself systematically to get, to get better at it.
Story_ID: 639377
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned earlier about you had an [paternal] aunt that was very--kind of a stickler on education?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Louvenia [Louvenia Lewis Renshaw].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Were your parents [Martha Williams Lewis and Ward Lewis, Jr.] very--sticklers also on, on the value of education?
Speaker 2: My mom more so than my dad.  My mom said that the key to, you know, getting a better life was to get an education, she always drummed that into us.  And so she was very, very keen on that.  My dad kind of tacitly said, "Yeah, that's right," and then he went off to work.  But my mom drummed it in our head that you gotta get your education, gotta get your books, that was how she referred to it.  And her goal for all of us was to get a high school diploma--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because she thought that if you got a high school diploma and since she had not been able to obtain that, that that would be a key to education, key to a better life.  So, she would assist us, not because she would know how to do, you know, calculus or whatever, but she would read with us or help us to do our homework to the extent that she could or encourage us to do our homework by asking, "Have you done your homework? Do you have any homework tonight," you know, "You better take time and not be watching TV or sloughing off and get your, get your assignments done."  So in that support, it encouraged us to make sure that we stayed focused on academics.
Speaker 1: Let me touch on something you just mentioned.  How much education did your parents have?
Speaker 2: My dad got to--he dropped out of high school [A.H. Parker High School, Birmingham, Alabama] I think as a, as like a first semester junior and my mom dropped out as a, as a freshman, I think she was a freshman, when she completed her freshman year and was about to enter tenth grade when she dropped out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My mom subsequently went back and got her GED [General Educational Development] at Ferndale [Michigan].  My dad never completed high school.
Story_ID: 639378
Speaker 1: What kind of dreams and aspirations did you have in high school [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan] in terms of what you thought your career might be?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a Greyhound bus driver (laughter).  I thought that'd be a cool job because you get to go and drive all over the country and I thought the bus, the Greyhound buses were pretty nifty.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, all I could see was driving a Greyhound bus, because for me that was a lot more adventuresome then going to work at Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan], or GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan], or Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan], or, you know, or Dodge, which was what most people did who came out of high school.  So, my aspirations were a lot more limited because that was all I knew. I didn't know much more than the Greyhound bus which seemed to be the principal vehicle when you go south.  If you think about it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --people would always say we're gonna go down to the Greyhound bus station and we're gonna take bus and go to some exotic place in the United States, California--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --New York, Birmingham, Alabama.  So I wanted to be--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --a bus driver.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Were there any particular role models you had in your community that you kind of looked up to?
Speaker 2: Well teachers. Our educators were probably the most successful role model that you can see consistently in our community.  You would see them because they wore a suit and so the only people who wore suits in our community were teachers, preachers and insurance salesmen.  We--nobody else wore a suit where I lived.  Everybody else had a blue collar or no collar.  And I didn't wanna be a preacher.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I didn't wanna sell insurance, and actually I didn't wanna be a teacher either.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, but those are the role models that we would have to look to.  And so teachers were, I guess, probably the natural default factor because at least the education piece was something that resonated with me.  But there weren't a lot of options to choose from.
Speaker 1: Now you subsequently did go to college. What moved you from being a Greyhound bus driver to wanting to go to college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Sports.  I played football, as I said, and I enjoyed playing football.  And my coach, you know, you ask who was my role model in high school.  My high school coach, a gentleman named Frank Joranko was also a role model for me because I think he saw a spark in me that I guess I didn't see myself.  And while he never taught me academically, he coached me as a football coach and so I, I'd say he was another role model in my life because he saw that, you know, there's a possibility of going to college.  If it hadn't been for Frank Joranko, I never would've gone on to college, because he introduced the possibility to me.  Obviously my parents [Martha Williams Lewis and Ward Lewis, Jr.] didn't have any sense of college, because it was not something they were aware of.  And while a couple of my aunts and uncles had gone on to co- well not a couple, some of my aunts and uncles had gone on to college, they weren't there every day in my life. So it was difficult for them to be as encouraging as they might have, even my Aunt Louvenia [Lewis' paternal aunt, Louvenia Lewis Ransom].  Who would talk about college, but I wouldn't see her with great regularity and the people who I saw with regularity were going to work for GM or Chrysler or Ford, and coming back with hot cars and money in their pockets and so that was an alluring option.  And then there was a war in Vietnam [Vietnam War] that was also taking a lot of people too.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, Coach Joranko sent out letters on my behalf and sent out, you know, film and actually was instrumental in my getting a offer of a, of a athletic scholarship to, to Western Michigan [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] to play football.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, and that was what prompted me to, to, to take that next step.
Story_ID: 639379
Speaker 1: Now you graduated from high school [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan], what 1967?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: In '67 [1967], that was around the time of the Detroit riots?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Would--how, how did that affect you or, or your family at that time?
Speaker 2: Because we didn't live in Detroit [Michigan] proper it was not as pronounced, and as I said I lived on Eight Mile Road and the riots were in Detroit on the west side in the main.  We saw the riots up close and personal.  In fact, the summer that I graduated from high school, I graduated in June of '67 [1967], the riots were that summer.  We actually went and toured some of the riot sites just to see what was going on there, and it almost seemed surreal.  It was like, you felt like you were in Beirut [Lebanon] as opposed to Detroit.  It was, you know, National Guard riflemen, you know, kind of standing on the side of the street and policemen basically having barricades and blockades for places that we had gone to, you know, all our lives.  So it was almost like I felt like I was in some kind of a alternate world as opposed to being in the place that I knew (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --intimately.  And it wasn't scary, it was just. It was weird. It was weird mostly than anything else.  Reading the news accounts and then watching the national news when they talked about, you know, how horrific it was in Detroit, then being there and going like well it's bad, but it's not like they make it out.
Story_ID: 639380
Speaker 1: So I want to take you back to your childhood just one more time.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells from your neighborhood [in Royal Oak, Michigan] that you recall?
Speaker 2: Well, sights and sounds and smells.  I guess the sounds would be, we knew everybody.  The families, this is probably a little bit of a derivation of what you just asked me, but one of the sounds was if one of us got in trouble, let's say if I went to somebody else's house and I didn't do what I should do.  I would be reprimanded there, and so that was a sound, and then the next sound would be the phone picking up, calling my mom [Martha Williams Lewis], and then the next sound would be my mom reprimanding me for what I did at the place that I was at.  And then the next sound would be my dad [Ward Lewis, Jr.] when he came home from one of his two jobs being told about what I did.  If it was an egregious enough transgression and the sounds coming from him around his, you know, dissatisfaction with what I had done.  So it was a strong sense of community, a strong of neighborhood and you would sense that as you went down the street because people knew one another.  You would know your neighbors, you would speak to your neighbors and that type of thing.  I guess, a sight would be people taking pride in their homes, because you know, people who came as--they lived as sharecroppers or they lived--most came from the South.  I mean almost everybody in the community I grew up in came from the South.  They had some ties back to whether it be Tennessee or Arkansas or Georgia, but most from Alabama because there was a little pipeline from Alabama, would have, you know, around the holidays trips back to and from, bringing back peanuts or pecans (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --or watermelons from the South.  So that was always something that was kind of a prevalent sight and sound.  And then I guess the other sight that was pretty prevalent in our neighborhood that I remember growing up was that we had a park and the park was not far away from where I grew up at.  So it was usually something for the kids to kind of go--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and gravitate towards.  I mean it didn't--it wasn't much.  We'd have a raggedy baseball and a, you know, beat up bat.  But it gave us a focus, and so our focus was always on the playgrounds and around sports--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that gave us something as a, you know, a group of kids to do.  And then in the fall it might switch to football or tag football, and not a lot of basketball. We didn't have any basketball courts in our area.  So it was always, you know, running or you know, games that would involve, you know, bats, balls, tossing or catching.
Speaker 1: Were you a Tigers' [Detroit Tigers] fan?
Speaker 2: I wa- I am (laughter).
Speaker 1: How about Lions [Detroit Lions]?
Speaker 2: I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pistons [Detroit Pistons].  The Red Wings [Detroit Red Wings] were a little more foreign to me so I guess I'm an adopted Red Wings fan.
Story_ID: 639381
Speaker 1: Now we've graduated high school [Ferndale High School, Ferndale, Michigan], and you're starting at--
Speaker 2: Western Michigan University [Kalamazoo, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Western Michigan.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your initial impression when you went there?  I mean was this the first time you really been away from home?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I had--other than family vacations, I think the only trip I'd ever taken beyond that for something that was not related to family travel was I went to Lansing, Michigan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on a school fieldtrip and met then Governor George Romney [George W. Romney].  And that was a big deal, it's like ninety miles away to go to East Lansing [Michigan].  I also went to East Lansing for--our high school won the state basketball championship in '63 [1963] and '66 [1966], and so I went in '66 [1966] to the, to Jenison Field House [East Lansing, Michigan] to be there for the basketball championship.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That was--those were my two trips away.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But going to Kalamazoo, Michigan was like going to another world.  You know, Kalamazoo, Michigan is Christian Dutch Reformed, you know, it's a very different kind of an environment.  Kalamazoo is, it's a great place if you--as an adult going back to Kalamazoo, I've come to appreciate what it has to offer.  It's really a great place to be.  They have something called Kalamazoo Promise [Kalamazoo, Michigan] and it's phenomenal.  But as a seventeen year old, you know, coming out of an urban environment, it was like going to, not the country, 'cause I'd been to the country and I knew what that was all about.  It was like going to, I don't know, Barney Fife land or something like that, it was just so different.  And so there was a real cultural shock with going to Kalamazoo and I do remember the distinct feeling of like what have I got myself into when I first got to Kalamazoo.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Being at Western, being in the dormitory was actually a positive experience, I enjoyed that, 'cause there was only two of us in one room.
Speaker 1: Um-hm (laughter).
Speaker 2: I thought that was pretty good.  And we had lots of food.  Another one of my requirements.  So I could get as much as I wanted to eat or drink, that was good.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, so I figured, okay I still didn't have any money but I had two out of the three things--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that I felt were important.  So I, I began to adjust.
Story_ID: 639382
Speaker 1: Did you play football all four years you were there?
Speaker 2: I was there for four and a half years and I played four of the four and half years at--they--I was redshirted so I had five years of eligibility of which I used four.  So, my last academic year I did not play.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I knew I was not gonna ever go to NFL [National Football League], but there was a draft that was waiting for me and I did not wanna go in as a, as a non-graduate, and so I did not play my last year of aca--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --of eligibility so I could finish my academics and complete my degree requirements.  And that is why I didn't play as a, as a fifth year senior.
Speaker 1: When you first went to college [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], did you have any idea of what you wanted to major in or what you wanted to do when you got out?
Speaker 2: No I didn't Tom [Thomas Jefferson].
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I simply wanted to play football.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That's all I went to school to do.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: As college was such a foreign concept that football was the, was the known thing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: College was just kind of a place to play football.
Speaker 1: Was your team any good?
Speaker 2: We were a--I'd say that we were respectably mediocre (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did you decide on a major? I mean what courses kind of influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought about what I liked and--because you didn't have to declare a major as a freshman. They gave you time to think that, think that out.  But by, before your junior year you have to declare your major.  So I thought well what do I like and I thought well I kind of like business and business seems like it would be kind of interesting.  I knew I didn't wanna be a teacher, an educator, so that was not appealing to me at all.  While I didn't know a lot about business, I figured well business is pretty big and again coming from Detroit [Michigan], GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan], you know, Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan], those were all businesses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so I thought well I'll probably go to work for the motor car company.  So being a business major would be helpful, so I can go and you know, get a job with GM or Ford or Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan].  So, I'll be a business major.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What that meant I had no idea--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but that was what I chose to major in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At that time, did you see yourself doing anything other than that?  I mean, did you have aspirations for playing in the NFL at that time?
Speaker 2: No.  I knew I wasn't NFL material.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, you know, fortunately I came to that realization quickly because there were a lot of guys who didn't come to that realization.  But I played, I didn't always--in fact I was not a starter, I was kind of like the first off the bench, if you will or second team player.  Played a lot, lettered, and made all the road trips, that was great.  So I had a great college experience in football, and if I had to do it all over again, I'd do the same thing.  I think that having athletic experience in college really does round you out, and it's a special, I think, opportunity to be involved in something that the majority of people who go through college won't have a chance to be involved in.  So, I have no regrets about that, two knee surgeries notwithstanding.  But I didn't harbor any thoughts that I'd ever be an NFL player so that was not--that was not an option and I was okay with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said you had an interest in business. What were your--what did you major in?
Speaker 2: I majored--in undergraduate school, I majored in general management, so management because I thought well okay, gonna go to GM or Chrysler or Ford and I'll be a supervisor at some point.  So being in management would make some sense.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But I majored in management really based on just my gypsy logic, if you will, as opposed to anything specific.  But I was a management major.

Speaker 1: Were there any people in--at Western Michigan [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] at that time that were--became notable later on that you recall, any of your classmates?
Speaker 2: Well, there were people at Western who went on to do other things like Dennis Archer who, you know, is--was the mayor of Detroit [Michigan] and also is a judge and is on the board of Western, was a predecessor so I knew of Dennis Archer.  There were people who were in my class who while they haven't made a splash on the national scene, have done things of prominence in--whether Michigan or in or around Michigan and some of them were in various stages of you know, kind of forming their ultimate, you know, career choices.  A guy named Roger Pulliam who is a Ph.D. and Roger was a--he had completed his undergraduate stu- studies at Western, was in the process of kind of working his Ph.D. and teaching.  So those were people who we--I knew had gone through, had similar backgrounds, had gone on to bigger and better thri- things, so clearly began to sink into me that this college thing could be of some value beyond just the opportunity to play football, and so it started to make some sense.
Speaker 1: Now Luther Vandross was there for a little--
Speaker 2: If he was, I didn't know him (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The guy who--I'll tell you who was there when I was there and I didn't, I didn't know him either, the--he played on was it home--not 'Home Improvement.'  I'll think of his name later, sorry.
Speaker 1: Tim Allen?
Speaker 2: Tim Allen, thank you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you (laughter).  Tim Allen is a Western grad.
Speaker 1: Now, Kwame Kilpatrick, his mother [Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick] was there?
Speaker 2: If she was I didn't know her (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 639384
Speaker 1: When did you decide to go to grad school?
Speaker 2: After I got out of undergraduate school [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan], when I graduated and I got a job, I was working for a bank in Detroit [Michigan] called Detroit Bank and Trust [Detroit Bank and Trust Company; Comerica, Inc.].  And I--the job was, again I just kind of backed into it.  It was not, it was--I kind of landed it really in a very serendipitous way.  So once I got into the bank, I saw that the action was actually as a corporate banker and I thought well I'd like to do that, that looks like that could be a lot of fun.  And I tried to figure out how I could get in the corporate banking given my background, and I thought well it's gonna be a tough row to hoe and a long road if I go through conventional channels.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But everybody who came in as an M.B.A. was immediately put in that chair.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I thought, okay.  I need to get an M.B.A.  And that was how I went back to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Now you said you kind of backed into the position there at the bank. How did you back into it?
Speaker 2: Well, the way I got the job was--when I came out of undergraduate school it was--I graduated in December of '71 [1971].  I mentioned earlier that I was gonna get drafted one way or the other, not by the NFL [National Football League] but by Uncle Sam and I was gonna go into the [U.S.] military, 'cause the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War] was at its height.  So, as they began to deescalate the war, many people, unless people grew up in that timeframe they won't remember, but if you had a Selective Service number, employers could look, could legally ask you what your Selective Service number was.  If your Selective Service number was beneath the ceiling, the ceiling was I think like 250 if I recall or 270.  Then if it was beneath that number they didn't have to, they didn't have to interview you and they wouldn't hire you.  So my number was 113.  Clearly I was gonna be a goner, and so as I finished my last year of undergraduate study I couldn't interview for jobs because no employer, prospective employer would take a look at me.  In December of '71 [1971] because Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was beginning to deescalate the war, every month they announced the ceiling for the draft, eligible men, and you would check that to find out, you know, what the ceiling was.  Well in the month that I graduated in December of '71 [1971], the month before it was above, it was 125. I just kind of remember that because I was at 113.  And they had been dropping the ceiling by, you know, it depended, sometimes it would be five numbers, sometimes it was stable, be the same, depends on how big the need was for troops in Vietnam.  But the month I graduated in December they dropped the ceiling to ninety-five.  So if your number was above the ceiling you didn't have to worry about being drafted.  And I came out with no prospects of being drafted by the NFL or by Uncle Sam, but also no job.  So I backed into the job by going door to door in Detroit [Michigan], you know, with a degree, but no job.  And so I went to GM [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] and Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan], and Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC, Auburn Hills, Michigan] and they weren't hiring because it was one of the little mini recessions that they were having in the auto industry.  And I went to all the automotive suppliers trying to see if they might have jobs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --like Budd [Budd Company] or some other, Masco [Masco Corporation], or some other major providers, and of course they weren't hiring either.  So I sat down and, and scratched my head to see where do I think I could get a job that might have a training program and I thought well banks. Banks probably have training programs (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 639385
Speaker 1: You were talking about how you backed into this job at the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at the bank and trust?
Speaker 2: So what happened was because I didn't have a job I said, "Where might I get a training program?"  And so I went to the branch of the bank that I had always made my deposits and went to the teller and said, "I'd like to apply for a job."  And so she looked at me and laughed and said, "You can't apply for a job here."
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I said, "Well where?"  So she sent me downtown.  And I went downtown.  And the recruiter, whose name is John Lewis [John D. Lewis], ironically enough and John went on to be a very successful leader at the Detroit Bank and Trust [Detroit Bank and Trust Company] and subsequently Comerica [Comerica, Inc.], was in HR [human resources] and so we talked for about five minutes.  And so after a while he said, "Okay let's kind of cut all the, you know, crap aside, what is wrong with you?  You got your degree, you seem like you, you know, presentable enough.  Do you have a problem with, you know, drugs or, you know, is there some criminal activity or something that you're not telling me?"  And so I said, "Mr. Lewis, you may not realize this but there's a war over in Vietnam [Vietnam War] and my draft number is 113."  So when I explained to him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --he said, "Got it."  And so he says, "You know what, you're hired.  When can you start?"  And so I started the next week at the branch that I had gone to apply for the job and showed up, and the same teller who said, "You gotta go downtown" ended up being my first supervisor.  So I kind of backed into it that way, but it worked out fine.
Speaker 1: Now were you initially a teller or did you get in some kind of management training program?
Speaker 2: Well the training program was a, was a--is kind of a on the job training structure that they had.  And the first three months you actually spent as a teller (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on the teller window, so her name was Jeannie Crump [ph.].  And Jeannie was my trainer and I actually just observed her as she executed her duties as a teller and then ultimately she gave me my own window and I would execute transactions as a teller.  That's the first phase in the training program.  Then you moved over to be an assistant bank manager or branch manager watching a assistant bank manager perform his or her duties and ultimately you shadow the manager, and then in nine months and they would assign you as an unassigned person to go around and work at various branches in the Detroit Bank and Trust system.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So that was their informal training program.  So yes, I was a teller for three months.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get into the loan department?
Speaker 2: No, I transferred out of the retail training program and went to what was called the operations area which is really a non-computer operations and systems analyst.  And that was where, again, I'd--I worked downtown, got to see where all the action was at, which is in the corporate lending area (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and decided I wanted to be a corporate banker.  So that gave me a window to what the lenders did and their interactions with the customers and working with the external client, and I found that that was a area that I really thought I would like and would enjoy being a part of, and so that was when I made the decision to go back to graduate school.
Speaker 1: And how long did you work at the, at the bank?
Speaker 2: Two and two thirds years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, two years and eight months I, I worked at Detroit Bank and Trust.
Story_ID: 639386
Speaker 1: Tell us about the, the graduate school you went to?
Speaker 2: Well, the--I was a--in graduate school I knew that paying for it was gonna be something I'd have to kind of figure out.  So I found out about the consortium for graduate study of management [Consortium for Graduate Study in Management] which is an organization based out of St. Louis [Missouri] that provide, provides through the graduate M.B.A. degree an opportunity for qualified minorities to be more involved in mainstream and business.  So I applied for the consortium fellowship and was awarded a consortium fellowship and graduated from Indiana as a consortium fellow.  It's a stipend that you receive and a, and a--they--the university, sponsoring university covers your tuition and there's, I think, sixteen, there's probably more than that now, universities that are part of that consortium program, but at the time I was applying there was probably only around six or maybe nine that were available.  And I chose Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Was there anything particular about Indiana that--why you chose that one as opposed to one of the other ones?
Speaker 2: I chose it because it was the highest rated M.B.A. program of the ones that were offered.  It was at the time rated the tenth, it was the tenth ranked program, M.B.A. program in the, in the nation at the time, and of the ones that were offered, I thought it seemed like the one that made the most sense to me.  It was Midwest and so I thought well, I'll go here.  That's as much as I knew about Indiana University at the time, just it's ranking in the national polls.
Speaker 1: And when did you finish there?
Speaker 2: I finished in, in May of '76 [1976].
Story_ID: 639387
Speaker 1: From there, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I came straight to the Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois]. I started here in June of '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you get--I mean you're in Bloomington, Indiana, how did you get to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well Tom [Thomas Jefferson], I actually had intended to go back to Detroit [Michigan].  My intention in coming out of graduate school [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] was to go back to Detroit and actually go back to Detroit Bank and Trust [Detroit Bank and Trust Company; Comerica, Inc.], which is where I wanted to continue my career.  And the reason that I didn't go back was because they were gonna bring me in at the same rate as all the other incoming trainees.  And I argued with John [John D. Lewis], I still remember this argument today, 'cause he and I had a really good relationship and they recruited at IU saying, "Just give me something.  I mean, you know, if you can give me my credit for the two, two thirds years I was there, give me, you know, five hundred bucks [dollars] more than you give the other guys, just give me something to make the difference for me coming back."  And John said, "You know, my hands are bound, I can't do that."  So, the Harris, at the time, was, there was a guy named Jerry Burns [ph.] was very active in recruiting, I mean I'd come to the bank and I only took the interview with the Harris because I really wanted to go to work for Continental, Continental Illinois National Bank [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America].  They were the high fliers at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, I thought well I'll take this interview with the Harris to practice for my interview with Continental, and I'm sure I'll get an offer from Continental.  Well of the fifty or so interviews I took, I only got rejected by two.  One was Brown Brothers Harriman [Brown Brothers Harriman and Company] out in, out of New York [New York], which I expected, and the other was Continental.  And it just, it just blew me away because I, well I don't get rejected for interviews, I was reasonably good at interviewing.  But Harris showed such a genuine and sincere interest in me as a person, that when Continental rejected me and Harris through Jerry Burns continued to pursue me, I thought well this seems like a good fit. I think I could do well here.  So, I'll come here for a couple of years and get some experience and then move on to something else.
Story_ID: 639388
Speaker 1: Did you have any family or friends in Chicago [Illinois] area?
Speaker 2: My wife [Jacqueline James Lewis] was born in Chicago, even though she was raised in Flint, Michigan.  So she, she has strong family ties here.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so she had a number of relatives who continue to live in the area, and so her ties to the community, to Chicago were stronger than mine.  My Aunt Louvenia [Lewis' paternal aunt, Louvenia Lewis Renshaw], who I mentioned before, lived up in Waukegan [Illinois] and I have an [paternal] uncle who lives here.  So I have family here as well, but not as much as my, as my wife did.
Speaker 1: Where did you and your wife meet?
Speaker 2: We met in undergraduate school at Western Michigan [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan] in my junior year.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So we met there and then subsequently got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you continued, when did you get married?
Speaker 2: Well we got married in May of '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay and that was when you were at, you were still at the bank [Detroit Bank and Trust Company; Comerica, Inc.] at that time?
Speaker 2: I was at the bank. I started at the bank in January of '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so we got married a little bit--I worked for a little bit over a year and so she was in graduate school in--at Western getting her M.S.W. so she graduated with her M.S.W.  We got married the month after.  So she graduated actually late April and we got married May 5th.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you went on to Bloomington [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and so both of you lived there for a while?
Speaker 2: That's correct, we lived there together (laughter).  She provided the income because the consortium fellowship [Consortium for Graduate Study in Management] is--it's a stipend, it's not really designed to cover all your living expenses.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Her working in Bloomington professionally as a M.S.W. and then my going to graduate school full time was, was the key success factor for me.  I didn't think I'd do very well at night. A lot of people are very good about going to night classes.  I didn't think I would do very well--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So going full time was better.
Story_ID: 639389
Speaker 1: Did you know when you came to Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], did you know a guy by the name of Ed Williams [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you know him?
Speaker 2: Ed was one of the senior bankers here when I first came to the bank and actually was probably one of the most prominent bankers in Chicago [Illinois] and in particular one of the most senior minority bankers in Chicago.  And so he was here, had been here for many years and Ed immediately became a mentor and a close advisor and today continues to be a mentor and a friend as well.
Speaker 1: How about Yasmin Bates [Yasmin T. Bates Brown]?
Speaker 2: Yasmin and I started together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she and I actually started in the same year.  We both started, she started a little bit earlier than I.  She started in the first part of the year, I think in January of '76 [1976], and I started a little bit later in June.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your first job at Harris?
Speaker 2: I was a trainee in the corporate banking department.  So I was a commercial banking trainee.  And started out as most of the undergraduate students in the M.B.A. class did as a trainee doing the analytics and being assigned to a division and doing write ups, and then ultimately being assigned to a corporate banking division as a junior relationship manager, which happened in April of the following year.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And what was your next position there?
Speaker 2: Well I was a, I was a relationship manager and then you are promoted in terms of your officer title, and so there's a series of officer promotions.  But I stayed in the first division I was in until '82 [1982] and then I transferred to another lending area, another lending division where I had different assignment.  And I was there from '82 [1982] to like '86 [1986].  In '86 [1986], I was assigned a--to another lending area, specialty area and was given a team leader responsibility so I did that from '86 [1986] to '88 [1988], and then I was promoted to division administrator, senior vice president, and second vice president.  It just--there was a series of steps along the way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but all of those in the corporate banking space until I rotated out of the corporate bank in 2003 and took on a role that was an amalgamation of retail, commercial and affluent--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --which is what I continue to do today.
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna go back a little bit because everybody doesn't know what the banking industry is like.  When you were in the corporate area, what specific things did, I mean did you have corporate relationships and--that you had to manage and--you said you were (unclear) a relationship at one point?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What did that actually involve?
Speaker 2: Well it's basically being the principal contact person for the relationship that a corporation has with a financial institution.  So if--I'll name Schwinn Bicycle Company, which is always a name that everybody knows.  So I was the relationship manager for Schwinn Bicycle Company.  The relationship that they had with the Harris Bank and the principal contact that they would come to when they needed whether it be credit services, deposit services, relationship activity would be a person such as myself.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I would be responsible for facilitating the execution, analyzing what the request was, presenting it to the appropriate parties inside the bank, getting approval, delivering it, monitoring it and making sure it was, you know, kept up to speed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on a ongoing basis.  So it's kind of like a quarterback for a relationship.  You know, a sales relationship between the organization, but selling financial services as opposed to, you know, automobiles or computers.
Speaker 1: So if say Schwinn needed a--if they had a credit line, they needed an increase in their credit line they would come to you to make that request?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) That's correct.  And I would process it, look at it, validate it, make sure it was legitimate, it was based on sound principles, present that internally, seek approval, get the necessary approval, make sure the documentation was executed properly, work with the company and the law, the legal firm to make sure the documentation was properly reflected, you know, and then move forward with funding and all the other necessary arrangements.
Speaker 1: When we talk about the analytics, where you have to go back and look at their, you know, their financial statements and you know, those type of things in terms of making those decisions?
Speaker 2: Correct.  You have to have, you know, a real good familiarity with financial statements, annual reports, you know, cash flow statements, forecasts, et cetera to be able to properly determine if a request was legitimate based on sound business principles.  You have to look at forecast to make sure that what they're gonna use the money for, if they're gonna invest in their business was gonna pay off in a sufficient timeframe to repay the debt or to cover off on the cost of capital was gonna be incurred.  So, it's a, it's, you know, accounting is the language of business, you know, again from a graduate education perspective the IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] experience prepared me very well for what I did or what I do today, and I think that that's what most good relationship managers do as they are able to interpret and interpolate the information in a way that allows you to make appropriate decisions.
Story_ID: 639390
Speaker 1: Now as relationship manager, did you have relationships with existing customers or did you have to go out and also solicit customers?
Speaker 2: Both Tom [Thomas Jefferson].  There's a portfolio you usually inherit.  So as you have turnover in the bank, there'll be people who move on to other responsibilities as I did and those residual relationships then have to be assigned to a, to a new contact person or relationship manager.  But at the same time, you go out and seek out new relationships to grow that portfolio because if the business grows then that helps the organization to grow and growth is something we're committed to.  So, I solicited relationships, as well as maintained the existing ones.
Speaker 1: Now when you had the, you know, in the role of soliciting new relationships, did you ever run into resistance or felt that you ran into some resistance because you were black?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  With the name like Mike Lewis [HistoryMaker Michael W. Lewis] and I always like to say there's a, there's a telephone voice that you have, so I might call you up and go, "Tom, I'm Mike Lewis from Harris Bank [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois]. I'd like to come and call on you."  I'm not trying to make my voice sound any different than I do now, but you might not hear the things in my voice on the phone that you would hear if you're sitting across from me speaking to me.  So it might not sound the same if you will to someone who's listening on the other end.  So one of my assigned territories was Ohio.  And I would call all over Ohio.  So I'm very familiar with the state.  And in some places like Marietta [Ohio] or even in Dayton [Ohio] or Cincinnati [Ohio], or other places I would call, make an appointment to come and call on a company and the look on their face told me that they didn't know who I was on the phone as opposed to when I showed up at the office.  So yeah I ran into resistance.  It was not overt, it was very subtle, but what I found was okay, you know, it's not the stimulus, it's the response.  I can't control the stimulus, I can only control the response.  So I would immediately launch into a discussion around the topics at hand.  And what I found is that, you know, pretty consistently if you were prepared, if you had a good conversation that was planned around things that were important to the company, you got away from the issues that might relate more to race than more towards the issues that were related to business and after all, I'm a businessman and that was what I was there to talk about.
Story_ID: 639391
Speaker 1: Now you talked about relationship with Schwinn [Schwinn Bicycle Company]. Who were some of your other major clients if you can tell us?
Speaker 2: I don't think it's anything secret, Hewitt Associates. There was also this company called Joanna Western Mills [Joanna Western Mills Company] that was a relationship, Allied Van Lines [Allied Van Lines, Inc.].  Names would be, you know, very well known local names, a lot of names that wouldn't be as well known.  Some were in specialty markets, so there were a lot of not-for-profit organizations that we handled, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America would be one.  So it was a wide range of both commercial and not-for-profit relationships that I handled as relationship manager [for Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  Then there were a lot more that I was involved in as a manager of people so they were in the portfolio or in the market, or the segment I had responsibility for.  But in terms of direct ones, those are would be some that are, some that are offered.
Speaker 1: How big was this department?
Speaker 2: Well, I have, I've had a variety of roles--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because I've been there for a long time and so when you say how big was it, I guess I'd say--it's difficult to kind of give a perspective to a non-insider in terms of how big they were, so I would say in the corp- in the banking business you have micro, small, midsize and large corporate commercial clients.  And I tended to deal with more the midsize and large corporate commercial clients as my core competency.  So they're multimillion dollar clients that I typically deal with. That was kind of my stock and trade.  There were some middle, middle size clients that would be say $25 to 50 million in revenue, but some of the, you know, Fortune 500, Fortune 750 in terms of their size, so it was a wide range of, of entities that I deal with.   Which was, was good, because it gave me a, a great understanding of some of the dynamics of business.
Story_ID: 639392
Speaker 1: When you left being a relationship manager, where did you say you went next?
Speaker 2: Well, I was promoted to be a manager [for Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I managed people who managed relationships.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, and then I managed a group of managers who managed people who managed relationships (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So it was a, it was a hierarchical structure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And as the manager, how were you, I mean, did you have to have a certain, meet certain, I assume certain profit goals or whatever, how was that, how were you evaluated in terms of those positions?
Speaker 2: Well you hit the nail on the head Tom [Thomas Jefferson].  First and foremost is you gotta, you know, continue to grow your revenue and continue to grow your contributions, so revenue and contribution goals were measures that were key standards for me in terms of my success.  Growth and number of relationships were market penetration which is usually--market penetration is kind of a, is a byproduct of growth in number of relationships, so winning new relationships was another barometer of success and expanding relationships with existing customers was another measure of success.  So, those--and then absolute standards like growth in loan portfolio, outstandings in growth and deposit total. Outstandings were also measures of success, all kind of correlated around revenue growth, contribution growth, market share growth, new account growth, expansion of existing relationships and creation of new relationships were the principal measures of success quantitatively.  Then there was also qualitative standards like how much involvement did you have in, in internal support functions, as well as external organizations, boards, et cetera.
Story_ID: 639393
Speaker 1: Who were your main competitors at that time?
Speaker 2: Well it's varied.  Chicago [Illinois] has been a very interesting and dynamic marketplace, so over the years, I mean, it used to be the big four or five, it was like, you know, I'm dating myself, but you know, First Chicago [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Continental Illinois [Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company; Bank of America], you know, Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], LaSalle [LaSalle Bank, N.A.] and probably American National [American National Bank and Trust of Chicago] 'cause Northern [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] was always a niche player.  Then as time has rolled on, you kind of look at a new set of entrants into the marketplace, so you have Chase [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.] and Bank of America [Bank of America Corporation], and now a private bank or a Fifth Third [Fifth Third Bank], or National City Bank [First National City Bank; CitiBank, N.A.] who provide, you know, strong competition and then some local competition whether it be from a Charter One [Charter One Financial] or from some of the other entrants into the marketplace.  It's a whole different dynamic that's out there.  So, starting in, you know, the '70s [1970s] and fast forward to the 2000s, because of the dynamics of this market being so open and so, Chicago is known as a fragmented, unconsolidated market where no one market player has greater than 50 percent market share.  And because of that, everybody looks at is as a, as a, as a unconsolidated opportunity, but because the market is so unique, many have tried and many have failed.
Speaker 1: So you've seen a lot, I mean from the time that you started until now, there have been a lot of different dynamics in the Chicago banking industry in terms of, you know, companies that have been there.  And you know, like you say Continental where you really wanted to start at, I mean they're gone?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's been, it's a, it's a trail littered with a lot of, you know, expectations around success.  WaMu came in, Washington Mutual [Washington Mutual, Inc.] came in thinking they had a magic formula and it didn't work because Chicago is a very unique, it's--Chicago is like a big, it's like a big little town (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it's very insulated, then there's a non-Chicago.  I think I appreciate that even more because I recognize that Chicago is not a place where if you're not native or if you're not part of the established, not in crowd, that's the wrong word, but the established crowd then it's very difficult to break in.  And I think a lot of outsiders look at it and go great, I'm consolidated, I'm gonna come right in, I'm gonna swoop and grab market share, and it just doesn't happen.

Speaker 1: Now you mentioned Ed Williams [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] as one of your mentors.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there any other people that influenced your career through Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: There were several people, you know, Ed being the principal one.  There's a gentleman named Ben Nelson who ran the corporate bank and Ben was always a strong guidance fix--figure for me.  He formed a lot of my career and was very influential and helpful to me in my career.  Our former CEO, Al McNally [Alan G. McNally], was also a very supportive person to me in my career here at the bank and had a big influence on success that I achieved.  I would also say there were a lot of people who played different roles and different parts, but if you were asking me to name a couple that were prominent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I would certainly mention those in the first instance.  And I'd also say--I would mention my recently former colleague, Yasmin Bates [Yasmin T. Bates Brown].  And since she's been here as long as I had been here, we supported one another in many different ways, and so in my career here since we started the same time, both as a mentor and as a colleague, she played an invaluable role in keeping me sane in times when I wanted to become insane.
Speaker 1: Now has she left Harris?
Speaker 2: She retired in March.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay.  In 1996, and I don't know if you were involved in this, Harris acquired Household bank [Household International, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any of that transaction?
Speaker 2: I was not.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time I was still in the corporate bank.
Story_ID: 639395
Speaker 1: From a chronological standpoint, where are you now, say in the first part of the '80s [1980s]?  Have you gone beyond this manager position?
Speaker 2: In the first part of the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, when did you hit that, that level?
Speaker 2: Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay and since then, give us kind of a progression of where you went after that?
Speaker 2: So in '86 [1986] I became a team, a team leader--was it, I have to, I have to think back.  Eighty-four [1984] to '86 [1986] I became a team leader then I became a division administrator in '86 [1986], so that's the first level.  Team leader is kind of an informal management position (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but a division administrator at the time was a formal management position.  From that point in '86 [1986], in '88 [1988] I was promoted to senior vice president and group executive, and then in 1998, I was promoted to executive vice president.  So that was the progression in terms of my career going from, you know, really relationship manager to a team leader to a division administrator to a senior vice president to then executive vice president.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm gonna ask you a little bit more detail about those positions.  What were your responsibilities, say as a division manager?
Speaker 2: As division administrator you have a (background noise) team of relationship managers who report to you.  So it's the first level of management if you would.  You've got, you're assigned a portfolio or an area.  In my case, I was assigned to, actually to a market that I had a chance to start from the ground up.  It was called the tax exempt institutions market, where we kind of brought together all the not-for-profit organizations in the organization.  And Ben Nelson, who I referred to earlier, gave me the opportunity to not only create that market, but also to manage it as its first division administrator.  So, in that responsibility as a, as a DA, is what we called them, a DA would have RMs, relationship managers, who report to him or her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then an assigned portfolio which is either geography based or market based.  In my case, it was market specific because of the specialty.  And you are, you are accountable for the growth of that portfolio for the individuals who are part of your, your division and, and the overall direction and contribution it provides to the corporate bank [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  So that was my first specific assignment.
Story_ID: 639396
Speaker 1: You were talking a little bit about your position with the kind of the special industries group.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: You said you had tax exempt institutions.  Now what is the relationship with those type of institutions, I mean are you making loans or--?
Speaker 2: We have the same kind of commercial relationship Tom [Thomas Jefferson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --with tax exempt institutions as we do with a--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We talk about it as for-profit and not-for-profit organizations, but it's still a corporation.  So a corporation still has needs and you want to serve the needs of a corporation irrespective of its tax status.  There's some different nuances in terms of how they borrow or what their board of directors might be, but it is a commercial relationship and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so we had a specialty, we have a specialty area that deals with those kinds of entities and so I had an opportunity to start that market for us and then run it as part of a larger group.
Speaker 1: Now you started that. What brought that to your mind, or why did you see that as a niche to get into?
Speaker 2: Two--a couple things.  First of all, it was an area I had an interest in.  You know, educational institutions, tax exempt organizations, those kinds of entities were intriguing because as a commercially oriented bank [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] we'd always treated them as almost like stepchildren.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's like okay, gosh, you really don't really wanna deal with those kinds of companies because they don't have the same opportunities as say, you know, some exciting companies like Schwinn [Schwinn Bicycle Company] or Rust Oleum [Rust Oleum Corporation] or others like that.  So that was, that was a area of interest.  Secondarily as a, as a banker I wanted to make sure I was on track in terms of my promotions and a lot of my peers were being promoted to other markets in a leadership role and I felt like, you know, I needed to find someplace that I could have the same opportunity and I wasn't sure about when the others would come.  This was something that I saw as being an opportunity for me to move and advance my career by having the assignment for that as a division administrator, so I stepped into that role because it would be an (background noise) opportunity for me to move ahead.
Speaker 1: Did you have any resistance in terms of--I mean this is not an area that you think about--in terms of commercial banking?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When you brought this to management, what was kind of the reaction?
Speaker 2: It was mixed.  I'd say my immediate supervisor didn't really see the same level of opportunity, but Ben Nelson, who I alluded to earlier, and I talked about it.  And at the time, Ben said, "You know what? This has always been something in the back of my mind that I thought would make some sense and I couldn't get anybody to be excited about trying to pursue it."  So it happened that I had the right idea with the person who was able to make the decision (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so it's where, you know, I guess opportunity meets, you know, inspiration or whatever the right phraseology is.  But it was a match.  And Ben said, "Then good, I'm gonna give you authorization.  Make it happen."
Speaker 1: What are some of the tax exempt organizations that you brought into that group?
Speaker 2: Well I mentioned the Evangelical Lutheran Church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in America [Evangelical Lutheran Church in America] as one.  There's--a lot of them are ones that wouldn't necessarily be household names.  A lot of healthcare organizations kind of came into our portfolio as a function of our, of our work in the marketplace.  A lot of local not-for-profit organizations, universities in the area, large human service organizations in the area that we have relationships with, we've kind of consolidated them and made them grow.  So I'd say, you know, pretty much a cross section--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --of entities, the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], just to give you a name of a major client of ours and one that we've grown our relationship with over time.  It also includes units of government, the City of Chicago [Illinois], the County of Cook [Cook County], the State of Illinois.  All are part of the amalgamation of entities that would constitute the tax exempt institutions market.
Speaker 1: Now you were about thirty-seven at this time when you first start this group?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: How--you were about thirty-seven years old then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have to go back and do the math, but let's say sure.
Speaker 1: It seems like you're still fairly young in terms of your career.  Did you feel you were advancing at the, at the rate that you kind of wanted to?
Speaker 2: Well Tom, what I would say is in any organization you have markers and the markers tend to be the people you come--in this company--tends to be the people you came in with and where are they if they started at the same time in their career, where are you.  And you're always worried about being too far behind to catch up.  Now you can catch up, but I think that a smart person kind of takes a sense as to where he or she is and if you see there being any slippage, then you want to try and address that.  And in my case at that age, I was looking at my peer group and many of them, as I said before, were being assigned to existing markets with responsibilities that said that they were on the right track. I hadn't gotten that call.  So I thought it might be important for me to make sure that I didn't get too far behind.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So when I learned of this opportunity, talked with Ben about it, saw it as being an opportunity for me to kind of stay on track with my peers, I immediately sought it out.
Story_ID: 639397
Speaker 1: Then from there, it says that you joined the diversity council. What--what was that and what is that?
Speaker 2: The diversity council is an internal entity where we try and talk about issues of valuing differences, you know, issues of, of, of diversity and inclusion to make sure that inside our company we're basically practicing other things that we hold to be important (background noise) as relates to those important issues and topics.  And so it was really kind of, it was--it's been started by almost every CEO, but the iteration that I was most involved in was under Al McNally [Alan G. McNally] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --who I alluded to before.  It was interesting, Al is a Canadian, he was born and raised in Canada, came down with a very different view towards diversity and inclusion at a company like Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  And so his lens for diversity, his lens for inclusion were much sharper because I think that, like I mentioned to you Tom [Thomas Jefferson], being a non-Chicagoan I can see the Chicago marketplace very differently with much clearer eyes then someone who might have grown up here.  I think Al as a non-American came in and looked at issues of inclusion and diversity very differently than others might have looked at it who might not have had the same perspective as he.  And so the diversity council in its form with Al's leadership was something I got actively involved in because the diversity council was chaired by Al McNally.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So our CEO actually chaired the diversity council.  We made some major steps towards making inroads in terms of inclusion, in terms of reaching out to make sure our organization reflected the kind of diversity that we wanted.  And that was alluded to in the, in the recap of my bio.
Speaker 1: Now did that also include diversity in terms of your suppliers or just was this all internal?
Speaker 2: This was more internal in terms of our people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --our staffing, promotion.  Look- looking at things like promotion, looking at things like percentage of workforce in various areas, looking at things like, you know, activities that would support and celebrate diversity, and then give rise to things like our diversity, our affinity groups. We have four distinct affinity groups and Ed Williams [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] was involved in the creation of those.  There are four and our diversity council supports the efforts of our affinity groups, which advance the issue of inclusion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --celebration of diversity, and the like.
Speaker 1: Now I saw when we came in there was a banner about Asian American--
Speaker 2: Heritage Month.
Speaker 1: --Heritage Month?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  The month of May is the Asian American Heritage Month [Asian Pacific American Heritage Month] which we celebrated here for several years and I'm proud to say that I was the executive sponsor for AACE [Asian American Coalition of Employees] for four years.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I just rotated off last year and a woman named Pam Piarowski [Pamela C. Piarowski] is now the executive sponsor for AACE.  On every one of the major affinity groups, we have a, have an executive sponsor who would be senior member of the management team who would support that particular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --affinity group, and so for four years I had the privilege of being the executive sponsor for AACE, succeeding Ed Williams who preceded me in that role.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are the other affinity groups?
Speaker 2: AALPs, which is the African American League of Professionals.  Then there is--and I've got the name wrong, but I call it the Hispanic networking group, it's really the Hispanic affinity group [BMO Harris Latino Alliance] that really celebrates the diversity and inclusion in that area.  And then something called Lions Pride which looks at gay, lesbian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and transgender issues and celebrates the diversity of that group.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So there is a lot of corporate support for that, for that--those type of initiatives?
Speaker 2: There is, there is, both internally, and as well as externally.  The adjunct or the, I guess the corollary to that would be externally.  I've been involved in a couple of external organizations, one of which is very specifically involved in issues of diversity and inclusion, and it's a direct outgrowth I would say of the internal work that was done in the diversity council where we wanna have senior leaders involved in organizations that are a part of that brought community commitment.
Speaker 1: Now some corporations when they look at those type of organizations don't put as much weight on them because they don't think they add to the bottom line.  Has Harris seen that in terms of, you know, supporting these organizations?  How has it benefited the company itself?
Speaker 2: Tom, you make a good point.  I think that when you look at it and you don't think of it holistically, you kind of look at the efforts related to race and gender and inclusion as a tax on the business.  I've heard, and it's a painful thing to hear where I hear some business leaders go like this is just a tax on the business. I gotta, I gotta pay this tax in order to proceed, and I would say those are unenlightened leaders.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Those who embrace it--and going back to Al McNally, McNally, he looked at this as a competitive advantage.  He looked at diversity and inclusion as a way to really kind of move the corporate agenda forward with much greater efficiency, because if you look at, you know, markets or opportunity and you look at the whole playing field, it's a diverse playing field.  And being able to represent appropriately all aspects of that is a smart business decision.  So enlightened leaders look at diversity and inclusion as a competitive edge. Unenlightened leaders and, and people who don't fully understand the true potentiality for diversity look at is as a tax on the business and, and, and I think it's to their peril.
Story_ID: 639398
Speaker 1: In 1994 you were elected, you were promoted to senior vice president and market executive.
Speaker 2: That's correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did that involve?
Speaker 2: It basically was when I took on group responsibilities, so in addition to the tax exempt institutions group, I took on responsibility for the manager of the, of the real estate team and the manager of the construction industry market team to report to me.  So, I had managers of divisions reporting to me and that constitutes in our vernacular in the corporate bank, a group.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I was a group executive and had responsibility for a series of markets under the leadership of three individuals.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  How many employees would've been under your control or under your guidance at that point?
Speaker 2: This is just a rough guess (background noise), but probably somewhere between fifty to seventy-five professionals (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --would've been part of that group at the time with those three markets being the primary focus of their responsibility.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was that the last position you had before your current position?
Speaker 2: No.  So, in 1998 I took on responsibility, in addition to the group responsibility, for something called the LaSalle Street Project.  So I had two jobs, my job as the group manager for special industries group and the project lead for LaSalle Street Project.  LaSalle Street Project in the, in the Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], and again it was commissioned by Al McNally [Alan G. McNally], was roughly I guess kind of modeled after the Jesse Jackson LaSalle Street Project initiative which he be--which actually became the Wall Street Project initiative and then in Chicago [Illinois] it became the LaSalle Street Project initiative.  And that was again a commitment on the part of the organization to be inclusive from a diversity perspective for businesses.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because diversity--when we talk about the diversity council, it's focused internally towards the employee base.  The LaSalle Street Project from a diversity perspective was focused externally in terms of inclusion and in terms of our supplier base which gets back to the question you asked before.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it was the (background noise), it was the start, if you will, of a longer term commitment that the organization had made to really working with the diverse business community in being more inclusive and being more supportive of partnerships and working relationships with providers.  And I had the opportunity to really be the leader, if you will, of that activity.  So that began in 1998.  In 2000, we made some changes in the way we configured our corporate bank, so in addition to, at that time, I took on a role in what we then called business banking which was part of our community bank, and moved out of the specialty market, that market actually kind of got absorbed in, what we then called Harris Nesbitt.  So I took on a different role in 2000, including LaSalle Street Project work, but then starting up something we call our mid market team.  So the middle layer of companies, companies around $50 million, they went from $10 million to about $250 million in size, privately held in Chicago.  And I was the group executive for that activity from 2000 to 2003.  Then in 2003, I rolled--rotated into my current--not my current position, but into what is now the retail bank as a, as a regional president.  And in 2006, became a district executive and that's what I remain as today.
Story_ID: 639399
Speaker 1: I'm gonna step back to LaSalle--
Speaker 2: LaSalle Street Project?
Speaker 1: How did that get that name?
Speaker 2: Because Al McNally [Alan G. McNally] and Ed Williams [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] went to a meeting where Jesse Jackson, Sr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] talked about the work with the Wall Street Project to a group of Chicago [Illinois] business leaders who were enlightened and who were very interested in what that work was and how it could be translated into Chicago.  And LaSalle Street Project initiative came out of the conversations that Al and Ed had with the reverend and wanting to put that same commitment for our organization in the form of the LaSalle Street Project.  So we called it that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as really just a moniker, but it really meant we're figuring out ways to do business with a diverse business community in ways we hadn't done before.
Speaker 1: How did that work out?  How has it worked out since then?
Speaker 2: It--Tom [Thomas Jefferson], I'd say that we're still on the journey for the five years I had responsibility for that project, which would've been from 1998 to 2003.  We did a lot of good ground laying work in terms of studying the markets, looking at how and where we could be (background noise) successful and how we could be inclusive and really try to design strategies around advocating on behalf of minority owned businesses with a lot of business leaders.  We then kind of went through a process of trying to work it into our marketing area and now it's really kind of made itself manifest in what we call a minority supplier directive or minority supplier strategic commitment that is headed up by a woman named Casey Mosley [ph.].  So she's in charge of minority supplier diversity for the organization (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and is the manager of that unit.  So it's got formal status, not only in the United States, but in Canada and it's really managed by an individual, Casey Mosely, who drives that important initiative forward in our organization.  So I--we've made progress, we continue to make progress.  Is it as great as I would like to have seen it? No.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Is it--is it better than many? I'd say yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  What--just going back to what you said, what would you like to see it become in the future?
Speaker 2: What I'd like to see it become in the future is embedded in the fabric of how we do business.  Diversity only works when you don't have to think about when you do it because it's a natural part of what you do.  A few successful companies like McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation], McDonald's doesn't think diversity. They live diversity because, you know, they have to.  Their success is inextricably linked to being able to offer their product in all communities.  They don't just say we're only gonna put McDonald's in certain communities. They put them in all communities.  And by definition, that's diverse.  So that's what I'd like to see embedded in the fabric of our, of our organizational structure, organizational strategies, not as an add on, but as a, as a, as a matter of course.  And then I think when you don't have to--I'll put it like this Tom, when you don't have to talk about it as a separate initiative, then you'll know you've gotten there.
Speaker 1: Now a lot of corporations who, you know, go down that path they want them to have some kind of measurement of their success. How does Harris [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] measure it's success in this area of LaSalle Street Project?
Speaker 2: Well, LaSalle Street Project doesn't exist anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we now measure it in terms of minority supplier diversity in through measures that Casey has developed in terms of either a percentage of spend- absolute dollar amount of spend with minority or women owned enterprises, as the key measure of success.  Percentage of total spend is one indicator, so if you're spending, you know, a certain percentage in a particular area and a percentage that is held by a minority or women business owned organizations and that grows over time, that's a good thing.  The absolute dollar amount, you know, is configured similarly and grows over time, that's a good thing.  So, that's how we measure success.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Now I was looking at your website. There is actually a part of your website that kind of says how you become a supplier to Harris Bank.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Was that developed during the time that you were there or is that?
Speaker 2: Subsequent.
Speaker 1: Subsequent, okay.
Speaker 2: But it's a, it's a, it's a natural outgrowth of being committed to this objective.  You wanna be inclusive, you want to encourage people to--who might want to do business with you that you don't know about to have an opportunity and a venue, as opposed to feeling like they are shutout or excluded from ever having a chance to do business with an organization like ours.
Story_ID: 639400
Speaker 1: Your next step is, is now where your current position is or was there something before that?
Speaker 2: Well, so, we talked about in, in, in 2003--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I became a regional president and had responsibility for what was called the city region, and so that was in 2000, from 2003 to 2006.  And then in 2006, we went from ten regions to five districts, and I became a district executive in 2006 for what was, what is called the central district which is really Chicago [Illinois] and the contiguous suburbs by and large, including all the branches in that district, as well as the commercial and some of the wealth activity in that same geographic subset, and that's what I do today.  So I'm called what's a district executive, and there are five of us.
Speaker 1: So that you're more into the retail banking side now than just the commercial and corporate?
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.  Which I had not--up until 2003 I'd never been involved in the retail business at all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I'd always been a corporate banker.  So the majority of my career has been spent as a corporate banker, but I use that experience to really help grow and leverage our retail business, because there's a, there's a linkage and a relationship between business and retail, and a person who has a background in business can help identify and drive that forward.
Story_ID: 639401
Speaker 1: Now, how many branches do you have in Chicago [Illinois] area?
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight.
Speaker 1: Thirty-eight (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In my district we have thirty-eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you decide where to put a branch, a new branch?
Speaker 2: It's, often times, it's art more than science, but there is a science to it as well.  You tend to look at where you think, from a convenience perspective, the customers would like to have a location to serve them.  So for example, you wouldn't put a branch right smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood because you're not gonna serve as many clients.  You'll put them on a major thoroughfare with good access to transportation, whether it be public or individual transportation.  You'll put it near a natural destination so, a food store for example is a natural destination or a retail center is a natural destination, so you wanna try and incorporate that into the process.  You want to have good ingress and egress so you wanna put it in a place where you got good opportunities to have a comfortable traffic pattern.  So you factor all that in and then you look at available space, then you look at cost and you try and project what you think you'll generate in revenues, and then you make your decision.  So it's art and science combined.
Speaker 1: Now TCF [TCF Bank] and I think Chase [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] are now into Jewels [Jewel Osco] and Dominick's [Dominick's Finer Foods].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that a area you ever thought about going into yourselves?
Speaker 2: We looked at it Tom [Thomas Jefferson], but there's some real--there are pros and cons to it, and for our business model it has more cons then pros.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: When we talk about a client experience, which is one of the things that our organization is very focused on, making sure that our clients have the right kind of experience every time they do business with us [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].  That can't always be assured in a grocery store.  There are too many uncontrollable variables that take place in that kind of environment.  So for our strategy and for our business model, a grocery store does not work, does not work well.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it's not a place that you should expect to see us showing up any time soon.
Story_ID: 639402
Speaker 1: How many ATMs [automated teller machine] do you have now?
Speaker 2: I should know the number and I don't, but I can tell you this, we've got the second highest number of, of ATMs deployed of any institution in the city [Chicago, Illinois] or in, in this marketplace.  And there's two different cuts on this which I'll share.  One is the number of ATM locations, where I think Chase [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] has the greatest--I'm sorry number, absolute number of ATMs where Chase has the greatest absolute number of ATMs.  So they've got, you know, a number of machines, the greatest number of machines of any other provider.  If you look at the number of ATM locations, which is where do you have a location that has a ATM, that's where we are--our advantage and that's why we come in number two because while Chase may have across the street twenty-four machines at One Chase Plaza, we have, you know, say maybe eight or ten here, but we have one at every one of our branches, so we've got 280 locations throughout, you know, the three state area, plus we have Speedway [Speedway LLC], which is another affiliate entity, so we've got ATMs there.  So we have the number of individual locations that we have machines.  A lot of people don't realize that, but we've got a great number.  So that's why the answer is a little bit more convoluted then you probably asked.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you the same thing about ATMs that I asked you about branches.  How do you decide where to put an ATM?
Speaker 2: The ATM decision is even more artful then science.  We typically always have an ATM where we have a branch.  So if we have a branch, we're gonna have a ATM. That's almost universal.  The others are--you look at the potential number of transactions that you can generate at a particular location and the number of transactions have either on us or non-on us transactions, and you generate fees.  So if it's a, if it's an in bank transaction then we don't generate any income from that. It's a matter of convenience for our customers.  If it's a non-on us transaction, so if it's a, if it's a, an account holder at Chase, for example, then there's a fee that's paid.  There's revenue associated with that.  So there's a--there's a sit--a set of metrics around trying to determine how many transactions, how many of them will likely be non-on us transactions, how much revenue will that generate.  Then you look at the cost of the machine because there is a cost to the machine.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's gotta be serviced, it's gotta be, you know, you know, kind of kept up with technology and maintenance and there's a breakeven point.  And you look at that to say can I afford to put this machine here, is it gonna enhance the client experience.  Will our clients benefit from this and obviously you can't quantify that, but you go through that analysis and then you make the decision as to whether or not you're gonna make the investment or commitment to putting an ATM there.
Story_ID: 639403
Speaker 1: You're doing more retail banking.  One thing that you hear a lot from, particularly a consumer organization is bank fees.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What is Harris' [Harris Trust and Savings Bank; BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] kind of position on how many fees do you charge and how do you, you know, determine the amount of the fees.  I mean ATM [automated teller machine] fees are really a big sticking point it seems--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with a lot of consumers.  How do you decide what the ATM fee is gonna be and--I mean is it just market driven or is it just profit driven, how do you come up with those numbers?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna give you a direct answer that's not very direct (laughter).  So, it's a, it's a, it's a number of factors that go into it.  Our objective is to try and have a client experience that encourages the client to do multiple services with us.  The more services you do with us, the more we're able to make sure that we insulate you from some of the ancillary fees that you refer to.  So if we have a full relationship with a client, our objective is to try and make sure that we price and position the products such that they are more insulated from a lot of the one off fees that would occur.  I'll give you a good example.  If you are a noncustomer, you come in to cash a check with us that is drawn on us.  As a noncustomer, we're gonna charge you five bucks [dollars] for cashing the check, which is one of the fees that people talk about.  Why are you charging me five bucks to cash a check when it's drawn on you? It's your check.  But you're not our customer.  If you're a customer, you come in and cash a check, as many checks as you want, it doesn't cost you anything at all.  So our philosophy is to try and encourage you to do more with us because the more you do with us, then the easier it is for us to make sure we insulate you from some of the fees that you alluded to that have become so much in the news.  Now having said that the fees, themselves, are typically market driven.  It's a, it's a, it's not really a cost recovery issue because you can't necessarily recover all your costs in the fees you might charge because oftentimes it's just difficult to do that.  So it tends to be more market driven, more market base in tur- relative to the fees that are assessed, whether they be ATM fees or overdraft fees, or other ancillary fees that are part and parcel.  But our objective and our business strategy is to try and encourage you to do multiple services with us, to escape the fee structure that you alluded to.
Speaker 1: Now you say it's somewhat market driven.  There are some banks, I don't know if Chase [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] is one of them, they are reimbursing those fees that are drawn on non-Chase ATMs.  Has Harris looked at that as a, as an area?
Speaker 2: What I think you're alluding to Tom [Thomas Jefferson] is that there are, there are packaging and strategic marketing programs that may be either short term or long term, where there will be fee reversals or you know, there'll be some that'll say your first two or three ATM charges are gonna be waved.  It's just a systematic way of trying to give a discount to what amounts to an exogenous feeless charge.  We look at that, we tend to try and be more straightforward in saying, "If you do this, this is what we'll give you" as opposed to saying, "If you run into this we'll try and take care of it for you--" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --"--after the fact."  We try and be more proactive rather than reactive in what we do.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's just how we approach our clients and how we try and define the client experience that works for our customers.
Story_ID: 639404
Speaker 1: We were talking about some of the, particularly ATM [automated teller machine] and some of the new regulations that our [U.S.] Congress has passed and trying to address some of the consumer issues that have been raised about fees and things like that.  When those kind of things change, what does Chase [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] do to kind of address it.  Do you have, I assume you have a compliance department?
Speaker 2: We do.
Speaker 1: And is that one of your areas of responsibility, do you, do you manage that group?
Speaker 2: Well when you, when you ask the question, what does Chase do, I can't respond to that.
Speaker 1: Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean Chase (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that's okay (laughter).  You wanted to make sure I was paying attention.  So what Harris [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] does is manage by compliance.  Compliance has a--they, they're the first line of defense to make sure that we are, as an organization being compliant, because that's very important to us because we're obviously a regulated industry.  And then our product area looks at that same issue just to make sure from a product offering perspective we're not putting together a product or a package or a series of products that would be noncompliant.  So between our compliance area, our product area, that really is where the first, you know, look at any change regulation or regulatory environment would be made.  And then it will be communicated to the field, the field leadership team so that we can then make sure we're coaching and guiding and directing our people and more importantly our customers accordingly.  So that's how it works in our organization.
Speaker 1: Is that, is that under your group now that you have retail banking?
Speaker 2: No.  We have support partners so our compliance area, our product area all support the, the relationship team who have what we call the field leadership team so they would be partners with us and really trying to serve our customer which is the end objective.
Story_ID: 639405
Speaker 1: Talking about, let's get back to the industry itself.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Chase [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] does mortgage lending, has--I'm, I'm sorry, (laughter) I said Chase again (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's okay.
Speaker 1: Harris [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: They do (laughter).
Speaker 1: How has you, your company been affected by what's happening in the market in the last two years, what we've been calling the financial meltdown in the, in the, in the industry?
Speaker 2: Tom [Thomas Jefferson], there's no question that the malaise in the mortgage market has impacted anybody. Any financial services provider who said that they weren't impacted by the changes over the last, you know, three to four years is either fibbing or they're out of touch with reality, and you wanna run quickly from them if they have either of those two issues.  And we're no different.  The salvation that we have is that we were not involved in predatory lending and so therefore, that was not an issue that we had to resolve.  However, home values declined 40 percent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know, commercial properties had diminished in value that was unprecedented and the bottom dropped out of the market overnight so it impacted our portfolio, impacted our ability to lend into that marketplace with the same aggressiveness or posture that we had before.  So we've had to kind of, you know (background noise), adapt accordingly.  We continue, though, to support the mortgage market.  We continue to be involved in actively trying to support communities in our marketplace both commercially, as well as from a retail perspective.  We just have to be smarter about how we approach it and make sure that we're mindful of the, of the overall market environment.
Speaker 1: Did Harris get any stimulus money?
Speaker 2: We did not.  We got no TARP [Troubled Asset Relief Program] funds in part because--well we are owned--our parentage is by Bank of Montreal [BMO Financial Group].  Bank of Montreal is our sole shock- stockholder.  So the stimulus funds were intended for domestically owned organizations, and as such, we didn't qualify.
Speaker 1: In terms of your mortgage business, do you portfolio all your mortgage, you don't sell them to the secondary market?
Speaker 2: We do sell them to the second.  We sell conforming Fannie [Federal National Mortgage Association] and Freddie [Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation] loans in the secondary market.  We hold our portfolio of custom mortgage loans where we have customer jumbo loans, we'll hold those, although some of those get sold as well.  So we have a portion we hold, but the majority we tend to sell.
Speaker 1: Where do you see--let's talk about the mortgage market. Where is that going now?  I mean given the decline in the housing values, are you stepping up your mortgage lending and coming up with new products?  How are you reacting to that?
Speaker 2: Well, our posture in the mortgage market is a critical--if you're gonna sell--serve the retail marketplace in a community, you have to be able to offer a mortgage product.  And so we are committed to the mortgage business as we must be.  It has been a very good business for us and we want to find ways to make sure we continue to be actively involved in that.  Starting next month, we're gonna introduce a new FHA [Federal Housing Administration] product or reconnect with FHA to be able to broaden our base of clients that we're able to work with, and so we're actually excited about that because by being able to say yes more often and the FHA product, then we think that's gonna help enhance that business.  But from a retail perspective, if you think about a mortgage application, the information that comes from that, it really gives you a window to the world on being able to assess a customer's needs, determine if there is a way to serve them better and come up with products and solutions that can help them.  And so without that, I think you are limited.  So our intent is to remain committed and focus on that market and to, you know, find ways to work with this dynamic that's currently going on in the marketplace to still, you know, serve our customers.
Speaker 1: And how about on the commercial lending side? I mean that area is being hit pretty hard now also.
Speaker 2: It is in certain areas.  I mean certain areas are still, you know, stable. Some areas obviously have been, have been affected more than others.  But our commitment to our commercial business is as strong, and in fact we just restructured our commercial business to really be even more focused on trying to define, you know, where we wanna play and how we wanna play in that marketplace and kind of organizing our relationship teams around that.  I think the word Tom for us would be, we're not gonna be all things to all people, because we can't and shouldn't be.  But those things that we're committed to do, we're committed to do them in a way that, that makes a meaningful difference.
Story_ID: 639406
Speaker 1: So where do you see Harris [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] focusing on in the next say five to ten years?
Speaker 2: So, so it's a question that probably will be better answered by Ellen Costello [Ellen M. Costello] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --our CEO than me in terms of, you know, a true answer to the question.  But I'll give you my view.  We're gonna be focused on our retail footprint.  We're gonna be focused on our commercial marketplace.  We're gonna be focused on our wealth or affluent, you know, posture in this marketplace.  Those three legs of the stool will drive and propel us forward.  So retail, commercial and wealth will be integral part of our strategy over the next three to five years.  And winning in those three key business areas will determine our success as an organization, in addition to looking at the overall marketplace in terms of acquisitions, which of course we've been involved in as you, as you may know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Where do you see your next area of personal growth in terms of Harris?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the way I've approached my career is that, you know, I try and do the best job that I can in the area that I've been respo- responsible for, and with few exceptions I haven't raised my hands saying, "Gosh I'd like to move over here or over there," but sometimes the organization has a way of looking at where people have been successful and saying, "Gosh there's another area that we need to have some help and if this person has been successful there, they likely are able to help us in this area."  So I don't worry a lot about, you know, what my next move is. I worry more about making sure that what I'm doing currently is, is done to the highest level of execution.
Story_ID: 639407
Speaker 1: Now, you've been involved in some--a lot of civic activities. Can you give us kind of a flavor for some of the things that you've been involved in?
Speaker 2: Sure.  As I was saying earlier, as it, as it related to some of the diversity council work, I've been very fortunate to be involved in an organization called Chicago United.  Chicago United is a membership organization where you have corporate members that are committed to issues of inclusion and diversity from a corporate perspective.  And this organization, our president is named Gloria Castillo, and she's been there for the past five years and has done a terrific job.  I've, I have had an opportunity to serve not only as a board member, but as board chair for two years and that's been an area where I continue to devote a great deal of time and effort in working with the Chicago United.  I've also been involved with an organization called LISC which is the Local Initiatives Support Corporation headquartered here in Chicago [Illinois].  A gentleman named Andy Mooney [Andrew Mooney] is the executive director and it involves infrastructure financing for development ac- activity in communities that are LOMA [Letter of Map Amendment] census track areas, those hard to get dollars for the initial funding for infrastructure or development is where we focus and we bring together other--we kind of aggregate resources from various funding sources to direct them to areas that would need capital and seed capital, but can't get it from traditional sources for that very difficult to find startup phase.  I've also been involved in my undergraduate alma mater, Western Michigan University [Kalamazoo, Michigan], where I serve on the business advisory council for the school of business [Haworth College of Business, Kalamazoo, Michigan] and I just went on the foundation board, the foundation board for the university just last year in September.  So I've been active in those two organizations.  And so those are the main focal points.  I've also worked a little bit with the Real Men Mead--Read program [Real Men Read] for the city, or the Chicago Public Schools, which was a very rewarding experience.  And there's other things, but those are the main things that I work on.
Speaker 1: You're also a soccer coach?
Speaker 2: I was (laughter), I was.  It wasn't because I played, it's 'cause my son [Neamen Lewis] has been involved in it and so there was a club soccer program that he was involved in and I was very much involved in.  It was very important to him and his career development, the Rich Township [Illinois] soccer club.  So yes, I coached and, and, and had a board position there as well.
Story_ID: 639408
Speaker 1: Let's get back to your, your, your family.  Where--you said you met your wife [Jacqueline James Lewis] at--in undergraduate school?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how many children do you have now?
Speaker 2: We have two, we have two children.  I have a son [Neamen Lewis] and a daughter [Kamilah Lewis Anderson].
Speaker 1: And when were they born?
Speaker 2: My daughter was born August 20, 1980, and my son was born on the Ides of March, March 15, 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are they doing now?
Speaker 2: My daughter is--she was an accounting major, graduated from Butler University [Indianapolis, Indiana] with an accounting degree.  She worked for Deloitte and Touche [Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited] for just under four years and then took an opportunity at the Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois].  So she works at the Northern Trust as a, as an accountant in the, in their accounting area working with internal accounting activity, and has enjoyed that.  My son graduated from Millikin University in Decatur [Illinois], and then got his master's in sports marketing administration at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York.  And so he now works for a marketing agency here in Chicago [Illinois] as a, as a marketing representative and is involved in external activities where he's a representative, account representative for the firm he works for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did you say wife does?
Speaker 2: She is a M.S.W., was a school social worker for many years and just last year stepped down after having completed her career as a early childhood program administrator for the Glenwood public school district in Glenwood, Illinois.
Speaker 1: That's kind of a ways from Olympia Fields [Illinois] in going up there?
Speaker 2: Well, she enjoyed being an M.S.W., being involved with the schools (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --with the, with the children in school, but this was a natural adjunct and so it was a program that was funded by the state and so she ran it for about five years and then elected to step down a little bit early--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and enjoy some other pursuits.  So she's doing that as we speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's go back a little bit to your brother, your siblings because there, there're a number of you.  What kind of careers have they gone into, starting with your oldest and coming down?
Speaker 2: Well, I told you that my mom [Martha Williams Lewis] always emphasized education, didn't define it other than beyond high school.  So one of the things I think she's most--I don't know if she's, think she's proud of it, is the fact that of the eight of us, six of the eight have gone on to further education.  So my oldest sister [Lolita Lewis Ransom], while she didn't complete a four year education, she did go on to take on some junior college courses and she completed her career as a, as a--she worked for the IRS, Internal Revenue Service, and was a systems analyst for the IRS in Detroit [Michigan].  Then going in chronological order, my sister beneath me, Marva [Marva Lewis], actually graduated from Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and got her Ph.D. from University of Colorado in Boulder [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  And she is now a professor at Tulane University in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So she's a, she's a tenured professor at Tulane.  My sister below her, Brenda [Brenda Lewis Morris], has taken classes, she does not have her undergraduate degree, but that was--her focus when she came out of school was really to kind of be family oriented.  So she's raised, she's successfully raised two kids and is a grandmother, and now is taking some classes later on in life after having had a successful career at a, at a utility company in Michigan.  My brother beneath her, his undergraduate degree was at Lawrence Institute of Technology [Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, Michigan], got his master's at, his M.B.A. at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and he's relocated to Atlanta [Georgia].  He retired from GM [General Motors Company, Detroit, Michigan] and is actually doing some consulting work in the Atlanta area.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Timothy [Timothy Lewis].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother beneath him is Perry [Perry Lewis].  He also, he went to undergraduate school at Michigan, got his M.B.A. from Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], worked in the corporate world for several years and now doing some consulting with a company in Atlanta as well, and is working there with his, raising his family.  My brother beneath him, my youngest brother Robert [Robert Lewis], his--he graduated from Michigan as well, we got a lot of Michigan grads here.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm seeing.  Is there kind of a rivalry between Michigan and Western Michigan [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well they were smart enough to get into Michigan, I wasn't.  And so he graduated from Michigan and he got his, he got his M.B.A. from a, from a school out east and he lives in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] now but he's about to take on a project role and will be doing some work for a company, actually overseas, and is about to embark upon that.  And my youngest sister, Donna [Donna Lewis], graduated from Grand Valley State College [Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan] in Grand Rapids, Michigan [sic.] and works for the [U.S.] Postal Service in Atlanta.  So that's what they're doing and where they came, where they graduated from.  But from two parents who did not complete their high school diplomas, we produced a number of diplomas as a result.
Story_ID: 639409
Speaker 1: Is there anything that, in terms of your career, that you would do differently now, looking back upon it?
Speaker 2: Tom [Thomas Jefferson], I think most people would look back on their career and they look at, you know, strategic moves that they made and said, "You know, if I did this move this would have created this opportunity. If I'd done this that would've happened."  So I would be not truthful with you if I said if I had it to do all over again, are there things I'd do differently? Yes there are things I would do differently.  But if I said would I make some major change, like I would not be a banker I would be, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --a Greyhound bus driver, no I wouldn't say that.  That--tho- those aren't the kinds of changes I would make.  There'd be some fine motor skills versus gross motor skills that I would--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I would change, but by and large I wouldn't trade what I've done. I might alter a couple of things that I've done along the way, but that's--I think any reasonable person looking back would, would probably have that view.
Story_ID: 639410
Speaker 1: Now you've been involved in several things that kind of affect the African American community.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for that community, for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I think about the African American business community in particular, particularly here in Chicago [Illinois] which has got one of the most vibrant African American business communities, I think, in the country.  Obviously I haven't lived in New York [New York] or in Atlanta [Georgia] or Los Angeles [California], but I look at the, at the capacity, at the vibrancy of that community and my hope and dream would be that community would coalesce around opportunities to really leverage one another and really kind of make that core even stronger.  Because you've got some world class resources and some world class names in this African American business community in Chicago.  So I would hope and I would dream that one day they would get to the level of prominence that they deserve.  But a lot of things are gonna have to happen in order for that to occur.  So I look at that and I think about that.  I think about some of the talent that doesn't get a chance to surface or really have a opportunity to really show itself in diverse communities and my hope and dream would be that they would have those opportunities presented to them as I have had.  I mean, I had people, as I mentioned before, like a Ben Nelson or like a Ed Williams [HistoryMaker Edward J. Williams] who would help guide me along the way.  I would hope that they would have those guides and those opportunities to really show their full talent in the business role in an unimpeded way.  So, for the individuals, as well as for the broader business community, those are two things that come to mind.
Story_ID: 639411
Speaker 1: I'm gonna jump to something, an area.  If you were a mentor to somebody who was coming up through the Harris ranks [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] right now, what would be some of the key things that you would tell them that they would need to look at in terms of their career?
Speaker 2: One of the things I would say is, make sure that you have an effective mentor (laughter).
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Both--and sometimes mentors look like you and sometimes they don't look like you.  And you may find them in unfamiliar places.  You know, so I, I'd be a very sensitive to who they are and make sure that you support them and you recognize and you, and you respect those relationships, because they have an extraordinary, extraordinary impact on your career.  These are people who are talking about you in places and at times that you either can't be in or don't know about, and depending upon how you've managed or impacted that relationship can make a huge difference in how you progress in this organization.  Second thing I'd tell them is that, you know, while your work isn't everything, sometimes it's the only thing you can control, so make sure you do a really good job at whatever it is that you're assigned to do.  I see a lot of people coming in and go, "This work is beneath me," or, "I think this work is insignificant. I don't really wanna do this," or, "What do they think about me that they think I can only do this?"  You know what, focus on the job at hand and do the job extremely well, and then talk about what you wanna do from the base, from the base of saying I've demonstrated clearly my capability here and I continue to do superior level work. Now, let's talk about what else I might do, you know, in the future, because I've shown command of this.  As opposed to saying well I don't wanna do that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because that's not something that I think is appropriate for me.  So I'd say, make sure that your work, you know, reflects your true capabilities and don't let that be a liability.  And then I guess the last thing I'd tell someone who I mentor is that, you know, you should have fun at what you do.  I mean, the old adage of if you do a job that you love, you'll never work a day in your life is true, and while it can't be 100 percent applied to any situation, I'd say that, you know, trying to have a positive enthusiastic attitude around, you know, working and being involved in a professional capacity is something that does enhance your performance again in ways you can't imagine.  So I'd say, you know, have some fun, you know, incorporate fun into what you do.  And whatever you have to do to incorporate that fun, if it's, if it's maybe saying, "Gosh if I'm an analyst and its really very tedious kind of sitting and working at a computer all day," maybe you then go out and serve as a mentor for other analysts and other external parties so it adds some breadth and depth to what you do.  And you can look at it in a broader context as opposed to gosh I'm just sitting here looking at a screen all day long.  So, I'd say do those three things and that would put you in good stead.
Speaker 1: Kind of along those lines, what do you see, how do you do your work life balance?  I mean, some people get into a corporate world and that becomes their life.  How do you balance out those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: Well Tom [Thomas Jefferson], as I, as I think about what has happened in my career, early on in my career I'd say work life balance was horrid.  I was a hu- 100 percent dedicated towards the job and very small amount was dedicated to non-work activity.  Well I think that, you know, as you have a family and as you have other commitments, that percentage begins to alter itself a little bit, and you have to accept that.  And so as I've moved forward in my career, what I've begun to do is to supplement what I do in my professional capacity with the things that at first were family related and now they're, are civic related activities.  So I talked about the boards that I serve on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the outside activities that I'm involved in.  So the balance really kind of becomes- because you supplement or complement the work with things that are important to you either inside the bank, whether it be a diversity council or an affinity group, or outside the bank in terms of serving on a board or being involved in activities that allow you to give something back to a broader community.  And so, I think that the work life balance initially is focused 100 percent on that job, and that's probably appropriate and has to be if your circumstances allow.  Then as you move forward that balance in terms of dedication towards work, the work part, I think, begins to decrease, but it doesn't go away from the total.  The pie is still the pie, and you just replace that work portion with something else that's important to you and that brings balance to your life.
Story_ID: 639412
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be (audio disturbance)?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like, Yaz [Yasmin T. Bates Brown] and I would joke about this all the time.  We said, "Leave it better than you found it."  So that's less a legacy and more an objective.  But I guess I would say from a legacy perspective, there's a couple things that are important to me.  Particularly since I've been more involved in a retail world.  I, I've had a chance as a, as a corporate banker to really start a couple of important businesses for the bank [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois] that will be legacies.  The tax exempt institutions market that you mentioned is something that I was given the opportunity to start and so that'll be a legacy.  People may not know it, you know, ten years from now but I'll know it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that's fine.  The mid-market activity, I had an opportunity to start that when I moved over here in 2000, and so that will be a legacy.  That was something I started and it's grown, it's taken on a whole new dynamic so that will certainly be a legacy.  But what I think about proactively is probably two things.  One, I mentioned there are thirty-eight retail distribution points in the footprint that we call central district, but in the City of Chicago [Illinois] proper, I would like to see us have a greater footprint, particularly in communities that we are not in now, and that would be in African American markets and the Hispanic markets.  So I would like to create a legacy of us having more distribution points in places that historically have not as a part of any legacy that I might create.  The second thing I would like to see us do is embrace more inclusively diverse markets from a business perspective.  To really kind of look at markets we are not now involved in as actively, Hispanic markets, you know, Asian markets.  We have been involved in African American women owned markets before, but to even get greater penetration there as another legacy.  So if those two things could be added to the dossier, then I feel like back to the comment that Yaz and I made, it was better than I found it--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and that would be good.
Speaker 1: What message or lessons would you like to leave or have you left for your children in terms of your career and, you know, where you'd like to see them have their lives go?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I smile because I thought, what have I left for them?  Well, they'll probably have some money (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But I think that what I've, what I've impressed upon them without necessarily being overbearing is that there's an expectation of success that I've instilled in them.  That is, when people say, "Well we're very pleased, we met your daughter [Kamilah Lewis Anderson] or your son [Neamen Lewis] and they're good people and they are very, you know, professional and disciplined."  I'm going like, okay well I kind of expected that or my children will sometimes say to me, "Well you know, I'm not doing things that are bad or I'm not involved in this. I haven't been in jail, I haven't been arrested or whatever."  I'm going like, okay, well that's interesting, but, you know, I didn't expect to raise a thug.  So, I guess the point I'm making is that what I believe what I've instilled in them is an expectation of success.  I expect you to be successful.  You should expect to be successful yourself in whatever success is defined as.  So if you've got all the raw ingredients for success, education, access to information and support, then the outcome should be success, and so that's my expectation of them.  So I think that's probably the legacy I have instilled in them because of, of, you know, the things that I believe are important.

Speaker 1: Another question, it's, it's kind of similar to legacy: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered as being here right now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, but if you said fast forward to a point when I'm no longer work- walking the planet, I really don't have any expectations about that Tom [Thomas Jefferson].  I believe that, you know, if you do the right thing as you define it and if you try and do it from the heart and for all the right reasons, then you don't have to worry about how you're remembered, how, how you will be remembered.  Because you will be remembered in the right way.

Speaker 1: Have there been any things that during our conversation that you wanna add to what we've talked about or areas that you think we've missed that you would like to--?
Speaker 2: Really, I guess if I were to think about it, I'm proud of the fact that as a former athlete I dispelled some notion that all athletes are not focused on professional careers.  There's a lot of people out here who are former athletes that have done things that are, that are positive.  The other thing I guess we haven't touched on that I probably would think about is there are so many good professional people of color or diverse backgrounds that never really get an opportunity to be recognized.  And I guess I, I'm happy for those who have had a chance to do so, but there are so many others that if people would just take the time to have a conversation and get to know someone who they don't know who's doing something, they're gonna find out something really interesting and really important about someone who's making a positive contribution every day that doesn't get the limelight.  It's kind of like the ten o'clock news. If it bleeds it leads.  You know, but there's a lot of things that aren't bleeding that aren't leading.  And so I would say that that's something that I feel pretty passionate about and I hope that as I've, you know, walked this earth I can have a chance to meet more people who are doing good things and encourage them to keep doing that good work.
Speaker 1: Now it's interesting you said, 'cause that's one of the goals of The HistoryMakers is to identify those people who, you know, are not nationally known, but who have achieved certain things within their careers or their lives that are more lesser known stories of the African American experience.  And that certainly--like I said, that's one of our goals and that's part of what this project is all about.  So, that's a good thing to hear in terms of what we're trying to do, so.  Are there any people that come to your mind that you think haven't gotten the recognition or you know, that you think, you know, done things that would warrant additional attention to what they've done?
Speaker 2: There are.  I need to think about them.  I know there are, I was just thinking as you mentioned that even in this organization [BMO Harris Bank, Chicago, Illinois], there are a lot of pioneers, a lot of shoulders that, you know, one stands on.  You know, I was thinking the corporate bank, I've had a chance to be the (background noise) highest ranked African American in the corporate bank, but there are a lot of folks who preceded me in the corporate bank, who were in the bank in total, who don't get that same recognition, a guy like Winfred Watson [ph.] for example or you know, a guy named L.J. Simmons [ph.].  So there's a lot of stories like that.  You know, or a woman named Lucille Dobbins who were interval--instrumental, probably didn't get the same recognition or attention so when you asked the question, there's lots of good folks like that who preceded and I just hope at some point in time their stories get told too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us a little bit about those three people you just mentioned?
Speaker 2: Well, they were--for people like me in the corporate bank where there's a lot of preconceived notions about what people couldn't do, they dispelled those myths and rumors.  And so they came into the corporate bank and it was not a very hospitable environment and demonstrated capabilities.  So when they demonstrated capabilities and whether it be here or you can go around LaSalle Street, then it became okay to have someone else who looked like them come in and do a job that previously was viewed as being something that folks were incapable.  It's like the Tuskegee Airmen, once they proved that they could fly and support bomber groups then it was okay for, you know, you know, William Davis or others to come along to basically take on positions of responsibility.  So in any organization where you see somebody who's achieved any level of success, there's a lot of folks like that that preceded in order to, to kind of plow the row.  So that was, that was what I was alluding to.

Speaker 1: This picture was taken fifteen years ago.  The reason I remember is because my left hand is on my surgically operated knee.  That knee was actually bandaged because I'd had my first arthroscopic surgery.  I was taken to Hinsdale Hospital [AMITA Health Adventist Medical Center, Hinsdale, Illinois], not where I had the surgery, but--because we were commemorating the start of our healthcare practice.  The two people in the picture, the two women are colleagues Sunday Perry is in the red and Carolyn Mosley [ph.] who is a relationship manager is in the center, and we were take--this was taken in the OR [operating room] at Hinsdale Hospital.
