Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am can you please state your name and spell it for us please.
Speaker 2: My name is Elnora Daniel, E-L-N-O-R-A, Daniel, D-A-N-I-E-L.  No 'S.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs)  And what was your maiden name?
Speaker 2: My maiden name was Belle, B-E-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Do you have any other names you're known by?  Any nicknames or any--.
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: Do you care to divulge any of them?
Speaker 2: (Laughs).  I have a lot of nicknames.  But the one that my family mostly calls me is 'Pete,' P-E-T-E.  But I'm called 'El,' 'Dr. D.'  There's another one that people call me.  Oh, 'Pres D.' (Laughs).  But Pete is my nickname that all of my intimate family know me by.  Even my mother [Cecelia Amanda Moss Belle] before she died in April of this year.  The name still sticks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I will not (Laughs).  I'm really kidding.  Yes I will.  I was born November 19th, 1941.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in a small town called Oxford, North Carolina.  Actually in the rural part of that little town, Granville County.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is--.
Speaker 2: A little section of it called Belltown [North Carolina] which some people say was named after my family.
Speaker 1: Sounds like--,
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --there's a relationship there.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm--at this point and time I'm president of Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is May 21st, 19--2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: [The HistoryMakers at] 1900 [South] Michigan Avenue, I do believe, in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: All right.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there are five 'People' magazine-ish type questions we always ask.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they just require a brief answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: What is my favorite food.  As you look at me you can tell I like food.  But what is my favorite food?  (Laughs) Let's see.  That's a hard one because I like lots of things.  Vichyssoise soup.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I do.  My favorite color is dark pink, like an old rose color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I do.  I think my favorite time of the year is probably the spring.  It's a pretty time and everything's renewed.  So I'd say the spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well not actually.  But what--I have a favorite type of vacation.  I like to cruise.  And I like great ships that sail the wonderful seas that provides an avenue or vehicle for my ultimate rest and relaxation.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Pauses)  A favorite phrase--Yeah.  It's "Mercy."  (Laughs)  I guess that's it.  I say "Mercy" a lot.  Um-hmm.  And it takes me back to the 'Song of Solomon' with one of my favorite writers who is--.
Speaker 1: Toni Morrison.
Speaker 2: Right.  And there's a passage in there that says, "Mercy" in there in three different ways.  And I like that word.  I use it a lot.  And maybe that's my southern upbringing too.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the three different ways she uses it?  The three different contexts or--?
Speaker 2: I do.  In one instance when she--and when she's using the word, she--her daughter has been killed, and she walks into the funeral home, which I've done many times in my life to view the remains.  And her first--just like desperation use of the word is (spoken as though overwhelmed) "Mercy."  And then her second one is more or less like pardon (unclear) of the grief and grieving process.  Wherein she just resigns herself to the fact that her daughter is dead.  And that's, (sound of acceptance) "Mercy."  And then there's a third way wherein again she is going through that grief and grieving process wherein she's angry about it.  And probably that's the second way she uses it and she says, (sounding slightly angry) "Mercy."  Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 6088
Speaker 1: Tell me about your family.  Can you give me the name--the full name of your father and spell it for us please.
Speaker 2: I can.  My dad's name was Steven Belle S-T-E-V-E-N, B-E-L-L [sic B-E-L-L-E].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his birth date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My dad was born May 22, 1923.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where?
Speaker 2: In Oxford, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you do the same for your mother [Cecelia Amanda Moss Belle]?
Speaker 2: I can.  My mom was born August 23, 1924 in Oxford, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I had one.
Speaker 1: And your sibling's name?
Speaker 2: His name was James McCoy Belle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now can you tell us how far back can you trace your family?  How far--.
Speaker 2: Not very far, you know.  And the rationale for that probably is, you know in little small towns like Oxford, North Carolina, the way blacks were considered in those days was not very high.  Not valued very much.  So in many instances the court records would have "Baby boy Belle or baby girl whoever" without a name or what have you.  And then in many instances the family kept their own records in the family Bible.  There were many fires that occurred, you know, with wood stoves and that sort of thing.  And so in many instances the Bibles were burned.  And those traces of family lineage were really lost. So I never knew a single grandfather.  Both of my grandfathers were dead when I was born.  So I've never known a grandfather, only grandmothers.  great-grandmother I've known, a grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've known your--you knew one great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: I knew one great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Did your grandparents or your great-grandmother tell--have any stories about the family at all in days past?  Did they talk--did they have any legends or--?
Speaker 2: I never knew my great-grandmother or my grandmother [Lois Daye Moss] well.  My great-grandmother, I remember she was Blackfoot Indian.  Had this long braid down the back of her--down her back that touched her hips almost.  Very kind, very loving, protective of me.  And I was a very little girl.  So I have not that--really memories of her, except that one of the things that my aunt used to do--because really it was an extended family.  My--in those days you had marriages that say, for example, if the wife died and the husband survived, he might take a second wife.  And with the second wife have more children.  And so my mother was born in that type of extended family, wherein she had aunts who were almost the same age as she was.  So my aunts--we lived in rural North Carolina, in a big old red house that sat on a hill.  And down the hill was a river--Tar River.  And many of the family members would go and swim there.  And in many instances it was time for little girls to get their hair combed.  And my aunt would chase me down to the river, because I'd always run to my grandmother for her to protect me.  So those are the really the biggest memories I think I have of my grandmother.  And then I remember in the house, in the kitchen, the floors were wooden and she used to churn butter.  And I can remember the smell of the buttermilk as she churned.  I can remember the smells of the coffee and the breakfast as it was prepared and everyone sitting around the table.  And my grandmother always at the head of the table and my grandfather at the other.  But other than that, no.  Because soon my mother moved away from the grandmother's house with her husband.  And they moved to Richmond, Virginia.  And my father was drafted into the [U.S.] Navy.  And so we were living in Richmond.  It wasn't a very pleasant place in a big city with a mother alone.  And so my mother and father returned me to the brother [Charlie Belle] that my father had lived with, because his dad and mother died early on as well.  So I spent most of my early childhood living with a rather Victorian uncle and aunt [Janie Lee Allen Belle].  My aunt who reared me really most of my life from the time I was about three until I went to college, was born in 1900 and my uncle was born in 1899.  And so I do remember my aunt's father a little bit and mother.  But--and that's one thing that I think that I am very, very concerned about at this point and time.  Is that I'm losing that sense of being grounded.  My mother just died in April [2003].  We were very, very close.  And memories, things that she had, I didn't tap as well as I should have.  And so at this point and time I'm floundering a little bit, because I really have that sense of losing.  That sense of lineage, that sense of who I am.  That grounding that one gets I guess when you do that family tree or whatever, and, you know, who your great, great, great grandmother was and that sort of thing. Or father and so that's where I am at this point.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.  What was her name again?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Cecelia, C-E-C-E-L-I-A, Amanda, A-M-A-N-D-A, Moss before she married my dad [Steven Belle].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now what was she like and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother was a butcher.  And most of her life she worked in various grocery chains like U-Cross in Richmond [Virginia].  She was a butcher there for most of her working life.  My mother was very hard working.  Caring, refined in her own way.  Always the lady, gentle.  And had difficulty keeping a secret (laughs), but a wonderful person.  I miss her so much.  In the last days of her life she lived with me for five years.  And--let's move on.
Speaker 1: You know, that's an unusual occupation for a woman to be a butcher.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did she have any stories to tell about, you know, that experience?
Speaker 2: It was cold.  It was always cold because it was done in the cold refrigerated area or what have you.  So she would talk about that.  And the people that she worked with I guess, the day-to-day routine of, you know, doing the cutting of the meat and pricing it and doing that sort of stuff. So, real stories.  Not really that many.  It was just a job that she did, that she liked doing.
Story_ID: 6090
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father.  What was his name again?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Steven [Belle].  He was mostly a mechanic, worked very much with repairing cars.  The latter part of his life was basically working in a bowling alley and caring for the mechanics of whatever goes on with how a bowling alley works. And he was a very strong man.  Bright, intelligent, even though he had only about a tenth grade education.  Strong.  Very strong.  Very determined.  Typical African American male in his socialization, in that I mean being someone to care for your family, being the head of the family.  Very resourceful, even though he didn't have but a high school--not really a high school education, tenth grade.  When he died he left his wife [Cecelia Amanda Moss Belle] very comfortable.  They'd been able to acquire property and savings were very good.  Investments were very good for a man, you know, who had only had a tenth grade education.  A very, very shrewd, strong, determined--not verbose in any way, but very strong.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--,
Speaker 2: And I--yes.
Speaker 1: Oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: They lived mostly in Richmond [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They did, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I lived mostly in Oxford, North Carolina.  So my real rearing was done by my aunt [Janie Lee Allen Belle] and uncle [Charlie Belle].  That's where if I had to look at who had the most influence in my life, who left the greatest imprint, I'd say it would be my aunt.
Story_ID: 6091
Speaker 1: Tell us about your aunt and uncle now.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was your aunt's name?
Speaker 2: My aunt's name was Janie, J-A-N-I-E, Lee, L-E-E.  Allen was her maiden name, Belle was her married name.  My uncle's name was Charlie, C-H-A-R-L-I-E, Belle.  My aunt too was very, very strong, hard working housewife.  My uncle was relatively--neither one of them had much education.  My aunt I think had maybe a fifth grade education.  My uncle about the same.  My uncle had his own little business though.  He was a contractor.  He had his own contracting carpentry business.  And he built barns and had his own folk that he hired or fired or what have you.  And was one of the first blacks in that little county to own his own home.  So basically I'd say lower middle class or what have you.  My uncle--my aunt worked at home.  I remember her very much getting up at four o'clock in the morning to go milk this one cow that we had. So that there would be milk to bake the biscuits and to do the churning to make the butter.  So you'd remember the--I remember the smell of the bacon or the chicken or whatever it was.  We had a few chickens, a cow and a pig every year.  And so we would kill the pig every year, that was a big thing.  We had a little--my uncle owned about two and a half acres that the house was built on.  A large--we had a large garden.  And I was born during the Great Depression.  So that was one of the reasons too why my mom [Cecelia Amanda Moss Belle] and dad [Steven Belle] took us back to the country.  And the, you know, with the war and my dad being in the [U.S.] Navy, and he was always sure, they were always sure that we would be well fed because, you know, you could get your meat and that sort of thing right there that you grew or you were able to produce yourself.  So my aunt did do at home--she took in washing for the folk who had sold us the land.  And basically was a good wife. Very puritanical, very Victorian, which I am sort of a reflection of.  I'm pretty much of an in-the-box person.  But I think the idea of hard work, perseverance, respect for education came from her.  There was some thought when I early on as I started to go to school that I was rather gifted.  And so she permitted me to always be in the books.  You know, we would have in the country a bookmobile that would come around and bring the various books that you could take and read.  And I was a ravenous reader.  In many instances, because I was totally frustrated because my aunt wouldn't allow me to do the things that the other girls would do, you know.  I was not allowed to go to parties and all that, the movies, no.  That just didn't happen.  And so I lived in many instances in the books as a way to escape the humdrum of the life I felt I was leading at that time.  But today, in another era, I appreciated that because I think that it has helped to make me who I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  What were some of the other--now you grew up in sort of the country.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Rural area.  I like to refer to it as a rustic area.
Speaker 1: A rustic area.
Speaker 2: (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Did you have other homes around you or were you isolated or no?
Speaker 2: No.  We were rather isolated.  The closest house--we were on rather a central highway in Oxford [North Carolina].  But I'd say the closest home to us was at least a mile away.
Story_ID: 6092
Speaker 1: What was the community like--Oxford [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oxford was a rather--it was very segregated.  And living in such a cloistered, protected environment as I did, the realities of the world didn't really enter my life per se, until I started to, school.  And I think I started school when I was six.  And prior to that time, the people who sold us the property or my uncle [Charlie Belle] the property I played with their daughter who was white.  We made mud pies together.  We played with our dolls together in her dollhouse and I really knew not the difference between the two of us until it was time for me to go to school.  And I realized that she was on the bus going to the city in--going to the school in the city and I was having to walk to a two-room school that was about three fourths of a mile away.  And that's when--and I then said to my aunt [Janie Lee Allen Belle], "Well why can't I go with Jane?"  The young girl's name was Jane.  And that's when she said, "Well, you know, you are colored and she is white, and you don't go to school together."  And that really was my first awakening of segregation really.  Because Oxford was very segregated with white water fountains, white and colored bathrooms.  And blacks really were mostly sharecroppers.  That's why my dad--my uncle [Charlie Belle] was very different.  You know.  Because he had his own business and he built barns and houses and all that kind of stuff for whites and well as blacks, but mostly whites.  So it kind of put him under a different category a little bit, and elevated I guess our standard of living.  But most blacks, relatives and things that I knew at that point and time were sharecroppers.  And you know how that went, you know.  You worked all year, and at the end of the year because you had borrowed from the landowner the money to buy the seed, to buy the fertilizer, to do other things, to exist, in the end there wasn't very much left because you owed most of it.  So that's more or less the environment, the proximal environment that I lived in.  Oxford, you know, was a little bit different, but not that much.  Like we had one black doctor in the city.  We had a black hospital that wasn't that great.  People died easily and people talked about, "Oh my God!  You gotta go to the hospital?"  And very few people expected to come home as a result of the poor medical care that was given.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did these things make you feel when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: Well I'm sure that there's a degree of inferiority that creeped in.  You know.  "Why can't I go?  Why am I different?  Why do I have to have something separate and certainly not equal?"  When Jane was going away to a very good school and I would be in this little two-room school which was finally consolidated and we did--when I was about in the seventh grade go to the city to a better school that was segregated then.  It does have a--it does have a lasting, I think, imprint on one.  I remember so often getting the books of the classes.  And they, of course, had been used by the white kids and handed down to us.  And so that meant that, you know, we were always behind, because we weren't getting the new editions of the books and that sort of thing.  And so I--you know, you start to see or, you know, to think, "Why don't I measure up?  Why am I not good enough or whatever?"  That's a lens that sometimes one feels that has been impressed upon them or what have you.  For lack of a better language I'd say so.  So I think it's a built-in degree of inferiority that people have, if this is something that's done early on.  And it's--it affects your psyche certainly.  You know, even though you know you're as good or you measure up or you are better.  I remember when I went to Columbia University [New York, New York] to work on my master's degree.  And I was one of one hundred in a class.  And I made the top grades, you know.  So you knew that you were capable because it was an Ivy League school and I'd come from, you know, segregated schools.  And yet I measured up more or better than many of the people in the class.  So it's--I think it has its lasting effects on one's psyche.
Story_ID: 6093
Speaker 1: What was school like?
Speaker 2: School initially as I indicated to you earlier on, I started school in a two-room plywood building.
Speaker 1: This was Granville Elementary [School, Oxford, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, that was Belltown.
Speaker 1: Belltown, Okay.
Speaker 2: Belltown School [Oxford, North Carolina].  That was all it was called.
Story_ID: 6094
Speaker 1: School was great.  I always loved books, learning.  I was reading very early.  My aunt taught me how to read.  So I was reading before I went to school.  Teachers were wonderful, great role models.  Great mentors, wonderfully caring.
Speaker 2: Can you--do you remember some of their names?
Speaker 1: I do.  Mrs. Goode was my high--seventh grade teacher, actually my sixth grade teacher.
Speaker 2: How do you spell the name?
Speaker 1: G-O-O-D-E.  And Mrs. Anderson was my like my first through the fifth grade teacher.  Very caring, cared about us.  My aunt [Janie Lee Allen Belle] was old. So she had old-fashioned ideas about how to dress a young girl.  And so she would do things like talk to my aunt about not putting a million plaits [braids] on (laughs) my head.  She would do things like tell her the latest things that young girls were wearing.  Tell her about what I was doing in school.  And suggest books that I should read.  Made sure that the bookmobile came by our house often.  And made my aunt feel that I was somewhat special.  And as a result, I was given the time to do the studying.  And lots of times I probably used that a little bit because I never liked housework, you know. So I got away with not having to do too much house cleaning or whatever because my aunt thought I needed the time to, you know, study and to become much more a learned person.  My aunt treasured education.  She thought that it was so very important in one's life in enabling an individual to realize their potential.  So she always pushed and always supported me in any educational endeavors that I wanted to pursue.  So school was great.  Now when I went to--left the two-room school and went to the city in--the city, which was Oxford [North Carolina], there was a transition period always.  You know, you're the new person and a degree of finding yourself occurred and finding new friends and for a while that was a little difficult.  But after that, you know, I excelled in classes.  And so that gives you a degree of acceptance.  I remember Mrs. Leatherberry who taught me French in the ninth grade and in the tenth grade.  And by the time I had completed that I could pick up a book in French and read the entire thing.  She was an excellent teacher.  And I loved French and I do today.  And one of my greatest ambitions--or goals one of them was to go to Paris [France].  And I had an opportunity to go there year before last and it was a great, great, great opportunity.  It was a great city and I enjoyed it immensely.
Speaker 2: Was that your first trip to Paris?
Speaker 1: That was my first trip to Paris.  And I'd always wanted--I've traveled all over the world, but I'd never gone there.  Where I'd wanted to go more than any place.  I finally got the opportunity to go.
Speaker 2: What about high school?
Speaker 1: High school was good.  I went to Mary Potter High School in Oxford [later Mary Potter Intermediate School, Oxford, North Carolina].  The--particularly the learning environment was good. Even though it was segregated.  Again, the teachers were great. Wonderful mentors, caring, nurturing individuals in most instances.  My negative experiences with high school were related to the socialization process of going to the prom.  When I went to the prom, my brother [James McCoy Belle] had to go.  My uncle [Charlie Belle] had to take us.
Speaker 2: You had to go with your brother--?
Speaker 1: I had to go with my--I had a date.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But my brother had to go. Okay.
Speaker 2: He had to chaperone you?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, yes.  And I remember the first time that a young man wanted to, you know, at that time the word you used was take company.  And I was not allowed to take company.  (Laughing) Everybody else that I knew, all my girlfriends were able to do that.  But my aunt and uncle, you know, were from a different vintage.  And so, the first guy who had the nerve to come to my uncle's house--because my uncle was a notoriously authoritarian person.  He ran the church and everything.  He was a deacon in the church, he determined everything that would go on in the church.  You know.
Speaker 2: The Baptist church?
Speaker 1: There would be no tambourines.  Oh yes, Southern Baptist all the way.  Very stayed Baptist though.  No tambourines, no loud music.  My uncle would simply tell them, "Oh no.  You're not gonna have that in this church."  I mean he was that kind of person.  I mean he really was a very domineering person.  And the first time a guy had the nerve to come to my house to try to, you know, for a date or something, (sighs) my uncle said (laughs), "Get out of here boy."  (Laughs)  And I think he would've gotten the shotgun after him.  I mean he was just that kind of a person. I mean there were--he was not gonna have any young boys coming to visit me.  And I guess that that was related to the fact that he wasn't my father.  And he felt that special responsibility to my dad [Steven Belle] to make sure that, you know, that I continued as a nice young lady or what have you and that, you know.  He was very overly protective.  But anyway it was--so there were times when, you know, my girlfriends were going to parties and dances and things.  And of course, you know, being a normal young girl I wanted to do the same thing.  And so my aunt [Janie Lee Allen Belle] and I would have horrible spats about it.  Wherein I would just scream and holler and cry so much and lay in the floor until (laughs) I though she would give in, but she would not.  And so it was interesting.  Also as I think about it in high school, one of the vivid memories I have is, you know, my uncle bought a new car just about every other year.  And so he was one of these typical southern men.  You know, you don't mess with his car.  My aunt never learned to drive because women were socialized that, you know, your husband took you wherever you needed to go.  You did not need to know how to drive.  So my aunt never learned how to drive.  And so the--my brother did though.  I mean he got his license before I even had the opportunity to try to get my license because this was not something that young women did.  Young women in that particular time were not socialized to be, you know, drive cars.  So one day my aunt decided--I had gotten my driver's permit.  And my aunt decided that she would let me take my cousins home.  Well I took my cousins home.  I was new in driving.  Drove off the road and broke the axle of the car.  Yes I did.  And oh I was scared to death.  So finally we got the car back.  We got it to the service station.  The car was repaired before my uncle got home.  Because everybody was like, "Oh my God!  What's Charlie gonna say?  What's Charlie gonna say!"  You know.  So my high school days were rather frustrating as far as socialization was concerned.  But I had wonderful friends that I even keep up with now that really made that, what for me I thought was a difficult time in not being able to do the socialization kinds of things.  But that aside, it was a time when I learned a lot, did well in school, graduated second in my class and then went on to college.
Story_ID: 6095
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation did you--,
Speaker 2: Uh-huh?
Speaker 1: --did you know what you wanted to do with the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: Well I really--.
Speaker 1: Did you have plans?
Speaker 2: I knew what I wanted to be.  But you wouldn't believe it now.  But I weighed ninety-eight pounds soaking wet.  And so I had always wanted to be a nurse.  But everybody at school felt that I should become a teacher.  And, of course, my French teacher [at Mary Potter High School, later Mary Potter Intermediate School, Oxford, North Carolina] thought that I should become a French teacher.  So they were very, very surprised when I decided to go to college to become a nurse because they thought I was just too frail, too little.  I couldn't handle big patients or whatever.  And the other thing that I knew from my teachers and from the prodding of my aunt [Janie Lee Allen Belle] and support that I wanted a baccalaureate education.  In many instances women were going into practical nursing.  Or they were going into a diploma or a hospital program.  But I wanted a baccalaureate degree. So as I explored and as the counselors helped me, then I decided to pursue a baccalaureate degree in nursing, which was very different at that time because most of my contemporaries were going to hospital schools of nursing or into practical nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's true.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: That's true.  They weren't  (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Um-hmm.  That's true.  That's very true.
Speaker 1: So--now when did you decide that you wanted to be a nurse?  I mean what influenced you to be a nurse?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I've always cared about children. I've always been a rather caring person.  And I guess that's from my aunt who was a very caring person and very much involved in the church and very much involved with the families,  always giving a helping hand, always supporting people, always being there to be a good listener or whatever.  And so I think that socialization of caring and giving came from her.  And as a result, that was a way of actualizing that kind of inner self, or that intrinsic characteristic that I had of giving and caring.  And to me becoming a nurse would certainly allow me to actualize that in a professional way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you interested in the sciences in--?
Speaker 2: I was.  I really--to tell you the real truth, I wanted to be a doctor.  Really wanted to become a physician.  But as I look back, in that town was only one black doctor and he hadn't been there that long.  So my socialization, my outlook or my thoughts of becoming a doctor at that time, I didn't have that insight.  It wasn't even on the horizon for me.  It wasn't something that you saw that many people going into.  I had no role models of female doctors.  And so I settled really for nursing because I did not have the role models or the insight to know that I could have become a physician.  And I could have very well become a physician.  Because in many instances as I would compare capabilities with physicians that I knew, you know, I had the same knowledge base.  And I could have, you know, pushed it to the point of coming prepared as a physician.  So in a way the nursing was a backdrop because I did not really have that many female role models to say, "Yes this something that you can do.  This is not out of your realm of capability.  Go for it."  So I ended up with nursing.

Speaker 1: Now you graduated in 1959--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from Mary Potter High School [later Mary Potter Intermediate School, Oxford, North Carolina].  And who is Mary Potter?
Speaker 2: Mary Potter was a private all girls school at one time.  And she apparently was the founder of it.  It was for young black women.  And so she--it was a residential school.  And then as the school--.
Speaker 1: You had to stay there all the--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  When I got there it was a private school.  But it was no longer residential.  The school had fallen on hard times.  And so it stopped the housing part of the education there.
Speaker 1: So were boys allowed to go to school there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And it was then integrated as well.  But initially it was an all girls school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you graduated, did--now how did you get to North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: That's interesting how that happened.  I really had intended to go to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  And Hampton as I looked at the catalogs I thought, "God, that is so expensive.  My parents [Steven Belle and Cecelia Amanda Moss Belle] can't afford to send me there."  So I decided to go to A&T.  I didn't bother to ask them, could they afford to send me there.  I just decided that they couldn't.  And so I went to A&T, because A&T had a baccalaureate program in nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: In Greensboro, North Carolina--,
Speaker 2: Yes!
Speaker 1: --at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 1959, '60 [1960]--,
Speaker 2: You got it.
Speaker 1: --we're talking about tremendous racial tension.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Robert F. Williams [civil rights activist] I think is there--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the sit-in movement is there [referring to the sit-in at the whites-only lunch counter at Woolworth's variety store].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was right in the middle of that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear)  NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] (unclear)--.
Story_ID: 6097
Speaker 1: I went to school with Jesse [Jackson].  Jesse was a freshman and I was a freshman [at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  We started out together.  And my funniest memory about Jesse is Jesse--we went to Sunday school and Jesse would come to Sunday school and Jesse would get up and pray this prayer that would just bring tears to your eyes.  And then he would get outside the Sunday school and he'd say, "I wowed 'em didn't I?"  (Laughs)  Jesse was just that kind of guy.  But, when the movement started and the sit-ins at Woolworth's [variety store], the people--the students on the campus started the sit-ins I think.  Ezell Brian [sic, Ezell Blair, Jr., later called Jibreel Khazan] and two other guys were the first ones.  But then the rest of us got involved.  And Jesse got very much involved in that too.  But the--and that's when I remember the first time that somebody spit at me.  The football boys particularly were marching and other female students as well.  And the one day that I was on line, I was very short and very tiny.  And some person going into Woolworth who was rather annoyed that we were picketing and doing the sit-in and marching and stuff spit at me.  And the guys were ready to not go with the non-violent (laughs) actions.
Speaker 2: These are football players.
Speaker 1: Right.  So they had to get me out of there.  Because it--I was an inflammatory person.  And they just felt that, you know, if somebody did that to one of their women that they would forget about the non-violent, so.  So that was the very day that I got off line that everybody got arrested.  And I--you know, I didn't wanna go to prison, that is for sure. But that was the exact day I had been on the line all that morning until this guy spit at me.  And then the guys asked--they took me off the line.  And then they got arrested, so lots of people were in jail.  I never did go to jail.  But those were some interesting times.  Those were hard times really.
Speaker 2: And did the civil rights activity interfere with school?
Speaker 1: No.  Because basically what you did is you kind of planned your class schedule around the time when you would go and get on line and march.  So for me it never did.  It probably did when the kids were arrested.  I'm sure that interfered.  And, of course, the campus was in an uproar as well.  You know, with the students being out there picketing. And the police and all the chaos and the newspapers and people on the campus.  And it was a difficult time.  It was a difficult time.  But there was a degree of solidarity that I've never seen on a campus since.  And people had a sense of this is what we needed to do, this is what we were gonna do, we were gonna make a difference.  We were gonna make sure that Woolworth [store] allowed anybody to come in and sit at that counter.
Speaker 2: How did it--did it feel at the time as if you were making history and you were really changing the world?
Speaker 1: Not really to me.
Story_ID: 6098
Speaker 1: How did it feel at that time [around the sit-in at Woolworth's variety store in Greensboro, North Carolina]?  Did it feel like you were changing the world at that time?  Or changing the way black people in this country?
Speaker 2: It felt like we were getting ready to make a difference.  But as far as perceiving it as a historical moment, no.  Not to me at least.  And I don't think anybody else.  It was just something that we felt we needed to do.  I think somebody had gone into Woolworth's [store] from the university from a northern state.  And really had not experienced the segregation that was happening in the South.  And so the person came back and were--they were very irate.  And that's when other people--you know, it was a casual thing at first.  And then it gained more and more momentum until suddenly everybody--the whole campus was inflamed to the point that everybody was getting out there being almost scheduled to go.  "Well, you know, when can you go?  What do you wanna do?  Do you wanna go in and sit at the stool--on the stools?  Or do you want to march on the outside?" or whatever.  So it just kind--it was just something that snowballed. But then it captured the passion of the entire campus and the entire establishment of A&T University [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Did you have training?  I mean were there--,
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.
Speaker 1: --were there organizers there to train you?
Speaker 2: No.  If so I didn't know about it.  No.  Basically it was the various guys who had initially been rebuffed.  And then they started enlisting the support of the various students on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how it happened with me.  Now whether or not there was--I mean, you know, when you were bused there, you were told on the bus, " Do not react.  Do not respond.  This is non-violent."  You know, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] at that point and time, his edict about non-violence was very much a part of that whole movement.  And you were told that if you didn't feel that you could stand the pressure of the negative things that would be said to you or done to you, you should not go.  And so I felt I was calm, that I would not respond.  But because I was small and somebody spat at me--or spit at me, then the guys--it kind of enraged the football guys.  But they felt that it was better that I not go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I only went a couple of times.  After that happened I didn't go any more.
Story_ID: 6099
Speaker 1: How does it feel now to look back on those days?  Are you proud of yourself?
Speaker 2: I'm very proud.  I am very proud.  I tell my son about it.  I tell my granddaughter it.  And they're fascinated to hear the stories of, you know, separate and supposedly equal of how the water fountains were marked 'colored' and 'white'.  And how we did the sit-ins.  And, you know, the things that people did to us and said to us.  And, "Gram did you do that?  Mommy did you do that?" (Laughs)  They are really amazed and quite proud.  And I am too, you know.  At that time it was just a cause.  It's something you really thought you needed to do.  You know.  But today you can look at it though a different lens and say, "That was something that you should have done and that you did do.  And what a great difference it's made in the United States of America."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now did you--when you were in Greenville in--.
Speaker 2: Greensboro.
Speaker 1: Greensboro. Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: My fault.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: Did you know Robert F. Williams [civil rights activist]?  Was he the Chairman of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] then?
Speaker 2: Could have been.  Could have been.  But I don't really remember that much involvement of the NAACP at that point and time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because basically I was just caught up in the movement on the campus [at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Story_ID: 6100
Speaker 1: Now were there other campus activities [at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] that--I mean those that usually go on like (unclear) sorority (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.  There were.  And I pledged.  That's when I got my first gray hair.  Is pledging Delta Sigma Theta (laughs).  Alpha Chapter.  Alpha Mu Chapter there in Greensboro [North Carolina].  And it was a wonderful sisterhood.  It was a wonderful experience.  And I never regretted that.  I still participate financially in the sorority.  But my life is so very come--full of other activities that I'm not a very good participant.  But I'm still financial here in Chicago [Illinois] even.  And in Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] as well.  But, yes.  And I married a Kappa [Alpha Psi fraternity member].  And so--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) While in school?
Speaker 2: I did.  Um-hmm.  My junior year I got married [to Herman Daniel].  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you could date who you wanted to in school.
Speaker 2: (Laughs)  I could.  And he chased me miserably.  (Laughs)  Yes.  Finally I was that loose as they say.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: So you didn't miss the supervision of your father [Steven Belle] and (unclear)--,
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you the truth.
Speaker 1: --uncle [Charlie Belle] and brother [James McCoy Belle]?
Speaker 2: Actually I was terribly homesick.  And I thought I never would be.  I thought, "Oh my God!  I'm finally getting an opportunity to be on my own," or what have you.  But I think after the third day there I was crying, because I really missed home.  I really, really did.  And the comfort of it.  I guess the safety of it and the familiarity of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is your first time away from home.
Speaker 2: That was my first time ever away.  Um-hmm.  No, in the summers when I was a junior and a senior [at Mary Potter High School, Oxford, North Carolina] we went to Richmond [Virginia] to--for the summer to live with our parents.  So I had been in Richmond.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was the extent of it.
Story_ID: 6101
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers or administrators that were outstanding at North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] that had a profound impact on you?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was one who was particularly good.  And I guess, as I became a teacher of nursing education, I really mimicked a lot of her teaching style.  And her name was Georgiana Stamps.  She's dead now.  But she had a lasting impression on me.  And she was very bright.  Really taught the scientific rationale undergirding the profession of nursing, and used pathophysiology a lot in her teaching.  And I tended to do the same thing.  The--I did the of asking "Why?"  You know, "The answer is, but why is that so?"  And so if I had to pinpoint a person who had the greatest affect on me, there, I would probably say it was she.
Speaker 1: Ms. Stamps, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 6102
Speaker 1: When you graduated from North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] now.  You came out in '64 [1964].  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did you do next?  Or what had you planned to do?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  My first job.  I took a job.  And I took the first job at NYU Medical Center in New York.  I had gotten married my junior year.  And so my senior year I had gotten pregnant.  And we had a son.  And my son was living with my mother-in-law, his grandmother.  And then once I finished school, I--we moved to New York.  My husband [Herman Daniel] had an aunt who lived there.  And we lived with her for a while.  And I worked at NYU [New York University] Medical Center [New York, New York].  This--we were living in St. Albans, New York.  And we stayed there.  And I stayed at--I worked at NYU for about a year and a half.  And a position came up for assistant head nurse.  I was the best-educated person there.  But I was the only black nurse who had a baccalaureate degree.  And I felt that a person who had only an associate degree who was white would get the job.  And I could not stand that.  So at that point and time because I knew I was up for it and she was up for it, I knew she would probably get it because there were no black nurses.  No black nurse with baccalaureate degrees in the hospital except for one.  And there was only one head nurse who was black.  And so I thought my odds, you know, the odds were such that I really was not gonna get that job.  And it would have chagrinned me so, until I couldn't take that.  So I took the exit out and I got a job teaching nursing in a diploma school of nursing at Morrisania City Hospital [Bronx, New York].  And I worked there for about six months.  And then I decided to myself and a good friend both decided to apply to Columbia [University, New York, New York] to pursue a graduate degree, a master's degree in nursing.  And she wasn't accepted.  I was.  She went to Hunter [College of The City University of New York, New York].  I went to Columbia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is--we're in what year?
Speaker 2: 1966.
Speaker 1: '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Al right.  Well how did you like Columbia?  Did you go full-time or did you work and go to school?
Speaker 2: At first I was trying to work part-time and go to school full-time.  And that was not working.  I think that was when I made my one and only C minus.  C minus is not a grade in my repertoire.  And so at that point and time I decided that I would go full-time.  I was able to get several scholarships, professional nurse training ship and another scholarship.  And so I was able to, you know, pay the costly bill, tuition at Columbia.  And I then went full-time.
Story_ID: 6103
Speaker 1: How did you find New York City [New York], I mean you lived in the South all your life?  Was moving to New York a--.
Speaker 2: New York at that time was a great city.  Great city.  Very safe when I was at NYU [New York University] Medical Center [New York, New York].  Some nights I would leave the hospital at eleven or twelve o'clock at night, walk to the subway and never even think about it.  You know, of someone grabbing your purse or, you know, accosting you or what have you.  It was just a very safe environment.  Very, very different than it became later on.  And so it was just a great city.  And I enjoyed it immensely.  I enjoyed going to the Apollo [Theater] and to the theater and the great shopping and wonderful educational facilities for my son and that sort of thing.  So New York was great.  We enjoyed it.  After we moved from St. Albans [neighborhood in Queens, New York], we lived in the Bronx [New York] for a while.  And we lived on the seventeenth floor of middle-income housing.  And people were very friendly, very nice.  I mean it was no problem.  I'd take the subway to work or either my husband [Herman Daniel] would take me.  Pick me up or either I'd take the subway at travel back that way.  So it was a rather safe city at that point and time.  The museums were wonderful.  I mean it was a great city.  I really enjoyed the experience there.  And then, you know, the educational experience was a great one.  In that the people who were teaching me were people who had written the books, you know.  So that kind of Ivy League education was really right on the cutting edge.  And so as I started my career I was so advanced.  You know.  With all the newer concepts and theories that had been presented to me there at Columbia [University, New York, New York].  But, of course, initially it was a very cold place.  I didn't know anybody.  I was the only one so often.  And so you felt very isolated.  Socialization was really not great at all.  And then I met a white friend.  And we just clicked.  We bonded.  And we pursued that master's of education degree, which was a sixty-credit master's because thirty credits could be applied to the doctoral degree.  And so we pursued the master's degree and then we went back and pursued a doctoral degree together.  So she was Irish.  I was black.  And she felt some degree of alienation as well.  So the two of us kind of clicked because I was black and I felt a little bit alienated, or out of sync with the mass of people who were there.  And she being Irish, I guess that stigma of Irish and the drinking and that sort of stuff, she--.
Speaker 1: She was from Ireland herself?
Speaker 2: No.  She--her parents were from Ireland.  Um-hmm.  So she had a little bit of a brogue, which was interesting as well, but a very nice person.
Story_ID: 6104
Speaker 1: So you got your Ph.D. in what was it 19--?
Speaker 2: My doctorate of education in--,
Speaker 1: Ed.D., right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  In 1975.  But actually I had--we had moved from--when I started Columbia [University, New York, New York] we had moved to Teaneck, New Jersey.  And then we bought a home there.  And after I received the M.Ed, the master's of education degree, my husband [Herman Daniel] decided he wanted to return home.  Which was Hampton, Virginia.  And so in 1968 we returned to Hampton and I took a teaching position as an instructor of nursing education in Hampton's nursing program [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia.]
Speaker 1: So this is '68 [1968] or '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: '68 [1968] that I got the M.Ed.
Speaker 1: Oh (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: The--I got the Ed.D. after I had been at Hampton for several years.  Then people in the department decided that they wanted to pursue a doctoral degree.  And I'm a rather competitive person.  And I said, "Well, you know, they're going to get a doctorate.  I ought to do that."  You know.  So then in '72 [1972], I returned to New York [New York] and pursued the doctorate of education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  So I got that degree in 1975.
Story_ID: 6105
Speaker 1: Now you went on to teach at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Right.  I taught at Hampton from--well I was on the faculty for thirty-one years.  I was appointed in 1968.  I went back to school after I--well I had gotten pregnant again.  But I lost that child in 1971.  And at that point and time I felt I needed to do something different.  So I decided to pursue the doctorate.  That was kind of like a--very much of a change agent kind of wake-up call in a way because I felt I needed to be more of an independent person.  At--you see, I was socialized by this aunt [Janie Lee Allen Belle] who was born in 1900.  And so I had never even gotten my driver's license.  And so after I lost that child, then I got my driver's license, and I decided to go back and work on my doctorate.  My son at that point in time was a senior in high school.  And I felt that I could really leave him with his dad and that they would be okay.  So I then returned to New York, Columbia [University, New York, New York], lived in the dorm and pursued my doctorate. Completed it in about three years.  Because I got my degree in--started in '72 [1972].  I finished in '74 [1974]. But the degree was actually awarded in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You went back to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I went back to Hampton.  And at that time, I became the chairman of the graduate program.  Or actually the prime mover for the development of the first graduate program in nursing education to be established in a historically black institution.  We started that program.  I was the chair.  I am very involved in grant writing.  I wrote a grant to support that.  We wrote a grant to support many, many things including nurse practitioner programs.  The final grant that I think that I received while I was--I became the dean of the program in 1980.  And during that time, I received the largest grant that I had gotten, which was a grant for about seven million dollars from the [W. K.] Kellogg Foundation to establish what was called a health mobile.  And the health mobile went out into the community, provided health care services to indigent people like homeless people, people who were in shelters and things like that.  And we also established as part of that seven million dollar grant what was called a nursing clinic.  So the nursing clinic while I was at Hampton was the first nursing clinic to be established in a predominantly black college or university. And so then in 1991, I was the vice president for academic affairs retired and I was selected to become the vice president for academic affairs.  And then I became about three years later the vice president for health.  And I established at that point and time at Hampton the doctoral program in pharmacy and the doctoral program in physical therapy.  And then I was getting ready to become president somewhere.  And the president said, "Well no.  Why don't you do this.  And then I'll help you become a president."  And so I then became the executive vice president in provost.  And then I stayed in that position from about '95 [1995] until '98 [1998] at which time Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] called.
Speaker 1: Now you were in Hampton for--?
Speaker 2: Thirty-one years.
Speaker 1: What would you consider to be the highlight of your career there at Hampton?  (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well let's see.  You know, I really saw a great transformation in that university during the thirty-one years that I was involved.  I think a lot of it occurred after [William] Bill  Harvey.  He is the president there now--was appointed.  There's been great transformation in that college.  And I guess the greatest highlight is that during my service there, I brought in more than thirty million dollars in support of that university.  And I think my greatest achievement there again was probably the nursing clinic and the care mobile which was the seven million dollar grant from the Kellogg Foundation.  But there were many, many other firsts that happened while I was dean of the school of nursing as well as vice president for academic affairs. And as executive vice president in provost we did some wonderful things.
Speaker 1: Now what was the biggest challenge I guess at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] when you were there?
Speaker 2: The biggest challenge.  I guess the biggest challenge was probably changing the image in that people thought basically as a black school and not necessarily as a very good educational institution.  So, you know, there always would be little snippets in the papers.  Little negatives about, you know, that would it occur at [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia] that would never even hit the papers. But always if it was something related to Hampton, the negatives got in, and very  few of the positives.  You know if say somebody raped someone.  Well even though the student might not have--or the person may not have ever graduated from Hampton, if they ever went there, in their lifetime, then, you know, it was mentioned as, "Hampton somebody some--," you know.  And so getting rid of the negatives related to the fact that this is a black institution and it's mediocre.  To the fact that it's a great college education.  It's a great university education.  Changing really the image.  The papers now give the positive things that are happening.  The entire perception of Hampton over the last twenty years has changed significantly.  And I would say if you're looking at HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] among the ones that have great reputations would be Hampton or Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Um-hmm.  And Florida A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] too and some others.  But those are the particular ones.
Story_ID: 6106
Speaker 1: You came to Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] in '98 [1998]. Right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What was the biggest challenge facing you in '98 [1998] when you came to Chicago State?
Speaker 2: About the same thing in a way.  The perception of the school.  And for me personally,  (laughs) the greatest challenge was the fact that I came from a university that was private and located in a right-to-work state.  And I had not had any experience at all with the unions.  And I now have six unions on my campus. Including the faculty members--the faculty is also unionized.  So that was a transition for me.  And I'd say that's always a challenge for me.  Because if one is not careful, I think, in an educational institution, unions can sometimes protect and promote mediocrity.  And that is something that I find abhorent. Something that I really cannot tolerate.  And so a challenge to us to move that university from just a good teaching institution to one that has credible research and a credible service involvement with the community that surrounds it.
Story_ID: 6107
Speaker 1: Tell us about Chicago State.  It started off as Chicago Teacher's College [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: It did, actually, no.  It started off as Chicago Normal.  It was really initially owned by--no, it started off as Cook [County] Normal [School, Chicago, Illinois].  It was originally owned by Cook County.  And it has gone through seven iterations--seven different locations.  From the Cook Normal to now Chicago State University. It was one time Chicago East, Chicago South [College], Chicago Normal [College], Chicago Teachers [College] and now--and Chicago State College and finally Chicago State University.  And it started out really as a teacher-training institute in 1867.  It's an old university.  Most people don't know that.  It's the oldest public institution in the city of Chicago [Illinois].  It is the second oldest public educational institution in the state of Illinois.  Most people do not realize that.  It has turned out some fantastic teachers.  About 36,000 students have graduated from there.  Folk who you would be shocked graduated from Chicago State.  Like many, many legislators, [Terrence] Terry Hilliard [former Chicago, Illinois Police Superintendent] graduated from there.  Several other people who have been in charge of the CPS [Chicago Public Schools] or in high profile positions there.  So it really has produced some outstanding individuals.  And Chicago--Cook County Normal school in 1867 started out in a boxcar, with two teachers and fifteen students.  And today it has a 110 million dollar budget.  We have about fifteen buildings on a 163-acre campus that is beautifully coiffured.  It's a pretty place.  And it's like what?  It's like--it's an institution that has steeples of excellence that people--it's almost like a well-hidden secret.  And I have really gained a lot of respect for the university since I've been there.  It has a committed and caring faculty.  I have done a lot of different things since I've been there.  I have had to raise the standards.  And the one thing that I speak about often is raising the bar.  And raising the bar of the caliber of students that we admit.  Raising the bar for the quality of faculty members that we appoint.  They have to now do not only good teaching, but research and service.  And the students who come, we look at those who come from outstanding high schools, as well as those who exhibit potential, but may have had some deficit.  Be it academically, be it economically or socially.  So we do also address those students who come to us who are like diamonds in the rough.  And we give them an opportunity. So it's almost like two different populations that we admit.  But having been at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] for thirty-one years, I pretty much know that ACT [American College Testing Program, Inc.] or that SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] score that would be predicted of success as far as one's pursuit of a university education.

Speaker 1: Now Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] had, I know recently had been in the news for a writer's program.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: We have a great writers program.  In fact, we just implemented a new creative writing program.  It's the first one to be located in a predominantly minority institution.  Many people think of Chicago State as a HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] in Illinois.  But Illinois really hasn't one.  And basically Chicago State started out as a totally white institution.  It's still classified as a traditionally white institution, TWI, even though we are really a minority-serving institution I'd say seventy-nine percent of our students are African American.  About ten percent are Hispanic.  And then the rest are either international or Caucasian students.  So again--I forgot the question.
Speaker 1: No.  I was just asking about the writer's program.
Speaker 2: Oh the writer's program is great.  You know--.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) national every year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Gwendolyn Brooks served on that faculty for many years and most people are not aware of that.  Of course, she was a poet laureate for the state of Illinois and a Pulitzer Prize winner.  She loved Chicago State.  She loved being in a community in which informed her writing.  And it did that very much so.  If you've ever read any of Gwen's works, you know she writes about the black community or the black experience.  And she and Haki Madhubuti--old [Donald] Don Lee, if you remember Don Lee are both on the faculty. Were both. Haki is still there.  Gwen died, you know, a couple of years ago.  We named a center--there's a Gwendolyn Brooks Center.  And it puts on or sponsors every year this black writers conference.  Wherein we had some of the best and some of the brightest black artists, writers in the country.  We had people like Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, Mari Evans, Nikki Giovanni.  Oh there's another person that--just so many of them--August Wilson.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  So it's a great conference.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes. Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So it's a great conference every year that we have.  In the center [Gwendolyn Brooks Center at Chicago State University] right now we are trying our very best to obtain Gwen's papers.  Miss Brooks, we feel, would want her papers to be at Chicago State. And so one of the things that I've been responsible for with the aid, of course, of President [Emil] Jones and the legislature, is to acquire about thirty-five million dollars to build a new state of the art library.  And we want to acquire Gwen's papers to repose them in our archives.  I think that the estate at this point and time is worth about one million dollars.  And so we're working with [U.S.] Senator [Dick] Durbin as well as other Illinois legislators like [U.S. Congressman] Jesse Jackson Jr. and [U.S.] Congressman [Bobby] Rush, [U.S.] Congressman [Danny K.] Davis [Jr.] to acquire those papers.  Last year we probably would have gotten the one million dollars, but Miss Brooks's daughter Nora [Brooks Blakely] had not completed the overall assessment of the value of the collection.  And so we had to put it off.  So we are trying to get the additional funding now.

Speaker 1: The health program at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now you're a person who's in health?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And I know there have been some innovations in the health care program at Chicago State.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of them.
Speaker 2: Well right now we only have a baccalaureate program in nursing, a baccalaureate program in occupational therapy, and a baccalaureate program in health information administration.  They are doing well.  They are all nationally accredited.  We are though--the new strategic plan that I implemented in 1999 calls for a doctoral program in pharmacy--the Pharm.D.  A doctoral program in physical therapy--the D.P.T.  And we're also looking at a doctoral programs in psychology, the Psy.D.  And we're also looking at a clinical doctoral program in education, the doctorate of educational leadership.  And so that's one of the ways that we're trying to take the university to a new level.  Right now I'm trying to get funding to support planning for the new doctoral program in pharmacy.  Walgreen's [pharmacy store chain] is backing us and helping us to try to get the legislature to give us money.  And they will give us scholarship support.  We are also working with my lobbyist in [Washington] D.C. to help us acquire funding to begin that program as well.  We are also, if the governor in forthcoming, looking toward planning money this year for the doctorate in education.
Story_ID: 6110
Speaker 1: Everything at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] was not wonderful.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It hasn't been.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You were involved in a little controversy a few years ago--,
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --with the invitation of General [Abdusalami] Abubakar--,
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --from Nigeria to Chicago State [in 2001].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What happened with that drama?  He was invited to come and speak and he was--the controversy as I remember it was that he was considered a criminal by many Nigerians here for activities during the war.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.  Well to tell you the truth from what we determined.  He really had been, I do believe Governor of Nigeria after the regime of a very cruel people had been in power.  And he was the individual who stepped down to allow a form of democracy to occur.  Rather than it being a government run by the military.  Perhaps even martial law.  And he felt that there was someone ready to step in as a civilian  and to run the government, he stepped down.  And many people don't give him credit for that.  They don't remember that.  They just remember some of the people who had been in power in close proximity to when he had been.  And so he generated a lot of negative feelings from various Chicagoans who were from Nigeria.  The thing that was important to me and to the administration was that knowing that and knowing also that there was some controversy, we felt that since he was not really labeled a criminal, but had been in proximity to the government that had been rather violent, and really very, very harmful to the constituents of Nigeria, we felt that, where is there a better place than a university setting for that kind of dialog and discourse?  A university is supposed to be a place where one can have civilized debate.  The pros and cons about various issues.  And so that's the forum in which it was set.  Now not to say that we did not have high security on the campus.  Because I received a lot of negative e-mail and so did many other people.  But I think the fact is that it turned out well.  It was very, very well attended, because there were pros and cons.  There were those Nigerians who were supportive of him.  And then there were those who were not supportive of him.  And then we had a situation set up and a venue appropriate to receive him, and a program that was structured to do just what a university should do. That is to engage in civilized debate about the issues that he generated.  And other issues related to Pan-Africanism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I really felt and the students felt and many of the faculty felt that it was a good learning experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything you'd do about that that's different, now that you  look back on it?
Speaker 2: No.  I wouldn't do it any different.  Because it's like, you know, people decided  whether or not they would have a [Nation of Islam Minister Louis] Farrakhan on their campus.  Whether they will have an [Reverend] Al Sharpton on their campus.  We do not live in a  closeted world, wherein you can hide reality from people.  And you have to in order to be a liberally educated person, you need to be able to engage in discourse about the pros and the cons of various entities, people, situations, what have you.  And so I felt and the students felt that it was a wonderful learning experience.  The exposure to the various persons in power in that country, coming to this city, our campus, with the pomp and circumstance and the protocols and that sort of thing that occurred at that campus for our students to see.  And to have real pride in their heritage was good.  And the students were really very, very supportive.  And we talked about the things that had happened with the regime who was in close proximity to his reign as governor of that state.  And we even talked about what his term had been like and the things that he had done.  And there were many, many positive things that General Abubakar had done while he was the governor of Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Someone and probably a different kind of person unlike a Minister Farrakhan or Al Sharpton, he was accused of actually--,
Speaker 2: Killing people.
Speaker 1: --killing people.  Yeah.  Which is something that those who disliked Malcolm X and those who disliked, you know, they don't have quite the same--.
Speaker 2: But there was a lot of venom too against Farrakhan.  Because there's a lot of people who felt that he had a lot to do with the death of Malcolm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You see.  Uh-huh.  So, it's a university setting.  And I don't think that we should hide reality from the students.  And so, and I think that--I know that the outcome of the conference was a great learning experience for the students on our campus.
Story_ID: 6111
Speaker 1: Has the university [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] continued to, you know, try hold a Pan-African programs and tried to--?
Speaker 2: We have.  Right now I was instrumental in acquiring a grant from U.S.A.I.D [United States Agency for International Development], about actually a million dollars, to develop linkage agreements with South Africa--actually three South African colleges, universities, Technikons [South African universities of technology consortium].  And we've had the grant now for two years.  Each summer we travel there.  They were--representatives from those three universities were here in the fall of last year.  And we have about seven students, exchange students from South Africa on the campus now.  And we have five students who will go to various universities in South Africa that we have the linkage agreement.  One is the University of Zululand [KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa].  Another one is--there are two others but their names elude me at this point.  But one of the things that I think is so very, very important for our young black people particularly, is they get an opportunity to get a different world view.  So often they only have--can place the American lens on experiences.  And this way they get a different worldview.  So that they can appreciate the things here.  They can appreciate the differences in other cultures, become more sensitive to the differences and know that there are so many similarities as well.  So one of the things that I've tried to do at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] and that I have done is I established an office of international studies.  And I tried to push at least five to six percent of our students abroad each year.  So now we have also linkage agreements with the University of Toledo [Spain] in Madrid [Spain]. And our students go there every year.  They go to Bristol, England.  They go to Durban, South Africa.  They go to The Gambia and they go to Ghana each summer.  And so we are looking to even expand the linkage agreement to the University of Paris in France very, very shortly.  But I really pushed that.  Because I find that many of our students are very parochial.  A lot of them live right there on the south side and don't even venture to the loop.  And they need those kinds of experiences by the time they graduate so that they can become even greater contributors to our society and excellent citizens for this state and the nation.
Story_ID: 6112
Speaker 1: What's your assessment of today's student?  I mean they're a little bit different.  When you were in school, your classmates were largely rural Southern and sort of activists, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, meeting this activism, civil rights activism right at its very beginning stages.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: North Carolina A&T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] being the first school to launch a sit-in demonstration.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What about today's students?  Your students at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] in particular.  They're urban.  They live probably at home and it's a commuter campus for the most part.
Speaker 2: For the most part.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's hard to answer.  Because I have a more nontraditional population of students.  If you ask me about high school students, I'd give you a different answer.  But most of the people, a great deal of them of our students are part-time.  So only 60 percent are full-time.  Many of them are heads of households.  75 percent of my students are female.  And so you find that many of our students work full-time jobs and try to acquire a university education as well.  And so some of the activism engagement that occurs on a university campus is a little different for us because as you indicated many of our students commute.  I have only one residence hall on that campus and it holds about 350 students.  So you see the bulk of the 7,500 students that we enroll basically live off campus, live at home.  And so the ambiance of a residential college is not as significant as you would find with a university that everybody just about lives on campus and a few commute.  But if I talked about the young student of today, right out of high school, I have some concern.  I'd say in the past five years, students have been particularly apathetic I think.  I think there is a little more activism occurring now.  But the concerns, I guess, that I have, and maybe it has to do with their socialization.  You know, in an era when we have such concepts being espoused as "Greed is good," with [Michael] Mike Douglas [actor] in [motion picture] 'Wall Street'.  You find a lot of materialism, concepts of materialism being embraced by students.  Students wanna go to school not just to get a good education or to become a liberally educated man or woman.  But they wanna go to school to get a good job.  They wanna go to school to make money.  And somewhere along the way, the traditional idea of becoming a liberally educated person who was willing to give back to their fellow man to uplift the people that surround them, or to be a contributing member of society gets lost a little bit.  I think sometimes about some of the things that we're seeing even happening in the more affluent communities.  That hazing incident for example.  The Columbine [High School, massacre in Littleton, Colorado]--there's something happening to our youth of today that, to me, is a bit unsettling.
Story_ID: 6113
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community in general?
Speaker 2: Well I guess one of the things that I think about our black community is that we need to become more cohesive.  You know, with shared visions and shared goals.  So often when one of us escapes from poverty or from a different lifestyle, to a more elevated, one, we rather than being supportive as we need to be, we sometimes try to knock them down.  And so the idea to me of being more cohesive.  And I sometimes look at what has happened to us as a people.  And think that that's why we respond in some ways of not really having a real sense of who we are, from whence we come and a sense of lineage a sense of place.  But being--having been displaced, misplaced by being pulled up from our roots.  That we are always a bit less cohesive as a people.  We are not as close--we are not as closely knit, let me say that, as some of the other cultures that we see in the country.  Like the Jewish people or the Hispanic people or what have you. That worries me sometimes.  That there is such disparate interest, disparate support systems for lack of better language, amongst our people.  And that to some extent is a worry for me.  So if I had a wish, it would be that we could become a more cohesive group of people.  More supportive of each other, more lifting up, more mentoring.  Not to say that it doesn't happen.  But it doesn't happen, I think, as much I feel it should.
Story_ID: 6114
Speaker 1: I neglected to ask you about your military career.
Speaker 2: Ah. (Laughs)
Speaker 1: So tell us about that.
Speaker 2: I'll very quickly tell you that in 1972, I became a captain in the [U.S.] Air Force.  I did it basically because my friends were doing that.  I didn't really think about the positiveness, you know, becoming a military careerist.  And so I went in, stayed a couple of years, became inactive.  And then I was asked to become chief nurse of a field--army field hospital in 1979.  And so I was promoted to major in the [U.S.] Army Nurse Reserve.  And that was a very, very interesting experience.  And, in fact, sometimes I wish I still were because it--you know, you have to weigh in (laughs).  It keeps you on a diet and makes you exercise because you have to be very physically fit.  And since I'm no longer in it, I'm not too physically fit.  But anyway the learning experience was wonderful.  I mean I hear this antiterrorism stuff.  The [Office of] Homeland Security agency and all that.  And they talk about the nuclear, biological chemical attacks that we could experience.  I have right now my gas mask (laughs) in my house.  I have my mop suit in my house and all of that came from the experiences that I had as being a member of a field hospital unit.  The other thing that I'd say about my military career that I appreciate is that you know, you can become very comfortable with all the accoutrements of home.  Running water, you know.  Electricity, et cetera, and sometimes you wonder can you really survive?  You know.  And I've taken a bath in a helmet.  Or having to go to the bathroom (laughs) in the woods or whatever.  Or sleeping in an outdoor tent where the spiders and, you know, snakes and stuff and pitching your own tent.  And it makes you quite resourceful really.  Because the average person seeing me probably would not think that I had those kinds of experiences or that I have those kinds of skills and competencies, but I do.  Knowing how to read a map and, you know, those experiences are really life support, life saving experiences really.  As I said I started out as a captain.  I got promoted to major, then lieutenant colonel and then full bird colonel.  I've been chief nurse.  I've been commander of a unit as well. and it was a great experience.  I retired in 2000.  And I am enjoying the fruits of my labor in retirement pay, which is quite good.  And I encourage young women and men to pursue a career as a reservist particularly.  I mean now that we have so many little wars going on, I'm not so sure that I would be as supportive or, you know, suggest that people pursue that.  Because, you know, you may very well get in harms way.  But in peacetime (laughs) it has been very, very good.  And it is really a very good way to prepare for retirement.  I've been that kind of person all of my life.  I've always been preparing for retirement.  I hope I live to see it.  But it's something that the average person doesn't think about.  In, you know, the additional income that comes from a military career.  Even as a reservist.
Story_ID: 6115
Speaker 1: Now do you think you'll retire from Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], or--?
Speaker 2: I plan to at this juncture.
Speaker 1: And what else do you plan for the future?
Speaker 2: I--for the future, of course, you know, continue the presidency for at least another five years. And then I will retire back to Hampton [Virginia].  Sit on my back porch, which is three fourths surrounded by water.  The Hampton River runs into a lake that my house sits on.  And maybe sit in my rocking chair and enjoy my grandchild or my grandchildren.  If it's such by that time, and travel.  You know.  I love to travel. I traveled a lot in my life.  But there are places that I have not yet visited that I would like to see.  So that's what I see in my retirement life being like.  Enjoying my grandchildren, doing some writing too.  Now each year I try to publish at least one article or a chapter.  But I'd like to really write.  To publish a book.  I've not had the time to really publish a book.  And I'd like to do that as well as I think about and get prepared for retirement.
Speaker 1: Would you--are you considering an academic book, or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I love writing really.  And I think a novel would be kind of fun to do as well.  So--but right now it's mostly academic.  Although the novel thing has always been very, very intriguing to me.
Story_ID: 6116
Speaker 1: When you reflect back over the things that you have done and accomplished--,
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What would you see as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: Well I think my legacy probably would be the fact that I was a caring, nurturing human being who contributed to the uplift of her people.  That's what I would like to be known as.  But I think my legacy--most of the people who know me probably see the contributions that I've made more in the field of nursing.  I've been involved in so many firsts.  I was the first black woman to become the president of a state board of nursing.  The first to establish a graduate program in a historically black institution.  The first to establish a nursing clinic and a health mobile in a black institution.  The first to establish a nurse practitioner program in a black institution.  The first to--established the first program in pharmacy at Hampton.  A doctorate of physical therapy program at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  So I've been known a lot.  My legacy is mostly in the area of healthcare I'd say.  And the things that I have been able to achieve, particularly in that area.  If I looked at Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois], probably would be the--a legacy of building.  Since I had been at Chicago State--when I first arrived actually, they had not received any capital funding for new edifices in twenty years.  Now since I've been there we now have monies for a thirty-five million dollar library, a thirty-two million dollar conference center, a five million dollar--no, a convocation center--a thirty-two million dollar convocation center.  A five million dollar conference center, a five million dollar childcare center and a five million dollar financial outreach center and a ten million dollar renovation of the oldest building on our campus.  So I think as I look at that legacy it would be related to expansion of the university.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And bringing in more and more resources.  Since I've been there the amount of external funding has gone up from fifteen million dollars to as high as thirty-five million dollars last year.  The average that we do now is at least twenty-five million dollars.  So we've gone up at least ten million dollars in funding and in some instances twenty million dollars since I've been there.
Speaker 1: This last question is similar to legacy.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered though?
Speaker 2: I think I really kind of said that earlier on in answering your other question.  And that is that I'm a caring--that she was a caring, humanistic individual, who nurtured and mentored and contributed to the up lift of her people.
