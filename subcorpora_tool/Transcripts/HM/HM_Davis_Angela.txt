Story_ID: 17293
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to start out -- I ask five questions of everyone, their little people magazine so just bear with me.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: Actually, my favorite food is tofu - scrambled tofu. But scrambled only in the way I know how to do it.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I suppose I enjoy the spring, when it's not too hot and not too cold.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to say that my favorite color was purple, but now it's somewhere between purple and green.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: Actually over the last couple of years my favorite place to vacation is Australia--Brisbane, Australia, off the coast is a beautiful island named Stradbroke and that has become in the last few years my most favorite vacation place.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know whether I have a favorite phrase.
Speaker 1: That's fine. I would have trouble, too. Some of them just slip them out.
Story_ID: 17294
Speaker 1: Okay, I'd like to start out by talking about your father and his side of the family. I'd just like you to start off by stating his name and just what you know about his background and his family.
Speaker 2: My father's name was B. Frank Davis--Benjamin Frank Davis. He grew up in an area called Marengo County, Alabama, which is on the border of Mississippi. The closest town was/is called Linden, Alabama. He grew up on a farm.  I had the opportunity, when I was young, to visit that farm on many occasions. That was actually one of our favorite summer vacation places. My father went to high school in Birmingham, Alabama at an Episcopalian high school.  He became involved with the Episcopalian church because they offered him an opportunity to get an education, so that eventually he ended up attending St. Augustine's College in Raleigh, North Carolina, which is an Episcopalian church [school]. Returned to Birmingham, began to teach Latin and other subjects in the Episcopalian high school there. He spent a number of years in the service during World War II and as a matter of fact my mother, who was recruiting young men to fight Fascism in Europe. Later when he returned he discovered that it was quite difficult to support a family which was growing; I was born during the time he was in the service, during World War II. He decided that he would open up a business for himself and eventually created a service station and parking lot in downtown Birmingham [Alabama]. And as a result of the fact that he had one of the only black-owned service stations in the city, and certainly the only black parking lot close to the downtown area of Birmingham, he became a kind of legend among black people in the city. In a sense his station was the gateway to downtown, so he got to know a huge number of black people in Birmingham and of course they got to know him. So that when he died in 1983, and we held the funeral at the Episcopalian church in Birmingham, it was quite astounding that there were hundreds and hundreds of people they could not all fit into the church.
Story_ID: 17295
Speaker 1: Do you know how he came to own the station? Do you know that story?
Speaker 2: I don't know the specifics of it, but I do know he leased a small service station on the corner of 16th Street and Fourth Avenue. Another interesting aspect about the location of the service station is that it is just a couple of blocks away from the 16th Street Baptist Church and from the area that served as a mobilization location for all of the demonstrations that took place during the Civil Rights era in Birmingham [Alabama]. It's also located on Fourth Avenue, which at that time was the place where virtually all of the black businesses, located downtown, were situated. So I think that he found, he was confronted with this opportunity to lease this broken down station for a sum that he could afford at the time and decided to do it, and eventually expanded it. Eventually he was able to get the lot next to the station and turn that into a parking lot. Yeah, it's just something I took for granted. The question is interesting because it never occurs to me to think about my father without that service station; that was his life. He went everyday except Sunday. We all, all of the children, did some work there.  My younger brother was parking cars when he was eight years old, and, you know, I was working in the office and also pumping gas when I was quite young. So we all grew up around the service station.
Story_ID: 17296
Speaker 1: Now I want to just go back to his growing up. Was he a talker, and did he talk about growing up as a young black man.
Speaker 2: My father was very reticent. He was not forthcoming in the way many black men and indeed black people of his generation were not necessarily forthcoming, but he did use his history to whip us into shape sometimes by talking about, of course, how difficult it was for him to get an education. His, you know, the fact that he was only able to go to high school as a result of moving to Birmingham [Alabama]. The same with my mother; she never would have been able to attend high school had she not left the town where she grew up.  Birmingham had basically the only high school for black people for many, many, many miles, so my father would often evoke his experiences as a way of comparing them to ours in the hopes that we would appreciate the opportunities that we had. Of course we didn't. We did, but we came to not so much acknowledge these evocations of his own childhood as something that we needed to examine and explore, but as a way of admonishing us for not appreciating what he and my mother had given us.
Story_ID: 17297
Speaker 1: Now you know his mother though, too, your grandmother, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about her, or did she share any stories at all herself?
Speaker 2: Well we knew where she raised the family. There were very sort of contested aspects of my family's history. They were married differently, by different members of the family. My father didn't talk very much.  I have an aunt who was more talkative. Another aunt who was also quite talkative, but I think like to embellish the past in a way that made it unrecognizable to others. So that we have these narratives that we relate to others and we're not exactly sure. We do know that my father's father was white, and as a matter of fact of his siblings, all of them with the exception of the eldest who was my Aunt Ella, had white fathers. Now, we have not been able ascertain a great deal of information about the nature of the relationship, but it's most certain that this was a man who owned the land on which my grandmother and her husband lived. And I have spent time talking to people there, but certain things are not considered to be appropriate topics of conversation among older generations.
Story_ID: 17298
Speaker 1: I understand. Now you spent, as you said, a time in Marengo County [Alabama], right Angela?  Can you describe what it was like?
Speaker 2: It was the country. It was the country. There was, at the time I spent vacations there during the summer or sometimes my father would say, "You know, let's go to the country" we'd go down and spend the day.  Go down early Sunday morning and my mother would make food, fried chicken or whatever, we'd drive down and spend the day in the country, come back. But it was the country. I can remember that the outhouse was where we went to the bathroom. There were no electrical or gas heaters, so that everything was heated with a woodstove or a potbellied stove, and so was cooking. As I say in my autobiography, I developed a kind of utopian idyllic way of remembering those days, and I recognize the need to be somewhat critical of my tendency to romanticize what was obviously a very difficult life for my father's siblings. But I do remember the animals. I do remember Pearl, the mule. You know, I do remember riding on the mules, as well as going out to the fields when the fields were plowed. My uncle who, well I had one uncle and one aunt who remained there, my Uncle Henry and my Aunt Ella. We primarily visited my Uncle Henry who had a pretty extensive farm. He grew cotton. He grew, I remember the watermelons, all kinds of greens and that kind of thing. And as children we were put to work, as is always the case in situations that are reliable, that rely on agricultural work in that respect, so yeah, as kids we were put to work. But of course we didn't do that for most of our childhood so it was fun. It was fun learning how to stand behind the plow with my uncle and it was fun getting the eggs from the chickens, although I think many of the people who have memories from that period point out the sort of horrors of watching the chickens being killed and running around the yard with their heads cut off. I have those memories as well.
Story_ID: 17299
Speaker 1: Now your mother can you give her name and talk about, you know, her background?  I know less about my mother's background.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Sallye Bell Davis. S-a-l-l-y-e B-e-l-l D-a-v-i-s. My mother lived for most of year youth prior to high school in a town called Sylacauga. Sylacauga, Alabama.  Can you spell that?
Speaker 1: Sylacauga. It's a Native American name. She was born in a place called Goodwater, Alabama, and was fostered [foster parented] by the Bell's, her foster mother and her foster father, and I have vague memories of Grandmother Bell and Grandfather Bell. What I remember most is the period when he died and was in the hospital in Birmingham [Alabama]. My mother also developed a very close sisterly relationship with another child who grew up under similar circumstances the only child in her family, and she became our Aunt Elizabeth. Aunt Elizabeth. And what's interesting to me about the current sort of obsession with distinguishing between adopted families, foster families, birth families, what's interesting to me is that we did not learn how to make such a distinction at all. It never occurred to us, or it never occurred to my mother to try to find the mother who had actually given birth to her, because she said the Bell's were her family and she had no need to go any further than that. And Aunt Elizabeth was her sister, even though they had no biological relationship. And I think about that way of making family as having been a very important part of African American history; this ability to create the family, often under very adverse circumstances. I experienced that in my life. So I don't know a great deal about what one might call my mother's biological family, but I do know that when she graduated from elementary school she was determined to go to high school; went to Birmingham, which was I think it's an hour, an hour or an hour and a half away from Sylacauga, and was able to sufficiently impress the principal of the high school for whom the high school is now named, A.H. Parker, that he and his wife invited her to live in their house. So during the time she was in high school she lived with the Parkers and was basically adopted by them as well. They are the ones who encouraged her to go to college, or made it possible for her to go to college. So, yeah, I had the opportunity to meet them before they died as well.
Speaker 2: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 1: My mother is a very quiet but determined person who places great emphasis on learning. We knew when we were very, very young that we would be going to college. My mother taught us how to read when we were say two, three. By the time we were four we were all reading beyond first grade level. So she had that, I say "had" because my mother is still living today but she has Alzheimer's, so it's actually very good for me to think about her before she was afflicted with this disease that has robbed her of virtually all of her memory and sense of connection to people. I think of my mother as also a person who gave us a sense of adventure, and sometimes I wonder why it is I decided, myself later, to take off when I was--how old was I?  Eighteen years old, go to Europe alone with no idea of where I was going to stay, and I don't know whether my mother would have agreed with that, but I think I probably got that sense of adventure, the desire to travel, the desire to see beyond the sometimes narrow confines of the local situation, Birmingham, Alabama. I know that from the time I was very young I saw myself moving on, so that I ended up going to high school in New York. But of course my mother had moved from Sylacauga to Birmingham. She went to Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama]. And then while we were quite young, she spent I think four summers in New York City at NYU [New York University, New York] getting her masters. So I think I realized that based on my mother's influence that it was possible to accomplish things that others would have considered entirely out of the question. She always had that kind of determination.  It seems like she's a person who have saw a world beyond her very, you know, small world and explored it.
Story_ID: 17300
Speaker 1: Let me ask you what your earliest memories growing up was, do you have an earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Well of course memories are not always the immediate memories of a particular time because they're pictures that enhance memory or create memory. But I do think I remember when I was very young we lived in the projects in Birmingham. There's this wonderful picture of a birthday party, a friend's birthday party, and I can remember the joy of playing with Margaret Burnham when I was two and she was three. I do remember very vividly, and I think I say in my autobiography, that this is the memory that etched itself on my brain from the earliest period of my childhood. And that has to do with the bombing of houses, of a house across the street from where my parents moved when we left the projects. That area of Birmingham came to be called 'Dynamite Hill', precisely because the Klu Klux Klan and other racist formations were determined to prevent black people from moving into that part of Birmingham. Actually we had the, well the house that my mother and father decided they liked and they wanted to buy was serendipitously on the other side of what became the dividing line between the segregated white neighborhood and the segregated black neighborhood. But right across the street was the most contested part of that neighborhood, and every time a black person moved in or purchased a house across the street there was a bombing, there was a fire. So my earliest memory is the sound of this thunderous warlike end of the world, and I was, as I relate in my autobiography, I was actually washing my shoelaces preparing for church the next day and was alone in the bathroom when that happened, and having had no previous memory to allow that to make any kind of sense to me. It was thoroughly frightening. And I do remember that my mother was very comforting. And I didn't say this about her, but she always had a way of making us feel that everything was going to be all right.
Story_ID: 17301
Speaker 1: Now, do you know how your parents came to, you know, to buy that house there, and what year was it? Because your father comes back, you know you say from the service. You know, he has a small--there was just you at that point, or was there you and your--oh, I'd like you to say who your siblings are.
Speaker 2: Okay. Yeah. By that time my brother had been born. I'm the eldest, okay. I have a brother named after my father, Benjamin Frank Davis. (Pause) Yeah, my brother is about a year and nine months younger than I am, so he had been born at that time.  And I have a sister, Fania Elizabeth Davis. She was named after my father's sister, whose name was originally Fannie Mae and she changed it to Fania after some Russian woman; it was a name she heard and of course she was interested in trying to remove the affect of the country from her name. Then I have a younger brother whose name is Reginald, Reginald Wayne Davis, and he was--is about seven or eight years younger than I am.  So girl, boy, girl, boy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly. That's precisely the way my parents say they planned it, so.
Speaker 2: But do you know how your parents ended up, you know, moving? Because you moved from the government housing project into this house.
Speaker 1: Right. Well, I don't think they had planned to stay in the projects forever. And at that time it was possible for people to buy homes. This was, you know, a huge house that needed a lot of repair.  It was actually a historic Victorian house from the turn of the century, and it cost $6,000.  So $6,000 then, although it was an enormous amount of money, proportionately it was far less than what a person has to pay to buy a house at that time.  So anyone with a job could basically buy a house. And they told me the story that when I was very young I always said I wanted to live in a big white house on a hill. So, the story is they found the big white house on the hill and they bought it to satisfy me.
Story_ID: 17302
Speaker 1: What were your parents saying?
Speaker 2: Well you have to recognize that this was actually quite normal. We didn't question it. Yes I do remember that when we visited California we'd often drive to Los Angeles during the summer and spend a few weeks or a few months there. So that on the one hand we had my Aunt Fania who lived in Hollywood and who was quite wealthy. On the other hand the majority of the family was very poor, so that the children of my father's other sister, Aunt Florida or actually I would say her grandchildren, had so many problems over the years. When we were in California in LA [Los Angeles]we were shuttled between the Hollywood Hills to the ghetto and where often times they had no money to buy food. That was the strangest part of the experience, and I can remember wondering why my aunt didn't support the children. But she apparently gave them a place to stay, but she owned all of this property in South Central Los Angeles, and in that sense was a kind of slumlord I guess you would say, but she did give them to stay. But I can remember that they had very little and whenever we visited it would be my father who would go shopping and buy food, and eventually some of the children met tragic ends. My cousin Barbara, who was the granddaughter of my Aunt Florida [Davis], my father's older sister, married a young man who apparently was involved in some way or another with drugs. We're not sure exactly what happened, but what we do know is that she and her mother-in-law, they were living with her mother-in-law. She and her mother-in-law were killed by a group of young men who broke into the house looking for the husband. Her children were then raised by my Aunt Fania, and then another similar tragedy was the cause of my cousin Bessie's death.  My cousin Bessie was the daughter of my father's brother Henry [Davis] and his wife, Aunt Daisy. Bessie had lived with us for quite a number of years. She stayed in Marengo County [Alabama] with her father and her mother and then lived with us in Birmingham, and eventually made the trek out to California as virtually the entire family did. She married a minister and had several children. One of her sons was involved in the gang culture in Los Angeles and as a result of some problem, some conflicts, the group from the gang--from the rival gang, broke into my cousin Bessie's house and killed her and one of her children. My cousin, the son of Bessie who was the person involved in the gang culture, is still in prison and has been in prison now for twenty years or so. So there's, you know, there's the successful side of the family, but there's you know also there are those reminders that we're very much connected with the fate of the majority of black people in this country.
Story_ID: 17303
Speaker 1: Now if you take yourself back to Center Street [in Birmingham, Alabama] can you just describe the neighborhood and even in terms of maybe sights and sounds.
Speaker 2: Well when we first moved to the big white house on the hill, the corner of Center Street and 11th Court. Center Street was paved, 11th Court was not--it was a dirt road. There were not very many people living in the neighborhood, and what I remember, interestingly enough, is that we played with the white kids and it seemed to be okay. You know I can remember one, a little white boy down the street and we were playmates up to a certain time, and then he disappeared of course and we never really saw him again. During my earliest childhood this area was not developed at all so there were woods, so I can remember the snakes in our yard. I can remember picking blackberries. I can remember forays into the woods that sometimes worried my mother. And then eventually the neighborhood began to be developed--gradually developed. So that I remember when 11th Court was paved, which meant we lost a good deal of our front yard because now there would be sidewalks and a street, as opposed to the red dirt that turned into mud during periods of rain.  I remember the children who eventually moved to that neighborhood, lifelong friends, people who became my lifelong friends. I should say that on the right side of Center Street, if you are facing south I suppose, black people were allowed to move in, to buy houses, to buy land and build houses. On the other side of the street for many, many years it was considered a white area, legally I think, I think it was legally zoned to be a white area so that we were not allowed to walk on the other side of the street. So this is something that I remember as a thing from my childhood, wondering what's on the other side of the street, sometimes with friends being so bold as to run across the street to defy what we knew were the law, or at least the expectations. And I think I described in autobiography a game we used to play which involved running up and ringing some white person's bell, and being able to make it to safety on the other side of the street by the time they came to the door. A few other families moved to the neighborhood. The Cores, Madeline Core, who is now a dentist in Birmingham, Alabama, was one of my--is one of my lifelong friends. We had an enormous amount of fun playing games like hide and go seek, and the whole neighborhood would be--we played hide and go seek not in a particular spot, but we had sometimes a three-block radius. And I can remember in the summertime playing beyond the light of day, playing in the darkness, and that was fine. No one cared. There was no threat, even though there was this threat of racism that constantly reminded us of the power of the individuals who controlled the city, at least, [T. Eugene] Bull Connor [commissioner of public safety, BIrmingham, Alabama]. I'm mentioning him because he was the central figure in the government of the city for years and years and years, whether he was the mayor, whether he was the police chief, he was something. But we were able somehow to bracket that, I would say, and have a wonderful time. So I can remember those long, long summer days and we played hide-and-go-seek, games that sometimes lasted for four or five hours before you could actually find everyone. Smells--honeysuckle, lightening bugs, fireflies, those are the things that, you know--picking cherries, picking blackberries those are the things that remind me of the joy of my childhood.
Story_ID: 17304
Speaker 1: Any sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds? Let me see. What kind of sounds? You know, well over the last say fifteen years say I've developed a kind of hobby of identifying birds, and so I'm aware of those sounds but I don't know if I had any awareness at that time. I do know that we focused on cars. You know one of the games we used to play had to do with the ability to identify the brand names of all of the cars that passed. And then another game, which I think I also describe in my autobiography, involved calling the white people names who drove by our house, or drove through the neighborhood, without getting caught. So perhaps those are sounds that I can remember.
Story_ID: 17305
Speaker 1: And family life, what was family life like?
Speaker 2: Well we were always doing a lot of things. It was very hectic, and I suppose that's why I have a higher tolerance for doing many things simultaneously, traveling, because there was always a lot going on in our house. My mother and father worked, and my mother told me that she developed an agreement with my father that involved his participating in the work of providing, or doing the reproductive labor let me put it that way, within the house; who would cook, who would clean, and who would get the children ready. And my mother, who went back to teaching after we were born, realized before the women's liberation movement, that there was no way in the world that she could do all of that alone. There was no way in the world that she could work a fulltime job and do a fulltime job at home. And I think that's also a theme of African American life that I've always been struck by the fact that gender relations have never really matched the norm, although increasingly they do today, but of course these are very different circumstances. So, yes, I can remember how crazy it was in the morning when we had six people getting ready to get out. My father would be cooking breakfast, we would all, you know, rush to be the first in the bathroom, we were getting our books together, and somehow we all did it. I think my mother decided that, or my mother and father decided that my father would cook during the week, and he cooked breakfast every morning that I can remember except on the weekends. And my mother would get us ready, get herself and get us bathed, and dressed, and so forth.  And I am absolutely amazed that they were able to do that. That she was able to do that, you know, get us all to school on time. She had her schoolwork, so she had her lesson plans that she stayed up late doing. I can kind of remember that. You know my father had, of course, his favorite place in front of the television, his recliner. And we all took music lessons, and dancing lessons, and did trips, and went to museums, and you know, we were always doing something, art lessons, sports, you name it, it was always happening.
Story_ID: 17306
Speaker 1: Now your mother, she started going to New York when you were six for the summers, was that around, I think--
Speaker 2: I think maybe I was seven. I think maybe when I was six I went. My first trip to New York was with the Burnhams. I went alone to visit them, I remember.
Speaker 1: Because they had already lived-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: They had already moved to New York.
Speaker 1: So you went back to back to be with your friend, Margaret [Burnham] for the summer?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you remember that trip?
Speaker 1: Well I remember it was a long drive from Birmingham [Alabama] to New York. I don't have much of a memory of the trip, but I do remember my first impressions of New York. And I was five or six, I may have been five but probably six, and I suppose having experienced New York at such an early age I developed this desire to see much more than what increasingly became for me a kind of confined provincial climate, intellectual, artistic, social climate in Birmingham. You know I just remember being totally amazed that there could be a city as large as that, that there could be so many people, that there could be so many different kinds of people. And I think I also mentioned in my autobiography, although it may not be there but it probably is, I remember being so impressed by hearing black people speaking Spanish. And that is in my autobiography. Yeah, that just opened up all kinds of new worlds for me, I suppose.  I remember going to camp and learning Mexican folk dances, things that never been even mentioned in Birmingham, which isn't to say that I don't appreciate the education I got in Birmingham; I think I learned a great deal more, particularly about African American history in the schools I attended in Birmingham than I ever would have learned anywhere else. But New York was--totally expanded my sense of what was possible in the world.
Story_ID: 17307
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about what you were learning about black history at the time too, you know, in the schools and?
Speaker 2: Well in a sense I think that this emphasis on the accomplishments of black people, and we didn't call it black history then. Right, there was 'Negro History Week', but there wasn't this concept, black history.  But I see it as a survival mechanism. It was so important for us to learn that we, as black children, that we were much more than what the prevailing authorities represented black people as being; mainly inferior. We were barred from the white schools, we were barred from most aspects of society in Birmingham, so that I utterly appreciate the fact that so many of my teachers must have been thinking very consciously about subverting that sense of inferiority that might well have become entrenched. And many of us, if we fashioned our own identities after the definition of blackness and black people that we heard from in the status quo, so yes we had.  I know that when I went to New York finally, to go to high school at age fifteen, I knew a great deal more about black people's contributions. I knew how to sing what we call then 'The Negro National Anthem' [also known as 'Lift Every Voice and Sing'] because we sang that all the time. I knew about Benjamin Banneker [first black American scientist]. You know I knew about George Washington Carver [scientist], but I also knew about Ida B. Wells [early civil rights activist], and I also knew about Mary McLeod Bethune [educator/activist]. So that it seems that our teachers, for those of us who were excited about this, to create some company for us; to create a very different kind of imagine community than the community that got evoked by the white mayors and white police chiefs, and the white supervisors of education.
Story_ID: 17308
Speaker 1: You know, I never ask this question but I was just thinking about, I mean your books have Southern history and they, you know, talked the blacks who are wanting to really be inspired--so how were the black teachers? I've never really asked this. What were they using as their support material? I mean, was it the black newspaper?
Speaker 2: Yeah, black newspapers. As a matter of fact I can remember doing many, many projects. This is something that I remember.  Posters, I can remember, say, this colored, what do you call it, poster board?  And taking on projects of say finding out everything we could about, say, black musicians, or finding out whatever we could about black scientists. And finding their pictures, and cutting their pictures out and putting them on the poster board.  So yes, we relied a great deal on the black press at that time; 'Ebony', 'JET' [periodicals]. In Birmingham we actually had two black newspapers. I ask myself now why there were two, but there was the 'The Birmingham World' and the 'Birmingham Mirror' and they were both black newspapers. I do remember teachers expressing critical ideas regarding the textbooks that we used. We were aware of the source of these textbooks. We knew that these were textbooks that were primarily directed towards white students, so I can remember being aware of that. I can't remember whether this was actually discussed, but I do know that in the history books that portrayed black people as being joyful in their chains and happy that they had someone to support them even though this meant slavery.  I do remember critical discussions about that.
Story_ID: 17309
Speaker 1: And how did you find school, because you were already more than prepared coming in, so did you find school very easy? Did you find it challenging? Were you bored?  What?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I found it easy. But my mother always insisted on - my mother's a teacher, she was an elementary school teacher, so she always had projects for us. Every summer we had these competitions with respect to  how many books we could read during the summer, so we would all race to read as many books as we could. And of course we would be questioned on the books, so we couldn't pretend that we had read them. So I think that my mother was responsible for creating a kind of intellectual atmosphere in our home that made us, oh, quite excited about learning. We didn't see it as a chore.
Story_ID: 17310
Speaker 1: Now what was the young Angela Davis like?
Speaker 2: My niece, Essa?
Speaker 1: No, you.
Speaker 2: Oh. Okay.  Allright. Now it's interesting because I was thinking about her and she has my name, and I was going to say that when she was growing up my sister and I helped to raise her. Actually my sister was in law school so I took on a portion of the parenting responsibilities. My sister never once had to tell her to do her homework. It was actually quite amazing. As a matter of fact, sometimes we had to tell her she needed to get some sleep; she was staying up too late. And I think that came from my mother, that kind of driven, self-motivated desire to learn. So I suppose I was somewhat similar to her. Although, I do remember that my mother was this quite powerful force in our lives. I don't remember her being authoritarian, but I do remember her constantly urging us to, you know, to read, do our music. I took music lessons I think every week from the time I was six until I was fifteen. And I didn't enjoy playing the piano that much.  Later, I came to appreciate music, but I did see that as something that was forced upon me by my mother.  I also played in the band so I learned clarinet, and I was saying before that our lives were very full, our music lessons, our band practice, our dance lessons. Every Saturday we took dancing for many, many hours, I  think from about nine until twelve, and you know it was ballet, and tap dancing, and modern and all of that. And I appreciate it now, I don't know whether I appreciated it so much then because I do remember sometimes just wanting to do nothing--just wanting to relax and rest. And now people tell me that I can never just sit and do nothing. And I realize that it must have come from that very early period where we were constantly occupied with doing something.

Speaker 1: Are you a right brain, left brain person? Because I was interested to learn that your favorite subjects were, I don't' know if it's math and science.
Speaker 2: At one time, at one time.
Speaker 1: Yet you're such, you know, a good writer. You know people don't usually have both skills.
Speaker 2: Well my interests shifted. I suppose that I wasn't aware of what could be done within the humanities, so that as a elementary student and during the first couple of years of high school I did in Birmingham before I moved to New York to finish my high school there I was interested in chemistry and math. But I think it's probably because I had not yet been exposed to the expanse of the humanities. And once I entered this high school in New York it completely shifted.  You know I read in my junior year in high school, I think I read  [Karl] Marx. I read [Sigmund] Freud, and all kinds of literary figures whom I had not known, so I changed then.
Story_ID: 17312
Speaker 1: Now I want to talk about just before you were leaving  to go away and what you were like at that point. I know that you wanted to be a pediatrician, and I'm wondering even why you thought you wanted to be a pediatrician. What, was it to take care of the kids or--?
Speaker 2: Well apparently I had an interest in the field of medicine from the time I was very young. I don't know exactly where it came from. I don't know whether it was encouraged by my parents or not, but the stories they told me had to do with the fact that I went to a nursery school which was attached to or next door to a children's hospital, the same children's hospital where I was born. So during the time I was in nursery school and kindergarten I spent a great deal of time, and I do have these vague memories of the doctors there, and I have a memory of being a patient in that hospital myself when I had to get my tonsils taken out. And I think I was also struck with the medical personality of the doctors and the nurses. And I learned how to live with it daily going to school every day so that it basically persuaded me that that's what I wanted to do with my life.
Speaker 1: Now were your parents encouraging at that, at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were. They were--yeah, yeah. But I think for my parents it really didn't matter what I wanted to do. When I shifted they had no problems with that. They've never challenged my sense of who I wanted to become, or what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 17313
Speaker 1: You were, what, fifteen at the time? So what were you like at that point, you know as a person?  What brought on-
Speaker 2: What was I like? I was very shy. I was very shy for most of my life. And probably still am, but I've learned how to compensate for that shyness. I remember being very excited about leaving. I really wanted to leave Birmingham. There were two possibilities; high school in New York through this program, sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee [Quakers], where I would live with a family, a white family in New York and attend a private school, which would be covered by the Friends. I basically had a full scholarship to that school, as well as my room and board. That was a possibility. The other possibility was going to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]. I had taken the examination for early admission to Fisk University and received an offer to attend Fisk before I graduated from high school. And I think I was leaning toward Fisk, and this had a great deal with my abiding desire to become a physician because I had worked it out that if I went to college at fifteen I would graduate by nineteen and then I would go to medical school and of course Fisk is right across from Meharry University [sic. Medical College, Nashville Tennessee.] So obviously I would go to Meharry, and I'd be done with my medical training at a time when some people were just starting. So I remember thinking very methodically that this would be the most efficient decision to make since I did want to be a doctor. However it was my father who helped me decide that that's not what I should do. My mother wanted me to go to Fisk because she did not want me to be so far away. She did not mind my leaving, but she wanted me to be within reach.  And New York was a great deal further from Birmingham than Nashville, Tennessee. My father, who actually spent some time at Fisk doing some graduate work there at some point or another, asked me to think about what the reality of attending Fisk might be and to imagine what it might mean to go to New York. And of course I, as a fifteen-year-old, I didn't belong in college at that time; I was socially immature. I probably would have been able to do the academic work, but it more than likely would have been a horrible experience, a horrible social experience. And I was not a person who was excited about sororities and clothes and all of that. Well the only reason I might not have been miserable would have been because of the Civil Rights Movement. And so as I thought back to that period and wondered what might have happened had I decided to go to Fisk as opposed to New York I've thought largely about a different kind of opportunity to participate in the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. And when I did end up going to New York, my father didn't make the decision but he asked me to think carefully about my own decision and he warned me about certain aspects of Fisk, and then I decided to go to New York, but I do remember feeling very alienated from the Civil Rights activism that seemed to erupt as soon as I left. And I imagine that had I gone to Fisk I would have had the opportunity to participate more closely and more actively, more directly in that movement.
Story_ID: 17314
Speaker 1: So do you think your father was some sort of a--? Your ability, was it the black society that he--beyond the black society, or was it was it that you were maybe too young? I'm just--
Speaker 2: I think it was because he thought I was too young. You know my father wasn't, neither my mother nor my father, were totally into that black bourgeois society stuff. And that is something that perhaps made them different from others. And I think a lot of that rubbed off on me, although they would never have described themselves in that way, it was just that it didn't really matter to them. My father, yeah my father was a member of a club, and my mother was a member of Jack and Jill and some other things, but you know most of her work was focused on the church. So I did not have this burning desire to be a debutant or to get  involved in that kind of social life. And I ended up seeing New York as a way of escaping from that as well.
Speaker 1: And so you were feeling pressures to be part of that, is what you're saying? When you say 'escape' not--
Speaker 2: --Yeah, I think I was. I think I was. I do think I was.
Story_ID: 17315
Speaker 1: Now your mother, when you say her activities were around the church, what were the things happening? Because I know she was involved with that NAAC-- and both your parents were involved with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 2: Also the Negro Youth Congress. My mother was/is a Congregationalist, which is now the United Church of Christ, after the merging of the Congregationalists and the Church of Christ.  So we grew up primarily in the Congregational Church, although my father, as I'd mentioned before, was an Episcopalian and he actually was a lay minister. So when the priest was not there to deliver the sermon on Sunday's, it would be father who would wear the, you know, the garb and do the rituals and do the service. So I sometimes went to church with him, although we were Christian in the Congregational Church. No, I take that back, I think at first I was Episcopalian. That gets a little bit fuzzy in my mind.  That's right. I was first christened as an Episcopalian, and I went to church with my father I think for a long time, but then eventually my father didn't go to church as regularly so my mother brought us into the Congregational Church. And she became active in that church, First Congregational Church, for all of her life. And as a matter of fact, recently I talked to someone who told me that her name is in the bulletin every Sunday still.  The Congregational Church and the United Church of Christ is one of the more progressive religious formations, so that when I was about twelve, I believe, and got involved with an interracial teen discussion group or young whatever you call it at that age twelve, thirteen, fourteen, this discussion group that took place at that church. The church was burned as a result. I mention this because that church was very much  involved in the civil rights efforts, then later of course the United Church of Christ has been one of the most active religious groups in all kinds of campaigns against racism; Reverend [Benjamin Franklin] Ben Chavis [former head of NAACP] for example was one of the key member--Charlie Cobb. So there's a spiritual connection, but also a political connection to that church, I believe.
Story_ID: 17316
Speaker 1: So now you're at fifteen and you are feeling, you know, quite sort of limited; you want to leave, and so your father has this discussion with you and what happens? Because at this point you are prepared to go to Fisk [ University, Nashville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: --So I just changed my mind, and we called the people in New York, the family with whom I would be staying, the [William Howard and Mary Jane] Melish family and told that I was coming to New York.
Speaker 1: Now this--
Speaker 2: So that meant buying some other things. I remember my father bought me this amazing coat. It was a leather coat that was lined in sheep's skin or something like. And my father was always very--we accused him of being miserly--but he was certainly very thrifty, very economical. And nobody could believe that he went out and bought me this coat that I think, at that time, cost over a hundred dollars, and I was a fifteen years-old.
Speaker 1: And I realized that that was his way of really demonstrating to me that he supported me and, you know, really wanted me to do well. I kept that coat, I think I wore that coat for, let's see that was 1959. I don't  think I got rid of that coat until the late '70s [1970's]. Yeah--
Story_ID: 17317
Speaker 1: So now, do you remember how you felt when you got to New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sort of strange. I had already visited the school. My parents had visited the family, so I knew what I was, well I thought I knew what kind of life I would be entering into. What kind of world I would be inhabiting for the next couple of years.  It was not easy. It was quite difficult as a black child from the South. I found myself in an almost entirely white atmosphere, living with a white family, going to a school where all of the teachers were white. All of the students, with the exception of a few, there were, well there two other black students in my class, which was disproportionate to other classes as well.  So it took a while to feel comfortable there. I must admit though the fact that I had been going to New York for many years meant that I had another set of friends there. I had a set of black friends there, the Burnhams; Harriet Jackson, Marylou (ph.) Patterson. As a matter of fact, during that time I attended the sixteenth birthday party of a group of girls who were around my age. They were a little bit older than I was, and that was Claudia Burnham, Margaret's sister; Marilou Patterson the daughter of Louise Patterson; Harriet Jackson , the daughter of Esther and James Jackson and then Phyllis Strong the daughter of Augusta Strong who was a well known activist figure at that time. And in 2003, they all turned sixty and held a second sweet sixteen party, which unfortunately I was unable to attend. But I do remember that I felt quite comfortable with that set of friends whom I had known from the time I was born. Bettina Aptheker, who is the daughter of Herbert Aptheker [professor/activist] and who is a colleague of mine at University of California at Santa Cruz now. I met Bettina when I was, say, six or seven, and during the time I was in high school I was very much involved in an organization that she lead, it was called Advance, a Socialist youth, Communist youth organization, however you want to describe it.  So I can remember being, you know, quite excited about that work and going to meetings in the basement of Bettina's home. It's really quite ironic that now we're colleagues, and you know, we like to think about these times. Just recently, in 2003, Herbert Aptheker died, and at the memorial I tried to evoke some of that history. But that was the other side. So while I had some difficulty in adjusting to this absolutely different social environment, and it wasn't only a question of the racial shifts but it was a question of adapting myself to a new approach to education. I had never heard of Sigmund Freud, allright?  And, you know, we're reading 'Interpretation of Dreams'. You know I had heard of Karl Marx, but I never considered that it might be possible in high school to seriously study Marx.  At that particular high school everyone who graduated was expected to have four years of French. That was a requirement; I had never had a foreign language. They didn't teach foreign languages in the high school I attended [in Birmingham, Alabama]. So I had a lot of catching up to do. I had to do three years of French in one year so that I could take the fourth year French class with my class, so there was a lot of catching up that I had to do, and it made me realize that what I had considered to be education wasn't necessarily education in the full sense.
Story_ID: 17318
Speaker 1: Did you feel any sense of insecurity about any of this at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I did.  I did. I did. And I worked really hard. I was living with these ideas of these ideological representations of black people, and of course in an all black environment that didn't matter so much, but in a white environment I became hyper-sensitive, hyper conscious of these ideological notions. And at the same time because we were just beginning to develop a civil rights vocabulary, a civil rights discourse, anti-racist vocabulary. There were things I was incapable of articulating that I could only feel, and I'd mentioned in my autobiography I believe that I felt a very profound sense of discomfort, unease at being treated as the representative black person from the south; being aware that the many invitations I received from some of the students, from their parents were not really directed at me as an individual, but were an attempt on their part to affirm their lack of racism. And although I couldn't say it at the time, I felt that  there's something really wrong about how I was being treated, about the wonderful ways I was being treated, right. It took a long time to understand that. But I certainly did grapple with that sense of not being able to say what was going on but nonetheless not accepting it, feeling very uncomfortable with it.
Story_ID: 17319
Speaker 1: Now the American Friends Service [Quakers] at the time what was their purpose, and what were they attempting to really sort of do with this program?
Speaker 2: Well the American Friends Service Committee, the Quakers, have a long history of doing--of engaging in radical progressive activities that sometimes have been at odds with the popular opinion or prevailing ideas. The Quakers were the group that challenged the kinds of punishments that predated the prison you know the torture, so you can say the Quakers saw the prison as this humane alternative to corporal and capital punishment. And then later they became involved in a prison abolitionist movement, so they've been I think in the vanguard of a whole number of political movements.  In this particular case, they had the idea that black children from the South ought to be able to, well the idea was an exchange program, so that it was predicated on black children from the south living with white families attending white schools in the North, and white children from the North living with black families attending black schools in the South. But that part of it never really got worked out. And of course there were enormous material obstacles because in many states it was illegal for black and white people to have any kind of social intercourse, other than economic, with each other. But it was a very productive program, I think. A number of students from Birmingham [Alabama] became involved, including other members of my family; my sister and my brother. And I have very fond memories of the times I spent with the Quakers, the meetings.  I've since done more research on the Quakers and have an appreciation for the fact that they were among the first group to allow women to speak on an equal basis with men, you know because there is no hierarchy and there is no authoritarian minister; everyone gets to participate on the basis of equality in the religious meetings.
Story_ID: 17320
Speaker 1: Now *(inaudible) the school that you went to, can you just give that name and talk a little about, you know, its program? You said it was more aggressive than what you had been used to, right?
Speaker 2: --Well, yeah, it was not your typical high school. The name of the school was and is, it continues to function in New York, is Elisabeth Irwin High School, associated with the Little Red School House.  The Little Red School House, originally founded by Elisabeth Irwin, was an experiment in public education during the depression, I believe. And because of the, I guess economic difficulties the New York City schools no longer wanted to support it and the teachers themselves decided to turn it into a cooperative.  Now around this time, which I believe is the McCarthy era increasing numbers of teachers were barred from the public school system and could not teach. So a number of teachers at this school were, elementary and high school, were teachers who had radical histories and they were not able to teach in the public system, so they literally bought the school and it became and remains a teacher-owned cooperative school. It's a very small school, one class per grade  from kindergarten up through the 12th grade. There were twenty- some odd students in my class and grade; interesting students. I should, [Robert] Bob DeNiro [actor],  for example went to that school and he was in my class for one year. Kathy Boudin, who is spending much of her life in prison as a result of involvement with one of the major encounters by the Weather People, you know. She was in my class. There are quite a few people who have emerged into some kind of prominence who went to that very small school. The history teacher was a Marxist, and I think I learned a great deal from the two years I spent there. But also it was just wonderful being in New York. The school was located in Greenwich Village.  This was the height of the beat era, so I had the opportunity to you know learn about new art movements, to hear jazz.  I can remember hearing Miles Davis at the Village Gate. Because I looked older I was allowed in; we didn't have these rigid rules about ID then. I don't even think I had an identification card.  So I loved Greenwich Village. I went to the Village Vanguard, the Village Gate. I developed a really strong interest in jazz, but jazz then was the popular music of the day.  I went to many poetry readings, the theater. Even though the theater was expensive then, it was still possible for a high school student to save money and go to the theater. So it was really wonderful living in New York.  I remember saying that that is the only place I would ever live in the United States of America.
Story_ID: 17321
Speaker 1: William Howard and Mary Jane are the names of the parents of the family with whom I spent two years during my time in New York.  Howard Melish--Reverend William Howard Melish, everyone called him Howard, was an Episcopalian minister who at one time had been secretary to the Dean of Canterbury, to the Dean of Canterbury called the Red Dean of Canterbury. Right?  (laughter) So he had acquired a reputation. Reverend Melish was involved in a number of movements, the Peace Movement, the movement around Soviet/American friendship.  As a matter of fact, I think he was one of the leaders of the Soviet/American Friendship Society. And it was because of that that his church was taken away from him. Apparently there was a major scandal that was widely reported by the media, and eventually he was barred from what was the largest Episcopalian Church in Brooklyn, and perhaps also in New York. It was Trinity Church located in Brooklyn Heights [New York]--an amazingly beautiful old structure.  So, by the time I went to New York to live with them he was without a church. Although he continued to do services on Sunday, they migrated from place to place, sometimes they were held--most of the time I believe they were held at Unitarian Church, the local Unitarian Church. And I went to church with them on Sundays. It was, again, rather interesting that I had an Episcopalian background from my father and ended up living in the home of this Episcopalian minister and his wife, who was quite a community activist. She ran a community center in Brooklyn Heights. One of the things I did during my two years in high school there was to volunteer at the community center, which allowed me to develop a different sense of what it meant to live in New York; what it meant to be a New Yorker. Most of the people who attended the community center were poor black people, Puerto Ricans. And it felt right to me to have that kind of connection, as well as to, you know, go to a school that cost an enormous amount of money, and although most of the students came from families, or many of the students came from families that were politically progressive, many of them were also quite wealthy because they had to be able to afford what was then was quite a large tuition fee.
Story_ID: 17322
Speaker 1: And they had three sons, right?  Yes, they had three sons.
Speaker 2: And there was no discussion in your family about a girl staying with a family that had three sons?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there wasn't. There really wasn't. No, there wasn't. Although one of them was not there; only Bill and Jeff were still there.
Speaker 2: Do you think now, do you have any Melishes of because you've never indicated anything like this, but were you a symbol more for them than you were a person? Or did you find, you know were they able to nurture you along, or was a lot of your experiences really more with the people you were active with in the school and your volunteer activities *(inaudible)?
Speaker 1: Well I think I was influenced politically by them. They were amazingly driven. They were involved in all kinds of political campaigns. They were connected with the Civil Rights Movement in the south. After Reverend Melish lost his church and no longer had a job, basically, he was hired by the Southern Christian Education Fund,  Southern Comforts Education Fund, rather SCEF, Southern Conference Education Fund. This was an organization that had developed in the south of largely white progressives who wanted to do something about changing the structure of racism in the south.  Carl Braden and Anne Braden [civil rights activists] were two of the leaders of that organization. And I got to meet Carl and Anne Braden through the Melishes.  Carl Braden is now dead, but I feel that he was a profound influence on my life. As a white working class, a white man who profoundly identified with the working class, living in a place like Louisville, Kentucky, who was willing to stand up for and stand with black people in the quest equality. He went to federal prison, because he was involved in an effort to desegregate a neighborhood in Louisville. And I can remember when he came through, he came to New York before he surrendered himself to federal authorities, and he spent some time at the house. And I can remember being very, very affected by that. So much so that later, when I myself, went to jail I could remember very vividly  that courage that Carl had in surrendering himself. And I'm still friends with Anne Braden. She still lives in Louisville, Kentucky. She still, you know, runs numerous organizations.  So, yeah, I think that period had a profound impact on the rest of my life. And just seeing both of them, sometimes to the detriment of their families, because they were always running, they were always running to this meeting or that meeting, or this rally or this fundraiser, or this or that, and I think that the younger son suffered for awhile. He's alright now. I'm in touch with him, he's fine now, but during the time he was young. I think he felt very much alone and abandoned; he felt that the cause was more important than his--than his life.
Story_ID: 17323
Speaker 1: Now you say that you, when upon reading the 'Communist Manifesto', which you read several times, that it struck a real cord with you. And I want you to talk about that.  I mean, what was it? Was it because you had such a questioning mind about what was right and wrong, and you know this was some how laid out an answer?
Speaker 2: Well if I remember correctly, when I first read it the image of workers that I had in my mind was the image of black people working  in the steel mills, working in the mines. I grew up in an industrial city, in a city that I later discovered was industrialized precisely by black labor in the aftermath of slavery.  I had no idea when I read the Communist Manifesto at that time that black men became absolutely wedded to the steel industry, and the mining industry, through the convict lease system.  As a matter of fact, the first black people to work in the mines, and work in the steel mills were convicts, who were then leased out to these industrial enterprises. There's a very interesting book by Mary Ellen Curtin on that. So I think that my initial instinctive response to the 'Communist Manifesto' was one that troubled--the idea that the working class is white. Later on, after I joined the Communist Party, the people would criticize me for being a member of a white organization.  And I never experienced the working class as white; I always thought of the working class, workers, as black, but multi-racial. And it helped me to think about what it might mean I think to build a movement that moves across all kinds of borders and boundaries, across racial boundaries, gender perhaps even, although I definitely had no vocabulary to talk about that at the time.  But it was one of those epiphanies, it was one of those very enlightening kind of moments, and I know that after I became so struck by the power of the 'Communist Manifesto' many of the students in my class used to, you know, call me a Red or a Communist, even though I had not, you know, joined the--well, I was member of a youth group--
Speaker 1: Advance. That was Advance.
Speaker 2: --Advance. Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: And so also part of that group, Marilou Patterson (ph.)--
Speaker 2: --all of you were part. But was that adult influence? That's why, I'm just trying to understand, this was all occurring within school, outside of school, teacher--
Speaker 1: No, this was outside of school
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know it was--but were any of the students from the school involved in the Advance group?
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of my friends--yes. And her name was Flo Mason, the girl who became my best friend in the school.
Story_ID: 17324
Speaker 1: But this is all really a part of the times. Now you were living in Greenwich [Village, a New York, New York neighborhood] at that time?
Speaker 2: No, actually--See this is rather interesting, I realize now that I was moving across all kinds of borders at that time. I was living with a white family in Bedford Sty [Stuyvesant, a New York neighborhood], so I was living in a black community with a white family, going to school every day in Greenwich Village. So, each day I--you know, moved from the black community to the world of the Beats, and then into this high school [Elizabeeth Irwin High School] that was very progressive in many respects. Then I would often times in the evening go to work in the community center where most of the people spoke Spanish, and as I said before, were extremely poor. So, I think I learned then how to live simultaneously in many different worlds without feeling out of place. I didn't decide that one world was the only world I wanted to inhabit. I mean, it wasn't that the world of the, you know, educated was well even, you know, living where I lived, I  lived in a relatively poor community, Bed Sty, Bedford Stuyvesant was not nearly as bad then as it is now today, because I was able at fifteen years old, sixteen years old, to you know walk the six blocks to the subway at midnight sometime without even considering the possibility that something might happen. It was a very different New York.
Story_ID: 17325
Speaker 1: Now that's just what I'm wondering, your parents you said there had been some you know, pretty, I don't know what you said, strong conversations. Because I was saying you were changing in, and I'm wondering, so what was the nature of the change they saw and how was it, you know what discussions were *(inaudible)?  Because your brother's in New York too, though.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true, that's true. But I think of the schools that my siblings attended, Elisabeth Irwin [High School, New York, New York] was the most iconoclastic school. It was the one that was less conventional and led me to question things that I would never have considered questioning before, lead me to question religion and religious beliefs. And that was the source of a great deal of conflict between me and my mother and father, although I didn't yet know how to talk about what it was that I was learning. And I came back from New York, I looked different even if it was only because I was wearing dirty white tennis shoes and, you know, white wool socks that all the kids in New York wore.  And you certainly had to make sure your shoes were dirty before you wore them the first time. So your new shoes you would rub on the sidewalk or rub in dirt. And when I went to Birmingham [Alabama] looking like that people thought I was actually out of my mind, they thought I was crazy. But they also, I learned from the rumors, had this strange idea that I, because I had gone to New York on a program organized by the Quakers, that I would have to wear these, you know, sort of old black Quaker costumes. And so there were some rumors that I had to, you know, try to address that were circulating in my hometown. I suppose they got the Quakers confused with the Pennsylvania Dutch or the other groups. So, yes, I can remember having major arguments, but of course that was the time when you're supposed to have arguments with your family; you're supposed to be able to rebel. And as difficult and painful as it was then, I still realized that my parents loved me. And my mother would never, there would be arguments, but she hardly ever raised her voice. And my father, once in a while he would raise his voice, so yeah, I, you know, grew up in a family where there was not a great deal of anger expressed. And there's a positive side to that and there's also the negative side to that as well. So whatever conflicts we had never reached the intensity of explosions, and you know I always knew that they loved me and that they would support me.
Story_ID: 17326
Speaker 1: So you did better by your senior year, you're in a path. You know you said in your growing fight because you said you were saying you had to catch up the first year--you even had three grades of French in one year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, I did that.
Speaker 1: That's pretty remarkable. And you said also that the world of humanities you know came sort of full blown, when you talk about that was it really sort of you know full blossoming of ideas and discussion of ideas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think I knew when I was attending high school in Birmingham really what it meant to engage in that kind of discourse. I don't think I was excited by history and by much of the literature. I can't even remember what we had to read, but I can remember in high school [Elizabeth Irwin High School, New York, New York] just finding a whole new world, and I got intensely interested in the Russian novelists. So I started reading all of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy and, you know, I can remember trying to keep all of the names in my mind, all of the nicknames and so forth. So I got very involved in. James Baldwin, I remember reading James Baldwin [novelist] for the very first time. So there were aspects about humanists learning that had never occurred to me when I was in Birmingham. And I think I wanted to go into the sciences in a sense by default, and later on I realized that there was much  that there was much that I had ignored. And living in New York I loved doing the things that I was not able to do in Birmingham. I loved going to museums. I went to the New York Museum of Modern Art; I'd go almost every weekend. I went to the theater; I saw films that I could never see in Birmingham [Alabama]. So that whole world that was barred to me in New York was, I think, affected me for the rest of my life.
Speaker 1: And you had more independence there than you would have had, you know, definitely in Birmingham, but I'm not even sure Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] would have been a more cloistered environment--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There were curfews at Fisk. I would definitely have been much more sequestered there. Yeah, I had an enormous amount of independence. I could choose basically when I came home, and so it meant that I had to develop a kind of discipline on my own. I had to not allow myself to go too far, but you know recognize that I could enjoy things that I never would have been able to appreciate in Birmingham. And that was another source of conflict with my mother. That's right. Because when in New York I could stay out as late as I wanted, where when I went to Birmingham I always a curfew. So there were these jarring conflicts that I could not work out with her and I was extremely angry with her for not understanding that I could take care of myself (laughter).
Story_ID: 17327
Speaker 1: And she didn't want you to go to New York in the first place in many ways--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --So this was, even though she had introduced you to it.
Speaker 2: But when it comes time for graduation what are you wanting to do or be at this point?
Speaker 1: You know, I'm not sure I had decided. I knew I did not want to follow the path I had persuaded myself I would follow from the time I was a child. I knew then that I was not going into the sciences, but I don't think I decided what I wanted to do. There came a time when I was much more interested in ideas than in the ultimate sort of practical functioning of those ideas. So for a long time, I suppose I knew deep down that I would probably end up teaching, but I didn't say that I wanted to be a teacher. I was basically interested in learning all I could about a whole range of subjects that fascinated me. And once I learned French, I became very obsessed with French literature and French philosophy, and ended up of course eventually studying in France.
Story_ID: 17328
Speaker 1: Who was your favorite French philosopher?
Speaker 2: Well I think that [Jean Paul] Sartre is the philosopher I read more. I read virtually everything that Sartre wrote, which was an enormous amount. But I also read and was interested and eventually the Phenomenologists  like [Maurice] Merleau-Ponty, for example, and then some of the people, the writers, who are characterized as philosophers, like [Albert] Camus, who is very interested in existentialism.
Story_ID: 17329
Speaker 1: Now this Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts], how did it come to the top of the list? You said you looked at, you know, several schools. But how did it emerge at the top?
Speaker 2: Well there are two reasons: one because Brandeis was an institution whose population was largely Jewish. Brandeis was founded in the same year as the state of Israel, in 1948.  It was one of the institutions that many of my classmates wanted to attend, given that Elisabeth Irwin [High School] and the Little Red School House [New York, New York] were predominately Jewish.  So not many of my classmates were able to get into Brandeis because there was such a huge number of Jewish students applying, and they had a kind of quota system they wanted to diversify, which meant that I benefited from the,you know what we might call affirmative action in those days. So I was not only one of the few who got into Brandeis, but I was offered a full scholarship. And I think that's what made me. I knew that I needed a scholarship.  And I think I was offered a scholarship at other places as well, but I liked the east coast and I really liked the Boston area. I had thought about a number of other schools in Boston, Mount Holyoke  [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts] for example, Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts], but I decided I wanted to go to a co-ed institution. So it was basically a process of determining that I did not want to go to a gender segregated school, I could not afford to go to a school that did not offer me a fellowship; I wanted to be near Boston [Massachusetts] and Brandeis was the perfect place.
Speaker 1: Now at the time that you come to the university, this is still a relatively new university?  But they recruited a lot of people there, right? The faculty was good?
Speaker 2: And what did you find, in your description it was you felt somewhat isolated there at the beginning. Am I right, or?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it was a much larger place than the high school I was accustomed to, it had perhaps the same racial proportion as my high school so there weren't very many black people there at all. Yeah, it was a question of getting used to it.
Speaker 2: It was not in a city. I had become thoroughly adapted to urban life, and not just urban life but New York urban life. You know, the noise, the crowds of people, and Brandeis was way out in the boondocks. The only thing close to Brandeis was a town called Waltham, Massachusetts, whose only claim to fame is [manufacturing] clocks, right? And at that time the turnpike, the Massachusetts turnpike, did not come out to Brandeis, so there was no way to get to Cambridge or Boston  except going through all of the small towns. Eventually I learned how to hitchhike to Cambridge and I spent a lot of time in Cambridge. I spent time there in the bookstores where I eventually made a world for myself there.
Story_ID: 17330
Speaker 1: Now had you decided, had you declared a major when you came in or not?  No?
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't. No, but pretty much I decided by my second year that I wanted to major in French. Maybe it was my first year, maybe it was my first year. Yeah. I think I'd become so accustomed to living with French because I had to spend so many extra hours, that it just felt normal for me to spend a great deal of time thinking in French, writing in French, reading in French. And I really loved that language.
Speaker 1: Now the black students on campus, how many people were?
Speaker 2: How many blacks?
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many black people, do you remember? Do you remember any of their names?
Speaker 2: There were just a few, very few. And if I thought, I could remember names, but there were very few.
Story_ID: 17331
Speaker 1: My name is Julieanna Richardson, and I'm the interviewer and Scott Sterns is the videographer.  And I'd like to have you start out by stating your name and spelling it for us.
Speaker 2: Angela Davis, A-N-G-E-L-A, D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date I think is April 3rd, 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we're at the HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: We're here at the HistoryMakers.
Story_ID: 17332
Speaker 1: Okay, when we last ended, we, you know, you were at Brandeis.  And one of the questions I'd like to ask you, because a lot has been written about, you know, that time and that experience, how, as it being a Jewish institution, was there anything that you were exposed to there that influenced you or required an adjustment on your part?
Speaker 2: I don't think it required an adjustment.  But I do know that I was very fortunate in being exposed to different cultures at a very early age.  Because I had gone to high school in New York with a large Jewish population in a small high school, the cultural shift at Brandeis wasn't so great.  But what , now as I look back, what I find interesting was that even as Brandeis was very closely associated with the State of Israel-- it was founded in 1948-- the year of the founding of, of Israel.  There were then a number of Jewish students who were pro-Palestinian.  And interestingly enough, it was at Brandeis that I first became exposed to the campaign to free the people of Palestine.
Speaker 1: And you also, but you talked also about, you know, experiencing-- at Brandeis, it was Viet Nam also that, you know, that there were things going on.  You had participated in the--
Speaker 2: The Cuban Missile Crisis.  Yes, yes, it was a-- it was quite an amazing four years, three years actually because I spent my junior year in Paris.  But I have memories of the Cuban Missile Crisis and people driving to Canada, thinking that was somehow going to escape conflagration, the presence of James Baldwin on the campus.  I think I may have talked about this last time, did I?  Malcolm X, it was at Brandeis that I had the opportunity to hear Malcolm X speak.
Story_ID: 17333
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that a little bit, his speech that day?
Speaker 2: Well, there were not very many black people on the campus at Brandeis, very few.  I knew, as a matter of fact, every single black person, undergraduates and graduate students.  And as I recall it, when Malcolm X [ civil rights activist] came to speak, it was really the first time I felt as a black person on that campus a sense of-of empowerment.  I, of course, during that period -- we're talking about the early '60's [1960s]-- the whole notion of 'Black Power' had not yet been formulated.  And it was quite stunning to hear someone who had a discourse that was totally different from the prevailing civil rights discourse.  I remember feeling extremely enlightened and awakened, I guess you would say.  That was probably an affirmative movement in my own experience.  And it led me to want to get involved in Boston.  I can remember doing work-- in black communities in Boston after that, yeah.
Story_ID: 17334
Speaker 1: Now, when you say there was a small black population, can you talk about because I just want people to understand the small size.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm talking about five-- I, yeah (laughter). Miniscule, all right, virtually invisible!  And the university at that time, it was still very new and it sort of being--
Speaker 1: How would you even describe the student body and even the teacher base?
Speaker 2: Well, quite a number of U.S. Jewish students, but a quite a few foreign students as well.  So I found my community among the foreign students.  My friends were from India, the Philippines, Greece, France, basically all over the world.  And, yeah, from the time I arrived in my first year, I became a kind of honorary member of the community of foreign students on the campus, Germany--.
Story_ID: 17335
Speaker 1: Now, was Birmingham seemingly far away to you then, you know, during this time because you had been away.  And you were up in school--
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.  I think that because I had the opportunity to travel at a very young age, and I've, you know, talked about living in Birmingham and traveling to New York-- it didn't feel as if I were, it didn't-- I didn't feel displaced in the way I might have.  It felt a bit strange moving from one community to another, but I, I didn't necessarily think-- that I had only one community.  I-- you know, people talk about multiple identities, multiple communities, and I think I experienced that very early on.  And that's one of the fortunate aspects of, you know, going away to school at a young age, and making that shift from a segregated society to a place like New York.
Story_ID: 17336
Speaker 1: Do you remember engaging in conversations with your parents much at the time, you know, about your thoughts and the things that you were thinking?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I did, but not really.  I do remember feeling a bit-- well, you know, feeling that I was having experiences that I didn't think my parents could understand.  I think I may have mentioned previously, that I had a major encounter with my mother over the issue of atheism.  And I learned that there were certain things that I, I could talk to my mother about and, you know, have a warm loving relationship.  And that were other things that would set her off, although my mother was never a person who was-- who was inclined to be become overly angry.  But I, I did learn that, that I had multiple communities (laughter).
Story_ID: 17337
Speaker 1: Now, in this community,  I know you talked about also feeling, you know, sort of, at the beginning when you got there, some sense of loneliness and that, you know, sort of, you know, having a fit.  And then you found this group of, you know, international students that you related to.  Um-hum, um-hum.  And then you went to the Conference in, is it Helsinki [Finland]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's right.  After my, after my first year, I decided I wanted to travel to Europe.  And as a matter of fact, I made that decision early on in my first year so that I had a plan to raise enough money to buy a boat ticket to Europe.  I worked I think in the library.  I also got a job in an ice cream shop in Waltham [Massachusetts].  And I dutifully put my pay in the bank every week.  And at the end of the year, I had enough money to buy a ticket on a freighter that left from New York and docked at Rotterdam [Netherlands].  So, yes, I decided I wanted to spend the summer in Europe.  My parents were quite opposed to that.  I was young, and, of course, I was eighteen years old, going off to Europe alone.  I didn't appreciate the gravity of that, of course.  And two months later at eighteen, I felt like I could conquer the world.  I could do anything.  So I did manage to make that trip, even though it created, you know, major problems in my relationship with my mother and father.  They did not want me to go.  Well, my father was, as usual, he was much more willing to be persuaded than my mother.  But, yeah, I, I traveled to the Netherlands.  I spent some time in France, went to London, and then I went to Helsinki and attended the Youth Festival there.  And afterwards, I had been seeing a German student, so I met him afterwards.  And I spent some time in, in Germany.
Story_ID: 17338
Speaker 1: Now, your interest in philosophy, had that started at that point?  Or was it with your time in Germany that you became, you know, or was he,was he--
Speaker 2: He wasn't a philosopher, no.  He was in--  and I think later he got his degree in Psychology or something like that.  But I was interested in French literature, and that actually emanated from my experience in high school.  And because I had spent some time in France during that summer after my first year, I decided that I wanted to major in French literature, and kind of threw myself into that for several years. And spent my junior year studying in Paris [France], studying at the Sorbonne [University of Paris-Sorbonne].  When I was in France studying, that was when I became much more interested in philosophy.  And it was through reading philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre.  I was reading his literature,  I was reading his novels, his plays and found my way to the philosophy through that.  So I began to read some of Sartre's philosophical essays and then eventually began to read works like 'Being and Nothingness', 'Lecture Lineal' [spoken in a French accent].  So by the time I returned from Paris to finish my studies at Brandeis, I was quite interested in, in philosophy.  And at the same time, serendipitously, I guess, you might say my first major encounter with Herbert Marcuse  [political theorist] happened.  He had been away during much of the time.  Well, he had been away during my sophomore year teaching in France.  And then I was away during my junior year, so my senior year was the first time I really had the opportunity to, to see him.  And it was Herbert Marcuse who encouraged me to continue my studies in philosophy even though I was basically just starting systematically.  And I spent the entire year doing intensive studies with him, reading the history of philosophy, taking his graduate courses, and it was after that, that I traveled to Frankfurt and studied with Marcuse's colleagues.
Story_ID: 17339
Speaker 1: Now, talk about that.  You had come back intending sort of and wanting to study with him.  And his class was full, right, as the story goes?  Was it full and then you audited it?  You-- I thought the story was that you went to him--or maybe it was that you went to him asking him if he would show you a (unclear) syllabus--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  I, and as I recall- of course, you know, we only remember things from we are at the moment.  But as I recall, I went to him to, to discuss what was a dilemma for me.  It was my last year,  I was graduating with a major in French literature, but I decided that I was really interested in philosophy.  So I wanted to sort of share that dilemma with him.  He agreed to mentor me to do a kind of tutorial, I guess you would say.  So I met with him weekly, throughout the first semester of my senior year.  And we started with the pre-Socratics and then, you know, read Plato and Aristotle and [David] Hume and [John] Locke and so forth.  So at the end of the first semester, he told me that he wanted me to take his graduate seminar on Kant, on Immanuel Kant, 'Critique of Pure Reason'.  So I then enrolled in his graduate seminar the second semester.  And that was how I got-- kind of got hooked on philosophy.
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts?  What was intriguing to you about one, the first, you know, the French philosophers and then just as, as philosophy as a discipline?  Why was that such an attraction to you?
Speaker 2: Because I think I was interested in the kinds of questions that could be raised within the framework of philosophy.  I really loved literature, and I still love literature.  And I had spent the first, I had spent two years entirely immersed in French literature.  When I studied in France, I took a course.  This was a program under the auspices of Hamilton College [in Clinton, NY?] where I was taking a sort of a over-arching course at the, you know, what was called 'Ecole de Préparation de Perfecionment de Professeur de Francais a L'Etranger'.  That's a long title (laughter).  And so I am, I was studying contemporary French literature, which means I had: a course in the novel, I had a course in the theater; I had a course in poetry, and I had a course in ideas.  And it was the ideas course that really seduced me.  And I still like to think about literature in terms of the philosophical questions that it can raise.  That's where I had been, been moving anyway in my relationship to literature.  So it was quite normal, quite natural I think that I would be interested in, in reading philosophy.
Story_ID: 17340
Speaker 1: But also brewing inside of you was a desire to sort of change the world as you were experiencing it, you know, which is sort of then direct, you know, philosophers think people who, you know, you think of French literature as things beautiful, you know, French language and literature as things beautiful.
Speaker 2: But then on the other hand, you had someone like [Jean Paul] Sartre who was very active in all kinds of radical campaigns.  I mean Sartre would even, in his old age, go out and, and sell newspapers on the street (laughter), might sell a radical newspaper on the street.  He was involved developing the campaign to save the life of Jean Genet, against the war in Algeria.  So I think my entrance in philos- into philosophy was a privileged one, in the sense that I was first exposed to philosophy by people who already, or who did see philosophy as related to efforts to change the world in a radical way.  And having already studied [Karl] Marx to a certain extent, having-- I'd-- oh yes, I did audit a course by [Herbert] Marcuse.  And it was-- that's right-- it was a Political Philosophy course that I audited.  You're right about that.  And to think about the ways in which philosophy can mutate or can be connected with the real world and what, you know, what Marcuse and [Theodor] Adorno and [Max] Horkeimer eventually came to, was a notion of critical theory.  So that philosophy would be brought into conversation with those disciplines and approaches and methodologies that could lead to some real change in the world.  You know, as [Karl] Marx, of course, philosophers have only, you know, thought about the world.  The point, however, is to change it.
Story_ID: 17341
Speaker 1: Now, [Herbert] Marcuse had you, in getting to know, had he ever talked about how he had gotten to the point where he had, you know, pursued a career or a life, you know, as a philosopher and a teacher?  Had he talked about that?  Who influenced him?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, he talked about that sometimes with his students, with his graduate students.  He worked with Martin Heidegger.  What's interesting about all of the, the three main figures in what's called the 'Frankfurt School of Critical Theory', is that there all had some connection with literature or aesthetics early on.  So that Marcuse was interested in the German--German novel, and Adorno was interested in music and aesthetics and [Max] Horkheimer was also interested in aesthetic theory, [Immanuel] Kant's 'Third Critique'.  So I realized later that I might have been drawn to them precisely because I did have this affinity for literature or aesthetics, but wanted to see it in the framework of making some real difference in the social world.
Story_ID: 17342
Speaker 1: And as you, it comes time for you to graduate. What are you thinking you want to do then at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: This is 1965?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, one of the, you know-- As I look at young people today and see this rush towards professionalization, I realize that many of us, at least my friends, didn't have firm plans for the future.  We weren't that concerned about what kind of job we would get.  And I look at my graduate students now and in their first year, they're already worried about publishing and, you know, what kind of job they're going to get, and often times subordinate their studies to this-- professional goal.  And I don't really remember thinking about what I was actually going to do with the learning I was accumulating.  There had been a point where I, when I was much younger, I wanted to be a doctor, but that changed when I went to high school.  And, you know, I thought that--that I would use that learning in some productive way.  I imagine I thought, well, you know, maybe I will teach at a university, but I--I didn't have plans to find a job teaching (laughter) at a university.
Speaker 1: But you had been exposed to a very rich learning environment, that's for sure.  I mean and, you know, not only in your exposure there, but your junior year abroad, you know, or in the fact even your exposure to the people at the 'Frankfurt School' [of Critical Theory].
Speaker 2: (agreeing)
Speaker 1: So you left.  Do you remember graduation day at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because my parents were there-- yeah, yeah,  I do.  I can kind of visualize the stage and the people in the audience and some of the, you know-- some of my classmates, whom I run into for- from time to time.  But it was just a graduation (laughter).  That's all.  It wasn't anything that special.  I, you know, tend to shy away from rituals, I guess you might say.  And it was probably for my mother and father that, that I actually did that.
Speaker 1: But you had done very well there too, academically.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I did okay.  I did okay, yeah.  I spent a lot of time studying.  I haunted the library , and that's basically what I, what I remembered at Brandeis, the library (laughter).
Speaker 1: And the library at that time, was it?--  'Cause there was, you know, there was a whole move of the Brandeis Women's Movement to equip the library with books.  They'd have these, you know, sales around the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: It's changed now.  If you go back there, it's a beautiful place.  Oh, yeah, yeah, it's not the same.  Yeah, it is, but I- what I liked about it then was that it was small.  You could really negotiate your way across the campus.  Yeah, and it was actually quite beautiful then.  There was a huge castle, which is still there, which is a dormitory for- it used to be a dormitory for advanced students.
Story_ID: 17343
Speaker 1: Was there anything else you would say just about the Brandeis experience that, you know, influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well --  anything odd about those years?
Speaker 1: Well, I suppose I would characterize my experience at Brandeis as giving me a cosmopolitan view.  I learned how to feel a part of the world. And I think that's important.  I was giving a talk recently in which I pointed out that in this country we are not encouraged to feel ourselves a part of global communities.  We are encouraged to think of ourselves only as a nation and as the superior nation.  So my experience at Brandeis was one that encouraged me to open up and look outwards and to imagine myself as a part of a much, much larger community.  And interestingly, later when I was studying in Frankfurt [Germany]--  I spent two years there after I graduated from Brandeis-- I had, I think this was at the spring of the first year I was there, I felt the need to get away.  I wanted to just go some place where I didn't know anyone at all.  And a friend was visiting and we decided that we would hitchhike to Greece.  And, of course, in those days, it was possible for two very young women to hitchhike to Athens from Frankfurt, Germany.  It was, you know, quite an amazing trip, but we made it there.  And I had wanted to basically go somewhere where I knew no one at all. And I think on the first night we were there I started running into people I knew (laughter) in the street, ex-students from Brandeis, a couple of Greek students whom I had known there.  So that-- I guess you might say, I learned how to feel at home in all kinds of communities and all kinds of cultures.
Story_ID: 17344
Speaker 1: -- And just ask you about, you know,what you talked about, just the bombing of the, you know, the bombing of the four girls-- of the church, sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay- that's right that was-
Speaker 1: Becasue that was your (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That was my junior year abroad. Did I talk about that before?
Speaker 1: You just said that you were , you know, that you were-- you didn't talk about it in your previous interview but you were just saying today that you were, that you went to France in  your junior year abroad.
Speaker 2: So is it rolling now, or is it--
Speaker 1: Yeah-
Speaker 2: Well, I was in Paris, 1963, October, 1963, well two major things happened there.  First, [President John] Kennedy was assassinated while I was there and then the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church happened [September 15, 1963].  And, of course, during those days, it was, communications were not facilitated in, you know, by all of the technology that we have today.  So I do remember that being one of the rare occasions that I actually made a long distance phone call home because it was too expensive to call to the United States, you know, when I heard that the church was bombed.  And my memories are still kind of fuzzy because I was, at that time I really felt alienated and isolated, and I, I felt that, that most people had no idea about the gravity of this event.  And I probably would have felt like that even if I did not know or even if I had not had a connection with the girls who were killed.  But, of course, one of the girls was the sister of one of my very close friends.  She was just a little bit younger, but, of course, a couple of years in age meant a lot during those times when you're thirteen and, and the younger sister is ten.  Carole Robertson was a good friend of my younger sister.  And, as a matter of fact, when the bombing happened, Carole's mother, Alpha Robertson, called my mother and asked her to drive her to pick up Carole.  So my mother was right there immediately after the, the bombing.  And she, but my mother was always pretty, pretty strong.  I never got the sense that she broke down as a result of it.  She was always the kind of person who helped others and who always felt the need to be strong to support others.  So I did talk to her about it, but not so much about the details.  One of the other girls was Cynthia Wesley, who lived a couple of doors away from us.  And she had been adopted by a couple who'd lived in our neighborhood, I guess almost as long as we lived there.  And I had remembered when she was a very young girl. Basically, we grew up together.  Yeah, and so it was, it was, you know, it was devastating, absolutely devastating.  But I didn't feel, this is one-the one moment I think when I was in France that I felt like I couldn't be there, that I did need to be there--  yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, your mother never, I mean, when she went with Mrs. Robertson, wasn't it the case that parts of Carole were strewn on the lawn, body parts? No?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think that's something that I kind of visualized because I later asked my mother.  And she said, my mother and I did an interview with someone, I can't remember who, a number of years later.  And she described it in more detail, but I think that in my anguish and I probably misheard her on this long distance call describing exactly what was going on.  And I kind of created this scene in my own mind to help me feel that I understood what happened there.  But then I don't know, and then it may, it may be true that there were, I-I mean I think the body parts were probably in the basement because that's where the bomb was set. And that's where the girls were--the girls were killed.  And I know later I discovered that my mother actually went with, Carole's mother [Alpha Robertson] to the hospital because they had taken her to the hospital.  And now, what happened and what month was that, what month was the bombing was in--  That was in October, I think, wasn't it?  October.
Speaker 1: So you were--
Speaker 2: Or September? [September 15, 1963]
Story_ID: 17345
Speaker 1: But you stayed in France to-- was it a semester?  Were you there a year?
Speaker 2: (agreeing)
Speaker 1: So you stayed the whole year and to come, and came back.  And then did your senior-
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went the previous summer and stayed from, I think, about the middle of the summer until the-- middle of the next summer.  And when you came back, did you go directly back to school or did you go home to Birmingham [Alabama] for a little bit?
Speaker 1: I think I went home for a little while, yeah.
Speaker 2: And was the community, had it changed at all?  Or was there was a lot of, you know-- because Birmingham, you know, when you originally left, not to say-- I know you lived on "Dynamite Hill" [Fountain Heights section, where black families were moving into a predominately white neighborhood. Bombings were so commonplace that the neighborhood became known as "Dynamite Hill."]  and I know there were, you know, there were things happening. But the community had increasingly gotten more active, hadn't it during that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.  That's true, yes.  Well, this was, this was the period during which the Civil Rights Movement really developed.  Shuttlesworth, for example, Reverend [Fred] Shuttlesworth was one of the most active figures in Birmingham [Alabama] .  And, and it's interesting that you ask that question because I would probably have to sit down and think very hard.  A lot of the summers kind merge in my memory.  I can remember very clearly the summer after I graduated from Brandeis.  I don't know how, and perhaps I didn't spend very much time there.  I have-- I have the recollection that I spent most of the summer in Europe, came back, got my things together and showed up at Brandeis  [University] a couple of weeks later.
Story_ID: 17346
Speaker 1: Now, the summer after you graduated, why do you remember that summer clearly?
Speaker 2: Because I spent-- more time there.  I spent the entire summer there, yeah.  And that was the summer before I was to move to Germany.  And I do, I do remember hearing Martin Luther King speak that, that summer.  Was that the first time you heard him speak?
Speaker 1: You know, I don't think it was the first time.  Okay.  But I remember that this was a--  I think this was the time I heard him speak about the war in Viet Nam.  This would have been 1965 [August 12, 1965], and, of course, before any prominent public figure spoke out against the war.  And Dr. King was the first to go on record opposing the war.  And I do remember going with my mother to hear him speak at the hall, in the A. G. Gaston Auditorium, downtown Birmingham [Alabama], and feeling very enlightened because I do think I began to think about the reach of the Civil Rights Movement, the connections, the relationship between the various struggles of oppressed people in other parts of the world.  And, or maybe it sort of consolidated, it confirmed my sense that the most important thing is to be able to make those connections.  And I kind of see myself as having been engaged in that project of discovering links and connections between and among events, ideas that seem totally unrelated.  And so that day, I can remember that many people were quite, quite upset.  You know, what does this have to do with the Civil Rights Movement?  What does Viet Nam have to do with, you know, black people gaining equality in, in this country? So, but I was very satisfied.  Some people were dissatisfied.  I remember feeling, you know, very fulfilled by that talk.
Speaker 2: Right, because the black community didn't understand, and they didn't- and he was coming under criticism for his stance on Viet Nam, you know--.
Speaker 1: (agreeing).
Speaker 2: Or maybe why add this on top of other things or it's not directed, you know, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] is not, you know, it's not--
Speaker 1: But he knew that.  He knew that it was going to be controversial.  But, of course, any idea is controversial if it's not already part of the prevailing common sense.  So--
Story_ID: 17347
Speaker 1: Anything else about that summer?
Speaker 2: Well, I-- a friend of mine from, one of the foreign students from Brandeis [University], who was British, came and stayed at my house while he was teaching at Miles College, which is a black college there.  And that was interesting because, of course, at that time things were beginning to loosen up.  But it's 1965.  The laws governing segregation had, were not so tightly enforced.  Many of them had been taken off the books.  So, so that, and it was okay for a white person to be staying in a black family's home.  But that was very interesting because, of course, you know, he had this very heavy, heavy British accent and he was moving around only in black communities.  I didn't know any white people to introduce him to in, in Birmingham (laughter),so- I can remember one really funny moment, which I may have also described in my auto- autobiography where he wanted to, he was interested in black churches, of course.  And there was a Sanctified Church in our neighborhood.  I had never been in that Sanctified Church.  I'd heard the music and-- the shouting, but I had never actually been inside the church.  So I, he persuaded me to accompany him to the church service there.  Of course, at that time, I, I didn't know that much about, you know, anthropology and what it means for (laughter) a white person to be at--  But anyway, we went along with it.  And he was asked to introduce himself and people, I guess, appreciated the fact that he wanted to participate in their service.  And I can remember him talking in this heavy British accent, and people, you know, people in, in the church saying, "Amen" (laughter).  That was funny, yeah.
Speaker 1: So your--  it was okay with your parents that he stayed there, obviously.
Speaker 2: My parents, yeah.  My parents were fine about that.  I had quite a number of friends that--  I think the next summer there was a German friend who stayed there.  And I kind of remember him because his name was Gerhardt, and then later my brother named his dog Gerhardt (laughter) after him.  So yeah, he had a kind of legacy in the family.  Yeah, but my family was always very open to other people and other cultures and other ideas.  I guess that's one of the reasons I turned out the way I did.
Story_ID: 17348
Speaker 1: Now, so--so in going off you were planning to go study to get your Ph.D., right? When you went off, or your Masters?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I was actually planning to stay in Germany for--
Speaker 1: Oh, you were planning to, okay.
Speaker 2: You, you're talking about, okay,  we finished-
Speaker 1: I'm talking about you finished Brandeis and you went, didn't you go and study there for two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to Ger--  I went to Frankfurt [Germany].
Speaker 1: Germany, okay. But wasn't that a whole plan to get your you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, and I was enrolled in that program.  It's very different from here, though, very different in the sense that--
Speaker 1: A little looser, no?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not as, not as--
Speaker 1: Structured?
Speaker 2: Not as tightly structured-- huge lectures, 500 in the lectures, a few seminars.  And I had the occasion to meet with [Theodor] Adorno twice, which was unheard of.  So people did not necessarily meet with their advisors.  And, yeah, after two years I decided to return.  And that had to do with the fact that the Black Movement was developing, and I felt increasing isolated.  And while I was in Germany, I was involved in the campaign against the War in Viet Nam.  I was involved with the Socialist students who was an organization called SDS, but in German, that meant (speaking German) 'Sozialistische Deutsche Studentenverbund'- Socialist German Student Organization.  Yeah, I was, I was involved in a whole range of radical events, but felt that something major was happening in this country and wanted to be a part of it.  And then I wasn't as satisfied with the whole process of studying with [Theodor] Adorno as I thought I would, although, [Herbert] Marcuse had warned me at that time, Adorno was not interested in the connection between his ideas and radical, social movements.  So I really enjoyed studying and I enjoyed being a part of the social activism, the radical activism among students there, but I think I felt somewhat frustrated by the inability to bridge those two worlds.  And I saw Marcuse as someone who effectively bridged his scholarly life and his life as a public intellectual, I guess you might say.
Speaker 1: And you had had a true, had a true mentor relationship, mentee/mentor relationship with Marcuse.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.  That you didn't have with Adorno.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The-- everybody's relationship with Adorno was very, very formal, you know, typical German in that respect.  But I had developed a relationship with Marcuse that was also one of friendship.  So we corresponded and, and I got to know his, his wife and, as a matter of fact, last summer, I mean in the year 2003, this past summer, Marcuse's ashes were taken to Berlin and interred there.  And so his family asked me to come along.  It was an intimate family ceremony to participate in the interment of the ashes.
Speaker 2: Had that been his desire?
Speaker 1: Well, it had not necessarily been his desire because he had to flee Germany, being Jewish, and had he remained he probably would not have survived.  But since-- Well-- his son, Peter, decided that, you know, once the [Berlin] Wall came down, things were changing, that it made sense to think about interring his ashes in the same cemetery as Hegel was buried, [Bertolt] Brecht was buried.  So we went back to the seminary, cemetery.  The City of Berlin gave him an honorary grave.  It was actually quite a stunning ceremony with his, grandchildren and his great-grand children.  It was quite wonderful.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's wonderful.  When did he pass away, in what year?
Speaker 1: 1979 [July 29].  In 1979, okay.
Speaker 2: -- very early on.
Story_ID: 17349
Speaker 1: When you, you spoke of also meeting Stokely Carmichael around that time, when you were in Germany.  You were attending a conference.  I think you were with [Herbert] Marcuse.
Speaker 2: And--  Well, actually--
Speaker 1: Is that wrong or--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Okay, no. It's right and it's wrong (laughter).  The--  I decided to leave Germany and continue in California with Marcuse.  What, what I decided to do, on the way back to the U.S., was to attend a conference called, 'Dialects of Liberation' that was happening in London [England].  And Marcuse was speaking at that conference as well as Stokely Carmichael.  So that was when I first met Stokely and had the opportunity to spend a little time with him.  As a matter of fact, I got some names of people in the, in-- Southern California and the Bay Area as well.  So that, I think, that, that connection with Stokely, later, of course, Kwame Ture, was what opened-- began to open up the whole, you know, world of radical, black activism in the late 1960's in Southern California for me.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your impression of him at that time?  And how did that, you know, I want to sort of juxtapose that to hearing Malcolm X speak at, you had heard him speak at Brandeis?
Speaker 2: (pausing) Well, yeah, I guess it makes sense to think of the two of them together.  I don't know that I ever have.  Well-- I guess sto-- Malcolm's older, so there's a kind of connect, a kind of respect for him as an elder that wasn't there with Stokely.  And also, I had the opportunity to witness Stokely in social settings as well, because I hung out with black people who were at the conference, mostly black British people. And I kind of--  I was impressed with his ability to formulate the challenges and the demands of, you know, were considered new movements at that time.  But then on the hand, he was my peer, and so (chuckle), you know, I thought about him in that way I guess.  You know, it wasn't like the sort of admiration I had for Malcolm[ X].  But they were both dynamic speakers.  Oh, absolutely, absolutely, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 17350
Speaker 1: Now, so he referred you, you said that he had referred you to look up one person was, I think Tommy J., but you couldn't find that person.  But when you went to San Diego, is it San Diego-
Speaker 2: Well, it was like Tommy Jacquette-- [Executive Director of Watts Summer Festival and Wattstax Festival of 1972]
Speaker 1: Oh, Jacquette, okay.  Jacquette, I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, he's in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and I was going to be in San Diego.  Eventually, I did run into Tommy Jacquette, though a little later.  I settled down in San Diego [California], tried to find my way around organizations there.  Of course, I think as I write in my autobiography, people thought I was an agent because I was asking too many questions, and I can understand that now.  And eventually, I hooked up with people in Los Angeles, the Black Panther Political Party, not the Black Panther Party for Self Defense, which happened later, Black Panther Political Party, and ran into Tommy.
Story_ID: 17351
Speaker 1: Now, tell me how had [Herbert] Marcuse, how had he, he had been forced out of Brandeis, right?  Is that what happened?  And why had he been forced out and how did he end up going to San Diego?
Speaker 2: That's--  Well, he was in a lot of ways a victim of conservative academia.  There were people who did not want him teaching there.  However, he was not fired for his ideas and for what he taught.  A statute was placed on the books in- at Brandeis [University] compelling faculty to retire at a certain age.  So that was what forced him out.  And then, of course, I imagine he got offers all over the country because he was a very well known-- philosopher and academic.  And UC San Diego [University of California, San Diego] offered him a position, and he decided to take it.
Story_ID: 17352
Speaker 1: But this, when you went to the university, you were saying you were looking for color, and it was really hard, you know, you were talking about Brandeis, you had five students.  I don't think, was, I mean UC San Diego wasn't much different, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.  (Laughter)  Not at all. Although-- there was an active black community in San Diego [California].  And there were black staff.  And, of course, as a graduate student there, having been recently exposed to these new movements and new organizations, I thought we needed to organize a black student union.  There weren't that many black people, but we eventually got everyone--staff, faculty--involved.  It was a hard process, but I can remember going to one person, and then there were three of us, and then there were four (laughter) and then there was five annd then a faculty, a young faculty member from Jamaica who got involved. So eventually, we were able to build a solid organization and what was interesting about that period was that we absolutely understood the need for building coalitions and alliances and solidarities.  So we were not held captive by the kind of known nationalism that quite a number of other black organizations were at the time.  We had ties with the Chicano Student Organization.  It was MAYA, Mexican American Youth Alliance.  We had ties with the sort of white radical student organization, and all of our projects involved, you know, working together.  So that was, yeah, that was, that was a good experience.  It kind of prefigured what people would be forced to think about.  But we did because of necessity and it, you know, it seemed that that was the way things needed to be done.  There was no question about.
Speaker 1: Now, what in that whole process, because, as you say, a lot had to with where you were located, you know, that you, you had to be able to work that way.  But was that your, you know, I'm just thinking, was that your first encounter with the Chicano-Latino community in a way like that?  You know, in that way, and their issues or, because I don't think anything, you know--  Brandeis was a different, you know, sort of-- type of community, but I'm wondering cause this was, you know, more heavily Hispanic than you had been--
Speaker 2: I mean that's true, that's true, because, yeah. I had, I was familiar with Puerto Rican issues to a much greater extent, having been on the East Coast.  And I knew about some of the struggles, already the political prisoners, Louie Telidon, for example.  But I didn't know a great deal about the Chicano, the emergent Chicano movement.  But as soon as I got involved with, as soon as I got involved on the west coast, it was like immediate.  It was a given.  You had to develop some fluency and some familiarity with and among those organizations and ideas.
Story_ID: 17353
Speaker 1: And who are the blacks that you were involved with or that you met?  Who was that sort of core group of people, you know, in--
Speaker 2: Some undergraduates, a couple of professors.  And yeah, and I can, I can visualize almost all of them.  But we, we got involved with community campaigns as well so that early on. There was a black man in the Navy. San Diego, of course, is a huge Navy site. A black man who was being court martialed because he had criticized the President.  So we got involved in that campaign immediately.  We got involved in some campaigns, organized by the-- was it called the 'Black Congress' in San Diego?
Speaker 1: And that prison thing (unclear), was that Len White?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Len. Len and we--  I'm actually still in touch with him.
Story_ID: 17354
Speaker 1: So you got involved.  You were getting involved also in the, now you said, you know, through Stokely [Carmichael] [black militant organizer], you became aware of the Black Panther Party- Black Panther Political Party, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, it wasn't Stokely who--
Speaker 1: Oh, wait--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know, maybe I did write that.
Speaker 1: No, but you said it.  Okay, well, wait.  Okay.  But when you came-- let's just put it this way, okay.  When you first got involved in the Black Power, you were interested in the Black Power Movement and what was sort of emerging, right?
Speaker 2: And--  See, I got-- I actually made my way around a number of local organizations in San Diego [California].  And as a result of that, I traveled to Los Angeles [California], which wasn't that far, an hour and a half, two hours away, and attended some conferences and met people and got invited to be a part of this organization called the Black Panther Political Party, which was very different from the Black Panther Party for Self Defense.  As a matter of fact, it was an organization that specifically focused on political or electoral issues, yeah.
Story_ID: 17355
Speaker 1: And during that time when you got very involved in the--  Now, did you actually, you moved to Los Angeles [California], right?
Speaker 2: Eventually, yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you talk about that being a whole new world sort of opening up, you know, out of San Diego, you know, that it was more vibrant, more black people, you know.  And you start doing a lot of organizing, but I think a lot of times people, you know, the perspective of the black Panther Party, a lot of people, you know, just think the symbols that existed and not, you know, the organizing, that they were very involved in, you know, in the community and soup kitchens and things like that.  And that's what that group was, you were doing there, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we were doing, we were involved in so many community efforts.  And as a matter of fact, this Black Panther Political Party eventually mutated into SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], the Los Angeles Chapter of SNCC, which was in coalition with, which had established alliance, an alliance at a national level with the Black Panther Party.  So yeah, we did a lot of community organizing.  We raised money for [H.] Rap Brown's [Black Panther member] bail, going door-to-door, persuading people to contribute money.  And I think we raised, across the country, like a hundred thousand dollars for his bail with these little cans, asking people to, you know, donate money.  And we got very much involved during, well, when [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated in April of 1968 [April 4].  And that was important because, as you know, cities were erupting all over the country at having heard the news that [Martin Luther] King had been assassinated.  There were uprisings and riots.  And that's what would have happened in Los Angeles.  But we knew that because the police were prepared for such an uprising, there would be a massacre.  So we took it upon ourselves to do the kind of organizing that would prevent this sort of spontaneous uprising.  We got people involved in, well, I think what we decided to do was that we wanted all of the stores in this mall in South Central, Los Angeles  [California] to close down in honor of, in deference to Dr. King.  And those that didn't, we picketed.  So we were getting people involved in those kinds of resistance activities so that there wouldn't be this disorganized, chaotic uprising that would give the police the opportunity to kill whomever they wanted to.  And I'll never forget after, after working all day long, we came back to the office, the SNCC office, and noticed that the police, well, the police drove up and dropped off this young, black man whom they had thoroughly beaten, who was, had blood all over his body, dropped him off right in front of our office as a provocation.  And then that same evening, we went in and made food for everyone.  There were lots of people, I don't know, fifty people or so who had been out doing the work.  And we had a big pot of spaghetti and there were tacks in the spaghetti, which we figured the police had done.  And so they were doing everything imaginable to make us sort of spontaneously provide the conditions for them to massacre us.  We saw that there was a machine gun or some kind of huge weapon mounted on top of a police station, and we knew that this is what they wanted.  And I think that, that that was a major accomplishment to, you know, not to keep the community quiet, but to do the kind organizing that would allow the black communities in Los Angeles to give expression to their grief and to their rage and to their desire for resistance.
Story_ID: 17356
Speaker 1: Now, when you talk about "we", can you talk about who the "we" was at that time?  You know, any of the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], you know, in the SNCC office.  It was you, in fact, I remember in the book you being criticized, you know, that there were a lot of women in involved.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.  Well, that's always the case (laughter).  You know, that's always the case.  If you look at who organized the Civil Rights Movement in the South, it was all women practically.  And, yeah, we had some controversies.  As a matter of fact, as I indicate in my autobiography, eventually SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], Los Angeles [California] SNCC, fell apart because of the gender battles and the battles over politics as well.  But the gender battle was very central.  As I say, it was a battle around gender.  It wasn't a battle between the genders (laughter) because there were some women who did not feel that women should do more than the housework, and the help work, and the support work, and the care work.  And there were men who felt that women should have an equal role in the leadership of the organization.  The encounter that was actually the catalyst for this battle happened when someone involved at the national level came out to visit the chapter and did not like the fact that there were women in leadership.  I was running the whole school.  There were, there was like Bobbie and Renee who played key roles.  Kendra Alexander played a key role. And they didn't like that,  somehow, they felt that it would-- was more important for the men to have the sort of leadership roles.  And, as I said in my autobiography, it was also about the role of Marxism and Communism.  So these two issues, unfortunately, eventually, destroyed the organization.
Story_ID: 17357
Speaker 1: Now, you say it was about Marxism and Communism.  It was that they did not necessarily mesh with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Commiittee] or, you know, at that point, right?  There was some criti--  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah-- Of course, things were going through a lot of changes.  There, there was the old guard in SNCC, that kind of straight, liberal, Civil Rights approach, and then there was the new guard, individuals who felt that we should challenge the economic basis for racism.  And there were those who felt that the most important role of SNCC should be to raise funds from white liberals to do the work the organization needed to do.  But then, of course, you had to tone down your rhetoric.  You couldn't, you know, you talk about Socialism and Communism.  So yeah, those were the, the problems.  And some of us were willing to- and, you know, we weren't totally uncompromising, but we were relatively uncompromising, I guess. Which is a good thing about youth.  And, unfortunately, this struggle led to the closing down of the office and people leaving and going elsewhere.  This is when I decided to become involved with the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 1: And why that decision?
Speaker 2: Why, because it was an organization that had a presence in the community.  It was what used to be called a 'militant organization.'  And I was also asked to help organize in the education project.  And I took that on as a challenge.
Story_ID: 17358
Speaker 1: And can you talk about your Education Project and what you were doing, you know, what your goals were with that?  Well, I had been in the liberate- what we called the Liberation School in SNCC and John Huggins--  You had actually headed that up, hadn't you?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah, I did.  And John Huggins, who was the husband of Erica Huggins, and was killed in 1969 on a campus at UCLA [University of California Los Angeles].  But John Huggins, who was one of the leaders of the Black Panther Party in Los Angeles, had asked me to help design an education, political education project.  And so I began to do that out of one of the Panther offices.  There were several in the city.  This one was one of the offices in South Central, near Arlington [Street?], I believe.  And we began by holding reading groups.  And that was an amazing experience for me.  Young people, older people who had not had the kind of education at the primary level or at the secondary level that allowed them to do any difficult reading at all, you know.  They took, they answered the challenge of, you know, trying to read something like, you know, something by [Vladimir] Lenin [leader of the Russian Revolution 1917], 'The State' ['State and Revolution'], 'Imperialism' ['Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism'].  And I can remember how it felt to be a part of this group of people who were struggling at every single level. Struggling on the level of vocabulary, struggling on the level of, of grammar, struggling on the level of ideas, but nevertheless, they stuck to it.  And I know that there were these moments, these epiphanies-- these moments of enlightenment.  And later, reading about some of the schools that were established in the aftermath of slavery, particularly the schools on the Sea Islands  [Georgia?], I connected with that because it must have been that, you know, same sense of excitement and joy and enlightenment.  So yeah, that was-- that's I think when I realized that I really did want to be a teacher (laughter). You know, what it meant to sort of help others find the kinds of questions they needed to pose in order to understand their lives.
Story_ID: 17359
Speaker 1: You know, I want to just take one moment and talk just--  Let's about who some of the players were in this, you know, in the L.A. group, the activist group.  You had, I mean the SNCC  [Student Noviolent Coordinating Committee]part was, that was James Foreman [civil rights activist], right?  Was he the sort of, I mean he had come in and helped you when you decided, okay, you were, not fight-.  Were you fighting with San Francisco [California]?  I mean, or was this confusion, and that's why--
Speaker 2: It was all of that.  It was a mess.  It was a big, big mess, and kind of ridiculous.  I was affiliated with this organization that was called the Black Panther Political Party, right?  Now, there was this other organization called the Black Panther Party for Self Defense that got started in Oakland [California] by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale.  And then there was another organization called the Black Panther Party at-- where was that?  I can't remember, one of the other, it was also in Northern California, I believe. At maybe San Francisco State [University, san Francisco, California].  Now, it made sense that there would be multiple Black Panther parties because the black panther was the symbol for the Lowndes County Freedom Democratic Party [Lowndes County Freedom Organization] in Alabama.  As a matter of fact, that was the icon at the voting booth.  So when you wanted to vote for the, for representatives from the Freedom Democratic Party, you would, you know, vote for the black panther, like other people voted for the elephant or the donkey, right?  So that got taken up by many people across the country, you know.  So it was-- it made sense that there would be multiple parties.  But then, of course, there was one party that decided they wanted to be "The" Black Panther Party.  And that's where the problems started (laughter).  So we were warned that we needed to change our name.  As a matter of fact, somebody said we need to change our name to the 'Pink Pussy Cats', or something like that (laughter).  People had guns drawn on them.  They were threatened, you know, change your name or we'll run you out of town (unclear).  So that was the kind of ridiculousness that James Foreman came in to help resolve.  And Foreman was quite amazing then.  He did strike an agreement that, first of all, where those of us who were members of the Black Panther Party, Black Panther Political Party, would become the key people in a new L.A. [ Los Angeles] chapter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.  And he was also negotiating an alliance between SNCC and the Black Panther Party at a national level so that, for example, Stokely [Carmichael] became the Minister of Information or something like that.  Huey [Newton] was, of course, the Minister of Defense.  So they were integrating the top leadership of SNCC into the top leadership of the Black Panther Party, and that never did quite really work, but that was the idea.  And yes, Foreman came in and brokered this compromise.
Story_ID: 17360
Speaker 1: Now, who was the Chicago [Illinois] group with, you know, Fred Hampton [Black Panther member] ?  Where did it fit in that, you know?  You know, cause H. Rap Brown, was out of New York [New York], right? and, but where did they fit?
Speaker 2: Well there were really Black Panther partys all over, (unclear) everywhere.  And that was what was so amazing.  And I think that as people think back on the history of that moment, much more important than what the Black Panther Party actually did.  There are, there are some wonderful things the Black Panther Party did, amazing accomplishments.  But then there were also some major mistakes, some real serious problems.  And then you have the very difficult history of Huey Newton. And so regardless of all of that, I think that what was so striking about this organization and those who founded it was that it had this appeal.  It was what was needed at that moment.  And within a relatively short period of time people, black people and people who weren't black, were drawn to this organization.  Like, you know, everywhere.  And of course, an organization can't really grow that rapidly.  It was inevitable that there would problems.  But there were chapters of the Black Panther Party in every single city, and in every major city, but also in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (laughter) and, you know, Birmingham, Alabama, every where.  And Chicago, of course, emerged as one of the key chapters and then with the killing of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.
Speaker 1: But let's give some, you know, context with this.  This was 1967--
Speaker 2: '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  '68 to--?
Speaker 1: It wasn't long.  It wasn't that long.  No, until say the mid-'70's [1970's], something like that.
Story_ID: 17361
Speaker 1: It was the youth, it was, it was young and brash and also, you know, perceived as dangerous.  But that, that's true, but that's not what the people, you know, there were some--
Speaker 2: Okay,  you had former gang members and you had those who joined the Black Panther Party because of the romanticism of being a revolutionary and being able to carry a gun, and so there was all of that.  But then, of course, all over the world, all over the Third World, people were fighting for their liberation.  So this romanticism of that helped to grow the Black Panther Party, had its roots in real revolutionary change that was happening in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia.  But a lot of people who were attracted to the Black Panther Party were people who seriously wanted to make changes and who found, who were beginning to see the Civil Rights approach, as important as it was, as a bit constricting.  You know, Malcolm [X] had said what's the point of integrating when you're integrating into a ship that's sinking. What about-- So people were thinking about the structural connection to racism.  This--I remember James Foreman gave a wonderful speech at a black youth conference that happened in Los Angeles-- and he argued that you can't just do a skin analysis.  You have to do a class analysis as well.  So people were attracted for all kinds of reasons and all kinds of people were attracted to the Black Panther Party.  And someone like Ron Dellums came out of that movement and would not have been elected to Congress had not it been for the base he created in Berkeley and Oakland around his defense of the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 1: But do you think, you know, was Huey Newton and their sort of predominance there, did that sort of cast a spell on the other things that were being done or not?  I mean I'm just--
Speaker 2: Well, Huey was in prison for most of the time, so it, you know, there were other people running the organization.  David Hilliard, for example, people like Elaine Brown later moved up to Northern California.  Now, Elaine was someone I met in the Black Youth, at the, at the Black Youth Conference.  And as a black, as a student at that time, she was active in the black student formations that we created in Southern California.  She was basically running the Black Panther Party, you know, for a while.  Yeah, it was a phenomenon.  And I think it accomplished amazing things during the particular period of time.  There were also some serious problems that emerged.  And I think that's how we look at it, we should look at it.  I remember Erica Huggins said at Huey Newton's funeral--Huey Newton, of course, was killed in Oakland in connection with some drug trafficking questions.  And, Erica made a really wonderful statement.  She said, of course, "Huey Newton had his demons, many people have their demons."  And she talked about the drug problem in the context of the extent to which black communities all over the country were being plagued by drugs.  But she said, you know, none of this should, none of this should be allowed to change history.  So that, you know, what he and Bobby Seale did when they founded the Black Panther Party stands on its own.  And I absolutely agree with that.  That they had this vision that was amazing and creative and responsive to the moment, and bold and courageous.  And it seems to me that that's what young people should always do (laughter). I mean, we need some of that today, not in the same way, of course.  It's really not about what you produce.  It's about learning how to, you know, listen to the-- popular imagination and fashioning something that's going to respond to that.  And about being committed to something outside of yourself, too for change.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 17362
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the problems you would say, you know, in looking at the Black Panther Party?  What were the problems?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a gangsterism.  As I said, a number of people had come out of the gang.  You know, there were these gangs in Southern California.  And you know, now we think about the Bloods and the Crips, but those gangs had long histories-- and the Slausons [also known as "Renegade Slausons" Los Angeles gang], whatever.  But many of the members, the new members of the Black Panther Party, came from that old gang structure.  And that was good because it meant that people who had been involved in fighting each other could be brought together to fight for a larger cause.  But, of course, they brought a lot of the gang culture with them into the organization.  And that was a major, major problem.  But then there was, there were also problems that were created by the police agents who would join the Black Panther Party.  And there were many of them, and probably some I still have not identified.  But during that period, there were FBI agents, local police agents, involved in the work of the Black Panther Party all over the country because they were determined to bring down this organization.
Story_ID: 17363
Speaker 1: How aware do you think you were at the time, you know, of the infiltration?  I know a lot is, you know, more is known about it now, and with the Freedom of Information Act, but how aware do you really think you were?
Speaker 2: Well, we were aware.  We knew.  But we didn't necessarily always know--
Speaker 1: Know who?
Speaker 2: Know how to identify the individual.  And I think, unfortunately, sometimes people who weren't agents were marked as agents and those who were were allowed to, you know, do their dirty work.  So, yeah, it's-- one of the things we did do is to try to and I think this was important--  I remember this happened when I was with SNCC [ Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  We were very aware of the extent to which any illegal activity could easily be the work of agents.  And therefore, in a public meeting if someone suggested any kind of, I guess you would, I suppose I could say violent, illegal activity--  I mean I can remember a case in which a young, black man was killed by a liquor store owner or by-  no, by a policeman. But it had something to do with, oh, I know--  it was a dispute in a liquor store.  And this person called the police.  So of course, you have a- you call a public meeting about this.  Someone says, you know, let's go get the sucker.  And you have to say that-- even though people can feel that, and you understand how people feel that-- you have to say that this is exactly the kind of thing that an agent would do.  So we want to build a movement, we want to organize.  We want to bring the community together, but we cannot render ourselves vulnerable to the agents.  So that's how we dealt with that.
Speaker 1: It's pretty sophisticated when you think about it.  I mean of the useful group and pretty sophisticated.
Speaker 2: (agreeing)
Speaker 1: But a lot under siege, that's why when you read, you know, your story, it just--The story and your story and the story of the times, it was a community and a people under siege.  Under siege, yeah, you're absolutely right.  And you know, I often say, you know, like when you interview some people that they--
Speaker 2: It was a very, you know, traumatic--  some people got hurt in the process.  And a lot of people died.  A lot of people died.  A lot of people were hurt emotionally, mentally, physically.  Yeah, yeah, you're absolutely right.  And those of us who survived are very fortunate because it was not a given that we would sur- survive.  And in good form.  I mean when you look at--
Speaker 1: You've survived in good form, you know, intact.  Let me--
Story_ID: 17364
Speaker 1: Okay, so yes, after SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was dismantled, after Los Angeles SNCC was dismantled, and I became involved in the activist work for the Black Panther Party, I had also joined the Communist Party.  That had to do with the fact there were several members of the Communist Party who were active in SNCC.  And I had become very close to them, the Alexanders-- Kendra and Franklin Alexander.  I had met Franklin's sister, Charlene Mitchell.  I was aware of the fact that there was a black collective in L.A.  [Los Angeles, California] that was a part of the Communist Party.  Now, I should explain that it was the case, and I imagine it still is the case, that when one joins the Communist Party, one joins a group, a club. They used to be called cells, right, but there is a formation at the base.  And so there are many clubs. The members of the club I joined decided to call it "Che-Lumumba" [after Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara and leader of the Belgian Congo independence movement, Patrice Lumumba].  And this was, I believe the only black- the all black formation.  It was an intentionally all-black formation, and there was some controversy within the Communist Party about the fact that there was this all-black club in Los Angeles.  But it was connected with the Southern California district of the Communist Party and through that, of course, with the national party.
Story_ID: 17365
Speaker 1: And so what-- did you feel that you had sort of found a home that you could sort of identify with?  I mean, with Che-Lumumba[ the black collective of the Los Angeles Communist Party], I'm talking about, mainly because, you know, you had been through, at that point, two other organizations, you know, one that had to sort of change, though it kept its form and then it sort of imploded.  But you were-- that part, what about the Communist Party?  Why did that have to be, that part have to be an integral part of your experience?
Speaker 2: I probably wouldn't have joined the Communist Party had not it been for the, the intense activism of people like Franklin Alexander, Kendra Alexander.  Not that I didn't consider myself a supporter of Marxism.  I did.  But as I've explained many times, I always thought about the Communist Party as being an organization of my parents' peers.  I always, you know, it was not quite radical enough for me.  I had been familiar with the Communist Party since the time I was a child, but I never identified with it because it was always much older people.  And I think it was because in Los Angeles [California] I was able to establish really close ties with people my age who had this amazing history of Civil Rights work and who were dedicated activists in the community in Southern California.  And I always needed--from the time I first became, began to think of myself as an activist--I needed to make connections.  I didn't like the idea of just focusing narrowly on one thing, one issue, one struggle.  And so it was, of course, it was about thinking of what we called black liberation, because that was the era in which everyone was active.  But I needed to think about it in connection with larger issues.  So you know, what's the relationship to struggles going on all over the world?  This is why I had been so impressed by Dr. Martin Luther King.  You know, what is the relationship to working-class struggles within the United States and, you know, what is the interconnection between race and class?  And, of course, eventually gender was placed on the table.  At that time, we were just sort of groping toward an understanding of something that had not yet acquired its own vocabulary.  But in the Che-Lumumba Club I could talk about these issues.  We could talk about many different struggles.  Some people were involved in the Labor Movement.  Some people were involved in campaigns that drew church people.  So our weekly meetings basically involved discussions about what we were doing at the grassroots level and how we would sort of theorize this.  You know, what was going on in the country?  What was going on in the world?  That was very important, very helpful for me at that time.
Story_ID: 17366
Speaker 1: Now, you were teaching at this point too, right?  Were you teaching at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I eventually did.  Okay, okay. I--  You see I was fired before I taught my class because I had joined the Communist Party in '68 [1968].  I joined the Communist Party in the summer of '68 [1968].  I started to teach in the fall of '69 [1969] and had done a lot of things in connection with the Party.  I'd gone to Cuba, for example, during the summer prior to taking on that position at UCLA.  And while I was in Cuba, apparently, all hell broke loose.  An agent who was a member of the Communist Party, whom I'd never identified as an agent, you know, basically, wrote an article in the school newspaper saying that UCLA [University of California Los Angeles] has hired a member of the Communist Party.  And then I think it went on, "She is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy".  And I think I was the-- I was the only black person, and I think I was the only woman of maybe one or two women.  So it was obvious who they were talking about.
Speaker 1: Was that when you came back to Cuba?  You came to that, to the press on that or was it shortly thereafter?
Speaker 2: When I came back from?
Speaker 1: Cuba  Yes, that's what I'm saying, from Cuba?
Speaker 2: (agreeing)
Speaker 1: Because even in your whole description of the Cuba trip was sort of amazing, you know, the route and going there.  Yeah, I know, it's--
Speaker 2: As I think back on that entire period-- say the period from 1967, '68 [1968] until I was arrested in 1970, so we're talking about two and a half years or something like that--so much happened (laughter) during that period.  Sort of this-- I'm amazed now that so much was compressed into such a short period of time.  But so many things were happening on the global scale as well.
Story_ID: 17367
Speaker 1: And now when you, okay, so you got back, when you got back and then there's this, you know, because you're enjoying teaching, I take it.  Are you enjoying-- You were happy about your appointment?
Speaker 2: Well, I hadn't taught yet.  Oh, that's right, okay.
Speaker 1: I had taught at UC San Diego [University of California, San Diego] as a teaching assistant, right.  But I had never, I had never taught my own class like that.  And I was actually fired before I taught my first class, yeah.  So I hadn't had a chance to settle in.  I hadn't had a chance to find out what it would be like in a teaching, as an anonymous teacher.  And on the first lecture course I did, something like two thousand people showed up, which was like, you know, not something I was really expecting (laughter) or prepared for.
Speaker 2: But now, at that time, Ronald Reagan, he was Governor?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay--  And a member of the Board of Regents of the University of California.  And so, now how are you feeling though at this point when this, this whole thing happens?  I mean you felt betrayed-- did you feel a sense of betrayal because this person that you didn't, you know, sort of suspect?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.  But you know, he wasn't someone really important and who mattered that much to me.  I would say that I felt surprised.  I felt--  I didn't feel betrayed in that sense.  I guess I felt like I didn't want to be at the center of attention.  It didn't surprise me that something like that would happen because it was happening everywhere.  People were, you know, people were being killed.  People were being set up on all kinds of charges.  There were, you know, all of these, you know, political prisoners.  So it--  It didn't shock me.  I was just taken by surprise because I didn't necessarily want to be the person at the center of this.  I was, would have been more than willing to do all of the behind-the-scenes work, the background work which is how I saw myself because I had never been a person who had any aspirations for fame (laughter) or I've never wanted to become a public figure.  So that was my dilemma.  Now, how do I re-fashion my life--  After, after that.  Yeah, or so that I could do this.
Speaker 2: Or during that time-
Speaker 1: And that was difficult.  That was very difficult because I, you know, I've been a shy person, a person who does not necessarily, you know, want to be out front.  And I was forced to do that.  I had no choice.  But you were also an impassioned person in your shyness, is what I'm saying--  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Very committed, so that's a different, that's a different thing.  Absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 17368
Speaker 1: So talk about your involvement with the Soledad Brothers and how that came about.  And, you know, what sort of led to, yeah, it was really your work with, you know, prisoners, right?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, there was--  there were a number of cases emerging.  There was the case of Huey Newton, and I had been involved in a number of campaigns around Huey.  There was [H.] Rap Brown during that period.  And we were also doing work around Nelson Mandela and through the Communist Party, I was involved in a whole number of international campaigns.  So, yeah, I didn't have a sense of why it might be important to develop a movement around or against the institution of the prison, but I certainly felt a sense of solidarity with political prisoners who were incarcerated, regardless of what their trajectory toward their political imprisonment had been.  George Jackson, of course, had been arrested at the age of eighteen for, on a charge involving stealing some money from a gas station, right?  Not necessarily political, but he had developed alongside the Movement of the Free World and had been become a known revolutionary among prison populations in California.  I didn't know this,  I didn't know this.  I became familiar with him first by reading about the charges that were brought against him and John Cluchette and Fleeta Drumgo, the Soledad Brothers.  But I also became involved in the campaign to free them.  Now, I should say that while I was fighting for my right to teach at UCLA [University of California Los Angeles] -- I was teaching at UCLA, okay- I was fired.  I went to the courts and got an injunction preventing the Regents from implementing their decision to fire me.  So that meant that I was teaching during that year, 1969, 1970.  Because I had gotten involved in the campaigns around political prisoners, I felt it was important to link my own case to that, to the political repression that was happening within prisons.  And not a lot of people on the campus wanted to do that.  There were academics who, the professors and the graduate students and others, who were more than willing to support my right to freedom of speech, academic freedom, didn't want to think substantively about the connection that might exist between my losing my job and someone in prison getting set-up on very serious charges-- Bobby Seale, Erica Huggins.  You know, Bobby and Erica had been arrested in New Haven [Connecticut].  So that was my, that was really my project to make that connection and not to talk about my case without talking about the far more serious case of the Soledad Brothers.  That's how I sort of took on the project of being an advocate for the freedom of the Soledad Brothers.  [On January 16, 1970 at Soledad Prison in Salinas, California, in response to the death of three Black Muslims, a white guard --John Mills-- was killed; George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clutchette were accused of the murder. The three became known as the "Soledad Brothers."]
Speaker 1: All right.  And the whole--  I mean there were two perspectives: you and your work and the work of the people who worked with you, was to make that- to frame the issue as an issue of political prisoners; when others would have said they did wrong and broke the law.
Story_ID: 17369
Speaker 1: And so in many ways, you were positioning, you know, sort of re-positioning an issue or bringing it to light in some respects.
Speaker 2: Well, but you see in the particular case that led to the charging of George Jackson, John Clutchette, Fleeta Drumgo, who were already prisoners, right?  And then George had been in prison for ten years on a $70.00 robbery case.  And he had gotten an indeterminate sentence of from one year to life.  So the argument could easily be made that he was a political prisoner.  First of all, if he got a sentence from one year to life, why was he still in prison after ten years if he could have been released after one year on a-- you know, what was a relatively minor charge?  But then, of course, there was the case of--  There were the circumstances under which they were charged and it had to do with a political uprising within the prison, protesting the murdering of black prisoners on the yard by the institution's major marksman.  And a guard was killed in the riot that happened in response to a ruling by the court that this other guard had committed justifiable homicide.  So that meant that he was entirely absolved of what the prisoners thought was an intentional murder of black prisoners.  And so, as I understand it, all hell broke loose.  And this particular guard, this white guard wandered into that chaos and got thrown over the tier.  And, of course, what was sad was that this was one of the better guards, that the prisoners liked him.  He wasn't someone that anyone had any animosity toward.  So it seems that that was just a really bad situation.  Nobody knew who actually threw him; it was lots of people, a whole bunch of prisoners.  And no could identify who was, was actually responsible.  If they were gonna charge anyone, they should have charged everyone there.  Instead, they chose three prisoners who were known for their political activism, so that pointed to the political character of the charges against them, that by itself.
Speaker 1: Now, at the time that you first heard, well, this was pretty much in the news, the Soledad case.  (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was on the front page of LA Times.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Not in this, not--  The narrative wasn't the same, but the images were there.  And one of the things I remember then, which is perhaps important to remember for today, is that we really had to learn how to read the news.  We had to learn how to read images and reports in a different way.  You know, so it was about a different kind of literacy.  You read a story that's heavily biased against these three men.  They're represented as criminals.  They wore chains in the photograph.  They're--  so, and we learned to read it differently.  We learned to read exactly the opposite from that which was reported.  And I think now, when we tend to see, you know, the news and just accept it as face value, as facts, the kind of critical reading that normal, every-day people learned how to engage in back in those days was, when anything was reported, where any demonstration was reported, and it was probably going to be reported in a very negative way. Well, people learned how to feel community by reading these negative reports and transforming them in the course of the reading to, into something positive and exciting.
Story_ID: 17370
Speaker 1: Now, when you got involved in this case, it's not like you didn't have a lot on your plate already, right?
Speaker 2: (agreeing)
Speaker 1: Okay, but you met the family.  You met George Jackson's family.  There was a great sense of community and I just would like you to talk about that and why, you know, why this helps because you were balancing your teaching, right, along with other things that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: I was teaching.  I was still an active member of the Communist Party.  I was involved with the black students on the campus, the black student organization, the black faculty organization, the progressive faculty organization.  Yeah, I was doing a lot.  And was actually traveling, speaking in connection with the campaign to save my job.  So I began to receive invitations from various places around the country.  So yeah, I did have a lot on my plate.  At the same time, I was receiving enormous numbers of threats, written threats, telephone threats.  As a matter of fact, at one point the Chair of the Philosophy Department was attacked by someone looking for me.  You know, who is this Communist who teaches in the Philosophy Department?  And I had to arm myself.  I, it was then that I learned how to shoot,  I took lessons.  I had a security person with me at all times.  I had to have someone move into my apartment, which I didn't necessarily like 'cause I, you know, always been kind of a loner.  I had to have the campus police accompany me while I was on campus.  And whenever I traveled, I had security people. And so I had actually bought a couple of guns that were used by the people who did security for me.  And Jonathan Jackson, the younger brother of George, often did security, particularly when I was speaking about the Soledad Brothers, as I began to travel up and down the state attempting to broaden and expand the campaign to free the Soledad Brothers.  So yeah, it was in that context that I met the family, George's mother and his sisters.  You know, but also the woman who became his, who was his attorney, Faye Stender, people from Northern California.  And did you have any sense about Jonathan [Jackson] that he was, you know, that he would do what he ultimately ended up doing? [In August 1970,  Jonathan was killed in the Marin County (California) Courthouse in an attempt to rescue his brother, George.]  You know, he was impassioned about his brother.  Well yeah, and he was very intense, very--very intense.  But, no, I, I couldn't have predicted that.  You know, perhaps if I had been a little more attentive, I might have been able to suspect, but who knows?  Jonathan was very much a loner.  I knew that he identified with his brother George.  I knew that he did not have a lot of friends his age.  And of course now, now that we know what happened, we can develop an analysis that allows us to explain the fact that Jonathan was really willing to sacrifice his life in order to bring some attention to the plight of his brother.
Story_ID: 17371
Speaker 1: And you-- I remember in your book also, the whole story of the--  I don't know if, he was not the, the crazy guy that would, you know, he, he sort of liked you?  He would mumble things, you know, at the Communist.  He would talk about how he wanted to kill, you know, kill you?  Oh.
Speaker 2: Wasn't that around the same-- it was the same time around the--
Speaker 1: Oh--  And he talked to your sister and showed dra--writings that he had done?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes--yes.  Okay, but this was all, I mean you had these people coming around.  You had a lot of things happening in your space.
Speaker 1: That's what I meant when I said that that whole period seemed so compressed.  It was as if something major was happening every day.  And I know that later when I began to spend some time with Jonathan Jackson, Jr., because George's brother, Jonathan, died before his son was born, right.  And so I met him later.  And for the--  I remember spending several days telling him stories.  And then realizing that I only knew his father for, it was not even a year, not even one year.  And so I told Jonathan Jr., I said, "You know, this is funny 'cause I always imagined that it was for a long period of time that I knew your father.  But now I'm realizing that everything was happening so quickly and so intensely that it just seems like it was a long time.  But it was really just a few months."  So now, just talk about the case, how you found yourself in sort of, in the center.  The whole story, you know, has been documented of the day, you know, that he ended up killing the judge and several people.
Speaker 2: But he did not kill the judge.
Speaker 1: Okay, he did not kill, okay, sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that's an important distinction.  I'm not sure exactly what was planned.  But what I do know is that it was,and one can say whatever one wants to say about the tactics that he used to bring the judge and the jurors out and the sawed-off shotgun.  But the judge was actually killed by San Quentin [prison] guards.  We had, during my trial, the pathology reports.  And we were able to definitively prove that Jonathan [Jackson] had not made the first move.  That it was the guards who did all of the killing, who killed everyone who was killed.  Now unfortunately, the shotgun did go off, and the judge's head was literally blown off.  But this, we were able to determine, happened as a kind of reflex action after the judge had already been shot by the San Quentin guards.  But yeah, that was, a really horrible moment.  And when I learned about what had happened, although not all of the details.  I saw, you know, some of it on the news, I realized that they would probably be after me.
Story_ID: 17372
Speaker 1: Did you realize at that time that it was your gun?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay, you knew that, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I knew that Jonathan had them.  So.  And we were just so cautious.  Any opportunity that the police might have had to engage in any kind of police action against people, they took it.  So we knew, we knew.  I, I had no idea that I would be charged with murder and kidnapping.  But I felt that they would probably be looking for me, yeah.  And you went on the--  (off-camera talk)  Yeah, I do.
Speaker 1: (off camera talk)
Speaker 2: You went on--  Can you just talk about what happened at that moment that you knew that you were gonna be trouble, I mean that you suspected.
Speaker 1: Right well, I--  There were friends who sort of brainstormed with me on what to do.  And of course, I had learned that Jonathan was killed.  And that was a major blow.  So I was really emotionally distraught and probably not in any condition to make decisions about what I should be doing myself.  So there were some people who kind of brainstormed with me and I went to a safe place in Los Angeles [California], someone's house who was not connected with our movements, but who was a sympathizer-- an older couple, and actually another place first.  It was, you know, it happened so quickly.  And one of the things we talked about was, well you know, we had had recent experience with people turning themselves into the police and having been killed.  Like there was Bobby Hutton who raised his hands in surrender and was told to turn around and was shot in the back.  So the idea was that I probably needed to-to get away from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] And so I came to, I spent a few days in L.A.  I came--
Story_ID: 17373
Speaker 1: Okay, I just lost my train of thought.  We were talking about--To a safe-house in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: To a safe house, that's right.  That's where we were.  Oh yeah, and it was my first real introduction to Chicago during the time I was underground.  I had been to Chicago before and as a matter of fact, I had attended the conference in the spring of 1968 designed to organize the protests at the Democratic Convention that took place in the summer of '68 [1968] And of course, during that period, I didn't attend.  I didn't attend the Days of Rage, the protests and some of it.  I was here in the spring, but I didn't--I think my only trip to Chicago prior to that--So yeah, I learned, I learned Chicago underground, you might say.
Speaker 1: How long were you here?
Speaker 2: I was here--oh, well, see--again, it seems like it was such a long period of time, but it was probably just a week or ten days or a little bit more.  Then I traveled from, I think Chicago to Detroit [Michigan] to New York [New York] to Florida, back to New York where I was arrested in October, October 13th, 1970.
Story_ID: 17374
Speaker 1: Did you have any indication that you were gonna be arrested or were you surprised?  Wasn't there some story around that, right?  You were traveling, your traveling companion was--
Speaker 2: David Poindexter, yeah.  And, well, yeah, it was well, we knew that the FBI had a line on the fact that we were in Florida.  And David Poindexter's mother lived in Florida, and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] had already visited her.  So we knew that somehow they had--well, I shouldn't say somehow---apparently, they spent like a million dollars, which was a lot of money in those days, right?  So, yeah, so we were trying to figure out what to do in New York-- had to leave, had to leave Miami because it was getting too dangerous, but didn't really know what to do in New York. Trying to, to develop up a plan--  And, yeah, on that day we were staying at the Howard Johnson's Motel and returning I think from the movies or something like that.  I did actually quite mundane things (laughs) when I was underground.  It wasn't all like intense and there were some nice walks in the park.  There were some- the movie theater was the best place to go because it was dark and nobody recognized you, right? So a lot of movies.  And on that particular day, when we were returning back to the hotel, I got this sense immediately that, that it was gonna happen.  And why, why?  The people standing around.  I mean I was already hyper-vigilant everywhere I went. I was, you know, learned how to sort of be aware, hyper-aware of who was in the space I inhabited.  So I looked around the lobby, and I was convinced that--I didn't say anything to David [Poindexter]--but I, I saw the, you know, I saw these men who I was persuaded were FBI agents, got into the elevator.  As a matter of fact, I was surprised that I was not arrested in the lobby.  And then it was, sort of a sense of relief.  Oh these, you know, really aren't the FBI.  It's somebody else getting into the elevator, and some other men get on with us and as soon as we got off at our floor, they all, they came out of all of the rooms.  So they had choreographed how they wanted the arrest to go beforehand.  Yeah, yeah, it's strange that I, I knew that that was going to happen.  I didn't know how it was gonna happen, but I knew from the moment we walked into the lobby that I was gonna be arrested.  It was in a sense, a kind of relief, you know, although I obviously didn't like being arrested, but I could relax.  And I didn't have to have that stance hyper vigilance all the time.
Story_ID: 17375
Speaker 1: Did you-- when you first went on the, what they call 'on the lam', but when you were underground, did you have a sense of, I mean you talk about it almost as if it was normal.  I guess what I'm saying, you said it wasn't all just being in fear and running.  But obviously, you felt protected in some respects, that you had--
Speaker 2: Well, yes and no.  There wasn't any pre-planned network of safe houses and it was all very much improvised.
Speaker 1: But how did you know a safe house was really a safe house?  Well, we didn't.
Speaker 2: We didn't.  So--
Speaker 1: And then what about your family?
Speaker 2: I wasn't in touch with my family.  I couldn't be.  I couldn't be in touch with anyone.  And then I did meet two people I knew during the time I was underground, but only two people.  Otherwise, everyone I saw was-- they were people who had no idea who I was. Although obviously some did because someone gave the FBI information that led them to David Poindexter, which then led them to me.
Speaker 1: And was it specifically chosen that David would go with you?  I mean how did that even happen that he was your companion on the run--
Speaker 2: He was a friend of a friend.  I had never met him before.  He was a friend of a friend.  And he was willing, you know, not someone who was associated with the movements, but who was a sympathizer.  And he was quite courageous to do that.  He was quite amazing.  Now, that when I think about where we are today with,you know, this person who'd never met me before would be willing to take this risk and did end up getting arrested, spending time in jail.  He was acquitted.
Story_ID: 17376
Speaker 1: So, I'm just wondering, was there any thought of the future when you're underground like that, is it just a case of sort of survival.  I mean I know you talk about there was sort of a sense of relief that-
Speaker 2: You know I did normal things.  I read a lot.  I couldn't be in touch with people but I tried to stay in touch with what was happening in the world.  But it was actually quite boring I would say (laughs) You know?  Nothing special happening and that was the whole point, to be as invisible as possible, or to kind of become a part of the environment.
Speaker 1: But you knew that there would be an end at some point?
Speaker 2: Well, I hadn't really decided what I wanted to do.  I hadn't decided whether, I was sort of vacillating between leaving the country, which I could have done and staying in the country and turning myself in.  And the idea, initially, I--I did want to leave the country because I-- well, you know, that's what you do.  That's the only alternative, but thinking about it, I realized that I would never be able to come back again.  And even though I had learned how to live in other countries and other cultures and felt quite comfortable, I didn't know that I wanted to give up the possibility of ever returning to this country again.  I think of someone like Asata Shakur, who's in that predicament now.  She was not able to return to attend her mother's funeral.  She has a daughter and a granddaughter now.  They have visited her in Cuba, but she can't come back unless we manage to build the kind of movement that will facilitate that.  I didn't know whether I wanted to be in that situation.  So I was kind of waiting around to, you know, figure out when might be the moment to turn myself in.  And that would determine, that would be determined by the extent to which support was created.  You know, I felt that if a major, massive movement was created. And, of course, that ended up happening later, then that would be propitious moment.  That would be the time when I would feel protected by turning myself in.
Story_ID: 17377
Speaker 1: Now, so now you're arrested that day.  You're whirled off and, you know, they--a lot of FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], right?
Speaker 2: A lot, (laughs) I mean a lot.  I mean it was a long corridor, the Howard Johnson Hotel. And as I got off the elevator, the agents came out of all of the rooms on both sides.  And they grabbed me, put me into one room and they grabbed David [Poindexter], put him into a room across the hall.  And I never saw him again until his trial.
Speaker 1: So was there questioning at that point or were you just, you know, handcuffed--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they questioned me, but I learned not to talk to the FBI when I was a very small girl, when I was five years old, I think.  I learned that you don't talk to the FBI, so I didn't say anything to them.  They kept asking me questions, but I didn't say anything.
Speaker 1: And so you were taken, you talk about the--it wasn't a prison, the jail that you were in?
Speaker 2: (agreeing), Womens House of Detention.
Speaker 1: And that was pretty, you said that it was pretty--that it was sort of raunchy.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was, it was, yep, yep.  An old structure with lots of vermin, you know, mice, roaches, so forth.  But I think it was probably better than the one they replaced it with, which is currently on Riker's Island [New York].
Speaker 1: And then how long were you there before you were taken to (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there, I was arrested in October [October 13 1970], and I think extradited in November so I would say maybe about six weeks.  (cough) excuse me.
Speaker 1: Now, in that six--who, what was the first call that you made then, because you were entitled to call. Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, who did I call?  You know, I remember--who did I call?  I can remember being in this office with a telephone, but I don't think they--No, I wasn't allowed to call.
Speaker 1: You weren't allowed.
Speaker 2: There was, I was in an office and there was a telephone, but I wasn't, because I hadn't actually been officially arrested.  The FBI,  I think, I mean I--I have to check, but I don't remember actually talking to anyone there.  I was arrested by the FBI.  They took me to this office building.  I didn't understand what that was about.  As a matter of fact, it was a bit scary. (laughs) You know, cause I assumed whenever I got arrested, I would be booked into a jail.  But I later realized that they were waiting to call the press and so they were holding me there so that all the press could gather and get pictures as they took me to the jail.  So that was the reason for that.
Story_ID: 17378
Speaker 1: And immediately the momentum started building. One, they had captured, I mean they had you as one of the Ten Most Wanted in the United States. And then the momentum started building, and do you remember your contact with your family? It was when you went back to California, right?  Or was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  It was in that six weeks.  Yeah, no, no, my mother came up immediately.  Immediately.  Yeah, my whole family came up immediately.  I saw them, and then I saw them regularly in California.  But yeah, as a matter of fact, while I was in the jail in New York, I can remember that one of the guards told me that she attended an event in Harlem on my behalf where my mother spoke.  So she got to, which was great, because she got to talk to my mother and to tell her that she was watching out for me, that everything would be okay.  Yeah, my mother came almost immediately.
Speaker 1: And any sense of shame, you know, at that point in time, you know, just for a bit that or any sense of remorse?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: -- or fear?
Speaker 2: Fear, yeah, but no shame.  I mean what did I have to be ashamed of?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, this is what was happening during that period.  People were trying to fight for justice and against racism.  And some of us were called upon to be the targets of that system.  I saw myself, I didn't see my plight as an individual plight, I saw myself as one of the many people who, you know, unfortunately, had to experience that encounter with the criminal justice system.  And I, at that point, I didn't know.  I thought, you know, maybe I was gonna be imprisoned for the rest of my life.  I thought maybe I was going to the death chamber, maybe I would be executed.  But I wasn't, I wasn't that concerned about my fate as an individual. That didn't, I mean there was some fear, yeah, of course.  I mean you're scared when you see all of these armed men with guns around you and when the whole power of the state is poised against you. Of course, you're afraid.  But I didn't see it happening to me as an individual.  And that, there was a lot of solace in that-- because I could feel palpably the solidarity of everyone else.
Speaker 1: Around you.
Speaker 2: And the period-- and yes
Speaker 1: Just in the times, but okay-
Story_ID: 17379
Speaker 1: Just in the times, but okay.  Now, so in that period of time, who came to represent you immediately?  You were assigned a-  Who came to represent you in New York?
Speaker 2: Well, the person who first came was, and she was my friend, Margaret Burnham.  But, and then also another attorney who I had never met, but who worked with the Party, the Communist Party.  But Margaret Burnham was my childhood friend.  Margaret Burnham, I had known since I was maybe nine months old.  Our mothers were very close, and Dorothy Burnham who is Margaret Burnham [mother] is still, you know, she's in her nineties now.  She's still very active, and she still visits my mother.  So their friendship has spanned sixty, seventy  years.  Sixty, over sixty years, sixty-five years maybe, something like that.  So we were all born together.  You know, Margaret had been doing Civil Rights work in the South, in Mississippi.  She had recently returned to New York and immediately came down to the jail.  But they wouldn't allow her to see me because-
Speaker 1: (off camera discussion)
Speaker 2: So, yeah, Margaret Burnham came to see me.  And she--
Speaker 1: Scott, is the camera still running?
Speaker 2: We're rolling.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just got up and walked outside (laughter). So, yeah, she came to the jail, but they wouldn't let her see me because they thought she was lying about her status as an attorney.  They thought she looked too young to be-- and so she had to go back and get her bar card, evidence that she was an attorney.  And then she was able to get in to see me.  And she stayed with the case until the very end.  Yeah, that was, yeah, that was. I suppose it's the case that Margaret's presence was always a powerful anchor for me since we went all the way back.  She was my friend, but also she was an excellent attorney and helped to give me advice on the other attorneys as well.  But she was also an activist.  She understood the relationship between "the law" and building  movements and campaigns.
Story_ID: 17380
Speaker 1: Which is really sort of a unique combination.  How many legal teams would you say you had during that time?  You had was it maybe three different--
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe, but around specific-
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, I mean it wasn't that we went through teams and got rid of them (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, I'm not saying it was consistence, but do different people serve different roles?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's all I'm saying.
Speaker 1: But the National Conference of Black Lawyers [NCBL, founded in 1968 as a legal arm for the struggle for black liberation] helped to organize the legal team.  And so NCBL, National Conference of Black Lawyers, provided ways to do a bunch of things in Los-, in New York rather.  They were, I was being held in solitary confinement, so there were a whole set of cases, legal issues that were related to my being held in solitary confinement.  And then there was extradition, challenging extradition, right.  And then once we got out and once we got to California, there was change of venue.  There's all the--
Speaker 2: The bond.
Speaker 1: --work that got done around the, yeah, bails.
Speaker 2: Bails, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: All the work that got done around picking a jury.  See, there were, there must have been, I don't know-- a hundred lawyers, maybe more.  Law students, community people who were involved in the legal processes.  And we didn't have a lot of money so many of them basically worked for the minimum. Howard Moore, for example, who was a civil rights attorney in Atlanta, picked up his entire family and moved from Atlanta to Berkeley, just like that, just like that.  And he's still in Berkeley, by the way, still in the same house (laughter).  And then Margaret [Burnham] moved immediately too.  As a matter of fact, as soon as I was extradited she took the next plane out and came to California.  She stayed in Northern California until the acquittal.  So there were wonderful attorneys.  Doris Walker, who had had experience with Smith Act defendants, and she was quite amazing.  And then, of course, Leo Branton, who's a HistoryMaker as well and has already been interviewed-- did an amazing job of plotting out the strategy and creating the kind of drama in the courtroom that urged the jurors to think differently about the prosecutors' case.
Story_ID: 17381
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was interesting to hear you say that you had gotten mesmerized as well by his (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: By Leo?  Oh, yeah.  But you opened it up then.  What was the decision about you actually reading the opening statement?
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: I didn't see any discussion about that and I found that really pretty, you know, a sort of a approach.  I mean, when you look at cases-
Speaker 1: Well, there are a number of reasons why.  First, I had--Okay, I had been granted the right to serve as my own co-counsel.
Speaker 2: And why was that?  That was the other question I had.  Why was that strategy and why did you want it and how did that come about?
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to participate in my own defense.  I wanted to do more than be the person interrogated and cross examined.  I wanted to-- it was my life.  I felt I understood the politics of it better than anyone else so I needed to be a part of the team.  Now what made it problematic was that up until that time, defendants had the right to counsel or to act as their own counsel, to counsel or self-representation.  And what I was arguing was that I wanted to represent myself, but I also wanted to have the advantage of working with other professional lawyers 'cause I didn't have that training.  And I actually helped to write the brief for that and made the argument, and the judge granted me the right to serve as my own co-counsel.  So it was because I had already done that that I was able to participate in the trial as my own attorney.  So I conducted some of the voir dire, voir dired some of the jurors, prospective jurors.  And I decided that I would be the person, best person to present the opening statement.
Speaker 2: Was that--
Speaker 1: Because then, of course, the lawyers didn't have to fight among themselves (laughter) regarding who would get to do the opening statement.  But it also meant that if I did the opening statement and decided later not to testify, and it turned out that I didn't testify, that the jurors would have had an opportunity to hear from me.  I wouldn't have been sitting there as a mute figure on which they could project all kinds of ideas.  So I got to speak to the jury.  I got to make the arguments about what we were going to prove, what the evidence was going to prove, and then when the time came for us to present our defense, because the prosecutors' case had so many holes in it, it wasn't necessary for me to testify.  And then one makes those kinds of decisions because, of course, if someone testifies about certain issues, then Pandora's Box could be opened.  So we wanted to kind of keep the case structured as it was, and later decided that I didn't need to testify.  But the jury had already heard me speak.  So it really didn't matter that much.
Speaker 2: Now, up to that point, what do you think were the things that your team did right and what things did you do wrong?  Or did you do anything wrong?  I mean there was the whole thing of the state, you know, you deciding whether it was gonna be in federal or state court.  I mean there was, right?
Speaker 1: Well, it was difficult.  It was difficult.  And that wasn't about making a real decision.  It was about solidarity with Ruchell Magee [involved in the August 7, 1970 deadly shootout at the Marin County, California courthouse with Jonathan Jackson in re: the Soledad Brothers case].  And I should say that I felt, I felt it was very important to remain in solidarity with Ruchell.  I wanted to do the trial together even though there were lawyers who said that "If you stand trial with Ruchell Magee, the likelihood that you'll be convicted is much greater because Ruchell was actually there, and was actually involved," right. My position was that we were in that together, and I really wanted to do the trial together.  However, Ruchell decided that he wanted to remove the case to federal court.  And it was a strategy that he came up with, and it was a strategy on which I could not agree.  I did not want to do that and so eventually, we decided to sever the cases.  And Ruchell was quite angry with me.  And he had every right to be angry, but I wanted to win the case.  And I knew that removing it to federal court was not going to do that.  And his case had a different term, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's still in prison today, yeah.
