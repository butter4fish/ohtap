He worked for a couple of companies before he did that, but he always was a, an entrepreneur I would say and worked hard, but it was about family and I always was with him. I always was and he'd pick me up from school, change your clothes in the truck and go to work and that was it.

I said, "Well what, what does that do daddy?"  He says, "That's how we pay it.  If you feed the refrigerator it stays on, your food stays cold and then the man comes once a month, empties the vegetable bin, like a parking meter" and that was how he paid for the refrigerator, it was a Philco, I'll never forget.  I was a little boy.  My job was to--he'd come home with a pocketful of money and I would punch the quarters and he'd put so much in, but he was always an entrepreneur.  And it was, it was a, a business that was--there were other fuel dealers, but everybody had basically their territory--their own territory; and then in the summer we sold vegetables.  We had another truck and we would have the same route and we sold vegetables, yeah.

She played the piano a little bit.  But they were from a musical background.  My grandmother [Margaret Perry] did day's work for the rich folk and they moved from the Lower Roxbury to Upper Roxbury, Humboldt Avenue [Boston, Massachusetts] and then, and then I remember when dad brought--well we rented, we moved back in the '50s [1950s] we lived in a, basically in a Jewish community and I was only the minority in elementary school [David A.

Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, well baby on, let me go back.  My earliest, my earliest was coming to the Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].  I was, I think seven years old and coming to the Vineyard and going to the (unclear) every summer and coming down, use to come down and we--my father rented at that time, we didn't own a house back then and each summer we'd come to the Vineyard and it was great meeting other people from all over, other children and ended up living here myself.
Speaker 1: So, so that's your earliest memory.  Can you talk about the Vineyard at that time?
Speaker 2:  	Oh the Vineyard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) what it was like?
Speaker 2:  	--it was, it was great, I mean the, the, the fer- the merry go round is still there.  The horses, you know, what we would do when small was ride that then you'd have lunch and go to the beach every day and you'd see that people--all the kids were from out of state too, so you would have friends, you know, summer friends and they'd go back and you'd see them the next year, but it was just a great experience coming to the Vineyard, getting out of that city [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: So what--who, who were your friends there on the Vineyard?
Speaker 2:  	Oh I have a number of friends.  I've got Gretchen Coleman [Gretchen Coleman-Thomas], the Coleman family who has long years of coming here.  You have the--Gretchen Tucker [Gretchen Tucker-Underwood], her father [HistoryMaker Herbert Tucker, Jr.] was a judge here.  You have Marie Allen is, was my mother's contemporary, that's who I use to stay with when we would come down here.  Bobby Ratkov [ph.], I had a number of friends that we played with every year.  And I met--had friends from the young people living here on the, the, on the Vineyard because you had no problem with black and white in them days and we were, we were all kids.

Speaker 1: How has it changed?
Speaker 2:  	Oh you're getting more and more Afro Americans that are coming here now. (Unclear) a percentage of them will buy homes and grow up and have their children who will grow up here, but it is no more reasonable.  It's very, very, as you know, expensive to, to be on this island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] with the cost of living and what goes on, but I think that the, the younger people growing up here now, to, to get a house you know, it's no more three or four hundred dollars, its, you know it's up in the millions.  The cost of it is high, but a lot of people just come here for two weeks and go back home, but we were blessed to be able to buy a home here, a couple of homes here and have someplace to go, because it's only an hour and a half to (unclear) from Boston [Massachusetts]--it works, jump on the ferry, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're, and you're in paradise, right?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.  More black people own homes here than in any other resort in the country.  This place is hot.

It was interesting and back in those days people lived--there was a man that owned Laurel Club beverage company [Laurel Club Bottling Company] lived on that street and I can remember that.  Then we moved when I was in, going into the fourth, fifth, fourth grade, we moved to Roxbury to Holworthy Street, that's over near Walnut Avenue, Holworthy Street and I went to David A.

Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the mix even of the blacks?  Were there a lot of people from--did you have a far number of people from the islands or other places?
Speaker 2:  	I, I, I think there were a lot of Bostonians.  I don't remember too many Jamaicans or--back in those days or, or other nationalities, you know, people.  I think they were more or less Bostonians because when I grew up, yeah, from Boston [Massachusetts] and it was different groups.  It was a good experience.  You had a lot of theaters.

She had it all, never spent it, just put it away because everything was cash.  People paid in cash.
Speaker 1: So it was good he had your mother--
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah, oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so she could save for a rainy day.
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah, oh yeah, she was the boss.  She was, my mother was the boss.
Story_ID: 650601
Speaker 1: So what were some of your m- your parents' [Marguerite Perry Grimes and Calvin Grimes, Sr.] friends?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, they had a number of friends.  They had--they were in a club called the (Unclear) club, older people and they'd give an annual dance and local people.  There was Bob [ph.], you know Bob, was her friend, he has a--you know Bob.  He lived on our street, Hutchings Street.  And then there was Dr. Price [ph.] and there was Judge Tucker [HistoryMaker Herbert Tucker, Jr.].  But those were the upper crust; you know that was Hutchings Street.  That was all the light and brights, but I use to tell my dad they were his friends but they never bought oil from us.  I said, "What's that about, dad?"  "What, our oil don't burn?"  They'd, they'd give parties and invite them all, but none customers [of Grimes Oil Company; Grimes Oil Company, Inc.].  They'd buy it from the majority companies, but I stopped that, yeah.
Speaker 1: I see.  Now, were the Snowdens also (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh, Otto, one thing, that was my dad's beet friend.  Otto Snowden and Muriel Snowden, the Freedom House [Boston, Massachusetts], the best.  You know his daughter?  You know the daughter?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  Yes, she's here.  She has a home here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	She's a good person.  What's her name?
Speaker 1: I forget her name.
Speaker 2:  	What's, Gail, Gail Snowden.
Speaker 1: Gail Snowden, right.
Speaker 2:  	Gail, Gail, the best, Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], old Rox- but that, it's funny, my father and Otto Snowden were like this (gesture), yeah.
Story_ID: 650602
Speaker 1: So what did they [Marguerite Perry Grimes and Calvin Grimes, Sr.] share in common, or, or that--were there groups and organizations and things like that?
Speaker 2:  	Oh back in those days?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2:  	Well yeah, you always had the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you know, the Guscott family and those types of people.  Then you had the--well she was in a private club, the Clique Club and what else.  That's when you had all the clubs in Boston [Massachusetts], yeah.
Speaker 1: What clubs?
Speaker 2:  	You had the Hi-Hat, Columbus [Avenue] and Mass [Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts]; you had the Wally's Paradise [Wally's Cafe, Boston, Massachusetts].  Wally's is still there on Mass Avenue, that's a small club.  You had Big M [Morley's, Boston, Massachusetts].  Then on, then on Tremont Street, I mean on Boylston Street you had the Paul's Mall, you had the Jazz Workshop [Paul's Mall and the Jazz Workshop, Boston, Massachusetts] and you--I think you had so many other things, so many options back in those days where there's not that many now, you know.  We had Estelle's on, you know, what Slade's and Estelle's [Boston, Massachusetts] was.  Estelle's is now a luxury, luxury apartment building owned by a black and Frank Williams' son [Frank Williams, Jr.] runs it, yeah, yeah.  It's interesting (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how would you describe Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] back in those days, I mean I just would like you to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, well.
Speaker 1: --'cause you know, we, we, we can look today at what it's like, but I just was wondering what (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, you know we followed the Jewish people.  The Jewish people would move out, we would move in, and Roxbury, you know was predominately all Jewish back in that day and then they went to Dorchester, and then they went to Milton [Massachusetts] and we basically followed behind them as far as living, but it, it's really changed now.  I mean the whole city has changed, every corner there's a crane, there's always something doing.  I think Deval Patrick [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick] was a great governor.  He's a dear friend of mine and a customer [of Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] and what else.  I had a good life.  I got Lee [Lee V. Anderson] now.
Story_ID: 650603
Speaker 1: So talk about the founding of your father's company [Grimes Oil Company; Grimes Oil Company, Inc.], 'cause I was told that it was founded in 1940?  Isn't that they year you--?
Speaker 2:  	Was born--
Speaker 1: That's the year you were born?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that, like what he did, because he, he originally, what I read was that he was a truck driver for liquor warehouses (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that true?
Speaker 2:  	Then he started his own business and went on from there and that was local streets with kerosene and, and wood and coal back in those days.  Then we switched to fuel oil, heating oil, oil burning.
Speaker 1: Now what made--did he ever explain to you why he fell into that kind of work or preferred it?
Speaker 2:  	Because he--after the warehouse then he went to, before that he went to, before that he worked for Earl Taylor [ph.]--was an ice and coal man and he decided that he could do it himself, so he borrowed some money and got a truck and started his own company (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what do you remember about the business, that part, the time of the business, you know, you said some people paid in kind, some people, you know, he [Grimes' father, Calvin Grimes, Sr.] had on--
Speaker 2:  	Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) on tab--
Speaker 2:  	--he had, it was, they paid you weekly, it was, was--'cause a lot of them were cold water flats, you know you just had heat in the front of the house and the kitchen stove, but the rooms didn't have it.  We use to sell kerosene and bring up to ten gallons of kerosene and put it in the, in the, in the basement or put it in, in the stove, but it was--a number of products we had, coal, we had ice and we had kerosene and wood, bags of wood.  He use let me carry the bags of wood.
Speaker 1: So people could do any of that for what they were required?
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: So you were really helping heat the house--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in, in whatever way people had?
Speaker 2:  	Right, right.
Speaker 1: So what were, were, were there--I thought there were more oil furnaces than there were coal furnaces?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, 'cause coal went out and then you came to the fuel oil, correct.  People converted to, to oil burners, correct.
Speaker 1: And, and were there ever any accidents in any of the, you know, homes, like where someone, the fur- you know things would combust, or there would be--?
Speaker 2:  	No, we--I, I don't remember, like glass--gas explosion or anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2:  	--I don't remember any of that.
Story_ID: 650604
Speaker 1: Do you remember any anecdotes with working with your father [Calvin Grimes, Sr.], any stories you'd like to share when you worked, you know, helping go from home to home; or you know or been a particularly hard day, or you know, something some, some customer didn't pay?  Do you have any of those stories to share?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I, I had this, there was, we had a real estate company that, he got a little behind in the bill and I said, "Dad, get the plate."  The plate was L 43.  I still have that plate for fifty odd years.  So this man gave my father the plate for the balance of the, or whatever they worked out.
Speaker 1: So what was the--what is the plate?
Speaker 2:  	It a low plate--you know somebody you know it's L 43 Mass [Massachusetts].  I've still got that plate on my car outside now.
Speaker 1: But is this like plates to a car?
Speaker 2:  	An automobile plate.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	The lower the plate, it's who you know, yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2:  	It's a hook up, like Governor Dukakis [Michael Dukakis] had the zero series.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2:  	0618, 0628.
Speaker 1: Now I remember that, okay, okay.
Speaker 2:  	Right, (Unclear) had H.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember when business was good and when business was bad, any particular--?
Speaker 2:  	Well, it, it, it, it grew in '69 [1969], that's when we graduated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2:  	--in '69 [1969], 1969, that was, our first big commercial account was Polaroid [Polaroid Corporation] because we had two trucks then--
Speaker 1: But up to that point you only had one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	--(simultaneous) with the kerosene--. Yeah, you just had one truck you know.
Speaker 1: One truck, okay, okay.
Speaker 2:  	But then we grew and we had three trucks, you know.
Speaker 1: But by that time, cause he starts in 1940 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and then so he's run--
Speaker 2:  	In '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: --so he's run it [Grimes Oil Company; Grimes Oil Company, Inc.]--
Speaker 2:  	Forty [1940], yeah; started in '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: In 1940--
Speaker 2:  	Forty [1940].
Speaker 1: --and so by 1950 you know, '58 [1958], that's eighteen years so he was really in business you know, for--
Speaker 2:  	All my life--
Speaker 1: --well all your life, but before he got the second truck it was about twenty years?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I would--we got that truck, right.  I was about twenty, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so what, did you remember the truck--did he have his name on the truck at all, or--?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, he definitely had his name on the truck.  Can I tell you a little story about the name on the truck?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2:  	I can't remember what the problem was, but I guess we had a little problem, me and my dad, so when I went, went to the garage to go to work one morning he marked my name off.  It was Cal Grimes and Son, so he took and marked my name off the truck.  I was so crushed when I saw it was wiped off; so I called my mother [Marguerite Perry Grimes], right, because she, she, she was the boss.  So I said, "Mom, dad took my name off the truck and that's not right and I work hard."  She said, "I'll take care of it."  But he took it off.  It, it wasn't--my, he took masking tape because he was angry at me and wrote off, took it off his truck and took it off my truck.  So when I went to get my truck that morning my name was masked off, but he, we, she straightened it out, she straight- that was, that was the biggest crush I had because he, he, he was good.  He, I mean, if you borrowed money from him you had to pay him back.  He, he'd mark it in the book--if, you don't get no more if you don't pay (unclear).  But back, that was our first--
Story_ID: 650605
Speaker 1: So I--did, did he di- compete with the white companies?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And so remember you were saying how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, the, the upper crust would--right--
Speaker 1: --the bright skinned people--
Speaker 2:  	Right, bright, light, would buy from the big company; but yet and still when they had a party they'd come over and drink that liquor, okay.  So I said, "What's that about Dad [Calvin Grimes, Sr.]?"  "Oh, don't worry about it; don't worry about" (unclear).
Speaker 1: But color was a big thing back then and still may be, but it was a big thing back then.
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah, oh yeah, it was the light and bright; down here too, same thing.
Speaker 1: And so the light and bright, for people who don't know what that means, they would get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) You know what that means.
Speaker 1: --they would get all the advantages, right?
Speaker 2:  	Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, so what--so you started to drive for your father, right?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you start driving before you were age eighteen? 'Cause I have you driving at the age of eighteen?
Speaker 2:  	I, I, I had my license when I was sixteen.  I didn't get a truck until we were about--
Speaker 1: Until you were eighteen?
Speaker 2:  	--yeah, eighteen.
Speaker 1: So what, what did having a truck mean?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I had my, I had--we had a number of customers then and we were building it up you know, so he'd have one route and I'd have another route.  And then I got off of the truck and I went to heating school and I use to repair the heating equipment, the oil burners, cleaning out the oil burners, install burners, boilers, that type of thing, so--
Speaker 1: Well, that was important that you learned that skill (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) The trade--I had a license.
Speaker 1: --because otherwise they could have equipment down you know, longer?
Speaker 2:  	Right, so you had--that was the thing, if you couldn't fix the oil burner it was hard to get a customer and I said, "Dad, let's go--I'll go to school," you know, we were losing--get a customer [for Grimes Oil Company; Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] and if you had no one to come and fix the heat they're not going to stay with you.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  So what, what are you learning about business when you start working, really in that way and I'm talking about age eighteen?  What do you learn about the business?
Speaker 2:  	Well, the, the, the, the, the whole, the whole business is based on if you can get the commercial accounts or you can get the, the retail accounts.  I'm kind of jumping forward now.  Our biggest customer right now is National Grid [National Grid USA].
Speaker 1: No, don't jump, don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(simultaneous) Okay, we'll get to that.
Story_ID: 650606
Speaker 1: So you want to know what about what now?  Getting back to what you--?
Speaker 2: I want to know about what, what were good accounts and what were not good accounts, that's what I was wondering?
Speaker 1:  	Well back in those days, we didn't have any commercial--you had homeowners, people home--and most of the people paid.  They may have been slow.  You didn't get nonpayment or you had to take them to court, very, very seldom because they, they, they did what they could do.  They may pay you weekly or may pay you monthly, but we didn't get a lot of losses.  It wasn't like someone would get into you for a large amount of money, unless you had a real estate account paying you or somebody that burnt a lot of oil.
Speaker 2: So how long did it take you to get the commercial clients?
Speaker 1:  	Well we it built it in 1969, that's why I told you Polaroid [Polaroid Corporation] was our first commercial account.
Speaker 2: I see, okay, but you know I have that you were incorporated okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) In '69 [1969], right.
Speaker 2: --in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1:  	Right.
Speaker 2: So you had to get incorporated--
Speaker 1:  	Right.
Speaker 2: --in order to get--
Speaker 1:  	Right.
Speaker 2: --the, the--
Speaker 1:  	And I changed the name to Grimes Oil Company [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1:  	Right.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah because I saw, we saw the documentation that, there're three people who were listed that were: Calvin Grimes [HistoryMaker Calvin "Kern" Grimes], you; Emily Grimes; and William Roper [William L. Roper, Jr.]?  Who is William Roper?
Speaker 1:  	William was a dear friend of mine when we first incorporated.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, okay, so that, I thought that was interesting.  You know, someone had pulled that fact up.  Now I want to--so tell me about once you incorporated because and how did--well let's talk about how you got Polaroid 'cause Polaroid I have you getting it in 1971.
Speaker 1:  	Um-hm, I thought it was sooner.  They came to us before affirmative action was--. We had a little office at Columbia Road and Washington Street in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] and two gentlemen came, a black man and a white man, Bob Sands [ph.] and another, Mr. Baptiste.  They said, "How would you like to do some business with Polaroid?"  And I really was excited and we were able to put something together, so the first time they called we had two three thousand gallon trucks then.  I drove one, my father [Calvin Grimes, Sr.] one.  We dumped the three thousand--the six thousand gallons.  He said, "Now, we don't have no money and this is June so what are you going to do now?"  I said, "I'll take care of it."  I went back to the man who signed me up and he said, "Kern, go to Windsor Street, accounts payable.  I'll let them pay you COD [cash on delivery]; bring the slip over there."  That's what they did for me.  So they made, paid us cash basically--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1:  	--and we were good and then we had to bring in little financial statements and they helped us grow.  Polaroid was ahead of their time for affirmative action, before everything else, so that's how we started.
Speaker 2: So who was at Polaroid at that time that you worked with?
Speaker 1:  	Bob Sands and, and William Baptiste [ph.], those were the two men that I, that I dealt with and they helped us and they really--and this was a big deal for us.  I mean I dumped six thousand gallons of oil you know; we didn't have any commercial accounts in them days.
Speaker 2: Now how had you thought of them, that's what I'm wondering?  How had you thought to approach Polaroid?
Speaker 1:  	They came to me.
Speaker 2: They came to you.
Speaker 1:  	They came to our little office.
Speaker 2: So this person (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) These two men came into my office one day and--
Speaker 2: --came to your office, okay.
Speaker 1:  	--and, and made an appointment to sit down and my father was there with me and they went over what they wanted to do and to try to help small businesses, but he, but he said, he was nervous about running a big tab and waiting thirty days for the money and you don't have the money to pay the supplier and this was what we did.
Speaker 2: Well this, you know that's the typical problem with small businesses like that, is the amount of time to get you know, get, get paid and that could effect things.
Speaker 1:  	Right.
Speaker 2: So, so, so when you--so this is a big deal.  This is--do you get a lot of publicity on this, or--?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, we had a nice write up, yeah, yeah, it was, it was, it was just--and they, they protected you, they, they worked with you.  Someone to pay you COD, I mean that's--'cause my father said, "Now, now what are you going to do?"  I said, "I'll take care of it."  He was, he, he was happy because he had no money.  I remember, off the record, I remember one time when money was tight and Gulf Oil--we were a Gulf branded dealer.  Our trucks were painted with our name on them, but Gulf emblems.  And we didn't have no money.  He said, "Send the check and don't sign it.  It will go to Texas, but by the time they get it to Texas, a week; by the time you get it back we'll be okay, but you can't do it all the time, you know, you can do it once, once," what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 650607
Speaker 1: So with this, so you get Polaroid [Polaroid Corporation] and, and I want to talk about this time period because 1971 you're right, it's right at the beginning and there is Black Enterprise magazine is just beginning.  I think it's a newsletter at that point.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.], um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, people, then there are the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], Republicans you know, that had liked-- supposedly Nixon did a lot.
Speaker 2:  	Well Nixon started SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration] and it was a good program for us.  We were in it thirteen years.  They gave us BDE, business development expense.  They bought us a computer, no pay.  They bought us a big Burroughs [Burroughs Corporation; Unisys Corporation], whole system.  They gave you BDE--we had contracts with all the government.  We had the hospitals.  We had the [U.S.] Army bases, anything for government we had.  So they would give you the money in advance.  I would take it to my supplier and, and we gave them a better price because they liked paying you up front.  The program worked for us.  We didn't mess with their money.  We paid them on time.  There was over twenty-eight minority dealers in the SBA division across the country and that's how we grew.  There's not one left.  I'm the only one [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.].
Speaker 1: See that, that's the status of things now.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, it's, it's, it's (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah it stems from consolidation.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: But some people say that for the reason.  Like I would say that, that the period that we're talking about--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is one of the most prolific periods for blacks--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --in Corporate America and--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --and business, especially like--so, so, you, so this happens and you get this account.  Now, is there any issue like you know, they, they did all these things for you, but was there any issue about how you were going to handle the added volume?
Speaker 2:  	No, because they paid us, they gave us special payment for the--they paid us, they kept us, they kept us flowing.  They, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, they you, okay--
Speaker 2:  	Right, they kept you afloat.
Speaker 1: But see now those programs are, they're impossible to have now.
Speaker 2:  	Right, you got to chase them now.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you enrolled in the SBA, the 8(a) program [8(a) Business Development Program] (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Program, 8(a), right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And can you talk about that program because this also would be earlier, early in the program's--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --history?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.  It was, it was, it was a wonderful program.  I mean it was so many things that Nixon you know, when he started that, that program, 'cause that was a Republican, that was Nixon who started that 8(a) program and SBA and it was really beneficial (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you said you were a Republican?
Speaker 2:  	No, no I'm not a Republican.
Speaker 1: Not, not, okay.
Speaker 2:  	I said he was a--
Speaker 1: He was a Republican?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, he was--
Speaker 1: Oh no, but people, black businesspeople swear by Nixon.
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	That was Charlie Wallace's [Charles Wallace] guy out of New York, Wallace and Wallace [Wallace and Wallace Fuel Oil Company, Inc.].  They were big.  They were going to build a refinery, but when Nixon went down that, that went down with it, but they had the government trucks.  They had the re- it was going to be a big minority refinement, Wallace and Wallace, yep.
Speaker 1: Now, you know the other person who was important to the 8(a) program was Parren Mitchell [HistoryMaker Parren J. Mitchell, III], do you remember (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh, I knew Mat- Parren, Baltimore [Maryland], excellent.  He was a fighter.  He was a real, real, great man.
Speaker 1: So can you tell a story about, about Parren?
Speaker 2:  	All I, all I, the way I knew him that there was, he was always fighting the cause.  He was always pushing for minority business; and he implemented, I mean, he, he, he was a winner, Parren Mitchell.
Story_ID: 650608
Speaker 1: What other--once you got into the 8--now how long did it take you to get certified into the 8(a) program [8(a) Business Development Program]?
Speaker 2:  	A lot of paperwork, you're right.  Once you got your paperwork in order I think that they were ready to, to roll.  Once we got in we got, I don't think we waited more than six months to get certified, you know, get all your paperwork and all that and everything.
Speaker 1: So now were you going around to different conferences and exhibits or things like that, or what, what did having the 8(a) program, being 8(a) certified, what did it allow you to do besides the Polaroid [Polaroid Corporation] business?
Speaker 2:  	It gave me advantage for, for new business within the government agencies.  That's what I told you I had the [U.S.] Army bases, we had the VA hospitals [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], we had the post offices [U.S. Postal Service].  We had all these companies.  All--they put that package together and we brought oil to these customers and my big supplier was a major company, Global Petroleum.  That was, that was big doings.
Speaker 1: So what, what did your annual receipts go up to at that point?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, what we did in those years.  We were, we were high.  We did big sales, probably twelve million, thirteen million [dollars].
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --in the 1970s--
Speaker 2:  	--but the volume was this, 'cause it was based on the price of a gallon of oil so your sales--if the oil was high, your prices were high, your volume was high, your gross sales were high.
Speaker 1: Okay, but what were your, what were the margins that you were offering on it?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, the, the margins, we worked, if we worked on, on the government stuff we worked on about sixty cents a gallon, fifty cents a gallon.  It was a decent margin.  They, they, they wanted that program to work.  They, they didn't squeeze you to the point you know, give you a, a hiccup and then squeeze you on price and then you can't make any money.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay and then what--so you're saying business was just coming in. Now, how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) No, no, I mean we picked up new business from that, but the, the government helped, kept us together while building where some of these other companies depended on the government stuff and didn't pick up no new business.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.
Speaker 2:  	That, that, that was our key [for Grimes Oil Company, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay, but I saw, I saw that, I mean some of your clients who were they?
Speaker 2:  	Digital, you may not remember Digital (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Equipment Corporation [Digital Equipment Corporation], um-hm.
Speaker 2:  	Digital--We had Gillette [The Gillette Company], South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], which we still have now.
Speaker 1: You had Bethlehem Steel [Bethlehem Steel Corporation].
Speaker 2:  	Yep.
Speaker 1: You had Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.].
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yep, yeah, those were a lot of the companies that moved.
Speaker 1: Didn't, didn't you have Raytheon [Raytheon Company]?
Speaker 2:  	We still have Raytheon.  Those are, because they are government agencies and they've got to spend the minority dollars for the federal funds.  That's--
Speaker 1: I see.  And do you, do you still have Kraft [Kraft Foods Group, Inc.]?
Speaker 2:  	We have, we have Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company].  We don't have anything with Kraft, Procter and Gamble, that's Gillette; they bought Gillette, Procter and Gamble.  We have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you mean this, who else are you competing with in the country?  What other minority business in this sector, you know, of oil distribution or--?
Speaker 2:  	There's one guy in Cleveland [Ohio], if I can think of his name.  He's pretty big.  He hooked up with, BP [BP P.L.C.], British Petroleum is his supplier and he's got all the Kroger's [The Kroger Company] and all those type markets; the same type of thing.  I'll think of his name, his company.  What else did we do?  Oh, Con Edison [Consolidated Edison, Inc.] was good to us.  And how we worked that Con Edison deal, they, they bought barges, big shiploads of oil, but they had Archie Bankston [Archie M. Bankston, Jr.] who was clerk of the corporation and a senior vice president, black man and Joy Crichlow was the minority person and when we, we did it, it was with my supplier, if prime falls and doesn't produce, our supplier would pick up the contract at no extra cost to them, so that made the purchasing people feel comfortable (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2:  	--'cause no one wants to do it if you let them down and they lose their job you know how it is--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2:  	--so we, we set up a thing between the supplier, Global Petroleum and myself and we voted and signed that, that they were guaranteed that they would get product--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	--and that was when Con Edison was good to us years ago.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, they had a nice program, yeah.  They had a nice-- Joy Crichlow was the minority person there.  She's retired so a lot of these people are gone.
Speaker 1: And with--I, I--and what happened in 1973 when you had the oil crisis?  Did that affect you?
Speaker 2:  	No, we got our, we got, we got our share, we got our (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so that didn't matter?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	It would--it tightened up--the prices went up, you know how it is when there's, when there's a crisis.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then what about your buying a half an acre of land at--on, on Callender Street in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, that was a st- small storage facility.
Speaker 1: And you paid six thousand dollars for the land?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Story_ID: 650609
Speaker 1: Well, I just want you to tell me like, in the early--like what are the most productive years in the business [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] would you say?
Speaker 2:  	Now.
Speaker 1: Now?
Speaker 2:  	(Nods head) Programs, affirmative action, federal companies have to spending minority dollars.  That's, that's, that's, that's where the break comes in.
Speaker 1: But isn't that--is that now?  But those, those policies got set earlier?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, it was different it was a smaller scale.  We didn't have the volume.  We had--after the, don't forget when you graduated from SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration], you know, you'd get out of the program [8(a) Business Development Program], you, you can't, you, you have to go with the big leagues and bid it, there's no advantage because you're out of the program.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	I think we were in that program for about twelve years and it worked, it worked fine.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	And we paid them.  We paid them what we owed them.  A lot of the guys would do other things with the money and so on and so forth.
Speaker 1: And then that puts a black mark on everything?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 650610
Speaker 1: What also was significant about the running of the business [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.]; and how did it differ from when your father [Calvin Grimes, Sr.] had been running it?
Speaker 2:  	Well, he used to always say, well you know, you've got the computers now and you've got this and you've got that, it's--he, he, he was an old timer, I mean he dealt directly with the--. We didn't have big accounts before he retired and got out of it.  We just had households.  We didn't have any, no commercial accounts and so it was a different--but he still came in you know, got his little check, he and retired, but it's, it's, it's totally different now.  The energy business is, is totally--as you see major oil companies are not in the retail business now.  Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation] sold out.  Hess [Hess Corporation] sold out to Safeway.  All the big major oil companies is getting out of the gasoline and the retail business.  There's no money in it for them, so you see Safeway up here now.  We never had Safeway before and all th- the large independents are taking over that stuff now.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay, and--
Speaker 2: We had a hiccup.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2:  	We had a hiccup.
Speaker 1: A hiccup?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, we had, we had trouble with a supplier.
Speaker 1: So who was it?
Speaker 2:  	Well we filed bankruptcy, filed, filed bankruptcy.  That might not have been--I'm just telling you off the record.  We had a hiccup.  We, we owed them a couple million dollars.  We, we ended up settling with them for a million and kept moving.
Speaker 1: Oh no, now I see that you filed bankruptcy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, we filed bankruptcy, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in 1989.
Speaker 2:  	And, and, but we came, we came right out of it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	We didn't, we didn't miss a thing because my supplier stayed with me.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2:  	We got a new supplier, Global [Global Petroleum].
Speaker 1: That's very important, that if you're going to file bankruptcy, if you can work things out with your--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --it's called involuntary liquidation [sic.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah voluntary liquidation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --that's right.
Speaker 2:  	And, the, the new supplier picked us right up and we didn't miss a beat and we beat, beat them for a million dollars (winks).  They were a major company and they started to squeeze us (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 650611
Speaker 1: You were very good at taking your father's business [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] to the next level?
Speaker 2:  	I think, I think so, we (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you were smart about your dealings?
Speaker 2:  	Well, you had the breaks.  You had the people; companies that you could get to do business with you that would pay you and help you grow.  If it wasn't for the affirmative action, the set asides, you know, you--how you gonna pay--you've got to buy it from this man, you got to compete against him, the city, now we have contractors, the City of Boston [Massachusetts] has big contractors, but everybody's got a contract, everybody's got to spend money.
Speaker 1: So how many people did you have working for you?
Speaker 2:  	Oh at one time, had forty people between the retail, and that was big, you know, payroll and this, that and the other, but we had a lot of retail then.  We had a lot of homeowners, you know.  But we came out of it you know, they knock you down but you've just got to get back up.
Speaker 1: I see.  So what, what contract did you have that was the easiest and what were the hardest to service?
Speaker 2:  	Well, you never had trouble with the big boys, the big companies, the Procter and Gambles [Procter and Gamble Company], or the Con Edisons [Consolidated Edison, Inc.], they paid you, I mean you didn't have trouble.  You, you if--I think in business, at least in our business you can have one big account go bad on you, that's what, that's, that's--I had an account, a big manufacturing plant go bad on me and so I got in trouble with the bankruptcy.  He got--we were in big debt and he didn't pay us.  We couldn't pay our bills.
Speaker 1: So when you said they, they went bad on you, was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) They went, they went bankrupt, a manufacturing company in Hyde Park [Boston, Massachusetts] owed us a lot of money and they went, they went bankrupt and I owed the supplier.
Speaker 1: Now how large is your office at this point?  Do you--
Speaker 2:  	Small.
Speaker 1: --it's small, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) It's small.
Speaker 1: --so you just really have to process the paperwork?
Speaker 2:  	Paperwork--we still have volume and we have one truck.  I have subcontractors do the deliveries.  I have one truck.  The department of transportation demands that I have one truck to work for the DOT you know, bridges and construction stuff that's going on.
Speaker 1: Now I have one question: why could, how could you have made in 1989, in 1988 reported sales of $28 million for the year--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then 1989, one year later, you're filing bankruptcy?
Speaker 2:  	Well, this, this, this company went bad.  He owed us a lot of money, millions, you know, it was over a million dollars.  And he, he got into us and, and that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you--how long did it take you to recover from that.  Oh, you're saying it didn't because it was involunt- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) (Unclear) because the next guy picked me up.
Speaker 1: So, pick you up, okay.
Speaker 2:  	That's right, because--they picked you up because they know there's an advantage of the business that they can't get.
Story_ID: 650612
Speaker 1: Now your father died in nine- in 1991.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That was like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) He was seventy-six I think.  He died seventy-five, seventy-six years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe, yeah, so, no, he was seventy-five.
Speaker 2:  	That's what I said, seventy-five, seventy-six.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says he was seventy-five.
Speaker 2:  	Young.
Speaker 1: And he had, he had had a stroke, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about what that was like because if, had it not been for him you would not have been in this business?
Speaker 2:  	True.
Speaker 1: So what was his death like, you know, losing your father like?
Speaker 2:  	Well he was, he was retired at that time, okay.  And we were, we were kind of established at that time.  We were moving along pretty good and it was tough, I mean anytime you lose, you know, your dad, I mean its--but my mom [Marguerite Perry Grimes] still lived.  She was a ball of fire.  She died, I mean, she was eighty-six I think when she died, but it's tough losing your, your, someone established, but we had a funeral for him.  We had a new truck in the front, a new truck in back.  He had--oil trucks, brand new and they led a thing.  I, if they didn't have a hundred cars we didn't have one.  They turned out for Cal Grimes [Calvin Grimes, Sr.], yeah.  He was--one lady at the funeral said, "You don't know what your dad did when we didn't have no money and he kept us warm;" the older people, the other set, not my group, you know, the older people that he served, yeah.  He was loved.
Speaker 1: That's lovely.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Especially to have those, those trucks, that's very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  That was Grimes [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.], yeah, that was our day.  Yeah, we had one leading and one at the end, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's lovely.
Story_ID: 650613
Speaker 1:  	--(Unclear) is one and Owens [ph.] is one.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1:  	That's the only three black oil companies.
Speaker 2: I know, but I'm talking about your company [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] (laughter).
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah, I mean they were, you know (pause).  I'm just thinking you know, there wasn't a lot of minority companies, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well Boston [Massachusetts] doesn't have--
Speaker 1:  	It, yeah.
Speaker 2: --a large minority population, minority population.
Speaker 1:  	Right--
Speaker 2: You know, (unclear)--
Speaker 1:  	--back in those days.
Speaker 2: --like compared to a place like Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1:  	Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: And it's pretty self--you know, and it was pretty much, I don't know if it's changed, but it's pretty much self contained.  I guess--
Speaker 1:  	You been back?  You been there?
Speaker 2: I have.
Speaker 1:  	There's a crane on every corner.  There are buildings going up (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is and you know what's surprising?  I was surprised that A Nubian Notion was still at Dudley station [Dudley Square, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1:  	They just went out.  They just--
Speaker 2: They just--
Speaker 1:  	They just closed up, yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow!  I could not believe they--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, Malik [Malik Abdal Khallaq], yeah, yeah.  They're nice people.
Speaker 2: They're, um-hm.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah, Malik and--yeah.
Speaker 2: So you like--[HistoryMaker] Samella Lewis was doing her thing and you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Oh, I was--
Speaker 2: And you at the time--you were at the time that Boston where the, the, you know, the Black Muslims [Nation of Islam], they had the bean pies and--
Speaker 1:  	Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal].
Speaker 2: Muhammad Speaks.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, I know Gene Walcott.  I know Mrs. Farrakhan [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan]--English High School [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: English High School.
Speaker 1:  	I know Gene, I know, I call him Gene, 'cause it, but as Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  That's my friend.
Speaker 2: So, wait a minute, were you in school with them there?
Speaker 1:  	No, no, no, no, I didn't know them back then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	I have a picture at the house with me and him.  He was great.  He was track star.  Did you ever hear him play the violin?
Speaker 2: No, but you know what, I--

Speaker 1:  	That's, that's Minister Farrakhan's, that's his name.
Speaker 2: That's his name.
Speaker 1:  	That's his first name, yeah, good man.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1:  	They lived in Lower Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  They lived on Ruggles Street down near Dudley station.
Speaker 2: Right, right there, okay.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah; he was good.  I went to his house in Chicago--serious, then he got a house in the suburbs they say that's serious, more serious, oh, yeah.  It's changed, it's, it's really, it's really changed.
Speaker 2: I know, it's getting worse and worse (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 650614
Speaker 1: So let me ask you--so what were your desires to have growth, growth plans for the business?  'Cause I saw in 1989 when your father [Calvin Grimes, Sr.], no, two years, two years before your father died you retired some of the debt, debt.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then it's, and then I see in 1993 you joined Captree Chemicals [Captree Chemical Corporation] and Aimtek [Aimtek, Inc.] yes?
Speaker 2:  	Oh Amtrak [National Railroad Passenger Corporation], wow, I forgot about that, yeah we had a big Amtrak contract, yeah.
Speaker 1: No, but this is different.  Amtek--Aimtek gas company form Intergy [ph.], did you--, "Grimes Oil Company [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] joins Captree Chemicals and Aimtek--,"--
Speaker 2:  	We, we, we had a joint venture with Aimtek, yeah.
Speaker 1: And was for bidding, right--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --for the purpose of bidding?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now how involved were you on the National Minority Supplier Development Council?
Speaker 2:  	I've always been a member, always paid my dues (unclear).
Speaker 1: How much did you play a role in that organization (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, I was in the local chapter.  I wasn't in national.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't in national.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 650615
Speaker 1: Why do you think you're--it's significant that your business is still, still around today?
Speaker 2:  	Well, first of all you've got a product they really need.  You're capitalizing on companies that do minority business who have to meet their goals.  They've got a big program with Massport [Massachusetts Port Authority] now, with the airports.  The feds are putting big heat on all airports and Massport to do more minority business or the feds are going to cut their, their chain.  So now we're trying to chase the, the--Massport has renters like, Avis [Avis Budget Group, Inc.] or Hertz [The Hertz Corporation], or car dealers.  We're trying to sell them some gasoline.  They're going--the, the Massport is going after people who rent from them, concessionaires I guess you would call them, to do minority business that help them meet their goals.  That's what's helping us.  That's why I told you about National Grid [National Grid USA].  National Grid has blown us up big.  They've got a black president you know, U.S., you familiar with him?  Charlie Seavers [sic. Dean Seavers], look him up, National Grid U.S. and they've got a real program.  We have them on onsite fuel and that is our truck will go to a site where they park their trucks at night and we fuel up for each individual truck.  Then we have them (unclear) oil.  They take the whole load.  Then we're, they're going to give us some, some lubricants, but they're a fine company.  They're, they're one of the big ones.  They, they gave, wrote us up, we helped them during the storm and they--I'll show you what they wrote to us, thanking us; Bill [ph.] and all of them for doing the storm for special deliveries.  So that's where, that's where it is.  We, we, you go and we have CoreSite, we have BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  We have Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts].  We have Boston University.  We have the City of Boston [Massachusetts]; the police, the fire thing, we have that.  We have a number of accounts that, you bid every year, but they have to do some minority business too, so it's a little edge, it helps.
Speaker 1: So what, why did you move here and start operating Grimes [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] out of here?
Speaker 2:  	Because I wanted to get out of that crazy city.
Speaker 1: So what did you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) They were shooting and killing. So I said, well we can run it from here and if I've got to go up (unclear), I said well--
Speaker 1: So, so when, when did you move to the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2:  	I've been here eight years now full time I think or it's seven, eight years.
Speaker 1: So, like 2009?
Speaker 2:  	I think so.  I moved down here and, and run it, run it from here.  It's a pleasure.  The city is--'cause I lived in the inner city.  I lived right in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], behind McDonald's on Warren Street.  I lived on Catawba Street, you know, I stayed there you know, but it was just time to, this is heaven.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2:  	Get on the boat--
Speaker 1: So, how do you operate it from here then?  Who, who, who--
Speaker 2:  	We have a, we have a bookkeeper.  We have computers and we, we do it from here.  We, we have trucking companies that--a call comes in, we have someone deliver it because I only have one truck.  We're doing the Talbot Bridge now.  That's a big account (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh so you only have one truck now?
Speaker 2:  	We only have one truck of my own, but I have plenty of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Trucks--access to trucks?
Speaker 2:  	--haulers, haulers that deliver for us.
Speaker 1: I see, okay, I see.
Speaker 2:  	Then you don't have to have the equipment; if you lose the contract you don't have to get rid of the truck, the help and so on.
Story_ID: 650616
Speaker 1: So what do you want--now, what about children, do you have someone who is going to be taking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) I have plenty of children.  I have five children.
Speaker 1: But what are their names and, and--?
Speaker 2:  	Darlene [Darlene Grimes], Lori [Lori Grimes], Mitchell [Kern M. Grimes], Ashley [Ashley Smallwood Grimes]--who else?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2:  	--Trevor [C. Trevor Grimes].  Trevor's here; I've got a youngest one; but I have a grandson that's going to come back.  He's in South Africa now.  He has a solar electricity license and he's done work for me previously and he's going to come back and run the company [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.]; that's my grandson and then my son (unclear).  I have a daughter too that will work with me and she--
Speaker 1: So they're going to continue the business?
Speaker 2:  	Well, the business will be my grandson and my, my son will take over, okay.
Speaker 1: I see.  So when are you going to transition like that?
Speaker 2:  	What, go away, stop working?  This is fun, being here with you, this works.  I only sell.  I like to sell.  I like to sell, but once you get a reputation it helps.  It makes the purchasing agents real comfortable when you show them the list of customers that you have and the, the (unclear).  I'll send you a list later on who we service.  It's--and you do the job and we, we're on time and it's professional, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what, what do you hope that your son and grandson do with the business?
Speaker 2:  	Just keep, just keep it moving.
Speaker 1: Because your, your father [Calvin Grimes, Sr.], you built upon his--?
Speaker 2:  	That's right.
Speaker 1: And you would like to see them built upon that.
Speaker 2:  	And it's changing. Energy is changing, but it's, it's still there, you know.  There's a lot of work out there.
Story_ID: 650617
Speaker 1: Tell me also what organizations were you a part of?
Speaker 2:  	Well, the NAACP [Martha's Vineyard Branch NAACP, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts]. I'm a member of it down here.
Speaker 1: And how, and how active were--have you been with that?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, just a paying membership.  They don't do much down here.  I don't, I don't, I'm not particularly, I, I, I pay my membership, but they don't do much down here.  But we're on the council, council of minority transportation association [Conference of Minority Transportation Officials], that's for the transit authorities.  I'm a member of that.  I'm a member of the New England Minority Supplier Development Council [Greater New England Minority Supplier Development Council].  What else are we on?  That's a--the council is big.  They have a national and they have a local chapter.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what about the Prince Hall Masons?
Speaker 2:  	I use to, oh well, I was never a Mason, but I always donated.
Speaker 1: Oh, you always donated, okay, okay.  Now I--you know, you, you--I saw an article where they say you do a lot of entertaining here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts]. Is that true?
Speaker 2:  	Sure, why not.  You want to come to a party?
Speaker 1: No, I just want (laughter)--
Speaker 2:  	When you come back next time, next time you come back this summer--you'll be back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--
Speaker 2:  	You will be back.

Story_ID: 650618
Speaker 1: --You think about where the black community is--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.

Speaker 1: --and how you have been very much involved in the business community and your father [Calvin Grimes, Sr.] really started--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on his own with, you know, really nothing except his, his hard work, you know and belief--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and what do you think about where we are as black people today?
Speaker 2:  	What do I what?
Speaker 1: Where--what do you think of where we are as black people today in this country?
Speaker 2:  	So, so you want to know what do I think of black folk (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, what do you think, yes, of black folk and where we are now given the events of this country?
Speaker 2:  	Well, we've made progress, but not--I think that we should have made more progress, but look at all the blocking.  Look at what Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] went up against, you know.  What a, you know, it's just all these roadblocks.  I don't think you have, you know, there're a lot of small black companies that have gone out of business too.  I don't know what the ratio is in new business, but there's a lot, you know there's a lot of young professionals that are doing real well that you might not hear of, but, its, its, I, I just think we could be a lot further, I mean, it's, it's been, it's been, it's hard.  You've got to have the right product too.  You've got to have something that they need.  You can't sell dashikis, you know, and that ain't happening, you know.  We've got oil; they burn it; they need some more.  Now, I'll give you, you a little story off the record.  I had a CFO who worked for me [at Grimes Oil Company, Inc.] about eight, ten years, good man, smart, numbers guy.  My daughter [Darlene Grimes]--I sent him to work with my daughter.  He's the only minority, large minority medical supply business in the country.  Merck took him under its, Merck, Merck, Merck pharmaceutical [Merck and Co., Inc.]--it's called Westnet, Inc.  He's blown up big.  He's in Baltimore [Maryland].  He's in DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company].  He's in--he's pharmaceuticals 'cause he deals with research and development; you don't have to go through purchasing and they've all got federal funds, so they've got to spend big dollars, Westnet, Inc., big company, look up.  My daughter runs it.  She's second in command and he's probably got sixty people and he sells medical supplies throughout the country, but Merck needed a minority.  If you want to get into DuPont you go through him, you know how they work.  And he, he looked and seen what was good, bought it from a Jewish fella, small company, made it minority; and just, it's, it's gorgeous what he's done.

Speaker 1: So you think you could have done what you did without the minority set aside program [8(a) Business Development Program]?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: You would not?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2:  	No, you've got to get the break because if you don't get an edge you can't get in the door and if you, if it's no minority set aside or no minority qualification your supplier takes it, the big boy takes it.  But you go to them now.  You're bringing a business that they can't get, so they go along with it.  And they want to work with you because they're not going to get that business.  So, I think there's, you know, there's a lot of programs, the transit authorities and tons of fuel, tons, tires, motor oils, greases, transmission fluids.  It's, it's--our, our, our business, you've got a lot of edges and if you get a, a company, another company like National Grid [National Grid USA], it's beautiful.  And once you get them they, they keep you.
Speaker 1: But what if, you know, what if our current president [President Donald John Trump] had his way and they decided to do away with set aside programs, you know, as discriminatory.  He's even saying that as it relates to you know, he's ordered Jeff Sessions--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to stop any preferential programs in colleges.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what if that happened?  What would be your concern about that?
Speaker 2:  	I, I think, I think, I think a company like a National Grid and a GM [General Motors Company], anything, they'll still do minority business.  I don't, I don't think it's going to--because it's, it's not the law, but it's good business to do minority business.  I don't think your major companies are going to kick you to the curb.  You may get somebody that, that, the, the small companies, but I think--you know when, when, when they have the set aside they make it, they make it happen, be competitive. Now, they're not going to pay the extra dollar a gallon now, you know. You've got to be in the ballpark.  They may give you some assistance, but you're not going to, you know run up--you can charge them what you want and get rich on them, no.  I, I hope it doesn't happen, but he's, that president, he's--they're going to impeach him.  He's gone.  He, he's over his head.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: He's gone.  They're building that case, you watch.  Yeah, he's crazy.
Story_ID: 650620
Speaker 1: So what hopes and concerns--we're talking about President Trump, Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump], right?
Speaker 2:  	Trumpy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Trumpy, okay (laughter).  So, so what, what, when you look at the black community today, 'cause you've said several times that the crime and you know, Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, really made you come to settle here [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] and you know when you describe the community in the early years--
Speaker 2:  	They didn't have that.
Speaker 1: Right, you didn't, you didn't, describe--
Speaker 2:  	When you were over there, you didn't have the crime that they have now.
Speaker 1: Right, so what, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2:  	That, that, that these people get a break or get something that, you know, they rob and steal 'cause they're broke.  I mean I know there're drugs and this, that and the other, but there's more to it.  These people are not eating.  They can't make no money, you know.  They can't survive; it's terrible as hard as they work.  Now if he gets rid of the programs, you know, it probably won't be in my time, but it'll, it's going to hurt.
Speaker 1: Right, but your hopes and concerns about blacks, I mean, what are they?  What are your hopes?
Speaker 2:  	That, that these young, young folks have something to work for.  I mean, first you've got to stop the crime.  You, you, you know, I think it starts back with the, with, with the guns, the gun laws and this, that and the other.  You know the politicians were playing softball and they got shot.  He should be one of them, you know, fighting for this, no guns.  These kids get the guns and then the drugs 'cause they have no money and they go on, and on, and on, it just, it just is a continual cycle.  And, and they move from one place to the other, but, you know, I don't know how Chicago [Illinois] is.  It's--that's, that's, that's like Atlanta [Georgia], you know, it's high crime.
Speaker 1: Chicago, we had seven hundred deaths (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --last year.
Speaker 2: --right.  Jesse's [sic. Yusef Jackson and Jonathan Jackson] still got a Budweiser distributorship.  He's still getting his piece of the pie, yeah.  It's rough, I don't, I don't know.  I don't know how this--look at the college tuitions, look at what is going on there when some other countries give free college tuitions, some of them, or lower t- college tuitions.  These kids can't pay the bills.
Story_ID: 650621
Speaker 1: And then what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2:  	Just that we worked hard and we took care of people.  We gave them a fair price and they helped us grow and helped us live.  I mean you just, just try to--and my grandson, he'll, he'll, he's on.  He's, he's bright and my son [C. Trevor Grimes], they'll, they'll run it, run it [Grimes Oil Company, Inc.].  I'll still be around I hope.  I'm seventy-seven, I mean, it's--and I ain't ready for heaven now (laughter).
Speaker 1: So if you were talking to your son and grandson now, what would you say to them?
Speaker 2:  	Try to, try to be fair, try to take care of your business and help it grow, and, and work hard to get new business because it's--we don't have a lot of companies, not a lot of minorities in this business, at least in our area, Connecticut, you know, you don't have anybody.  You know, you could go to New York [New York] with all the construction, the bridges and this and that, this, this, this worked, so often worked.  You've just got to go chase and set up (unclear), but you bring a package.  If you don't do it you bring it to your supplier, they'll work with you.  They'll carry you.  That's, you've got to, got to build a relationship.

Speaker 1: Now if you were ever to come back again what would you want to do that you haven't done in life?
Speaker 2:  	(Pause) Have more money, just more money, more money you can do more things, more time; work hard come to the Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].  This place is blowing up.  This place is--more black people own homes here than any other site in the country, do you know that?  These boys are coming here and spending money; I mean million, million and a half, $2 million houses.  God bless them.  This is Negro month here you know?  Have you been on Circuit Ave [Circuit Avenue]?  It's a lot of new faces, not that you know everybody, but it, I mean everything is happening here now.  It's like the mecca.  Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has come here and they say he's going to you know--I talked to a realtor up in Shawmut [Boston, Massachusetts] and he's looking at Jackie O's [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] place; not the whole parcel, it's a piece of the parcel, about sixty, seventy acres.  I hope he does come here.  I met him.  He did a fine job with what he had to work with, yeah.  But I'm happy Lee's [Lee V. Anderson] my partner.  She, she's, she's, she's smart.  You know, you've got to get someone smarter than you, you know, that's--I like that.  She guides me, right baby?  Old heart, new start (winks).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, we're ending the interview (laughter).  As he professed love to Lee.
