Speaker 1: --Interviewer [Larry Crowe] today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Observing is Clarice Tibbs.  Ma'am could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Erma L. Clanton, E-R-M-A, Erma, Clanton, C-L-A-N-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what does the L stand for?
Speaker 2: Laverne.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright do you have any nicknames or anything?
Speaker 2: Well, when I work with young people, when I was teaching at the University [of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] and of course they couldn't call me Erma so and they didn't even want to call me Ms. Clanton, so they called me E.C. so that kinda stuck.
Speaker 1: E.C.?
Speaker 2: E.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Memphis, Tennessee and on February 5, 1923 and of course that's a sin to give your age, but that's--that's the date and I am proud of it, blessed.
Speaker 1: Alright, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a retired professor of the University of Memphis, [Memphis] Tennessee.  Actually that's associate professor.
Speaker 1: Okay, professor of?
Speaker 2: Oh theater, theater com- theater and communications arts.
Story_ID: 136709
Speaker 1: Now ma'am, before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions I am compelled to ask you--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, what is my favorite food?  I don't know.  I think chicken.  I really think I eat--I like pasta and chicken.  I like chicken and rice and broccoli, a casserole and when it all boils down--it's interesting because we were out at Clairene--by the way her name is Clairene Tibbs--we were at her birthday party the other night and everybody was ordering different things and I ordered chicken.  They laughed, but I don't know I ordered chicken and pasta salad.  I just like chicken, I really do and I like peach cobbler which as you can see I probably like it too much and I like most of the greens, the greens you know, salads and the turnip greens and I have some friends who are Caucasian who don't understand why I like turnip greens and collards and things like that, but I like them because I have a feeling that they kind of clean you out and I'm just--I kind of grew up on that I like it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a (pause)--alright, now ma'am what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, teal green, the light colors, you know in the, in that area, the rainbow areas, but really and truly everybody thinks I like--that black is my favorite color I wear so much of, but I like black as--after I got larger.  I used to be small as everybody was small when they were younger, but then I do wear a lot of black but I always--black and something.  I like black and white, but in the summertime I just love light colors and the blues, I love the blues--that area, that arena.  And this--I have on today this is gray but it looks like it is light blue, and I love purple.  I love purple.  So I got a lot of colors and they changed.  When I was young it was all blue now, it's purple, it's different colors.
Speaker 1: Okay, well do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year really is spring.  Its spring and I like summertime, but the weather in Memphis [Tennessee] is so hot in the summertime.  In the springtime it's just wonderful here, and I like wintertime simply because I liked--I liked to look at the snow. I look out at it, but the favorite is of course the springtime.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't have much time for vacationing it seems.  Even though I'm retired, I don't do a lot of traveling.  I'm always busy, and I thought that when I retired I would just travel and go to--I still want to go to Italy.  I just want to go to Rome [Italy].  I haven't gone there yet and now my legs are kinda of bad, but that's still one of my dreams.  So, New York [City, New York] is my favorite--and then states, the New York--even more than California.  I love Los Angeles [California], but I stayed in New York.  I worked in New York for eight years when I was in college.  I was in Alabama State, I went to Alabama State College [then State Teachers College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] but in the summertime we would go--a group of us would go to New York and do summer jobs.  I worked at Gimbels as a cashier for eight summers, well actually for four summers and after I graduated I still went back.  Anyway, when I think about it now the interesting thing about that was that the college black girls they had us work as cashiers, but there were white girls who were high school girls, but we had to be in college to work there, but it was an interesting--very, very good summers.  Those summers were wonderful and I fell in love with New York and have gone back to some plays, but I don't get around too much like that now and I like New York.  I like New York.
Speaker 1: Okay (pause).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "To thine own self be true, and it shall follow" ['Hamlet,' Act I, Scene 3, William Shakespeare]--I've forgotten it but I know I can remember it and I glory in the fact that I'm eighty and I can say that I don't remember it all, but "To thine own self be true" and this is what I've lived by you know 'cause if you're not true to yourself you're not gonna be true to anyone else and no one--what you are in the dark is, is what determines your character.  What you are when no one else is around is what really determines your character and I try to remember that.
Story_ID: 136710
Speaker 1: Well, can you tell me something about what you know about your family?  Now, how far back can you trace your family? Do you know about what your family was doing back in the days before--
Speaker 2: A long time ago.
Speaker 1: --the Civil War--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I really am thankful to Alex Haley, although my family didn't do anything.  We all got interested in trying to follow this trail of genealogy and some of the younger nieces and nephews, especially one that was supposed to do that--of course they expected me to do everything but I didn't have the time to do it, but I have a cousin who did some of it and I think what she came up with on my father's [Saul Clanton] side that the Clanton family came out of Great Britain and that there were some, there were some royalty in the family.  I knew the Clanton family from television.  I heard about the Clanton gang, you know, just like the Jesse James, and I said oh my goodness.  I don't know too much other than the fact that my father was a--my grandfather was a farmer and a good one.  They owned a lot of land in Lexington, Tenn- Lexington, Mississippi and my father was a plumber and his brother was a plumber and it's so interesting about that skill that he had of being a plumber.  It is a form of engineering as you know, and he didn't go--and his schooling went as far as the ninth grade his schooling. But he learned the technology and the techniques and the skills of plumbing, but he couldn't--and he worked all over Memphis [Tennessee] but he had to have a man who had a license and this--usually I don't know usually, but this particular man that worked for my--with my father was a Mr. Reuben [ph.].  I remember that name.  I will never forget it.  He was a good man, but he had the license, but my daddy had to be the one--was the one to do the work.
Speaker 1: Now, was it true then in those days a black person could not get a license?
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying.  That's what we were told that he couldn't even get--
Speaker 1: So, Mr. Reuben had a license but--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Mr. Reuben--he was able to go to school obviously and study whatever the techniques were that you needed to know to accomplish and to get the license, but he couldn't go to school to get the license so--but he knew and how--we often thought, how did he know how to put the right pipes together?  How did he know--and on a many of nights cold and freezing he's up--in the day he's under someone's house.  In those days those houses were kind of made, you know you had--you could go under the houses and those pipes would burst and his--and we always had a phone for that reason, always had a telephone even when I was a child back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], and the phone constantly was ringing and you see that it would bring in a lot of money, but he just got just a salary, just a small check as I think now and Mr. Reuben got the check, got the money.  Now today of course, black and white and everybody can go to school for that but he missed out on it and I imagine if he were living today he could probably teach a course on that.
Story_ID: 136711
Speaker 1: You have--are there, there any stories from your family that passed down from slavery or, or the old period at all?
Speaker 2: And the sad part about my family is that I didn't know--we didn't know too much about my mother's [Josephine Smith Clanton] family.  She was from Mississippi also.  I was--we were all born in Memphis [Tennessee], but we knew everything as much as we could about the father--about my father's [Saul Edward Clanton] family because the aunts all came to Memphis and we knew them and my mother had one brother and one sister and they were so wonderful, but I don't know why--my older sister is dead now and I don't know why we don't know anything about my mama's people.  I just don't know, and we think about it all the time.  I say, why didn't we know--I don't even know who her mother was.  It was just nothing on that side of the family that I remember and I think--I just don't really know.  She was very shy, very loveable, very sweet and so was her sister and believe it or not both of them had real long hair.  We didn't get that, we took to daddy's side and they were--they were wonderful people--the uncle--and did well, the uncle and the aunt, both of them.  The aunt married, her sister married a man who was one of the first people in the city to start what they call quartet singing.  His name was Rad, R-A-D, Rad Sanders, and he had--his hair was down his back and he looked like the Ind- an Indian, and so they sang on WREC [Memphis, Tennessee] which is a radio station in the city.  This was years ago and one time they sang something in the presentation that had something to do with politics, something about [Edward Hull] "Boss" Crump, or something they added.  It was a little kind of humorous thing and they took him off the radio, I remember that.  I remember everybody talking about that, but I--no I hate to say this but I don't know much about my mother's side and I--and she died when I was fourteen, so I don't know, I just don't know, but I do more about my father's side.  It was just--he had several sisters and they all belonged to--most of them belonged to the Church of God in Christ [Memphis, Tennessee]--
Story_ID: 136712
Speaker 1: Now what was your father's full name and--
Speaker 2: His name was Saul--
Speaker 1: --And can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: S-A-U-L.
Speaker 1: S-A-U-L, okay.
Speaker 2: Saul Edward Clanton.
Speaker 1: And when was he born and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was born in Lexington [Mississippi] and I had--he died at seventy-three--he died at seventy-three, and he died in 1957, now you figure that out.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't feel like it, but he died at seventy-three years old and my mother [Josephine Smith Clanton] died at forty-five.  She had a stroke and there were eight children--
Speaker 1: So he was born in 1880s, late 1880s I guess?
Speaker 2: See you're smart, yes something like that.
Speaker 1: Now, you say he was a plumber and--
Speaker 2: He was a plumber. He was a real plumber. I mean, all the people in Memphis [Tennessee] today who remember my father always say when they think about me they say, "Oh, Erma I know your father, everybody knew Mr. and Mrs. Saul, did our plumbing--Mr., you know."  They knew him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what sort of personality did he have?
Speaker 2: Humorous, I think that's the word. I'm not a humorous person.  People laugh at me all the time but he was very humorous and really for the little education that he had was quite gifted and wanted to--always talked about education all the time and was quite pleased with the fact that I went to college.  I was the first one in the family to go to college.  He didn't get, he didn't get a chance to enjoy the opportunity of seeing me going into the university in that arena, but he saw me as a teacher and a good teacher, and he had a feeling that I was going to be alright and later on after he died my older sister went to college.  It was later. She went back to college.  She had her degree and that's one of the things that I preach all the time, you know I'm talking to young people, get your education, you know, go to school.  It's getting to be very expensive now but you have to study and you study hard there are all kinds of scholarships out there.  And I can't understand it because it was--we were so poor.  I hear people often say that they were poor but they didn't know they were poor.  We knew we were poor.  I mean (laughter), we knew we were poor, but--and even though he had this little job, I think--that's what made me think that he didn't get his money right, because the little money that he got, we didn't--he would always come home each day from whatever he made that day and we'd have to wait until he got home and he'd bring the groceries with him, you know. We'd wait, "Daddy will be here," and it was bad, but we made it and it was okay and it gave me a chance to kinda appreciate--to appreciate the things I have now 'cause I know from whence I came, and I see a lot of young people not taking advantage of they have so--oh, God they have so much, and I can't understand them not going to--not trying to go to college.  'Cause if I could go, I look like everybody could go.
Story_ID: 136713
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you state her name for us and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, her name is Josephine Smith Clanton, Josephine Clanton.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: J-O-S-E-P-H-I-N-E.  Mrs.--
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Now why would ask (laughter).  She was born the April 28th.  What year?  She died--she died, she died when she was forty-five.  I have to figure that out.  I didn't get that together, but she died when she was forty-five and I do remember that twenty years later he died.  My daddy [Saul Clanton] died.  He lived twenty years after that, and he did remarry but--he married a nice lady and--but she died, the second wife died and then he came to stay with me.  I had my first house.  I was very glad to, to have him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your mother, what was she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: She was, as I said she was a typical mother who loved her children who was a housewife, but she had eight children, there were eight of us, so and we were all two years apart, so as I figured she really didn't have--she really couldn't work in a sense but she did part-time cleaning for the white people in the neighborhood, as a matter of fact it was at one of the homes that she was washing, cleaning out the tub--bath tub that she had a stroke and they--the lady called us and they took her to the hospital and one year later she was--I know from that first stroke she was paralyzed in her left--on her left side.  I remember that so well because I remember her holding her hand and we would just rub her arm for her--just rub, but she lived one year from that stroke and then one year later, one year from that stroke, almost to the day she had another stroke and that one--she died from that one, yes and I was fourteen.  I just--I just--I never forgot, I never--like I--it seemed like the world changed and I know it did you know for me.
Story_ID: 136714
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Seven--there were--now or then? Then there were seven siblings and--
Speaker 1: Where did you fall in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was dead in the middle.  I mean straight in the middle because there were twins in the family and if you count the twins as the number one--as one number then I'm right in the middle.  So there were--let me see, my oldest sister Mattie Mae [ph.], my next to my oldest sister the one [Frances Clanton Knight] that is in Chicago [Illinois] I was telling you about, and then my oldest brother and then--then, I came then, okay, but then so that's number four and then the twins came, and then another sister, the baby girl and a boy so I was right in the middle of that age-wise.
Story_ID: 136715
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Josephine Smith Clanton and Saul Clanton] have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't really remember.  I can only remember that I felt the love that they had for each other.  I just remember that and it wasn't demonstrative at all, but I always knew that my daddy and my mother loved each other so much and he called her Josie and it was just in their eyes and in their action and it was just there, but I didn't--we--it was a little different then.  Like parents, and I'm sure--it may not be different--maybe just in my family.  We just didn't--they didn't talk too much about the old days as they called 'em.  They just didn't.  I wish to God that they had but they didn't.  I think it was because they were so--they were on the road to survival, just trying to just make it that with eight children we talked about a lot of things.  One of the things that they talked about was just, you know moral, moral things, things you just don't do and things you just--one day you're just gonna grow up, and you're gonna be good people and try to go to school and try to get an education. We're doing the best that we can, and remember you all are blood, you are sisters and brothers.  All of you are sisters and brothers.  There are no half-sisters, no half-brothers.  Nothing wrong with that but they just emphasized that you all are whole sisters, whole brothers and you all take care of each other.  That, I remember that kind of thing, I don't remember them saying, talking about how they met.  I just don't remember that, and my memory is pretty good, but I just don't remember.  I don't remember that.
Story_ID: 136716
Speaker 1: Can you give us an idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can and feelings also.  We had a blueberry--no, dewberry's what they called 'em, dewberry vine in our yard on Orleans Street [Memphis, Tennessee].  We lived on Orleans, called 1088 South Orleans.  Actually, we most of us were born when we lived on Ford Street [Memphis, Tennessee], but then we moved when I was six years old.  I was six. We moved on Orleans Street and on this street there were mostly teachers and around the corner was [HM Reverend] Benjamin Hooks, he lived on the street and most of the teachers that taught at the school LaRose High--LaRose Elementary School [Memphis, Tennessee] lived on Edith [Street, Memphis, Tennessee] which was right around the corner, and on the streets they had Pullman porters, which in those days that was a good job, you know and we had professional people in that time.  Now, we're talking about in the '30s [1930s], '20s [1920s] and '40s [1940s] you know, well not the '40s [1940s], by the '40s [1940s] I had gone off to college, but I can remember that in the--this I guess--I said spring but summer was good too when I was growing up.  In the summertime school was out, so it was--that was really my favorite time, and we used to--it was my job it seemed to go out and pick the dewberries and I would love to bring them in to the house in a basket to my mom [Josephine Smith Clanton], and she always--and I hadn't thought about it but I remember her telling somebody, she said "Erma is the one that looks after me," and you know and to me dewberries--we got it in our backyard, that's something and everybody didn't have that.
Speaker 1: Now what is a dewberry?
Speaker 2: A dewberry--
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't know, I know I don't know--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, it's very much akin to the blackberry, the--yeah the blueberry was--the blueberry--they called them dew--and I to this day wonder were they, did they get it mixed up.  Were they trying to say blueberry, but--they were called dewberries.  That's what they were calling them--calling them.  So I'm sure that somebody in hearing this will check it out and they know--they will probably know about it, but that's--that was the name of the vine, the dewberry vine, and they are small and very sweet and they were very dark, just like, just like the blackberry and we actually had to--
Speaker 1: Kind of like a mulberry or something--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --different from a mulberry?
Speaker 2: I would think so, I would think so, and we also, not in our yard but up the street there was another fruit tree. I can't think of the name of it--I can't think of the name of it, but when you eat it if it wasn't really ripe, it would sort of turn sour in your mouth.  I can't think of the name of that, like a plum, but it's not a plum, that'll come to me.
Speaker 1: A musket?
Speaker 2: I can't think of the name of this fruit and the--all the children would like to eat, but it was a real edible, well-known, you don't hear from it now, I don't hear anybody talking about it now, and of course people had peach trees in the neighborhood, peach trees, not apple, but had peach trees and you had dewberry vines and so that was some of the things I remember and as far as the feelings, when my mother was living our house always, always felt you know, very comfortable.  In the summertime, it was a big house, didn't have air conditioning, but we had the little fans you know, and it was always comfortable 'cause when we were children it just didn't seem this hot to me. We'd play outside, but when she died, even though she died in the wintertime--rather in the springtime--it felt like wintertime.  It was always cold.  I just always remember that.  It just, the house just was cold from them on, and it was just something that--a feeling that I always had and I still kind of stay cold, but I keep my hair on (laughter), and as far as sounds, there was always the laughter and children running through the house, but I don't remember my mother hollering at us like a lot of parents do today, and I often think about that, I say, it looks like we made a lot of noise, but I don't remember her screaming and saying things that some of the young parents say to their children now.  She said, "Okay now, y'all go outside if you gone keep on making all that noise," and she was very low key and--but I don't think we were as, as you know robust--you know robust as these kids are, I don't know, but that was the sound and at night time we would read and say a lot of poetry.  All of us liked poetry, kinda weird except the boys they didn't.  We would have contests, and my sister [Frances Clanton Knight], the one that's in Chicago [Illinois], the one that I'm going to see now, she was really, really smart.  She had to wash the dishes, it was her time to wash the dishes and we were smaller or younger than she and so she'd have us to pay her, our little pennies to come in to see her.  She--I'm put on a show and we actually went, we was give her what little pennies we had and so she said, "Well now in order to see this show you all gotta help me dry the dishes and then soon as we get these dishes washed we can see the show," and so true enough we would take the dishes and we would dry them and put 'em up for her and then she would take the spoons and the spoons would dance and she would sing and the spoons would dance and the knives would dance, and that was our show (laughter).  After that I always think about the story of Tom Sawyer, now she tricked us into doing that.  It was a fun house.
Story_ID: 136717
Speaker 1: Let, let me ask you about school, and where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to LaRose Elementary School [Memphis, Tennessee].  LaRose, two words [sic].
Speaker 1: L-A--?
Speaker 2: Capital L-A, capital R-O-S-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and well, how'd you like school and what was your favorite part of school?
Speaker 2: Well, back in the '30s [1930s] school wasn't too good.  They taught well, the teachers knew what they were talking about and they taught us well, but you--when I lived in such a segregated world until going to school, I didn't see the difference.  There were teachers who really made a difference in the color of the children that they chose to favor, and it didn't bother me too much at that time but I--I've always thought about--all I was thinking my whole life was when I grow up.  When I grow up what I wanted to be and who I wanted to be like, or what, you know, I was--always thought about that and I didn't get that--that nurturing and that embracing of you are somebody, you are a beautiful child, I didn't get that in elementary school at all and, but I soon, I soon--I wasn't in elementary school long-
Story_ID: 136718
Speaker 1: Finally, I was in high school, well it was eight years but--before I left [LaRose Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee] I, I'd had won over s- teachers who, who saw something in me and--and that was as it should be, but by this time I had already been hurt, you know, by some of them, but I was--got to high school--when I--at the high school I went to Booker T. Washington High School here in Memphis, Tennessee.  I guess they have one everywhere, do they not?  Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: A lot of schools, students, yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was--in that day we only had two schools, two high schools for blacks, that was Booker T. Washington and Manassas [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] and you heard that from [HM] Isaac [Hayes] yesterday, right?  He went to Manassas High School.  In high school the tea--I got along fine with the students, you know, I was--you know I always--I had friends, I always had friends.  When I got to Booker T. Washington I was voted for the president of my ninth grade, my individual ninth grade class, and--and it's a little different.  You had teachers that, that also made differences in that--that--we'd be in that color thing again, they were--believe it or not I'm--you may not realize it but that really did happen, but by the same time there was this woman that--who's dead, but who really saved my life in a sense.  Her name was Lucie Campbell. She was a great writer, a Gospel writer.  In any Baptist book you can open up a hymnal and you'll see her.  Her music, 'He'll Understand and Say Well Done,' [sic, 'He Understands; He'll Say, Well Done'] 'Something Within,' she wrote those songs, and she lived up the street from me.  As I lived around--the good part about my life was where I lived.  I lived around those people, good people, professional people who said--who was proud of the Clanton family.  They said that the Clanton girls, the Clanton children were good girls 'cause none of us at that time went out and had babies.  That was the main thing they watched and when my momma [Josephine Smith Clanton] died that was the first thing they watched.  You got six girls down there, no mama, you know, they gon' watch that, and then Erma's gonna to go to college and that was something and they knew that we were poor people and they helped us and so, but in high school Lucie Campbell helped me.  She just encouraged me so and she took me on conventions and she helped--she said I had a very good strong voice. She put me in oratorical contests and then there was Nat D. Williams who was a DJ [disc jockey] and also a teacher, wonderful man and he saw something in me and he--I said when I go to college, you know all the children they don't realize--I said, "I want to go to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee]" (laughter), no money, and he said, "No, you don't want to go to Fisk," and you know Fisk was kind of known for the fair skin all that kind of thing in that day and he said, "You want to go somewhere like Alabama.  Go to school in Alabama or Georgia and they will embrace you, and you know you have the personality and you have a gift for speaking and for writing. That's where you need to go."  I said--and the truth of it I didn't have any money to go anywhere--
Story_ID: 136719
Speaker 1: But by the time I got to the twelfth grade [at Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] I had been known as a speaker and as a writer and my homeroom teacher, Mr. Jeddy Springer [ph.], when they offered an opportunity for young people to speak--to get into this contest. It was called the Elks Oratorical Contest.  Actually, I really wasn't chosen--they said men, they said boys and I heard--I was sitting in the front row and I heard the announcer when he came through so I asked him could I go too to try out.  He said, "Well, they only said two, but you can go," and I went into the auditorium and there were about at least a hundred people in there, and so they listened to all of them, and so one teacher said, "Well who is that lady? Who is that young girl sitting out there?"  So I said, "Well I'm from whatever twelfth--whatever class of five--twelve" (unclear), I can't remember, but anyway I said then, "Well Mr. Springer said that I could try out" and they looked at each other and so they let me try out, so I tried out and I recited 'Thanatopsis,' by William Cullen Bryant, I think that's the name of it, 'Thanatopsis,'--"So live, that when thy summons comes to", you know and I said it in such a way that they were impressed and the fact that I guess I--we had to learn it that I knew it I guess, so when they had the callback, I was one of the callbacks, and so it got down from one hundred to like twenty-five, and I was in there, and it got down to the ten I was there, got down to three, I was in it--I was still in it.  So finally I was the one to represent the--Memphis [Tennessee], went to Chattanooga [Tennessee]--I won for the state, then went to Chattanooga for the regional and the teachers that took me there were young teachers and they took me to a boarding house and they left.  I will not call their names even though they are not living, and they left me there in the boarding house and they didn't come back until seven, the thing started at seven, and when they came I was hungry and I was tired and some other things that happen to girls once a month, and I was there by myself and I--it was terrible.  When I got to--when I got to the church the fifteen contestants--the fourteen contestants were there and they'd all had picked their numbers and so I was the fifteenth contestant, and nervous and feeling very, you know how I must've been feeling.  They stopped at the drug store and all that kinda thing, and I spoke.  The Negro and the Constitution was my subject, and I won second place and the little girl who won first place was in the ninth grade and she was a doll. She was cute as she could be.  So the president [Harper Councill Trenholm, Sr.] of Alabama State University [then State Teachers College, Montgomery, Alabama] was the director of this contest.  So after it was over you know my tears was just flying, I had no way to go to college and I felt it wasn't my fault that they had done me this way, but he told me he wanted me to come to his school, that he had a work scholarship and he said, "You really was the best. You should have won but I'm not--I was not the judge, and you know the decision of the judges is final."  I never will forget those words and people were coming to me and just--just I didn't know.  I was in Chattanooga they were just telling me, "You were really good. You were the best."  I went to Alabama State from that--from that contest (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: So they gave you like a work scholarship.
Speaker 1: They gave me a work scholarship.  I worked my way, and that's why I can't understand why students can't go to college, and maybe it's not like that now, but I worked--
Story_ID: 136720
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school [at Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] though, did you graduate with honors (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I graduated, not with high honors.  Just--I was just an ordinary student.  I was not--I think I was--what I know now is that I was nervous and scared all the time.  I didn't--I really had self, low self-esteem.  I really didn't think that I could do, because--and in grade school [at LaRose Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee] I was kinda, I was not encouraged and I was not, as I said, I was not nurtured, and actually, I was really afraid, and the reason I--the reason I know that was a problem was when I got to college [at State Teachers College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], some of the things that I didn't get the A's in, I began to get the A's in college and I'd have to have some background.  So, but when I went to college, they the whole, that was in Memphis, Tennessee and in Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama, there was--I was the only one there from Memphis, Tennessee with the exception of a man who worked there.  I remember he called me his homie, you know, he took care of me, watched me and everything, and so and then the president [Harper Councill Trenholm, Sr.], the word had gotten out that the president had given me this scholarship and that I knew him and he knew me and so I was kinda special, and so I started making good grades, and they put me on the debating team and that was one of the things that I had to do, and--and I--in my last year there I remember from working in the dining hall from being a waitress in the dining hall, I became the person that rang the bell and said the blessings, said the grace (laughter), but I didn't mind it because I had--I stayed down there in the summertime and I worked and got some of my time and that's how I got through, through school and cause we're talking about a long, long time ago when money was so scarce and people just didn't have money to send you to school, but I was determined.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of your mentors at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: At Alabama State.
Speaker 1: Alabama State.
Speaker 2: Although Tuskegee was one of my favorite schools too, but we, see--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, that's okay because--it's just, it's not even hardly twenty minutes away.  It's as they say, it's up the road kind of, but it's not far from Alabama State.  They do, they do associate with each other, the two schools, and of course, during that time, during 1940s this is '40 [1940]--
Speaker 1: (Unclear), (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes it is, yes it is, but in 1945 well actually in 1941 is when the War [World War II, WWII] took the men--this is the bad part, when I first got there, there were all these people, all these wonderful men and women from everywhere, Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], everywhere, and then they had to be--they were called into the [military] service, and we had gotten a chance to meet them, just meet them and they were in our class and I often think that--that there was one reason--that's where my husband went probably 'cause you know, one of things you do--you wanna to do is meet your husband in college.  That's the thing you do, so there were nobody left on the campus hardly, but it was almost like an all-female--which--not co-ed anymore except the so-called Four F's--they called them Four F's then, and they had Maxwell Field [Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama] which was Alpha Alabama, Alpha Montgomery and those soldiers would come cover.  They allowed the soldiers to come over and then Tuskegee guys would come.  Now, we did have a lot of friends.  I met several friends from Tuskegee who came down to Alabama State, but that, that was, to me though it was one of the best times of my life actually going to school, going to college.
Story_ID: 136721
Speaker 1: And so my mentors in high school [at Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee] or in college [at State Teachers College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in college, yeah.
Speaker 1: In college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause you, you talked about some, some of them in high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did but in college there was, well Mr. Wheeler [ph.] for one. He was from Memphis [Tennessee] and he just sort of looked after me.  He had been there I guess at least five years before me, and then of course, there was Mr. Pierce [ph.], he was a good--he was one of my--Mr. Lockhart [ph.], and what is the English teacher's name that everybody--oh, she was the English teacher.  She would come into the room, she was very comical.  I can't think of--Ms.--oh, I can't think of her name, but she would come into the room with an umbrella sometimes.  The umbrella would be up and, well what's-- Donnie--Donoghue--what's her name?  But we would say, "Well, what's going on?"  "It's just raining ignorance in here, it's raining ignorance in here" (laughter), and she, "you don't know anything," and--she would do that, and she--but we got--we learned under her you know.  She was really, really, really funny, but in the long run she--her whole interest was to get us to pay attention to more--to our English and to what we knew about reading and language arts and all that kind of thing.  But one of the things that I enjoyed about Alabama State [University], I didn't know it until now, was the fact that we had what is called a music appreciation hour.  Every Sunday afternoon we had to go into Tullibody Auditorium and listen to music, and the music was classical music and we--oh, we made fun, we had jokes and all. We said everything you know about this and that.  And we had to come back to class the next day and write an essay on what we--there were certain questions.  There were questionnaires what we were supposed to be listening for, but what it did to me was to give me the strangest and the deepest appreciation of that kind of music and especially the spirituals.  They played those kind--they played spirituals, classical, opera, you know the whole story line, and today I--you know I am the strange person that likes a certain kind of music.  I like gospel music of course, but I also like classical music and I love spirituals, you know, and I like to know--I like to hear about the history of the stories. I like the stories, and that came from that appreciation, that music appreciation and everybody who knows the plays that I do, they know that they'll always will get some spirituals and also some classical music.  Just last year, was it last year, I think it was, I gave something called 'The Other Side of Soul,' because 'Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes, & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] was so popular and we know what that's all about, but I kept saying there's another side of soul, you know we all--we aren't all about the blues and gospel music and spirituals, there's another side of us, and so I finally got that off my chest and I did that, and I used Mr. Oliver Sueing from Atlanta, Georgia who is a professional tenor and his sister joined him, Andrea Richardson who's in Memphis [Tennessee] who is a very beautiful classical soprano, high soprano and they joined together, the two of them joined together with a group that one of my, one of my proteges Reginald Gaston put together and it turned out to be wonderful, very wonderful.
Story_ID: 136722
Speaker 1: So at Alabama State [University, then State Teachers College, Montgomery, Alabama], you know things were working out pretty well?  Did you--did you--you were majoring in speech?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--really I majored in English.
Speaker 1: English.
Speaker 2: I majored in English and well in--you know in college in those days you--that was the luxury subjects like theater.  I don't even know that they even had it, but they did have art appreciation or something like that, but my--you know they wouldn't think about it, I don't think then letting students just go out into the world majoring in--cause the thing was, "Well what are you going to teach?" you know.  So I majored in English and I think I minored in social studies, but always as an avocation, I always liked drama and poetry and music. That was just always me.  Even from a child, you know, played games.  A little friend of mine next door, her mother had a big house, her grandmother had this big house and this--and it had a huge hall in the center and she had her curtains in between it.  There was a big--there was curtains up there, and we would go over there and those curtains--the curtains did something to me.  We would open those curtains and we--I was always the director, always and we'd have, we'd have our own little programs, our own little shows and I was eight, nine, ten years old, and I was reminded of that through this friend of mine whose name is Thelma Caslin-Busch [ph.] and she reminded me that I did that.  Said, "You know you used to come over to our house--our home and we used to have plays and you used to draw that curtain."
Story_ID: 136723
Speaker 1: People watching this tape may not realize it but earlier in the century, end of the 19th century, public speaking was an art--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: It was cultivated.
Speaker 2: It certainly was.
Speaker 1: It was high art and--
Speaker 2: Well, you look at Julius Caesar--yeah, that's what they had, that's what--that's what it was all about.
Speaker 1: That was the entertainment.
Speaker 2: That was the entertainment for them.
Speaker 1: For many, as well as the educated, you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly, and even in the, even in the '40s [1940s] they had--that's why they would--it seems to me everybody was just completely overwhelmed with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], the late Martin Luther King, Jr., and it wasn't--but to me I was accustomed to that kind of speaking 'cause we had orations and oratorical contests and--but now we don't do it.  We don't really do it, not like we should.  Our children, our children speak--I don't know what they're speaking, it's not oratorically, and I think it's because we don't--we don't push that anymore.  As a matter of fact when I was teaching speech even in the late years in high school, the books told us, and this is the truth and it brings into focus one of my dear friends who's a preacher, who's a minister in Atlanta [Georgia], Reverend Jasper--Jasper Williams [Jr.]. He was a minister, was a preacher when he was a little boy really, so I was teaching speech from, according to the way the books told me and they were saying that the book said that, all your speeches nowadays should be not so stiff, not so preach like, preaching like and certainly not in an oratorical way. That your speeches should be natural like you're in a conversation.  That's how you should come across to your audience, talking to them like you're talking in a conversation.  So I'm reading from the book and I'm teaching it that way and so when he is giving his speech, who is--he's a natural-born preacher, he's giving his speech even if it's on, and I forgot what it was on, but anyway he was giving his speech and he was more or less preaching, and so I told him, I said, "Jasper, you can't preach it. You have to just say it naturally.  You have to say it as (laughter) according to the book," and he told me, he said, "Ms. Clanton, I know you mean well," he said, "but one day I'm going to be a preacher and I got to do it the way I understand it," and I said, "Okay, you say it like you"--and he says I gave him a C but I don't think I did.  I went to visit him in Atlanta one time and he told me in front of all of his--or told the people, "My teacher's here and I want her to stand up."  He had me standing up, "And I want you to know that she gave me a C because she said I didn't know how to speak," and the whole congregation looked around, oh (laughter). He was telling the whole story, but he is a wonderful, wonderful excellent speaker.  He has tapes and everything out, yes.
Speaker 1: They say it's a different--I think black people in this country, tell me what your opinion is, seem to cling to the older style of public speaking--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the ministers do.
Speaker 1: And you can even see it in the political candidates when [HM] Jesse Jackson was running for president--
Speaker 2: That's true. That's true.
Speaker 1: I mean his speech--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: I think overpowered the others.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: I mean cause (unclear) really they sounded very flat by comparison to him--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That is really true.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) he sounded over the top to others, I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: Well, well, they consider--and then as you say in the black community you are not a great speaker unless you do come out of that class, that particular school and for goodness sakes you can't read it, they want you to know it from memory you know, and that's what they did, but the books say the correct way to do the speeches is to do it extemporaneously and to have your notes, not to--to be free from the page though, be free from the page, not to look at the--not to look--not to read the speech.  Now you can give a manuscript speech, 'cause after all, what do you think the president does?  You know his has to be manuscript because he can't afford to say it extemporaneously because everything he says has to be documented.  I can understand that, but we do demand that our speakers, that our preachers especially, he wasn't good if he didn't just say it from memory.  He didn't just say it and expound it, that's how we like it you know.  I think that's a racial--I mean a cultural thing, I really do, and it probably did come from a long time ago and we never did get rid of it.
Story_ID: 136724
Speaker 1: When did you graduate from Alabama State [University, then State Teachers College, Montgomery, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: In 1945.
Speaker 1: Forty-five, [1945] okay, and what did you plan to do, just teach school at that time.
Speaker 2: That's at that time.  Yeah, but even in my mind then I wanted to work in the neighbor- maybe in church or in some kind of theater arena, even then.
Speaker 1: And there was no theater at Alabama State?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had theater in--they had plays and it was theater I guess you'd call it.
Speaker 1: Did you get involved in it?
Speaker 2: I got involved in it just as a participant, just as a participant, maybe had a small part, you know, but--cause it wasn't really--it wasn't a lot going on you know, and they had a young teacher who came in I think, and by this time, by the time they got--by the time they implemented it I was going out, you know I was getting ready to graduate so I didn't get a chance to do very much but I was glad.  I know what I should have done as I look back, I should have tried to organize a dramatic theater group, but I was so busy working with the--I was over the--it was the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and they combined the men with the women.  They called it the Christian Associate--both of them were together--what they call that--it meant the College Christian Association, but that's not exactly what they called it but they had people from New York coming down and put it together.  I was president of that too.  So I was so busy trying to just do that--do what I was supposed to do with that organization I didn't want to get too involved, and I didn't get into the sorority because I was president when I was in ninth grade--first year there of those inclined Delta [Sigma Theta].  I was the little president of they called the "TIDs" and my sisters who was trying to help me go to school told me that, "You know we can't send--you can't go down there and get in a sorority.  That's too much money," and so I just kinda forgot that, but when I came out of the university out of school, I did join Zeta Phi Beta Sorority.
Story_ID: 136725
Speaker 1: 1945 is the end of World War II [WWII] and you're out of school [at State Teachers College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] and, and you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you came back to Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Came back to Memphis and just glad to be, be home and I was called--my principal called me.  He had already told me that, "Now if you go to school Sister President," that's what he called me. This is Mr. Jeddy Springer [ph.], the late Mr. Jeddy Springer.  He said, "I guarantee you you'll get a job, you'll get a job teaching."  "Yes sir, I believe that," and so, but I had no idea it was going to be that soon and I did get a job, not in September--like in--I got a job like in October of '45 [1945], and so I was pretty young and usually they weren't hiring them that young, they hired 'em, but you have to do sub first.  They called it substitute teaching.  I didn't get a chance to do hardly--I think I subbed one day, and I didn't sub and I was teaching, and I've been teaching ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what school was it that you were talking about?
Speaker 2: This was Melrose High School [Memphis, Tennessee], and it was in a community called Orange Mound [Memphis, Tennessee] which is a community all in itself, very unique.  Every--the unique thing about Orange Mound was that people--back in those days, people owned homes you know.  They might have been shotgun homes, but they were theirs. They were their homes. And they were parents who told the teachers, "If my child does anything wrong, you have my permission to get him," you know, and it was doing that kind of thing, so we had no problem with the children.  What we call bad at that time would be considered angel today, (laughter), you know, now it was--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Did most of the children have parents at home?
Speaker 2: Most of them had parents.
Speaker 1: Both parents?
Speaker 2: And the parents--yeah, most had both parents, but do you mean did the parents work, no you meant were they home?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) were they--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, most of them--most of those kids--most of those--as I remember that was the unique thing about it, most of them had came out of homes that had both parents.  Orange Mound is really--it's today it's still a unique community.  They had their own--they had churches out there, they had a movie out there, they had a little shopping center.  In fact, I used to get after them about that you know.  Don't stay in Orange Mound all the time, come on out into the outer world to the bigger Memphis, and I did everything that I could to encourage them and they did come, you know to come into the other parts of the city and--but that's why I think they are so close today, they still have--Orange Mound is probably the only--Melrose [High School] is probably the only school who has reunions, class reunions to this--every class has a class reunion, and then they have the mass reunion where everybody comes and they're having one this year.  They have fifty year reunions, they have, they have all kinds of reunions. They stick together.  It's a very, very interesting and unique community.
Story_ID: 136726
Speaker 1: Okay, in New York [City, New York] there--from school, you know, there were students who didn't go to Alabama State [University, then State Teachers College, Montgomery, Alabama] but they were college students and we got the idea that you can't find anything in Memphis [Tennessee] to do, so we wanted to go to New York anyway.  We were grown now, you know, so we went to New York and got a room. Wasn't an apartment.  Someone knew one lady and she had a nice house and so she rented us the room and--
Speaker 2: Where was it, was it in--
Speaker 1: Where was the house--the--where was it?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, in New York. Was it in Harlem [New York, New York] or---
Speaker 1: It was in Harlem.  It was in Harlem.  It was--I used to know the address so well, oh, even to the apartment number.
Speaker 2: So you were close to the American Negro Theatre [Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: I was close to it, and the lady that we stayed with was--played in the first black musical--something about blackbirds--something about blackbirds ['Blackbirds of 1928'].  She was one of the singers and she talked about it all the time.  So she was in theater so that was good, and she talked about--and so she told us about, you know, the theater--the black theater and was going to take us one day, but she didn't, but we were just walking with some guys and they showed us--we didn't--I didn't ever get a chance to go, but I did go to Broadway to see a couple of shows and how I went there--after I had gone to New York, I guess--I started going my second year in college I think it was, and by the third year there, I just kept on talking about--talking about Columbia [University, New York, New York], but then I just wanted to go on the campus, and we went on the campus and I just--oh, this is where I want to be and then my--when I graduated from Alabama State, I was still going to New York and I just enrolled for summer class and was accepted.  Yeah, I was I really surprised I was accepted to go to Columbia University.  I went there that--got I think six hours of credit (laughter) and I took it in theater and it was a foreign girl there and the rest of them were--I was the only black person in that class in this theater class.  That's kind of strange because, you know, so many people in New York I always thought liked theater, but anyway in this particular class the teacher told us to, and he was nice.  He told us to do a fight scene, and he said, everybody pick partners, but by this time they kind of knew each other, I think.  So this girl who was a foreign young lady, looked--she looked Mexican or but I knew she was not Caucasian.  I knew she was from some other country, but--some other culture I should say, and so the two of us--he put us together and so we got to fight.  She had long hair and I had never been in a fight scene before, and so he had given us--had given us the background who we were supposed to do and so we talked about it and we said what we was going to do and got involved in it and actually we didn't do anything we said we was going to do, but I started pulling her hair and then it was--and then we--but it was in acting, it wasn't--we weren't angry or anything, and then she pushed me down, I pulled her up and everybody started applauding you know and (laughter) and he said, "Now you take this couple"--he used us as an example and he said it was very good and that kind of gave me a little lift you know because I was really thinking, you know, I'm not going to do well, you know, I just had all those--all kind of crazy ideas.
Story_ID: 136727
Speaker 1: But, but after that in this class [at Columbia University, New York, New York], one of the requirements was that we were supposed to go to see a Broadway play as a group, as a class and the play we went to see was 'Tea and Sympathy,' which is really an old play but a very good play, and you may not have heard of it.  The name of it is--I mean the star I think was Deborah Kerr, some people say "Carr" but I always say Kerr, and it was about--you may have heard of it, the movie.  She was the wife of the schoolmaster of a all-boys school, and the boys in the school wanted to give a play, and the play they selected to give it was a--they needed a girl, they needed somebody to play a girl.  So the guy they selected to play the girl sort of had, they thought you know, had tendencies toward being gay.  And, so he, you know, in order to be with the in-crowd he played this role of being a girl and so after he played the role of being the girl they started teasing him and so Deborah [Kerr], the matron--the wife of the master--that was her role to give the guys tea and sympathy.  Whenever they had a problem they would come to her but she was very pretty, very young and so anyway she heard about how this young man was being condemned and treated by his colleagues, and so she told him to come up to her room and they would talk about it, and so--and he did and so she was saying, you know--and he'd come up there and he would talk--she would--several times and she said, "There's nothing wrong with you."  He said, "Sometimes I think maybe I do have those tendencies because you know, maybe I am," and she said, "Oh, no, no there is nothing wrong with you.  You're letting your friends get to you and you shouldn't do that, you shouldn't do that, you know you're all right," and so he said, "Well and the girls won't look at me."  So, anyway long story short, she had an affair with him.  She had a sexual affair with him, and the purpose of it, of course of the play was to prove to him that he was not a gay guy and I never will forget the words, the lines that she said, and she said, "And when you talk about this, and you will in years to come, please be kind," and I just always remembered that you know, and you could hear a pin drop and it was--everything was so quiet, and so we--as a class from Columbia [University, New York, New York] we could go back stage and talk to her, and so I know the question that I asked her was, when it's so quiet in that last scene, you know, how did it make her feel.  Did she sense the same quietness that we did and she said, "Oh yes, oh yes every night it's the same way," when she says these lines, you know, 'cause you know what's happening.  So that was an experience.  I talked to at that time a live movie star you know, and I was at Columbia and I was seeing a Broadway play so that was--that was good for me and from them on I just liked theater, always did you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 136728
Speaker 1: So, well you didn't get a chance to like see any of the black theater [in New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I didn't get to see any black theater.  Somehow during that time the lady that we stayed with, she was--the lady was more interested in just Broadway plays and we were kinda--we still were young, and we didn't know how to just get around and go too many places.  This guy showed us where this black theater was for (simultaneous), and I don't even know where anything was going on at that time though.
Speaker 1: It was in the library I think, the Countee Cullen Library there [New York Public Library, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Well I know he told us just where, but we didn't--we never did go and I never heard too much emphasis on it.  I never heard--people weren't saying you know, let's go. I didn't hear that like I do now.  Most--everybody was talking about go to Broadway, go to Broadway, Broadway.
Speaker 1: Now did you hear much about the black stage--
Speaker 2: Renaissance?
Speaker 1: --actors in those days like Richard B. Harrison and other people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I just knew about it because we had done a lot of reading about him and I've even before when I was at Columbia [University, New York, New York], I just kept up with the black--well now you know Paul Robeson was also one of the ones that I wanted to just see on Broadway and had an opportunity to see him thank God at Tuskegee [Institute, later, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in person, but I wanted to see people--
Speaker 1: Now that was while you were at Alabama State [University, then State Teachers College, Montgomery, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: That was at Alabama State.  We went--Alabama State students went to Tuskegee to this concert which was--
Speaker 1: Paul Robeson, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--this--
Speaker 1: Well tell us about that.  What was Paul Robeson like?  Did you get a chance to meet him?
Speaker 2: I didn't get a chance to really meet him because we had to get back on the bus. I'm sure the Tuskegee kids did, but to--see all my life I'd heard of us.  In black history--at that time, we called it Negro history.  That's all we heard. It was Paul Robeson, George Washington Carver, you know Booker T. Washington, these were the heroes, these were--and Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, these were the people we knew most about and here I am at a school just right down the street so to speak from the university where George Washington Carver is a scientist, and we went over on a tour again to Tuskegee and we met--he had his white apron on just a ordinary little man, and we met him and he didn't shake our hands. He was busy.  He kinda ignored us, not really ignored us but he was busy and I never--my heart stood still that was George Washington Carver.  I'd read about him and anybody I'd read about to me, and then they come to life--I meet 'em to me at that stage in my life 'cause I'm still reaching toward my goals, you know I wanted to be somebody, I wanted to meet people who were somebody and I met George Washington Carver that meant a lot to me and then we went to the concert.  A lot of the kids in the dorm didn't want to go to Paul Robeson: "I don't wanna go hear."  I just couldn't wait to go to hear him you know and it was--it was just wonderful.  No, I didn't get a chance to meet him because we had to get back on the bus and get back on campus, but that was a good thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about it, the kind of music that Paul Robeson was engaged in was not the popular music during the day.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't but that voice you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the big band music was the popular music of those days.
Speaker 2: And then his life story is so interesting.  Every time I--every chance I see--get a chance to hear about him or see or read about him and I read so much about him. It just inspires me you know and I understood why he left America. I really do you know and--but that's just the way it was then, and he was one of my favorites.

Speaker 1: Well back in Melrose [High School, Memphis, Tennessee], let me take--jump back to Melrose.  Now you are teaching high school in Melrose High School in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Twenty-four years in Orange Mound [neighborhood, Memphis, Tennessee].  Orange Mound, Tennessee (laughter). Orange Mound community.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, what are some of the highlights of your experience at Orange Mound?  Did--were you able to start some theater in that--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well actually I had a principal, bless his soul, that didn't really--he didn't appreciate theater.  He thought it was play.  He called it play and--but I think about it what I did do in order to do it and now I even get a little frightened, but we were slipping and having rehearsals and the janitors, the teachers liked me and the janitors liked me and you know and they liked the children and we would have rehearsals at night and he didn't know it and he just didn't--he just say--didn't have time for that it's junk--just you know, but it was not you know, and finally as time went on he kinda--they--I was a member of--by being a speech teacher and an English teacher because they had invest--they had somehow implemented speech in the curriculum by this time and I was an English teacher so he told me that I had to teach speech, and he didn't know why--I don't need speech--English is speech--you don't, you know, but that was good because they had--when they got ready to have their meetings their little seminar meetings or whatever the speech teachers came from mostly the white schools and as--the few little people who taught speech it was just about one or two of us and so I, you know was one of the ones who got with some other teachers, black teachers and went to the board and saw that we put it in our classrooms and that's how we really you know--cause they had speech/English and he said, "Put your emphasis on English" and which we did put English--put emphasis on English but it is just as important.  See the difference is what people don't understand is that we teach our children English--they don't do it too much now I don't think the way we did it. They don't understand that children need to know and I'm not good at it because I talk fast and you know, but I know it you know.  I know what I'm supposed to say.  I know how it's supposed to be done, but children need to know.  For an example, you're talking to children and they're singing a song or you're telling them to sing like 'Joy to the World' and if you listen to them what they're saying is "joy to the worl" and then you never hear the "d."  You hear the W-R-L, "joy to the wrl," you never hear "joy to the world." You don't hear the "d's" and you're also talking to them and you don't know--they don't realize that there is a difference in sounds of words, articulation.  For an example, you'll say, "What's the difference between T-I-N and T-E-N," and they say no difference.  They say "ten." It's just "ten"--"ten" you know, and you try to--no, no "T-I-N" is a piece of metal and it's pronounced with an -i sound so it becomes "tin" and "ten" is a number a numeral you know and it's -eh sound, so -eh and -ah is different.  You say, "Tin that is T-I-N. That's tin. T-E-N is ten," and, but even the principals didn't know so I'm out here by myself talking about this you know and M-A-N-Y, M-A-N-Y, they say "many."  M-A-N-Y is not "many" that is M-I-N-Y. It's "many," and it's--little things like that that makes a difference in your speech and I'm telling them you know and you take all--and don't say anything about the "ngs," "ing" which is phonetically is "ng."  You never hear the "g." You never hear the "ng."  I'm tellin--they spell it "t-e-l-l-i-n." You never hear the "ing" the "ing" sound so that's what I would do.  I tried to show them in speech, that's what we did in speech was to deal with the articulation of the sound and make them conscious of it and once they are conscious of it--my grandchildren now.  I have--I adopted a child and she has two children and they're four and nine years old and for instance the oldest, he's four--he's nine--he's ten now, he's actually ten and he knows, you know--he's--'cause I'll say--he'll say something and I'll say--and I'll repeat the word and then he'll--that's the only way you'll get them to be conscious of--then once you hear it then you start listening and the people who murder that more than anybody I know, I hate to say this, really are our ministers. They don't really--you know they--'cause after all what they'll say is well you--that's not important.  I heard a man the other day say, "Education is not important," you know. You wanted the word "God" that tells you want to say and actually God does, I believe that, but I think he wants--I think he wants the best.  I think God deserves the best and there's so many things that they say 'cause you're up there and you are in control. When you are the leader of a group of people, you would be surprised at how you--the kind of effect you have on people and especially young people and if you're saying things that--and they're listening, they're listening all the time and so when children--early on when children were coming--growing up and they--integration came and the white teachers would listen to them and they had no idea what they were saying.  They didn't have a clue.
Story_ID: 136730
Speaker 1: There's an example from Chicago [Illinois] if I just interject this--a teacher asked me once what "fenda" [sic, finna] means.
Speaker 2: "Fenda?"
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'm "fenda" to go.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: And (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Fixin (laughter) and then, one asked me why do they say "fixin to."  Well that's really cultural you know, "I'm fixin to," "I'm fixin to."  I think black and white says that.
Speaker 1: But if you degenerate it to the point of Chicago people say "I'm finna go."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: And then they--so many different things that they say that they keep--they pass it on, it becomes a part of their everyday language you know, and I've gotten to the point now when I just don't hear it you know 'cause I don't--'cause they say, I don't want people to think that I'm listening for mistakes 'cause I'm not.  Really I'm not.  I just--young people especially, I just think young people ought to learn as much as they can and be--I just think that they ought to be the best that they can be you know, in terms of articulating and in terms of just speaking and just because you are you know--they--one while we even had a term called "ghettoese" [ph.], you know, "Well that's ghettoese," you know.  We can get away with it 'cause that's our language.  That's not our language you know. That's not our language but--it's kinda dying out and so am I so (laughter) but I still would like to have a class just on phonetics, just to teach the "ings" and the "en" and the "an" just you know, "D-A-D," "D-A-D."  My children, our children say all the time--they say, "He's dead" because that's how they hear it, when it's actually "dead."  It's just one sound "dead." It's one syllable, one--it's just "dd," "de-ad," "dead" and it's the same thing with "S-A-I-D."  It's not she "sed" it's what it is, "S-A-I-D" and it doesn't seem like much but when you put it all together and they know--they know how to speak the English words and they know--then they know how to speak the--articulate then--and then they know the subject matter, you have some young people who's coming, and suggesting, and all those young men came about and they listened to somebody.  [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] had such an effect on us all you know.  Now I really like--I like Martin Luther King's speeches.  I love them.  It was oratory, but I think it has its place and I think it's a dying art, but--and I don't like to see it die. I think people like that--when they really can do it you know.  We were talking the other day about a young man who preached at our church the other day, Reverend Tony Braxton [ph.], and he mentioned [HM] Reverend Gardner C. Taylor, who you know, from New York [City, New York].
Speaker 1: The famous--
Speaker 2: Famous.
Speaker 1: Baptist Minister--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and see those--those great men--those great preachers were storytellers and they knew what they were talking about. They knew how to get the story over and you--and they captured you, really, you know, Harry Seawright, Dr. Lofton, Fred Lofton here in Memphis [Tennessee], and my own pastor, Dr. L. LaSimba M. Gray [Jr.] who is also on his way there to be one of those.  He is a great speaker.  He's younger but he's a great speaker, and he commands your attention and when you find a speaker that commands your attention, you don't mind listening and people are joining churches like that because they want to hear the word and they want to hear it done well.  I don't care what they say about what--they want to hear it done well, they really do.
Speaker 1: So your students, you know you were able to finally teach them some speech-- (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Those students who came through me, they--and then by my doing--working with the drama department when I was at the University of Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee]--at that time it was called Memphis State, in rehearsal--I did Readers Theater a lot--
Story_ID: 136731
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) which--
Speaker 2: Now wait a minute--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --let me get you to Memphis State [University, later University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] first off.  Now what happened, didn't you go to graduate school at Memphis State or did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I went to graduate school at Memphis State. I went there thinking I was too old. I was in my early forties, maybe forty, but it was early, it was early and I just--I was just--I was scared to death 'cause I just thought eighteen-year-old kids and I'm up against these eighteen-year-old kids. They are gonna know everything and I'm gonna be like a dummy, I'm not going to know anything, but I had friends who just--one friend she's dead now, but she just insisted, she said, "Erma, it doesn't make sense for you to not to have a degree, a master's degree in what you love," and I said--I--I, you know, but she took the application, did it.  She was a typing teacher.  She did it all, and all I had to do was go on out there.  So, I went out there, took the test, made whatever, got in and the first thing the teacher taught us--asked about was figures of speech. The very first thing and I taught English all my life so I knew all of them, you know and they didn't so (laughter) then I felt better, and then I felt better.  I think I hit my--after I found out that I did know something, I said oh, yeah, and then it just became wonderful.  I enjoyed every bit of it, and during that summer one of the summers I was there, that last summer, so I went in the summertime 'cause I was working and they received a grant--that department--theater department received a grant to teach at risk, inner-city children, young people something about theater, you know, get them off the streets, teach them.  They had not--didn't have a clue what to do with them, and they had at least a hundred of them.  So they called me in and asked me, "Do you think you can work with these black kids?"  Well, you know I could.  I said, yes I could.  "So you can come up with some kind of idea, some kind of program where you can work with these young people. We could put this on your degree 'cause you'll be doing theater and you'll be teaching."  So I did that and it was just great.  Met some of the most wonderful people became friends, became like students' mama, children of mine and they were so impressed with it and we'd have programs every Friday.  We'd meet, they'd come every morning, and we'd--they'd come at nine and I think they'd stay like three or four and then on Fridays we present what we taught and there were about four or five students--black students to get their master's, and so we all had groups but I had--called the super group and I don't know why I have this cough, but they were impressed and by the end of the six weeks or whatever weeks we had to do it, they called me in and asked me if I wanted to work there.  That was a shock you know?  So you know everybody thought you better be very careful 'cause usually they don't keep people, you know you only stay about three years and then they let you go, but I just walked out on faith and said 'cause I'd been at Melrose [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] for twenty-four years (cough).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Are you just finished your master's and they hired you?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right at Memphis State?  Right, and okay, you said you'd been at Melrose for twenty-four years so you took the chance?
Speaker 1: I took a chance, you know how you get burned out in high school and it was so--it's such a different environment in a university, the students you know, in terms of discipline.  Our children were not bad, but it's just a difference and then it gave me more of an opportunity to do what--it was just--the university welcomed the ideas--the creative ideas I had, whereas in high school, in the city system, they weren't quite sure that they wanted drama and that kind of thing you know, 'cause on drama you do sometimes go out there and the kind of play--most of the plays I did I wrote them and so I felt freerer at the university, so yeah I did enjoy it better.
Speaker 2: Okay, so now, now we're in the mid '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Oh, no this was '70 [1970].  I went to the University of Memphis in '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 136732
Speaker 1: But still it was just getting there.  Now, you know [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed in '68 [1968] so it was- wasn't too far away from all that bad stuff, you know, and so naturally when I went into theater and started doing the shows, it was a reflection of how it was, you know, this--there was a feeling you know that the soul was born out of, the kind of frustration and feeling that we had gone through.  I think that's why it was so popular.
Speaker 2: Okay, now this, you're talking about the play 'An Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)']?  Now what was the premise of the play and what was--what happened?  I mean what was the--
Speaker 1: Okay, so once I was at Memphis State [University, Memphis, Tennessee], now known as the University of Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee], one of the--one of the--one of my duties was to teach a course called "Speech for the Classroom Teachers," and along with public speaking, a course in Reader's Theater and I didn't really have a theater class that I taught 'cause I was really in communication, but I found out that when I was teaching "Speech for the Classroom Teachers" that most of my students were white young girls and young men who were going to be teaching in--to our city kids and they knew nothing which is natural.  They knew nothing about the cultural background of teaching black children and the more I taught them, the more I understood that they didn't know, and so I was trying to teach and yet entertain and yet, and I think I did do both you know.  That was one of the things and then so along with this particular class there was a thing called a lab course that went with it.  And in this lab course I had them to--we had just done 'Hair' at our school at the university and that was the beginning--
Speaker 2: The play, the play 'Hair'--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The play 'Hair.' And that was really the beginning of black and white people getting together on a stage in Memphis [Tennessee] that I can remember, and so it made a lot of media--got a lot of media attention, and so what I decided to do about a year or two later was to organize some kind of production that would kinda talk about the experience through music and song and readings, and in this lab course they had, I had the students to--as I said now, excuse me let me go back.  When 'Hair' was done, there was some music in 'Hair' that the words were kinda you know, they were saying a lot of things in 'Hair' and one girl was telling--one of the students was saying that her grandmother was patting her feet--she liked this particular song and the song was really saying a lot of things--were kind of vulgar, you know--
Story_ID: 136733
Speaker 1: Tell us about 'An Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'].  You know, they tried 'Hair' and I, I, I think from what I read none of the black students got, got, got in 'Hair' or they were kinda or they wanted something to do.
Speaker 2: They wanted something to do but they didn't--they had a few blacks you know and a good--they were talented kids and it was nice.
Speaker 1: And 'Hair" wasn't really an expression of what you know what black folks felt.
Speaker 2: No, 'Hair' was a whole different ball game.
Speaker 1: Everybody took their clothes off at the end (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did, but I don't think they did it at the University [of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't think that they allowed it--
Speaker 1: This is the Bible Belt so--
Speaker 2: That's right, they didn't do that but, but it was a beginning of integration of acting--theater I would say, but 'Evening of Soul' as I was saying I had to let this class do a lab on the music that 'Hair' was doing.  That's how it came up this girl was saying, "My mama was--my grandmother was just clapping her--you know stomping her feet to this music. If she had known what they were saying she would have had a fit."  I said, "Well you know that's true."  I said, "A lot of the songs that we sing we don't--people don't pay attention to the words."  I said, "So what I would like for you to do," and this is just the whole class, black and white though, I said, "I want you to find me the lyrics of the blues, find me the lyrics of popular music that they are singing today and just, let's just see what's out there," and that was just an assignment.  And so they did, and they came back and they were--it was just really funny because they said, "I didn't know this was saying this or whatever."  And so I got the idea, well why don't I just do a production on just lyrics, you know just words, use them as a Readers Theater, and instead of just using all kind of music just use black music and let that be--and divide it into certain categories, and so that's what I did.  I divided it into slavery, which is the beginning--in the beginning and 'cause that was not words, we actually used the music for that and then I had the blues and I had passion, songs of passion, songs on the blues, and songs of celebration and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had just you know, and I took all of this and I put it together as a Readers Theater, but then I met some young--a young lady by the name of Deborah at that time Deborah Manning, Deborah Manning-Thomas now, and she tried out and she had this voice, this unusual voice, very beautiful, big voice, you know, it's good, just--wonderful singer, and that changed my mind about keeping it just on a Readers Theater level.  I said oh, well then I can include some music in it, and so it just went on and went on until finally it just became just a production all about the black experience, and so then the categories of course were what was so interesting because you're talking about--you're teaching but you're entertaining and then and you got good--I mean the best talent 'cause these kids hadn't had a platform at all to do anything.  So I put an article in the school paper and I said "Students interested in music, especially black music, gospel music to see Ms. Clanton," and I told them the time and everything, and I figured you'd get about five or six, ten at the most.   Just all the students, all the black students who were there just about came and tried out and of course I couldn't use all of them, but I did use twenty-two of them. I used twenty-two and they were all good.  Some of them weren't that--were weak, but and from that came 'Evening of Soul,' and it grew from one night, one night--it was supposed to have been one night because see I wasn't a theater teacher and I didn't--I had not planned a night, so therefore I only asked them to let me use one night in the little theater and so what I did I contacted the critic, the main critic, media critic, entertainment critic and told him and he came and we did it that one night and it--that was that article I was telling you about that was on the wall, and it just--it was just--I don't know what happened, it just blew--just blew--blew everybody out of the room. It was just wonderful, and so then after the article came--the article was saying that--the critic was saying that it has to be done over.  We cannot have it one night.  Everybody must see this so by this time the university now is taking note and so they called me in, and they said, "Well Erma you've got to do it again."  So I said, "Okay," so we decided to do it in the spring.  This was November of '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 136734
Speaker 1: So we decided to do it ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] in the spring and, but during the one night--I mean, after we did the one night, they [University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] let us do it a few more nights and [HM] Isaac [Hayes] heard about it, it was during the time he was riding high on his Grammy [Award] and he heard about it.  He didn't know me at that time, and he wanted--
Speaker 2: He had just got a Grammy for 'Shaft,' right?
Speaker 1: Had just gotten it, and he heard about it in California 'cause it was written up in Jet and that kind of thing.  Joseph Papp from New York [City] sent somebody down to check it out, and it did have a lot of copyright problems because it was using other peoples' stuff--work you know.  So, therefore there had been--there was sort of a problem, but the originality--the creativity of it they thought was just wonderful.  For an example, I had this big guy, big guy who stood up and said, "Why--everybody wants to know why I sing the blues," didn't sing it, he's talking it, [HM] B.B. King's 'Why I Sing the Blues,' and then he says it with all that fervor and really meanness and sincerity and, "They wanna know why I sing the blues" and people just went wild and then in the passion instead of saying--singing the love song they would say it to each other.  It was--and I took--and then the narrator would say, (Coughing) "Excuse me, I don't know why I'm doing this."   (Pause) and they know he did.
Speaker 2: They know.
Speaker 1: And, so, but it taught me something.  So I went and wrote something to fix it.  I said, "Lord have mercy."
Story_ID: 136735
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: 'An Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] came about because of the need for a platform for black students to show their talent, and after I had done this lab and I saw an opportunity for something different, you know, to do a Readers Theater with the lyrics of songs and there was--hadn't been done before and I--at least I hadn't heard it and it just--it caught on and I took twenty-two kids out of about fifty or seventy.  Fifty-six they said. I don't know how many.  A lot of them came to the audition and I told them, "Now this is something different.  Since we do have music in it we have some singers we're gonna have music, but most of this is going to be speaking.  You're gonna speak out and you're gonna talk out," and course now what I have--had planned to read today is really original, but at the time I was doing all lyrics, just doing it you know, but I was--as I said I was running into a lot of copyright problems, so I had to rewrite it and that's when I changed it, but it came about as I said because of the need for African American students to have an opportunity to display their talent and they did it, and so I took it and I divided it into several divisions and it started out with 'Soul Suffering,' which is a retrospective look back into slavery and our roots in Ameri--on the American soil, and of course here we did sing the spirituals and we did--and now we did have narrations and some of that narration came out of the poetry of Langston Hughes and so this set us up, but the voices of the kids singing the spirituals is just beautiful 'cause I had--that's one thing Memphis State [University, later University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] did for me was to get good musicians to teach the songs and all that.  That was wonderful, and then after that we had--then I had 'Soul Survivor,' which was the black church, and now when I do the show for some reason I do the black survival of the church last because that seems to be what everybody enjoys the most, and so I have it at the end, but actually I think the black church should come right after 'Slavery Time,' 'cause even during slavery, you know it was the music of the black church and the fellowship of the people that held them together, and then after that we did 'Blues' and that was the cry of the black man's blues and how they helped him to get over life's harsh realities and--and this way the blues was recited rather than sung and that was interesting, and then we did 'The Passion,' that's the love between the black man and the black woman and what I was going to say was that in 'The Passion' scene, even though we had scenes where we we're talking about the love they have for each other we also--the narrator would say, "But you know now, we did have our fussing and our fighting," so that gave me an opportunity to use 'Think' that was done by Aretha Franklin, "You better think about what you're trying to do to me"--that song and that comes out perfectly as an argument to a man.  "You better think, you better think about what you trying to do to me," and the man, I selected [HM] B.B. King's, oh I think it's B.B. King's, 'Paying the Cost to be the Boss.'  "Look here woman, I'm paying the cost to be the boss," and when I put it together it was like two--a man and a woman arguing and that was always a hit, but that was an idea of how you can take the lyrics and put them together and makes--and music in a creative way and then of course 'The Soul Struggle,' the inspiration and direction that the black mother has played in keeping the family together, and that was always--that was something I wrote something about the black mother, and well, really the name of it was 'Mama Talks to the President,' and that was when--regardless of what president was in, we could always say something about it.  Don't have time to read it but it was really interesting because the mama was--mama was getting the black president--the president told about her children.  'Dr. King's Movement,' of course, we know about that.  The positive world impact by [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.], then 'Soul Salute,' that was an earnest plea for the freedom of all black--of all people and that's--that was a song I wrote.  I wrote the words, David War [ph.] wrote the music 'Two Hundred Years Ought to be Enough,' and I've kinda wanted to read that but it may be too long, and then 'Soul and the Stump,' this is a funny--this is humorous, and this is a bunch of black kids--black men sitting around on the garbage cans just talking about the universal brother and how we're the same and how we have different things that we do that's not right but they talk about it.  It's a--becomes kind of an interesting piece of theater done in a different and unique way.  'The Blues'--some of the blues pieces that I wrote were--the young girl says, she comes down and she got the blues, she says, "Blues, blues, I've got those low down dirty blues."  She's almost singing, and then this man, an older guy says, "Young folks can't sing the blues," and she says, "but when you see your man with another woman you got the blues just the same," and she's singing that and she looks over and see her man with this woman dancing and they liked that.  Then another girl comes out and this is in the blues scene, and she says, "My ole man is always broke.  I mean he's broke all the time.  Even on his payday he ain't even got a dime.  He brought me a new dress when I had my first child. Now my son's a man and my dress is back in style.  He tells me everyday I'm going to get straight, but I'm afraid when he do it's gonna be a little too late."  That was always--and then she had on one of those shingle dresses, you know.  Now remember this was done in the '70s [1970s] so all this was very, very apropos.  And--it goes on like that and the last girl says, "I don't know why y'all feeling so sad.  You can't miss nothing you ain't never had.  'Cause just 'cause we poor, it don't mean we gotta be blue.  I betcha I have more fun than the rich folks do," and she's very provocative and very cute you know.

Speaker 1: Now this is the one that I was telling you about that the black doctor, and it's a man and a woman standing at the bus stop, and so they meet and they start talking--so she--as usual people--I always say that black people think that they're kin to each other, you know.  Whether they know you or not they gon' start talking to you, and so she tells him--asks him how he's doing.  He said, "Well I had this pain in--I had this pain in my left arm."  This is the man talking.  "Oh, I didn't think it was no great harm, but you know what they say about heart attacks so I went to see me a doctor.  Naturally he was black.  I said, 'Doctor, tell me my fee before I undress.'  He said, 'Oh, don't worry, you're insured, I guess.'  I said, 'Maybe so, but I wanna know my fee.'  He said, '$150.00 initially.'  I said, 'Does that include an x-ray and an EKG?'  He said, 'No that's your temperature and a tap on the knee.'  I said, 'Doctor, your bills are just too high, besides I'm a brother. We're supposed to help each other.'  Just as I thought he was digging my pleas, he pushed a button and said, 'Nurse, next patient please!'"  And then the woman takes her umbrella and just throws it over--knockin' him on the head and says, "Well, why would you go to a black doctor in the first place?  And you know how I love my race.  Now I'll support the black preacher and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I'll support the black media, the politician, Jet and Ebony, but when it comes to my aches and my pains, I'm going to me a white doctor and I ain't ashamed.  I went to a white doctor when I had to stand in the hall and wait all day until my name was called, but that was when we were segregated, and now the waiting rooms, they--they are integrated.  I makes my appointment and get there before nine because white folks don't know about colored people's time, but there's one thing I don't quite perceive. Why am I always the first to arrive, but the last to leave?"  And that's the one that I did in Ohio and these little ladies told me, "You can't say that."  So then I went home and I wrote this to end that scene.  And this is a young girl and she's standing there with her books waiting at the bus stop.  She says, "The way you two talk is a disgrace.  Why, we have some fine doctors in our black race.  We got some fine black lawyers and dentists too, but they wouldn't make a dime if it was left up to you.  Why, I never heard talk more stupid or bold.  I bet you think the white man's ice is colder and you're supposed to be setting an example for us young folks.  Just listening to you is a sad, sad joke.  Remember when you degrade the black professionals and put them away on the shelf, you not only degrade them, but you degrade yourself."  And of course she walks off with him.  So I fixed that, you know and that was good--they told me that because I'm thinking everybody thought like I did that people thought like that in those days but I had to fix it to let them know that we all don't do that.  That's just some of the stuff that I wrote.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 136737
Speaker 1: And the play ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] was well received?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: Tremendously received.
Speaker 2: Thirty years of it really.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, for thirty years you all performed this at the--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, off and on thirty years.  We had our thirty-year reunion--had our thirty-year reunion last--2001--2001 at the University of Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee], and did the update of it, of course I had to update it and some of the old members came back and performed and now you know who we're talking about--they're almost fifty now, but some of them came back and performed and I had a lot of the young ones from my church and the community and it was very well--very well received, very well received.
Story_ID: 136738
Speaker 1: So, now I work at--now--excuse me I'm doing my drama work at my church [New Sardis Baptist Church, Memphis, Tennessee].  So it has to change the tune a little bit even though it's still about--I always tried to just do us the way we are you know, and to let people know that this is--the African American race is really a wonderful race, you know.  We all have our hang-ups and we all have our faults and--but our good parts too and, I just write according to way I--the way I see and feel it.  Now, that--the biggest thing I do at my church now is--as I said I'm a drama minister there, but I do an Easter program and its outdoors and that's kind of different. Nobody--most people do it--do their little Easter program with their little speeches with the children, but I do the pageant, and I have it--I have the beginning of it inside and--now I do have pictures on that you know, and inside where Jesus is coming in during the march where they do--(pause)--okay, it starts off with him coming in on--we don't really have a donkey, but with the children and the grown-ups and everybody with the palm leaves, they're saying hosanna, and of course we have a young man who plays the part of Jesus who learns his part, just is wonderful and what we do is show what he has done a little bit before the crucifixion.  Healing the sick and, you know, healing the blind, giving the blind sight and all these little incidents are shown, and we have the Judas [Iscariot] scene and of course the guy that plays Judas we have a professional dancer and he does the actual hanging you know--acts like he--in dance and then we have the music, you know after each scene and then of course there is a scene where he--the prostitute is brought and thrown before him and they want to stone her and he does it--just Biblical scenes before we do the crucifixion--take him to [Pontius] Pilot and Herod or whatever and he goes into the garden.  We show all of that and then of course after Pilot has done all he could--cause Pilot--Pilot really didn't want to do this it seems, then of course they take him outside.  They take him outside we have a hill outside and they take him outside and they crucify him, and it has grown so now that we have so many people come.  This year we had about six hundred.  That's a lot for our church, we have a small church and each year it's growing bigger and bigger, and it's getting more and more interesting.
Story_ID: 136739
Speaker 1: I do a black history play every year of something, something.
Speaker 2: What's it called?  Is it--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, it's different, different things.  One year I did 'Black on Black on the Right Track' [sic, 'Gifted & Black - On the Right Track'] I think was of the young people and then I've done 'Martin Luther King' and one time I did 'Blues on Sunday Morning.'  That was really interesting.  That was about one of our black blues singers.  He was a blues singer and then he became a preacher and while he was singing the blues--and I think in New York [City], he got ready to come out to sing and he couldn't--the words wouldn't come so he started singing 'Shine on Me,' which is a religious song and from then on he became a preacher and his story--so that was about his story.  'Blues on Sunday Morning,' and I'm doing now, and I have done before 'Black and White and Read All Over,' the Reader's Theater about the media and how the media portrays all of us, especially black people, you know, avant-garde trombones, and a lot of--lot of sort of skits--Biblical skits and things in church.  So, I'm busy.  I'm doing--I was commissioned to do the 'Black & White and Red all Over' for inner-city children and that will be done September--this September 2003.  So, I'm in the process of staying busy.
Story_ID: 136740
Speaker 1: Now you are unique in that you have a number of people, over five hundred I believe, who consider themselves your children?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, because--
Speaker 1: Teachers don't usually have that many people--
Speaker 2: Well, see my teaching went beyond the classroom, and most of--in Orange Mound [Memphis, Tennessee] like I said, Melrose [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] is just a unique--it really is a unique school and that was because the parents told them you know, the teacher is like your parents.  You obey that teacher just like you obey me and they got that love and attention and criticism and punishment or whatever, discipline and but they knew we cared for them so they do, they--I can't--there's nowhere in Memphis [Tennessee] I can go that I don't see somebody that I've taught, and then I taught night school once a few times and summer school. I just taught a long time, taught forty-five years so in teaching you just meet a lot of people, and even though some of them are as old as me (laughter), no they not, you know, I did teach them and I appreciate that and I'm proud of the fact that I touched them in some way.
Speaker 1: You were a mentor and advisor to many people in the city and been involved in entertainment including [HM] Isaac Hayes and--who else--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Isaac, well Isaac really is a very, very close friend because after he saw 'Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] then he wanted to be in it, and so when we did it that spring the University [of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] was just happy you know to have him, so they did it--we did it again in May of '72 [1972] that he was a part of it.  That brought a whole different audience of course, and then I worked with him and I found out he was so down to earth and like you said he--he's so knowledgeable about so many areas and he's just, he's good hearted, he's a kind person and he just sort of just accepted me as his like mom. Isaac really didn't--Isaac's mom died when he was a baby and his grandmama reared him and then she died here recently and it's not really like a mama 'cause we have so much fun together, you know we talk and say a lot of jokes and stuff, but actually I do you know advise him.  He may not accept it or say he's not gonna accept it, but he usually does you know (laughter) and I fuss at him a lot sometimes, but he is a good person and--and has been very, very good to me in terms of just when I moved here you know, he just sees that I have television.  I say, "I don't need digital," and he'll pay a year up for digital television for me, and that television in there he bought that for me for my birthday present and does nice things for me and I appreciate it and I just--I just admire--but not only Isaac but my pastor, Reverend Gray, Dr. Gray, Dr. [L.] LaSimba [M.] Gray [Jr.], is also my pastor and I consider also a friend.  He's done a lot of things in terms of looking out for me because everybody knows that I have bad legs, but they see that I go places and do things and I try--I really try my best to keep a positive outlook on life and I try not to be negative and even though things do happen, you know, like I'm going to Chicago [Illinois] later and see my sister [Frances Clanton Knight] I was telling you look like maybe she has a touch of Alzheimer's, I don't know, but I'm going to get her to bring her to Memphis because she needs to be near her sister you know, and so I'm gonna do that.
Story_ID: 136741
Speaker 1: Ma'am what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes are that as black people we can get together, be together more. That we can form more of a relationship where we trust each other more and that we can--we can accept the fact that our goods in business that we sell is just as--our goods are just as good as anybody else's.  That we will help each other, we don't seem to do that too much, but that's my biggest hope is that we can trust each other.  We don't seem to do that too well and my dreams, same thing almost, that we learn to live as sisters and brothers and not only as black people but as black and white people.  That we can just come together and live just like God wanted us to live and as sisters and brothers and love each other and get along and try to make this world a better place to live because it's kind of rough out here.  We need all the love and nourishment that we can get, and if there is anything that I can do and I'm trying to do to help this world to help people, I just try to do it you know because one thing I have learned by living in this world a long time is that what you do comes back.  Now that I have seen with my eyes, my own eyes. I've seen people live a certain way and honest to goodness I've seen the kind of punishment, I believe came from the way that they lived, and on the other hand I've seen people who lived a certain way and they lived a good way, by helping--and by doing as much as we can the way God would have us and they live a certain way.  I'm an example of that, you know, I've lived--and I'm no saint, far from a saint but I've lived a long time, and I don't really suffer that much.  I hurt all the time, but you know I don't really suffer and I just believe in helping each other (unclear).
Story_ID: 136742
Speaker 1: Who are some of the other people that you've influenced?  I know you can't name all five hundred people, but just maybe name a few.
Speaker 2: Well, my daughter I hope, I think I have influenced her.  She was--she comes out of a family of thirteen children and of all the children in her family she was the one that--and that's why I think it was a divine kind of thing because we have so much in common.  She is all theater. She sings beautifully.  She dances. She's very creative and loves the stage, and now this was a child at nine years old that I knew nothing about her and she really didn't know anything about me.  Her uncle--how I knew, her my sister married into that family and the nephew--my nephew naturally is related to her family so he comes down from Chicago [Illinois] to visit and so he told me one time when she was nine that I should take one of the children.  He said, "It's so many children at my auntie's house, you should take one of them," and of course at that time I was--I didn't want to be bothered with a child (laughter) but I wanted to help a child.  I didn't know if I wanted to keep a child or not, but anyway she kept calling and I kept telling her that I would let her come over on a weekend.  So finally I did and she never left.  You know I sent her to school, and I found out that I had really did enjoy having a child in my home, and I think that I have helped her as she has helped me.  At least she gave me two wonderful grandchildren and I--she's extremely talented and I notice a lot of things she does and says that it's just me you know.  For instance her house that--I always like a lot of mirrors and when I was first--when I first had my first apartment or whatever and I noticed that she did the same thing.  You can tell when they kind of imitating you, but the good part about it is that she joined the same church 'cause see her family, her real family still lives in Memphis [Tennessee] in which naturally have a lot of hold on her in a sense, but--and so they all go to another church but I just knew she was going to follow them but she came and joined my church at the church that I belong to which is New Sardis Baptist Church [Memphis, Tennessee], and sings in the choir and has given a lot of her talent there, so that's one person that I think I have helped, and then I don't know a lot of people say and I guess so.  Reginald Gaston is a young man that teaches at Hamilton High School [Memphis, Tennessee].  He teaches music and he was one of my proteges.  He came out of 'Evening of Soul,' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] beautiful tenor voice and he has helped me teach the music, get the music done now since I, you know, I don't have really anybody like I did at the University [of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] where they bring in people, and so he comes in and help there, and I help him with his students in English.  He teaches English but like I help him with theater, articulation, ideas and just being creative because that's the one thing I try to do.  Everything I do is creative.  I don't want to eat the same thing. Everything I do, I want to do it differently.  I just like to be creative--
Story_ID: 136743
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would if you look back over your life is there anything that you would do differently (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I would have married a couple of people that I didn't, one of them, not both of them at the same time (laughter).
Speaker 1: That could cause confusion.
Speaker 2: But I always thought--in growing up--I always thought there was always somebody better.  Now that's terrible to say on television, but honest to God that's the truth.  I always thought it was always somebody else out there that thought more like the way I thought and--and see after you've missed it out of college--that was a big down 'cause it was a person that I was interested in, went to the War [World War II, WWII], went to the [U.S.] Army, and then there was another person who was a senior when I was a freshman and I shouldn't have--but I just, oh, I just was in love with this person and then he left--Ohio by the way. He's from Ohio.  After the show I could ask you was he still--I never knew what happened to him, and I think that I would have--I always wanted to get married and have children, but I've always wanted to do what I'm doing this and I don't think you can do both of them 'cause I'm very high-level maintenance when it comes to work and so I don't know.  So maybe that's one thing I might would have done over again.  I think God wanted everybody to get married, but I don't think he wanted me to 'cause if he had he would have seen that I would, but I don't know too much difference cause I've seen problems.
Story_ID: 136744
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back over your life what things do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I really think that I have helped elevate and sustain black culture in the city [Memphis, Tennessee] and maybe in other places, but in this city.  I think that I have given opportunities to talented young people, shy kids who didn't, who wouldn't dare hardly move and had talent but was like I was and didn't know how to place it, didn't know how to do it.  I think I had a platform for them.  I think that I've given them opportunities to travel. We've traveled to nearly every college and they have life-long friendships.  Some of them have friends within the group of 'Evening of Soul,' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] and those are the--that's the friends for life.  It's like a family.  So they--they I've given them friendship, fellowship connections and I've given them opportunities to travel, and even in our traveling in those days, I know how the [Holiday] Inn is not the greatest hotel but I wouldn't stay in anything less.  We couldn't stay in anything less than Holiday Inn.  I wouldn't travel in anything less than a Greyhound, and even though it would be twenty people on the bus I insisted on that.  That's just one thing that I insisted 'cause I wanted to be safe.  I felt like we were safe, and I've given them opportunities to meet and to be under some of the greatest musicians that came out of New York [City, New York]. There were several people out of New York.  In our own music department at the University [of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] they would see that I had good musicians, and then they sent choreographers from New York down and so they had an opportunity to meet professionals at a very early age.  I think that was good and what did they give me?  They gave me life, that's what they gave me, and even--I gave them--many of them I gave--I guess the maternal thing, yeah.  You know they come here and they feel like they're at home and I want them to feel like they are at home, and I give them advice, may not take it but I give advice if I feel it's necessary, and always a friend.  Janice Williams is one of my--one of the 'Evening of Soul' people that we'll still--she still calls me from California. She is moving to Atlanta [Georgia] now and there are times that I just--we just talk, and sometimes not asking advice, but in talking you're giving it anyway, and they do the same to me, you know with my sister and her situation I was telling you about, they have given me a lot of you know, just comfort knowing that everything is gon' be alright.  So you kinda need each other.  So my legacy then I would say, would be that I hope that I have taught them to never forget from where they came from and always be proud of who they are and whose they are and always remember that they are somebody and that whatever they have--the talent that they have, use it. Don't be ashamed to use it and pass it on.  That's about it.
Story_ID: 136745
Speaker 1: Alright, now this is slightly different from legacy, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Okay, just a person who lived and tried to help somebody and just really tried to give all that I had to give to help young people especially, but anybody--but helped young people to establish something within them 'cause I remember--I remember that I seemed to--as I was growing up that I had something just like a burning fire and I couldn't put it out.  It was there--I just had to--I had to keep going you know.  I had to--as Lucie Campbell said, it was something within me that just made me just want to go on and just wanna be whatever, and I have stuff that--information and things that I have written that I know should be published and I am just getting around to publishing 'Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul)'] now and, but I don't have time 'cause time I get through with one thing, I'm doing something else and so I would just like to leave as a legacy that you can do anything that you want to do, that you know you shouldn't let your age stop.  You should not let arthritis or any kind of pain stop you and you should always stay in church, stay close to God, invite God into your life, invite him, invite the Holy Spirit to be with you at all times, and if you do that I think your life will be well spent and then I will be, I hope that I will be remembered from just being a good person who tried to really help.
Speaker 1: Thank you ma'am.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.

Speaker 1: Go ahead and tell us (unclear) this photo.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is [HM] Isaac [Hayes] and me at the New Sardis [Baptist] Church [Memphis, Tennessee].  I did this show called 'The Other Side of Soul.'  It was done in August 2002.
Speaker 1: Great, next?
Speaker 2: Oh, that takes you way back.  That was--
Speaker 1: No, wait, let me (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's a great class.  When I first started--one of the years when I first started teaching at Memphis--at Melrose High School [Memphis, Tennessee].  I'd been there a few years.  That's--no that's the tenth grade class.  I'm sorry 1957, Melrose High School, the school that I started teaching.

Speaker 1: And if I come over here this is you here?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's me in 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay, next?
Speaker 2: Isaac gave me a trip to Los Angeles [California] to attend the celebrity anniversary of the scientology class and Lisa Marie Presley was there.  She's a member and we were sitting, having lunch and I saw Lisa sitting at a table and I went to her and I said, "Lisa Marie," I said, "you're from Memphis [Tennessee] and I'm from Memphis and you lived right around the corner from me and I would like to take a picture with you," and Isaac said, "Oh, no don't worry her Erma," and he said--she said, "Don't pay any attention to Isaac, Erma. Come on," and then he jumps on the picture.
Speaker 1: Here?
Speaker 2: That was in 1998 I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, next?
Speaker 2: It's upside down.
Speaker 1: --No, it's alright, that's how we do it.

Speaker 1: --Here is another set.
Speaker 2: I need you to tilt that one forward.  (Unclear) (simultaneous) please.
Speaker 1: It doesn't have a year. That's when I was I think in college. I don't know.  I don't remember what year it was made but it was before I--I think it was my first year of teaching I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Maybe it was my first year of teaching, which was--
Speaker 2: Alright, next.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's my daughter, Saundra Crawford Garrett [ph.], she's married now and she is a flight attendant for Northwest--Northwest Airlines [later part of Delta Airlines] and she's gained a little weight since then. That was a size four (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, when was this taken?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was taken about nine years ago, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay, next?
Speaker 1: Preston [ph.] is ten now, but he's--when that picture was taken he was nine. He was nine years old.  That's my grandson who's going to be a doctor too, and that's my little princess, that's Hadiya.  Hadiya, she will let you know her name is Hadiya, not Hidiya, and she is four years old and she says she's going to be a ballerina dancer and a doctor.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you spell her name for the tape?
Speaker 1: Hadiya, H-A-D-I-Y-A, Hadiya Garrett.
Speaker 2: Okay, spell Garrett.
Speaker 1: G-A-R-R-E-T-T.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is my friend Isaac. It's when I first met him in 1972 and we were at the University of Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee] backstage getting ready to--I'm sorry that was in his studio. That was in his studio, but we were talking about the music we would incorporate into the--the musical--'An Evening of Soul' where he was going to perform with us. He had just won the Grammy Awards--Award.
Speaker 2: Okay, next?
Speaker 1: Oh, that's family, to the extreme right is my Aunt Nora Clanton who passed in 1986 and my sister--my oldest sister Mattie Grayson who passed in 1999 and her son Buddy McCoo [ph.] who's still living, thank God, and his son Billy Joe McCoo [ph.] and his baby girl.
Speaker 2: Next?
Speaker 1: And there's another picture of Isaac.  I don't know what year that picture was, but it was before he was fasting, I think.  He has a little hair I think at that time.  This is one of Isaac's pictures.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: This picture was sent to me a year--2001.  We needed something to put in the--our annual--our book, our anniversary, our thirty-year anniversary about Isaac, and his New York [City, New York]] office sent that picture, and so I don't know what year it is but I think it was, it was recent within the last five years.
Speaker 2: Okay, very good next?  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: That's my nephew, Billy McCoo and his wife Dorothy who is my niece, Dorothy McCoo.  They live in Memphis and that picture was taken in 2001.
