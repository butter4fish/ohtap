Story_ID: 217575
Speaker 1: So if you will, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, let's talk a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where she was born and where she grew up?
Speaker 2: My mother was Vivian Moore Green.  Green was her married name.  She was born in Fort Worth, Texas and grew up in Fort Worth, Texas.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a little girl?
Speaker 2: Not too many.  I was too young at the time that she passed away.  I was nine years of age and I don't remember very much of my early childhood years.  So, I'm sorry I don't have many stories to tell.  My impression of what I do remember is that she was a woman who had deep moral and ethical values.  She was a churchgoer.  We were members of a kind of a Pentecostal theologian church and we went religiously every Sunday and sometimes during the week and on Sunday afternoons as well.
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your father, starting with his name and where he was born.
Speaker 2: I don't know his--where he was born.  His name was Henry Green and because he passed away before my mother, I remember him less, but at any rate my impression was that he was a tall man with a good brain.  He was--he worked in a brass foundry.  And he had left some papers that had gave the impression that he was creative and innovative.  We think he drew a design for a carburetor and may have sent it off to one of the major companies at that time, probably Ford [Motor Company], but nothing ever came of it.  So, I always assumed that I got my mathematics ability and love and appreciation of architecture from him.  But that's just fiction that I've made up in my own mind about him.
Story_ID: 217576
Speaker 1: You had said earlier that you were raised by an aunt and uncle?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, their names were Richard [Moore] and Mattie Moore.  And after my mother's [Vivian Moore Green] death, they took Aileene [Green Davis] and I, we were the only two remaining six siblings of my mother's children and they took (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What do you mean, remaining six?
Speaker 2: There were six of us altogether.  One lived to be twenty-one years of age.  I remember him vaguely, but he passed away, and the three other brothers also did, and two before my birth.  And the other I don't remember.  So, that's what I meant, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 2: --that there were only two of us remaining of my mother's children.  And my aunt and uncle took us in and raised us as their own children.
Speaker 1: So can you tell us a little bit about your aunt and uncle?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Did they ever share any stories with you about what life was like for them as children growing up?
Speaker 2: No, not that I remember.  But there were plenty to tell, I'm sure.  Every now and then you'd hear of a few stories.  We wondered of course, about our--our, meaning Aileene and my grandfather [Henry Moore].  We have always wondered.  We never heard very, very much about him.  But there was a picture of him in my grandmother's home.  And I guess we just weren't all that interested in genealogy in those eras when I grew up and Aileene grew up, so we didn't follow up on the information as much as we possibly could have.  I do know that my aunt was a member of the Hicks family and they had been born in a different part of Texas; she had been born in a different part of Texas.  My uncle was one of six siblings.  So there was an uncle, Noah Moore, who passed away.  And there were daughters of Clanice [ph.] and Aileene [ph.], and a third daughter.  And I do remember that Clanice had attended college, and so was probably the first member of our family to have gotten college education.  And there was Jarvis [Christian College, Hawkins, Texas]--in Jarvis, Texas [sic.] where she went to school.  My uncle and aunt also were, had very strong Christian values and they were Baptists.  And, and so when we joined their family of course, I would attend the Baptist church, also on Sunday afternoons, in addition to Sunday mornings (laughter).  My uncle was a deacon in the church and always had very, very strong motivations for us to get a good education.  And he was active in the community in talking about the schools and whether the schools were good enough for Negroes, we were called at that time.  And you will also remember that we had de jure segregation, meaning by law, and therefore the schools were separate.  And the I.M. Terrell [High School, Fort Worth, Texas] from which I graduated was a segregated high school for blacks only.  And my uncle was always concerned about whether the quality of education that Negroes were getting in Fort Worth, Texas was comparable.  Of course, he knew it wasn't comparable to whites, but he wanted the black schools and black teachers to do the very best they could for the students and teach them as much as we could manage.
Speaker 1: Did your aunt and uncle have any children of their own?
Speaker 2: They did not.
Speaker 1: And do you remember what impact your mother's death had on you?  Do you remember that at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember being very sad about it, and for a while we, Aileene and I thought we probably were going to be taken by the social services and placed in an orphanage.  And that did not happen, and so we were always grateful to our uncle and aunt for stepping forward and volunteering to take us.
Story_ID: 217577
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your ancestry?  How much do you know about your ancestry?  Do you know if your people came from free people or slaves, or how, what do you know about your ancestry?
Speaker 2: We don't know very much.  I've talked to my sister [Aileene Green Davis], and she has a better memory than I do.  And she talked more frequently with my grandmother [Fannie Mae Stokes Moore], our grandmother.  And we think that somewhere in our background there may be American Indian [Native American] heritage, but we never heard conversations about slavery or different sets of forbears who may have been slaves, not saying they weren't, but it's just that we didn't hear anything about it.  And I guess the only reason I remember the references to possible American Indian tribes was the appearance of my grandfather [Henry Moore] on the wall and the color of my mother [Vivian Moore Green], and people have always told me that my high cheekbones sort of suggest that I have American Indian blood in me, but I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that--now I noticed on your questionnaire that you had a brother [Leonard Hansford Moore] who was a dancer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember him at all, and what kind of dancing he did?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember what kind of dancing, but I do remember when he would come home from time to time, and we'd all be delighted because we wanted to hear about the big city, and he eventually went to New York [New York] and then we never saw him again after that.  And he died in New York.  So, I don't know what kind of dancing he did, but we thought he was charming of course (laughter), and remember him that way.
Speaker 1: Now, did you all, were the older children much older than you and your younger sister?
Speaker 2: No, they were almost two to three years apart.  Leonard, our older brother, was the oldest and he was quite, or much older, but not the remaining five of us.  We were closer in birthdates.
Speaker 1: And so your siblings who, that passed on, was it during childbirth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or childhood diseases?
Speaker 2: Well, during their early childhood years when they passed on.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, if you will, tell us a little bit about your grandparents, starting with your maternal grandparents, their name and what you know about them?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been talking a little bit about my grandmother, Fannie Mae Stokes Moore, was her name, and very, how should I say, wise, I'd say tenacious.  I think that she could face adversity and manage to survive or figure out a way to solve the problems that she had to solve.  When you consider how long she lived, into her late eighties, and that she was alone essentially, I'm going to say for the last sixty years of her life, you see what I'm saying, and she owned property.  She had her own place that had the homestead, the house, and certainly enough grounds for two or three gardens, including a small patch at the end of what we used to call the potato crop area, and it was beside it a railroad.  We were in obviously a segregated black part of town in Fort Worth, Texas.  I remember her always giving us advice on how to live, how to see people for what they were, and how important it was for one to not be so interested in material things that you didn't keep your eye on the right set of values.  So she didn't have any objection to people moving into higher social economic levels, but she didn't particularly appreciate those who tended to look down on others if they weren't in their particular socioeconomic class, so, I remember those kinds of things about her.
Speaker 1: And what about your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: I do not remember any of my paternal--I didn't know them; didn't know anything about them, and I did not even know my grandfather.  I never saw him.  He passed away before I was born.  So, I don't know any more than that--
Story_ID: 217578
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, tell me what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Apparently as a toddler, I was very frisky and running around and very curious and things.  So I remember people saying that about me.  And my, my sister [Aileene Green Davis] remembers a nickname that I was called at the time, "Toodles."  And I guess I remember it, but I quickly forget it (laughter).  So, I remember people saying to me that I was frisky and sharp and bright, and smart.  So, I got that affirmation from adults, from some of the earlier years that I remember, um-hm.
Story_ID: 217579
Speaker 1: And can you share some of the memories with us, like, what were holidays like growing up?  What were Christmas and Thanksgiving like?
Speaker 2: Well, after my uncle [Richard Moore] and aunt [Mattie Mae Hicks Moore] took us [Jenkins and her sister, Aileene Green Davis], of course, there were times when we would visit our grandmother [Fannie Mae Stokes Moore].  We used to go out on the weekends and we would help her in her garden, and to help around the house.  So there were kind of annual family gatherings at her house, where you had the full spread of excellent food and I remember of course, the orange cake and the coconut cake, and I remember kind of a homemade brandy that she made out of peaches.  She had interesting there, trees.  There was a persimmon tree near the side of the house, there was a pecan tree at the corner of the front yard.  And I remember when the fruit would ripen, you had to be careful not to pick it too soon or try to eat it before it ripened because it would draw your mouth up and you would be warned about that of course, and sometimes you'd have to try the fruit and find out for yourself.  But, so I remember the seasonal kinds of things as being very warm family gatherings.  And our Uncle Noah and his wife, Aunt Alfreda [ph.] would be there, as well as we and our grandmother and stuff.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe what daily life was like as a small girl; you'd wake up in the morning and then what would you do next?
Speaker 2: I don't remember very much about it, but during school days of course, we were all getting ready to get to school and since there was one I.M. Terrell High School [Fort Worth, Texas], that's where we were struggling to get to.  I remember a little bit about the elementary grades because I stayed at home while my sister attended school.  And she would bring her books home and so I had the advantage of kind of getting her to read to me at home prior to my going to school.  They didn't have kindergartens at that time, so you just went right into first grade.  So when I arrived at elementary school, I had read all of my sister's books and so they put me a grade ahead and I joined her in her grade, in other words.  And that's why I was able eventually, to graduate from high school at age fourteen, although my fifteenth birthday came that summer following my graduation.  So, growing up was, Aileene and me being together all the time.  Certainly being at our grandmother's very, very often because that's where we went on the weekends, and certainly learning yard work.  I'm the best grass edger you've ever seen (laughter).  And I know how to pull up weeds by the roots.  We, I guess, essentially had some of the same kinds of concerns and kinds of tricks that most kids have in trying to do things you know you are not supposed to do.  And I was trying to recall to which degree, we got in much difficulty, but somehow I've seemed to have forgotten those (laughter), because I don't want to remember.  You see that I was nodding earlier.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Do, would you like to share, or would you mind sharing how your parents [Henry Green and Vivian Moore Green] passed away?
Speaker 2: They were both, it's very interesting, my father first, with a kind of pulmonary, a lung contraction.  And my mother also had some kind of lung problem, although it was years later when she passed away.  So, I believe that's what the death certificates say.  I don't remember the exact terminology, but essentially it was some sort of disease of the lung.  And it wasn't pneumonia.  They didn't say that it was tuberculosis, but I just know that it had something to do with the lungs.
Speaker 1: And could you please give your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Oh dear, all right, Leonard Hansford Moore, I believe, Rudolph [Green] was next, then Henry [Green], Aileene, myself, and then Paul [Green].
Story_ID: 217580
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe your block for us, the street that you lived on [in Fort Worth, Texas]?  Do you remember the name of the street?
Speaker 2: Actually, I remember vaguely.  When we were on Second Street with my aunt [Mattie Mae Hicks Moore] and uncle [Richard Moore] and it was a block of essentially row houses, almost kind of shotgun-like houses.  And we used to talk--you know when you'd come in the front door, you could see all the way to the back of them and things.  We, ours was furnished very modestly and I remember my uncle raised some pigeons in the back and from time to time we would have squab for dinner.  And it was very delicious the way my aunt prepared it.  At my grandmother's [Fannie Mae Stokes Moore] house, I mentioned that she owned her own property and she--her property certainly extended, you know, for country, wasn't huge acreage, or anything, and it wasn't farm size or anything, but she had that sort of plot of land where she was, and I'd say it was half a block or more, maybe three quarters of a block, the way the country roads at that time ran, but, she was practically alone in that particular area.  The next house was several yards away, and I'm not sure it even faced on the same street.
Story_ID: 217581
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up [in Fort Worth, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Well, I've mentioned the brandy, right, and the orange cake (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is that a smell?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I remember finding out how good green--not green beans, red beans taste with biscuits.  Have you ever had biscuits and red beans?  (Laughter) I remember being surprised by that.  And I also, in the recent years, have recalled how different the taste of short, strawberry shortcake is now, compared to what it was then.  You actually baked a kind of shortbread and then put the strawberries in between layers.  It was like having a very, very nice light biscuit with strawberries on it, and they don't make it that way anymore.
Speaker 1: So what sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, actually in my grandmother's [Fannie Mae Stokes Moore] house was a piano and my sister [Aileene Green Davis] and I would play around and tinkle on that piano.  We sort of taught ourselves enough chords that we could follow a song along in terms of the progression of the chords and eventually--shows you how small the church was, we would sit at the piano at the church and play these chords as the congregation sang, very, very small church, very, very small church.  And so we never became all that adept at playing the piano, but I remember our tinking [ph.] around on the piano a lot.
Story_ID: 217582
Speaker 1: We talked a little bit about elementary school.  But what else do you remember about elementary school?  Do you remember any of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Not so much my elementary school teachers, but I do my secondary school teachers.  And I particularly remember a Mrs. Louise Campbell, who actually taught children in class how to read music.  And that's how I learned how to read music, through my public school teacher.  And I also remember two teachers who, after I made straight A's all through school and graduated at fourteen and they saw it coming, decided that they knew I would get the Prairie View [State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] scholarship.  And they decided that I really should go to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  So they applied for me, and it was the, Mrs. [Juanita] Bates, the biology teacher and Mrs. Williams [ph.], the social studies teacher, who wrote and got that scholarship for me, and so I attended Fisk University from 1941 to 1945.  I--
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, just going back to the elementary school years, during that time period, what type of child were you around that time period?
Speaker 2: I don't know what other people would say, I think I was quick, a good student, we didn't dare misbehave.  I mean, you know, you are talking about a village raising a child, it really worked, and we wouldn't have dared not try our very best in school.  And because our uncle [Richard Moore] would immediately hear about it and we would learn the consequences.  So essentially I think I was considered a good student.
Speaker 1: Did you have dreams and aspirations at this time in your life when you were very young?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, not the way we talk about them these days.  I don't think I was hankering; I hadn't picked a possible vocation or avocation, or, what I was going to do.  I think I wanted to do well so I could do better and advance in life.  There was that sense, but I had not pinpointed, advanced to where, or to what, or how.
Speaker 1: And what were like the junior high school years like?  Do you remember some of your friends?
Speaker 2: I don't.  And I don't remember kind of junior high, isn't that funny.  I remember kind of an elementary stage and then a secondary stage.  I don't remember, but we probably might have had an intermediary school, I just don't recall.
Speaker 1: Do you remember, as a young woman, like during the preteen years, who was influencing you at that particular time?  Who were some of your role models and influences?
Speaker 2: You know, my sister [Aileene Green Davis] and I probably were the essential role models, that we were bouncing back and forth, and of course, our uncle and aunt [Mattie Mae Hicks Moore] and our grandmother [Fannie Mae Stokes Moore].  We were a close family.  We didn't necessarily socialize with a lot of other people.  We didn't have other close friends, our teenage years.  We had a cousin, her name was Joyce Colleen Moore [ph.], and she was the daughter of our Uncle Noah Moore, who I mentioned earlier and so that was our kind of nearest friend.  She was younger than we.  And so we didn't have a lot of interfacing and interrelationships with other families or other people our age, or anything of sort.
Speaker 1: What kind of subjects did you enjoy in school?
Speaker 2: I assume all of them, but I guess I found out in college that I must have found mathematics easier than some people do.  But, I liked music, of course.  And I certainly got the mathematics.  And so, that's about it.
Speaker 1: What kinds of activities did you participate in during (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was in the chorus, chorus.  And that continued on into my college years.  I was in the chorus at Fisk University as well.  And I was in the madrigal singers at Fisk University.  I was not in the famous [Fisk] Jubilee Singers, so I want to make that clear.  (Laughter)  So, I--
Speaker 1: How did you spend your time as a young girl?  What kinds of things did you like doing?
Speaker 2: Well, just fiddling around on the piano, or anything outside.  We really worked a lot in our grandmother's garden and stuff.  But, I don't remember much else.  We didn't go to many movies.  I think, it's funny, I remember being quite up in my teens, before I went to the movies and I remember the movie being 'Gone With The Wind.'  And I remember crying, crying buckets.  I had to lean over and let my tears roll between my knees; I was so taken with the movie.  But we didn't go out very much or socialize like that.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: I.M. Terrell High [School, Fort Worth, Texas].
Speaker 1: Now, were you bused to I.M. Terrell?  I know some kids were bused to I.M. Terrell.
Speaker 2: No, we probably walked.  We always walked long distances.  We walked from where my uncle and aunt stayed in Fort Worth [Texas], to my grandmother's place.  And so, I don't remember ever riding a bus to I.M. Terrell.
Speaker 1: And how, how long of a walk was it do you think?
Speaker 2: I don't want to say because I would simply be estimating and, because I don't remember.
Story_ID: 217583
Speaker 1: So, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, what year did you graduate from I.M. Terrell [High School, Fort Worth, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: And you were just fourteen years old.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that big news in town [Fort Worth, Texas] and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I think so, but there may have been another student who always, also was fourteen at that time.  I learned later on that that might have been so.  So, I'm not sure it was necessarily all that exceptional.
Speaker 1: Well, it was in the newspaper.  Was it odd or was it customary for graduations to be in the newspaper during that time?
Speaker 2: I can't answer that question.  I just don't know.  And I don't know why that little glib was in the paper about my going.  Probably because I got the second scholarship to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], maybe that's why it was in the paper.  And they also mentioned my age.
Speaker 1: Well, during the high school years, let me just ask you this, what were your thoughts about college?  Were you planning to go to college, or what were your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: I guess near the last few years I probably was anticipating going to college and assumed it would be Prairie View [State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], which was the state school for blacks.  It was one of the historically black colleges [and universities, HBCUs].  I hadn't known about Fisk University until the two teachers [Mrs. Juanita Bates and Mrs. Williams (ph.)] mentioned it.  And certainly didn't know about its heritage and reputation.  But was delighted that they sought to try to get that financial assistance for me and that I eventually attended.
Speaker 1: Was there any apprehension on the part of your aunt [Mattie Mae Hicks Moore] and uncle [Richard Moore], and even yourself about you just being fifteen years old going so far away from home?
Speaker 2: I think there was a little bit and there was cautioning.  I always think of that trip to Nashville [Tennessee] because I had never been out of Fort Worth, Texas at the time, was by train, and if you recall the Pullman porters were noted for their mentoring and caring for black passengers, especially the black young.  So my uncle, I'm certain talked with the Pullman porter on that Fort Worth end of the trip and told him I was going to Nashville and to keep an eye out for me.  Because blacks, or Negroes at that time, were not allowed to use the dining room of the cars, the train at that time, we carried our lunches in boxes.  We use to joke about the shoebox with the fried chicken in it.  And the--you had a special place on the train where you sat.  And so, it was the typical discriminatory activity which you would hear about.
Speaker 1: And were you the first to go away?  Did your sister [Aileene Green Davis] go away to college?
Speaker 2: No, she was just as bright as I, I felt, but my family wouldn't have been able to send both of us to college.  And we were going to have to utilize whatever scholarships and everything else even for me to get there.  So, I always regretted that she did not go to college.  And sort of, from time to time, since we're adults, I've sort of said, "Don't you want to get your college degree?  I'd help you if you want to."  But she decided she didn't, you know, need it or didn't want it.
Speaker 1: Was it hard on you all's relationship since you were so close, because you were going away?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It's interesting, I sort of sensed that because we had lost so much in terms of our father [Henry Green] and siblings, it's like we had figured out that you're going to be close to people and the close people will leave and you won't always be with them.  And so we made the adjustment, and so, that's the way we sort of managed our lives.
Story_ID: 217584
Speaker 1: And so let's talk a little bit about your time at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  So you were at Fisk from 1941 to 1945?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  And you can imagine my not being a sophisticated belle like some of the other young ladies at Fisk University who'd come out of the Northeast, out of Connecticut and New York and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], had excellent educational backgrounds and were very sophisticated about dormitories and girls and sororities and little power plays that you make.  I'm pretty sure I was sort of kind of like a young brat in my earliest months and stuff there.  I seemed to be in with the people who rolled toilet paper down the banister from time to time, these were pranks and things like that.  But I was a pretty good student.  I remember the dean of girls once sending a little questionable letter to my uncle [Richard Moore], but that didn't happen anymore.  So, (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: What did your uncle say?
Speaker 2: "Get straight," (laughter), in so many words.  So anyway, I think I became a pretty good student.
Speaker 1: What kinds of activities were you involved in at Fisk?
Speaker 2: I mentioned that I had also continued in music.  I was a member of the Fisk [University] Choir; it was led by a Dr. [Harold C.] Schmidt and with Mr. [Arthur] Crowley at the organ.  And I was also a member of the madrigal singers while at Fisk University.  I remember learning how to play ping pong, and so I was quite a devotee and sometimes a champion.  And the club at night that you know, we had a little student union place where we could go and play and we would also dance.  And I remember there was a student there who would dare any of us to eat cockroaches and show us how to do it.  But, that was about the extent of what I remember at any rate.
Speaker 1: And did you ever feel that you were so much younger than a lot of your other peers?  Was that ever--or were you all just kind of the same?
Speaker 2: No, I was quite a bit younger than my other peers.  I thought they were older and more experienced and both with life and with other kinds of social situations.  One of the things that Fisk does is also tries to accommodate and also expand and raise your social habits.  And so we girls in Jubilee Hall were taught how to dress appropriately, sit appropriately, speak appropriately, how to go to teas and manage teas.  I remember one time the university was visited by Marian Anderson and we all were absolutely agog, you know, to get a glimpse of her, to see her and meet her.  The famous Jubilee Hall, of course, is still on Fisk's campus.  And I enjoyed it immensely, being in this old dormitory.  Of course I didn't think it was old at the time.  I thought it was very elegant and I had roommates and was, you know, to go up and down those grand stairs with the banister and all, were just, I enjoyed it very, very much.  Loved it.
Story_ID: 217585
Speaker 1: And what did you study when you were at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, the usual subjects.  My major was mathematics and my minor was English.  And I remember in one of the first classes, one of my first math classes, when the teacher, who happened to be German, I think it was Dr. [Otto] Treitel, asked, when he asked about my siblings, and I had said they were dead, you know, you were asked about each one and I would say that he was dead and he--about my mother [Vivian Moore Green] and father [Henry Green] and I said they were deceased as well.  And he said, "Did death run in your family?"  And he didn't mean it, I don't think in a humorous way.  I don't know how he meant it, but I've always sort of remembered that question.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your favorite subjects in college?
Speaker 2: Well, that was, it's interesting, I don't remember much else, but I'm sure I had to take history because we had a famous professor there.  I took French under Professor Chatton [ph.], and of course we all enjoyed our whole time pretending to be him and speak like him, and to tease about the way he walked and talked.  I don't remember much else about the kinds of subjects that I took, but I enjoyed Fisk.
Speaker 1: And do, were there big differences between Nashville [Tennessee] and Fort Worth [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Because we were mostly on campus and didn't go downtown very much, I don't, I can't really document for you differences that I noted.  I can tell you, of course I was older, so I went to more movies, but the movies were segregated there as they were in Fort Worth, Texas.  And so Negroes had to go in too over the loges.  Now, I tease myself about, now thinking about it, in loges, in some theaters, those are really the best seats in the house, because you're up and you can look, but that's where the Negroes were sent, to the loges up in the balcony to see the movie.

Speaker 1: After you graduated from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: My sister [Aileene Green Davis] had been in war work and had--was in California and so I decided to join her.
Speaker 1: Your sister had done what?
Speaker 2: Aileene worked in war work.
Speaker 1: And what's war work?
Speaker 2: It was World War II [WWII], and so she had a job with the federal government working in a government job.  It was more like a kind of a clerical technician kind of position.
Speaker 1: All the way in California?
Speaker 2: Right, that's where she was employed.  And I got a job at Pacific Overseas Air Tactical Service Command [sic. Pacific Overseas Air Service Command, POASC].  Despite the fact that I had a college degree with a major in mathematics, I got a clerical position.  It was about equivalent to a GS-2 [General Schedule] or 3 at the time, and worked for them since the war was over in '45 [1945].  There wasn't much longer in terms of years that the government work related to the war went on.  By the way, I could mention that Uncle Richard [Moore], during the years that I was at Fisk, also got war work in San Antonio, Texas and some other parts of Texas as an aircraft mechanic.  And that was a wonderful boost to his skills and also to the monetary reward of doing that.  So, the advent of the war, I think helped blacks in many ways advance in the socioeconomic standing and their economic strength.
Speaker 1: And how long did you work in that clerical position?
Speaker 2: I'm going to guess about two and a half to three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so from about 1945 to 1948?
Speaker 2: I would guess.  And the reason I say that is because I at some time decided I would go ahead then and attempt to teach.  So it may not have been that long.  And I applied to the Berkeley Unified School District [Berkeley, California] to get a job and because my--isn't that terrible, when you asked me the subjects I took, I obviously took training to become an educator at Fisk University.  But it's funny I don't remember its being a kind of a block of curricula that you take, and yet I did student teaching under Dr. [George N.] Redd when I was there at Fisk University.  So it shows you how the aging process can play tricks on you.  So anyway, I was prepared to be a secondary school teacher of mathematics when I left Fisk University and applied in Berkeley [California].  And they had never hired a Negro at the secondary level in Berkeley.  So, I took some other jobs and went to the University of California at Berkeley [Berkeley, California] and took additional courses to prepare to get my elementary credential, it's called, so you can teach elementary school in the State of California, and then got that.  And I don't remember exactly whether the job with the Golden State [Mutual Life] Insurance Company as one of their writers, came immediately after the POASC, or the federal government clerical work that I did.  But I remember subsequent to the Golden State, and Golden State was one of the black insurance companies in the State of California (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And tell me a little bit about what you did there?
Speaker 2: I was a writer.  That means you sold policies.  You walked from door to door in Negro neighborhoods and attempted to have them understand the variety of insurance they could have and get them to agree to taking up a policy.
Speaker 1: Were you successful in that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, my mentor and co-writer used to say I was really a hard sell, and it was probably one of my first lessons in life were he suggested you have to use judgment.  You just don't bowl over the person and sell them the policy because you want to sell the policy and that's another tick on your record.  You want to think about their needs and also their ability to pay the policy and keep it going.  You know, they will come up, otherwise they come up with the money for the first two or three times and then they are not able to sustain it.  So from my co-worker at that time, I learned some very interesting life values that I should consider that were really my option to consider.  And so, I remember those.
Speaker 1: And so what did you do after you left Golden State Insurance Company?
Speaker 2: I believe that I then went to the Oakland Police Department [Oakland, California] where I was an identification clerk.  I learned how to classify fingerprints and to be able to match them.
Story_ID: 217587
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about what California was like in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Okay.  I would like to say it was like heaven.  It was interesting.  When I first arrived in California it was foggy and it was cold and the fog in the summer in July is unlike anything you can imagine.  You'd wonder how in the world could a temperate climate and a temperature that's probably maybe in the low 70s or high 60s feel so chilly.  And I'm sure it's because of our closeness to the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California] and the ocean.  So that was kind of a shock.  You know, expecting the sunny California that, that was the kind of climate that I had to get used to, but I got used to it.  I would love the fog.  My sister [Aileene Green Davis] and I and other friends that I had at the time, from time to time would drive over the Golden- not the Golden Gate Bridge, but the [San Francisco-Oakland] Bay Bridge from the Berkeley [California], Oakland [California] side to San Francisco [California].  Because we didn't have money we would sit in our car at the other end of the bridge until the sun would rise and so we could come back to the east toward the sun and see the sunrise in the morning.  I loved California.  We would--all the decades I was there from time to time, especially during my professional years, we would get a gang in the car and drive down to Carmel[-by-the-Sea, California].  We'd take Highway 1 [California State Route 1], where you'd see the beautiful cliffs, and the ocean, and the seaweed of course, and the beaches.  And go down to Carmel so we could be there for sunrise.  And Carmel has beautiful white sand, so even when the sun is not there, you probably can get a suntan just from the reflection of the sun on this white sand.  And so I loved Carmel and the Monterey [California] area.  Those were my loves in California.
Story_ID: 217588
Speaker 1: And what had you noticed in terms of the difference in the way that blacks were treated in California compared to Nashville [Tennessee] and Fort Worth [Texas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, right.  It did not have de jure segregation first of all.  Clearly, you didn't have colored fountains.  You weren't restricted from shopping in department stores.  You could practically get any kind of contractual agreement to purchase things on time, and if you wanted to, you obviously had to be very wise because there were people who would take advantage of you.  And so you always had to be wise.  There were some restrictions on housing.  Sometimes these were quietly under the table.  Sometimes there were written covenants to prohibit blacks or Negroes from living in certain areas.  If you applied for a job, you could apply for almost any job, you tended to be selected for those at lower and middle levels rather than at the highest level.  So there was still the impact of past discrimination on people.  That state had probably expanded faster than any other state in the United States with all of the immigrants from Oklahoma and Texas and Kansas who went west when, during the, I call it the [John] Steinbeck years, when they had a whole migration of people called the Okies, and it was especially into southern California (unclear).  It was a state rich in agriculture, rich in its actual geography and topography.  It had the beautiful Sierra [Nevada] mountains, so at wintertime, gorgeous snow.  We couldn't afford skiing, so sometimes we would struggle up the mountains, just drive up there and see the snow.  There were little baby hills and other things; you could play in the snow.  It also--you felt that anything you aspired to be you had a chance of perhaps being that there.  You were proud of the blacks who were professionally endowed, achieving things and accomplishing them.  Eventually of course, you had the head of the [California] State Board of Education; the superintendent of education of the State of California was a black male, Wilson [C.] Riles.  My first husband, Benjamin Wood, had a dear friend from Austin, Texas who had been in the service during the World War [II, WWII] and got the G.I. Bill, got his law degree after getting his first degree from the University of California and a number of people went on to get wider and broader education and professional degrees and did enormously well.  Wilmont Sweeney, who's now deceased and was a friend of my first husband, Benjamin Wood, was a judge, became a judge after becoming a lawyer and being part of a law firm.  And it's interesting; sometimes we go back and think every, practically every member of that law firm [Wilson, Metoyer, and Sweeney, and Broussard; Metoyer, Sweeney, and Broussard, Oakland, California] either became a judge or some other top state or national official, or prosecutor, or something else.  So they were a fantastic team of people and so you saw people doing things and what could be accomplished.  And that was very, very helpful.
Story_ID: 217589
Speaker 1: So after you left the Oakland Police Department [Oakland, California], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, I did apply for Berkeley [Unified School District, Berkeley, California] again.  And eventually was hired there in 1954.  So it was about nine years within the time that I went out to California, but probably it was much less than that when you consider the time I worked for POASC, Pacific Overseas Air Technical Service Command [sic. Pacific Overseas Air Service Command].  I was assigned to a second grade class, and the principal wondered if I'd be able to handle them, because they had sent two other teachers home (laughter).  And so, during my first hour or two, I remember his coming down the hall and peeking in the room to see if I had survived, and being reassured that they were sitting quietly at their seats.  So he figured that those little second graders had met their match.  And so that's how I began teaching in Berkeley [California].
Speaker 1: What made you different from the other two teachers?
Speaker 2: Probably, I didn't have better sense and so I knew I was going to be stern.  I guess, why would I let a second grader sort of run me out of the classroom?  It wouldn't make sense, so I probably went in with a kind of sense of knowing what to do.  And as I said, remember I had taken student teaching at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and so I just managed it I guess.
Speaker 1: And you taught for almost twenty years?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in education nineteen plus years, and the first, I guess, the first three years of my life I was an actual teacher in a classroom, and after the second grade they gave me higher grades, like fourth, fifth, sixth, sometimes we had combinations, fifth, sixth and so forth.  So I taught for three years and then I was appointed vice principal.  The first black woman certainly, vice principal at Lincoln [Elementary] School [Malcolm X Arts & Academics Magnet Elementary School, Berkeley, California], and I, after being in that position for a year, I was appointed to a principalship at Emerson [Elementary] School [Berkeley, California].
Story_ID: 217590
Speaker 1: Now interestingly enough, everyone thinks of Berkeley, California as being very liberal a place (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --it was not all that liberal and the schools were essentially segregated by neighborhoods.  And the white schools were in the hills, the foothills had schools that had both blacks and whites, and the flats had practically all black schools.  The schools had, most of the students were black.  The parents at Emerson [Elementary] School [Berkeley, California] had become concerned that their schools were practically all white and their students didn't even meet black kids until they entered junior high or high school.  And some of the parents felt our students, our children are going to be working in diplomatic posts, or internationally, and they are going to be disadvantaged in not having had any experience with other races and ethnic groups.  So they asked, actually they told the Berkeley [Unified School District] Board of Education, "We don't have any objection to your assigning a black teacher to our school."  And practically had to fight the board to get that considered.  But they eventually got a teacher.  Her name was June Long.  She was fantastic, just absolutely an outstanding teacher.  She had, she was teaching her fourth and fifth graders [William] Shakespeare, and fantastic art concepts and things.  So she was gifted.  And of course, they felt very good about that, so when--there was also the push to integrate not only teachers into the system, but the administration.  They decided to appoint [HistoryMaker] Harriett [G.] Jenkins to Emerson School because they knew the parents were more receptive to having a black principal.  I assume that they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So Emerson School was an all-white school.
Speaker 1: It was all-white.  Mostly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: --mostly all-white.
Speaker 2: Dr. Jenkins, what year was this?
Speaker 1: Oh dear--
Speaker 2: About?
Speaker 1: Let's see, if I started in '54 [1954], three, seven, '58 [1958], '59 [1959] to about '62 [1962], because I was there about three years before being appointed next to director of elementary education.
Speaker 2: What were your experiences like at Emerson?
Speaker 1: Oh, they were wonderful.  It was the marvelous school model where parents were very, very interested in their children; they were very active in the community.  Some of the parents there had been some of the leaders who were pressing the board over years to plan on integrating the students.  And there was very, very, rich, how shall I say, support for the students.  There were all kinds of activities that were provided after school on the campus, volunteer parents and things of that sort.  I remember being quite surprised when I found my little kindergartners practicing violin lessons with Mr. Shapiro [ph.].  They were using the Suzuki method, the Japanese method of learning how to play violins.  Of course that wasn't going on in the black schools in the flats of Berkeley.
Speaker 2: And was that disturbing to you?
Speaker 1: No, not disturbing, I was delighted.  But to know that first of all, you could do that in schools, and second of all, to see the variety of ideas that parents have about how they can enrich the education of their children.
Speaker 2: But, were you feeling though, that black children should be exposed to some of these same things as well in school?
Speaker 1: If it could be afforded, absolutely.  I think it would have been wonderful to have every child have that opportunity to go through--get that early music training and dexterity in the fingers.  I think it would have been wonderful to have foreign languages starting very early.  And there were some volunteer efforts going on in some schools.  Interesting enough, we were on the cutting edge in Berkeley in many ways in the kind of educational programs that we had going on there.  So at that school, District Y [ph.], there had been a move to give more attention to special education and to be able to look at students who were at least trainable.
Story_ID: 217591
Speaker 1: There always been questions about whether you should have a special education class for kids who are either mentally retarded or have limitations, or have some sort of physical disabilities so that they cannot learn the way other youngsters can learn.  And so they, the issues get to be should they be in a class all by themselves, or should you integrate them into the regular class and then have the ability to be able to pull them out of that class when you need to work with the specific skills they need.  And so at Emerson [Elementary School, Berkeley, California] and I'm sure that was true at other schools as well, we had the youngsters integrated into their regular classrooms, but they also had a room that was the special education room.  And Phil Hatlen worked with them and there might have been a youngster who was limited by sight, might have been blind, or might have been crippled, or might have been autistic, or might have had limited mental capacity.  But, Phil could work with them individually and he could pull them from their classes, as they needed to be pulled during the classroom day.  The rest of the time they were learning how to get along with other children.  And I remember one time walking into a classroom and the blind youngsters knew their way around the building, so they would come down the hallway, sometimes touching it to get to their classroom and they'd walk into class, and as they would walk into class sometimes they would bump into the seat of a student.  I remember one day a student is writing his paper and he just takes his hand and just shares, and shoves the kid a little bit around his chair to help guide him so he can get to his seat in the room without stopping a beat of what he's doing on, at his desk and doing his work, and I thought it was just a wonderful picture of how well integrated and how accepting the regular kids were of those youngsters with the special needs.
Speaker 2: Now, was the same thing taking place for black students in special education?
Speaker 1: I assume so, yes.  I assume so, because once we decided to go with that model and to even distinguish between those who were trainable and those who could get full academic load and work, but you just needed to make other variations.  At that time we didn't have all of the technology we now have, so that you can use readers for instance, or large print.  They were using braille, braille books for the most part for the blind students that we had at Emerson.
Story_ID: 217592
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about desegregation with two-way busing that was taking place in Berkeley [California].
Speaker 2: Right.  I, first of all, keep in mind now, Berkeley is a conservative town and gown, with the major seat is the University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California], very well-noted campus.  Had the highest number of Nobel [Prize] laureates on its campus and so forth.  So it surprises some to find out that originally, especially in the '50s [1950s] and earlier, that that had been a conservative town and most of the key positions on the Berkeley [City] Council and on the Berkeley [Unified School District] Board of Education had been held by Republicans, probably conservative and moderate, and that they essentially never passed taxes to help improve the school system.  So what you had is a growing city that was getting more and more minorities, blacks were a substantial proportion of the students in the school, number of students in the Berkeley schools, about fifteen thousand.  And there were people who were very active in the community were saying, "We've got to change this picture, we have all black schools and they're very, very poor.  They don't have the same quality or number or quantity of texts, the number of teachers, the high class size, versus our white schools, especially our white elementary schools in the hills."  There were a number of studies in the community, got together and made recommendations that they should desegregate the schools.  They were going to desegregate the secondary schools first, meaning the middle grades, or the junior highs.  The last political accommodation was to do it in stages.  And so, they went--Willard [Middle School, Berkeley, California] had already had a mixed student body.
Speaker 1: And Willard was?
Speaker 2: One of the junior highs.  And Garfield [Junior High School; Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, Berkeley, California] actually was desegregated later.  And they weren't doing the elementary schools at that time.  That was in 1963, '64 [1964].  Well, when the first plan was proposed to desegregate the schools and everyone knew that they were aiming for eventual desegregation of the whole thing, the Berkeley board of education had to withstand a recall election, if you can imagine.  Now, some of the members were going off the board anyway, Roy Nichols, had been appointed to a bishopric I guess, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania; sic. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] or in Pennsylvania, certainly western Pennsylvania.  And eventually [Spurgeon] "Sparky" Avakian was appointed to judge and stuff, so it ended up that Carol Sibley and [S.J.] Maisel had to withstand that recall election.  Well, they won of course, and everyone was happy, but the community went through one of the most remarkable educational programs of informing people and parents and teachers and working together that you've ever seen.  And, so eventually in about '68 [1968] they desegregated the, the elementary levels.  Now keep in mind the flats schools with mostly black students, K-6, and the white hills schools with mostly white students K-6, and, went through enormous planning and involvement of parents and community leaders and students to plan how we would do that.  And they looked at several models and eventually said, the best thing for the kids is that we have to have two-way busing.  We will not put the burden only on the black families.
Speaker 1: Was there resistance from white parents?
Speaker 2: All the time.  There was a group that they called the PANS [Parents Association for Neighborhood Schools], probably parents for something, and so jokingly Berkeley would pretend it had the pots and they were talking about the pots and pans, and the pots of course, were forcing desegregation, and the pans were against it.  And they were a very active and, well, I wouldn't say barely lost, because actually on the recall election, it was a sizeable victory for Carol Sibley, who was a member of the board and who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had she supported the plan?
Speaker 2: --right, oh yes, all the time, and Maisel.  And they beat their opponents who had been put together by the Republican Party and were supported by PANS.  What I want to tell you is that people like Dr. Marie Fielder who was a psychologist from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] came into the community and did an outstanding job of training our teachers and our parents to bring about this enormous change.  I should also mention that she was working at the University of California [Berkeley, Berkeley, California] at the time, running a program where you trained talented minorities for administrative jobs in urban school systems.  And from her work at the university, you know, since that time, a number of her students have held fantastic and significant jobs across the nation, not the least of which, Richard Hunter, who was in the Berkeley Unified School District at the time, and actually led one of the studies as we were doing the desegregation effort, went on to become superintendent of schools in such places as Richmond [Virginia] and Baltimore [Maryland].  He served on the faculty at the University, not the, yes, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [Chapel Hill, North Carolina], professor of education and is now at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].
Story_ID: 217593
Speaker 1: Do you think that [Berkeley Unified School District, Berkeley, California] desegregation effort was successful?  Would you, looking back on it today, would you characterize it as a success?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And it was a particularly emotional success for those who were involved in it.  Because what they would do, they would, they invited every single person in Berkeley [California] to have input into the plan.  If they wanted to suggest which model should be used, they could submit plans to do that.  If they wanted to raise issues about what you needed to be concerned about, they could do that.  There were all kinds of committees.  There were all kinds of PTAs [Parent Teacher Association] involved.  They even had a student group who reported, would have been the fifth graders who would have been the seniors going into the sixth grade, who formed groups they had been representatives of the fifth grade classes, who met with the superintendent.  So they could raise issues and things.
Speaker 1: Did it increase resources at the black schools?
Speaker 2: Well, see what happened was, the black youngsters who were grades K [kindergarten] through three were bused into formerly white schools, and the fourth through sixth grade children who would have made up that school were bused into the formerly black school.  So what you had in formerly white schools was an integrated mix of K through three and then fourth through sixth in the black school.
Speaker 1: But those black schools, were those black schools equal to the white schools, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: They weren't before the integration, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --but certainly after the integration you had integrated staffs, you had integrated kids, you had a fantastic curriculum waiting in the classroom (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: What about the resources?
Speaker 2: Yes, they got resources, by the way, from the ESEA, what's that, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, federal funds to help with the busing and help with resources.  There had been a number, they got monies from Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and some other sources to help train parents as teacher aides in some of the programs they were starting in the schools, because there was always innovation going on.  We had what you call university lab schools in Berkeley.  We had creative teachers.  We even had what you call alternative schools started at Berkeley and had a wide variety of those going on, even as we were desegregating.  So outstanding innovative math programs, multi-cultural school curricula, Dr. Kathryne Favors, who was our intergroup education coordinator, did an outstanding job of preparing all of us.  She had developed materials for the kids and materials for the teachers as well as parents--
Story_ID: 217594
Speaker 1: In 1974, you left Berkeley [California] and the world (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually 1973.
Speaker 1: --seventy-three [1973] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the world of education, what precipitated that move?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I was doing very well in education.  You probably noted that after I left the principalship at Emerson [Elementary] School [Berkeley, California], I was appointed director of elementary education in the mid-'60s [1960s].  So I was part of all this planning for the desegregation and also head of some of the curriculum committees of those who wanted there to be a good education program at the end of the bus line, we said.  I was appointed to assistant superintendency in about '71 [1971] and I got married in 1972 and joined my husband and left the Berkeley Unified School District in 1973.
Speaker 1: Because your husband was in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes, my husband lived in Washington, D.C.  That was George Lee Jenkins, Jr.
Speaker 1: Did you want to leave education in Berkeley, or were you excited about the new opportunities in Washington, D.C.?  What were your feelings about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to join my husband in Washington, DC.  I do not like four seasons weather after being spoiled with the temperate climate of California, but that was the most objection I had to coming to the East Coast.  I will tell you in a minute about my reception though, and when I looked for jobs in this area.  I wanted to underscore a couple of things.  The effort in Berkeley was brought about by a wide variety of people who were outstanding in doing their tasks.  Such people as a Larry Wells [Lawrence L. Wells] and a Robert Whiteneck, who did the special education programs that I was telling you about, a Dr. Ramona Maples, who helped immensely.  But the three superintendents, we were one--we had a Dr. Winterberg [sic. C.H. Wennerberg], in the late '50s [1950s], in the early '60s [1960s], and he was followed by a Neal [V.] Sullivan, a Dr. Neal Sullivan, who was the superintendent, who reopened the Prince Edward [County, Virginia] schools, remember Prince Edwards [sic.], Virginia.  They closed the black schools, closed all the schools because they didn't want to follow the law and integrate their schools and the whites went to private academies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --afforded by the state.  He was the superintendent during the desegregation of schools, so he was just fantastic in getting all this involvement of the students, teachers and community.  He was followed by a Dr. Richard [L.] Foster, who was the one who appointed me to the assistant superintendency, and essentially did that by setting up two assistant superintendents, one of administration and one--who was a white male--and one of instruction.
Story_ID: 217595
Speaker 1: So were you thinking you would still pursue education when you came to Washington, D.C. (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, and submitted my application to Prince George's County [Maryland] and Washington, D.C. and Montgomery County [Maryland]--
Speaker 1: This was in the early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: This was in 1973 to be exact, Montgomery County.  I got no takers and I, everybody had told me when I had left Berkeley [California], "You won't have any trouble, you'll be snapped up right away.  You'll get a job, don't worry, don't worry."  Well anyway, I was not offered a job, but I had applied for those three places including the county in which I now reside, and I remember having talked to the assistant superintendent, Dr. [J. Edward] Andrews, here in Montgomery County.  And I was also being interviewed by a federal agency, the Commission on Education [U.S. Department of Education] and they were considering me for the director of the Teacher Corps Program and the--one of their top persons, who had helped us in the Berkeley [Unified School District] schools actually was managing a program for the aged and adult education.  He was outstanding.  He lost his federal funding and so, although I had had an interview where they told me they wanted me and when they invited me back to the second interview, it was to tell me regretfully that they had to put this other person in the position and that they were very, very sorry.  So after I finished that interview, I went to Bill's [ph.] office and said to him, "You took my job.  You have to help me find a job."  And he good heartedly said, "Okay."  And that day home in his ride group, he told his friend about this person whose job he had taken (laughter) and I was called by a Dr. Dudley McConnell of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], interviewed, and he told the administrator of NASA that he would like to hire me as his deputy assistant administrator for equal opportunity programs.  I got a call on February 14th from Dr. James [C.] Fletcher of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who offered me the job, and I said yes.  I had been looking for three or four months and had even served in a kind of consultancy way with an educational company that was working in the Washington, D.C. schools on the Right to Read Project.  And so I told him, yes, I would take the job.  And the very next day Dr. Andrews from Montgomery County called and offered me the assistant superintendency (laughter) in Montgomery County.  That's how close I came to getting a job or staying in education.
Speaker 1: But was the NASA job a little bit more appealing because it was not in that traditional educational realm?
Speaker 2: In all honesty I can't say that was my rationale.  That was the job I was offered and I was looking for a job and had been so close and hadn't gotten the other.  So I took the job at NASA.  I figured it was related to what I had been doing because we certainly had been working in civil rights and integration and integration of systems and organizations in Berkeley and had actually done it in the public school system.
Story_ID: 217596
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what were some of your biggest accomplishments at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, helping the management understand the nature of the problem we were trying to fix (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was that problem?
Speaker 2: --and how the problem was getting more minorities and women, in particular, especially, and disabled individuals into disciplines and positions where they traditionally had not been placed.  So that meant getting them into science and engineering careers so they were trained and able to do the work at NASA.  And certainly once they were hired, ensuring that they were equitably treated, that they were promoted when they did good work, just like non-minorities and--
Speaker 1: Was it a huge learning curve?
Speaker 2: Not for all of them.  There were some that fully understood that and knew it.  NASA had received a lot of negative publicity before I got there and so we had congressional oversight and the agency was having to report quarterly to a Senator [William] Proxmire, who was monitoring and checking and making sure NASA changed.  Dr. [James C.] Fletcher, the administrator, told [U.S.] Congress, frankly, during the era that NASA built up to put a man on the moon they hadn't been as sensitive to that need as they should have been.  And so, although they were downsizing, they had the full attention of the top management as well as the mid and lower levels of managers and supervisors at NASA that that had to be done.  So I was helped in my tasks by people there who knew it was important, merit-wise, who also knew it was important in terms of congressional oversight in NASA's budget and also knew it was important in terms of the impact it was going to have on the nation as a whole in getting more people into these vital kinds of positions, and they had to have the kind of university education needed to do that.  So, we were able to get the managers to buy into affirmative action goal setting.  Of course we had the oversight regulatory agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], which required us to develop affirmative action plans and submit those every year and to make multiple plans and we also were able to get a system of top management monitoring of what was going on.  We had general manager reviews monthly for all of the programs at NASA, the technical ones as well as the support ones.  I became a part of that review process.  And so we would show, hold up a kind of a mirror to the agency to itself to show how well it was doing.  And so the goals were set, what they thought they could hire and also monitor, not quotas, I want to make that quite clear, they did not set quotas.  We did not use quotas.  And we monitored hiring, promotion and we eventually, we wanted to look at the training, how they were preparing people.  We wanted to look at the rewards received in the agency and we wanted to have the agency's enormous contribution to educational programs ensure that blacks and women and disabled persons, students, were participating in all those education programs.
Speaker 1: Who do you think benefitted the most, blacks, women or disabled?
Speaker 2: I suspect women largely, there were larger numbers and I think because they had a larger resource pool that they probably benefitted the most from affirmative action period.  But that isn't to be, that answer to your question isn't intended to mean that they are at any--at fault because they benefitted the most, just in terms of sheer numbers and being available and ready.  I think also people sometimes were able to see the rationale much more clearly when they could see the impact on white women.  And I remember on one of our science and technology committees a little anecdote being told by a person--it was the husband of a women who was a biologist and when he figured out how much lower her salary was, being paid in a job where she was required to be a biologist, and saw the impact on his family, he understood very well why we needed to correct the problem.  Even when women had their degrees and were signed they weren't necessarily being treated equitably.
Story_ID: 217597
Speaker 1: I think a lot of times when people think of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] they don't realize that it's a huge organization and what comes to mind, mainly, are astronauts.  And during that time period the face of an astronaut was not that of an African American.  What kind of effort was underway to help to change that image and help to create, you know, the face of an African American when an astronaut came to mind?
Speaker 2: You articulated it very well because that's exactly the story we pointed out to the agency; that you said with this marvelous group of persons you selected to fly in space that somehow a minority can't do it, or a minority and a woman can't do it.  And the--NASA has a very thorough set of processes they go through to select--you get thousands of applications and you have to winnow those down.  And so you have a selection process and a selecting committee.  And Dr. Joseph [D.] Atkinson [Jr.], the EO [equal opportunity] officer at the [Lyndon B.] Johnson Space Center [Houston, Texas], was on that committee, and he also documented the processes for selection of the astronaut corps and wrote his doctoral dissertation on that.  The bottom line is in essence: we needed to notify the whole nation that we planned to integrate the astronaut corps.  We encouraged people who had the qualifications to apply and we sent people out really recruiting and looking and encouraging people to believe us, that we really meant what we said, that if they could qualify, they could be selected and they should send in their applications.  We even used Nicole [sic. HistoryMaker Nichelle Nichols], I'm blocking on her name, she was in Star Wars [sic. Star Trek].  There was a black female, I don't know if you remember her name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: --anyway, she helped us in the recruiting, she and her firm [Women in Motion, Inc.].  And you will recall that of course, Sally Ride was the first female and she was followed by lots of others.  And you will recall that [HistoryMaker] Guion Bluford, Ron McNair [Ronald McNair] and Fred [HistoryMaker Col. Frederick Drew Gregory], he's by the way the deputy administrator of NASA right now (laughter), Greg, Greg, Frederick Gregory (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Frederick Gregory.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And since that time, there was another black that was selected and there have been lots of blacks since that time.  [HistoryMaker Gen. Charles] Bolden [Jr.] also was selected after the first group.  And so we were very gratified that first of all, it proved fantastic talent was out there.  And second of all, that they could go through a competitive process on their merit and be selected--
Story_ID: 217598
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, in terms of the overall program of increasing diversity at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], were you finding that you were meeting some resistance, like during the '80s [1980s] time period, during the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan-[President George Herbert Walker] Bush years, were there some, was there some resistance there?
Speaker 2: You're asking whether it had changed from what it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --when I first came in, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --As a matter-of-fact, when I first came to NASA I believe President [Richard Milhous] Nixon was the president and in the--he actually established a number of the innovative federal programs for small and minority business persons and some other activities.  And I think there were executive orders from both Democratic and Republican presidents supporting efforts for the historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs].  So, no, I didn't sense that there was, there was a change or much resistance.  You always had people who were a little less motivated than others, but the, I think the thrust and the momentum at the agency continued.  And I'm pleased to say as we looked at what needed to be done, our program was broader even than just the hiring and the promotions, or just integrating the astronaut corps.  We thought that everything NASA did, its utilization of its procurement dollars, rather there were minority, minority business persons and women business owners applying for and getting selected, either for the major contracts or the sub, the smaller subcontracts, so we pushed that as one of the major emphases.  We also said, your research dollars, you have substantial numbers of research dollars, and they are mostly in the top-notch research universities, but there is talent sitting at these smaller universities that historically have been training the black talent in the nation.  And we had the help of every single one of the administrators, plus Dr. Hans Mark, who was deputy administrator in subsequent years as well as George Low, who was the first deputy that I worked with, who were very good at fashioning ways to do things managerially in the organization to get things done.
Story_ID: 217599
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, when we left off we were talking a little bit about just some of the initiatives that were taking place at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] in terms of diversity and that kind of thing and how diversity was happening in all facets of NASA.  And you know, can you just tell us a little bit about how you were starting to see the organization change, not only in the way that it looked, but how was that diversity helping within the organization?
Speaker 2: We had people managing other programs being more concerned about when they were reaching broadly into all the communities and ethnic groups and so when we first started and Jurgen [G.] Pohly, as a matter of fact, who was managing the minority university program at NASA, asked to join my staff because of our interest in helping to get more minority researchers and faculty involved in NASA's faculty development programs and in their research efforts.  And he did join, and we created and built a vibrant and robust minority university program.  We also helped establish research centers at seven historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs] and those were funded first, for a five year span and for a second five year span, and then we encouraged all science, engineering and mathematics faculty members, if they were interested in doing NASA research, to apply for their faculty researchers and grants and also for their faculty the ASEE [American Society for Engineering Education] summer experiences, and we established graduate student researchers programs and undergraduate student researchers programs to raise awareness of minority students in these various universities.
Speaker 1: And were you finding that they were out there?  They, they existed, or were you finding that it was a little hard to get to them?
Speaker 2: We don't have nearly enough minority students in the sciences, in the mathematics, in the engineering that we need to have.  And that's always been a need and we keep saying that, every national committee keeps saying it and now even today if you were to go look at statistics when they talk about the number of jobs in the future and whether we're going to have available engineering and scientific talent to cover those jobs period, and certainly don't have enough minorities represented in the group, so it is still in need and it is still a message that needs to be gotten out.
Speaker 1: And is that kind of disappointing for you as, number one, an educator, and also as someone who majored in mathematics?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm disappointed that the progress hasn't been faster and that we haven't had more students prepared.  But I'm very impressed with the ones who are coming through the system and later on I'll chat just a little bit about some of those youngsters who are in some of the programs.  I was going to mention that in addition to these research centers, we saw changes in the agency itself.  The associate administrators who really managed the technical, scientific and engineering programs of the agency had more buy-in and were supporting the programs with more dollars.  And so the amount of dollar support for not only historically black colleges and universities, but also Hispanic serving institutions, as well as tribal colleges and universities--
Speaker 1: For Native Americans?
Speaker 2: Native Americans, and that has been a joy and a pleasure to see.  So it's-- I commend the agency for its effort and the way it went about it, and of course, we were noted for a long time as having one of the best programs in the federal government.  And I assume that maybe that's still going on.
Speaker 1: And it you had to choose one thing, what would be your proudest accomplishment at your time, your tenure at NASA?
Speaker 2: I'd say, getting the teamwork to accomplish some of the things I've just described.  I have enjoyed very, very much my work at NASA and the kind of people I had to work with.  I had an outstanding staff in the [NASA] Office of Equal Opportunity Programs [NASA Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity (ODEO)].  And I still see them, although it's been twelve years since I was at the agency.  They're very gracious and they're kind enough in my birthday month to see if there is a way for us to kind of get together.  We used to have so many staff members in my office who had birthdays in July.  We just called that the birthday month and we would do something, and so we continue to do that in many ways.
Story_ID: 217600
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, there is a fellowship program, I believe, in your honor at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  Could you tell us a little bit about that and how that works and when it was established?
Speaker 2: After I left the agency, you will notice that the agency certainly gave me excellent feedback while I was there that the agency appreciated the program, the way we were going about it, and got--I've gotten numerous administrators, presidential, as well as agency awards while I was at NASA.  After I left, and I left in 1992 to take the position with the United States Senate, they called me back to give me an equal opportunity award [NASA Equal Employment Opportunity Medal], for the second time, about two years after that.  And then I learned that the UNCF, United Negro College Fund Special Programs was writing a proposal to run a program that would identify and support minority students, minority women as well as disabled students in the, what they call the STEM disciplines, and that's science, technology, engineering and math.  And I couldn't believe it.  I said, oh, it will never be approved.  What in the world made you guys do this?  What do you think it is?  And they kept reassuring me, no, no, we think we have a pretty good chance to write this proposal and win funding.  And they did, and, it was established.  I could not believe it.  And, and it's named after me.  It's called the Harriett G. Jenkins Predoctoral Fellowship Program [sic. Harriett G. Jenkins Predoctoral Fellowship Project].  It's been going for four years, twenty students are selected each year.  The students have to have gotten their first degree in one of those four discipline areas I mentioned, and been accepted at a university for a graduate program in which they are applying for their master's [degree] and hopefully for their doctorate actually.  We'd like for them to be able to say right up front they're willing to go for the doctorate.  At any rate, twenty students per year, we've had four years, so this past July at Orlando, Florida, I was able to see all four cohorts, all eighty kids, they're in my program.  And there is kind of a sister program, but these are more advanced researchers in the, what's called the NASA Administrator's Fellowship Program [sic. NASA Administrator's Fellowship Project].  And they are faculty members, already have their doctorates in many instances, and they're going on to do additional doctoral work and research.  And they agreed this summer to mentor these younger students who are working on their doctorates and master's in the Jenkins Program.  So I feel very, very good about that.
Story_ID: 217601
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your work in the [U.S.] Senate.  Why did you leave NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and go to the Senate?  And this was in 1992?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Senate came looking for me, and they asked me to come up and head their first Office of [Senate] Fair Employment Practices that had been created in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  I couldn't believe them and I was kind of reluctant to leave NASA, I knew we had an outstanding program and I didn't know what it was like to work in a political environment, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And plus it's not like you not to have a job for twenty years at the same place (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  And so I told them well, you know I'd be giving up a lot leaving NASA.  Here are the things I have accomplished and I've always been appreciated and I've been roundly rewarded and they give me bonuses each year, and this is the amount of money I make.  And not only that, my retirement from the federal government, retirement from the federal government is very ideal and can you match that?  Well, we went back and forth and back and forth for a while and they, they finally matched what I was raising and I didn't have any more objections, so I was appointed and it took the joint effort of [Senator] George Mitchell, who was then the majority leader for the Democrats and [Senator] Robert ["Bob"] Dole, who was the minority leader for the Republicans recommending my appointment, and the president pro tem [pro tempore] of the Senate, [Senator] Robert Byrd, actually signed off and made the actual appointment.  And so I went up there and had a small staff, my deputy was Charles Moore, who'd had an outstanding federal career and was an attorney; Valerie Olson, my counselor, who had worked for many years at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], and eventually Raj [K.] Gupta was sort of lent to us on assignment and he also had been an administrative judge and also had years of experience at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  And I had staff members, Manny [ph.] and Aurora Carmichael, so we had a wonderful small staff, but very, very, competent staff.
Speaker 1: And what, what were you all doing?  What were you doing?
Speaker 2: Our purpose was to oversee and provide a process for Senate employees who alleged they'd been discriminated against, or some part of the Civil Rights Act had been breached.  And we also were to make sure the Senate staffs were aware of what the law was so they wouldn't breach the law.  And so we put great emphasis on training and explaining to people what were the sorts of traps they could fall into.  What were some of the human resources issues that were likely to get them in trouble and how they could avoid that with good management and human resources procedures?  And we seemed to have been appreciated and people liked what we did.  So then the [U.S.] Congress decided they would expand what we had been doing in the Senate to all of the congressional offices, that includes the [U.S.] House of Representatives as well as the Library of Congress, the General Accounting Office [U.S. Government Accountability Office], and there are about some nine or eleven congressional entities and agencies.  And so they are now all under--they created the Congressional Accountability Act [of 1995].  They have a slightly different way of processing and they set up kind of an oversight board that is appointed by the president as well as the Congress and our office closed down.  So we feel that we helped lead to this kind of appropriate coverage for all of the congressional offices and staff members.
Speaker 1: And, and you, and you continued to do that until 1996?
Speaker 2: Did indeed.  And then after my tenure in the office seized, I spent probably another three months on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] in small, short-term assignments with various committees: Judiciary Committee, the Labor and Education Committee and I think it was Agriculture, Nutrition [and Forestry] Committee.  And that was a good experience as well, getting to work in those other offices.  And then I went over for three months to serve with one of the commissioners of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Reginald [E.] Jones, commissioner, and he was looking at and doing a study of the corporate entities over which EEOC has regulatory oversight.  And to find out what were some of the best practices they'd utilized there, because he thought that would be very good information to capture for others in corporate entities as well as in the federal sector.  And we--I worked with another team member in his office and we gathered the information and put it in a publication and, so that was a good experience also for the three months.
Story_ID: 217602
Speaker 1: And when did you begin work with the Montgomery County Commission on Human Rights [Montgomery County Human Rights Commission, Rockville, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I joined that commission, must have been, let's see, when I retired in '97 [1997] from the federal sector.  I probably was out about one, or two, or three years before I put in my first term on the commission.  And essentially that's a volunteer effort--what you do is select the executive, the county executive, in this case it was [Doug] Duncan, county executive (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Duncan.
Speaker 2: --Duncan, know that you're interested in serving the county in a volunteer way.  There is no pay or anything.  And I was appointed and served one three-year term, and now in my second three-year term.  And that is a very important responsibility here in the county because the county statute requires and charges us with ensuring that citizens are not discriminated against in housing, in employment and in public accommodations because of their race, gender, religion, marital status.  And there are about nine bases that you cannot discriminate against citizens here about and for, and so, that's--it's very important work.
Speaker 1: And are you seeing that the complaints are changing a little bit in terms of who's filing them as like the county changes in terms of its diversity?  I mean, are most of the complaints filed by African Americans?
Speaker 2: It may still be that if we were to go back and do an account just by ethnic group, we would find that the majority are, but there are quite a few Hispanics or certainly with names sounding Hispanic that also have been filing concerns.  And there are Caucasians who also file complaints of being discriminated against.  So, but I still think it's still probably, it's predominately black.
Story_ID: 217603
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts on affirmative action in general?
Speaker 2: That it was very necessary.  I don't think the change and the progress that we've seen would have occurred without it.  And I think that despite the fact that a lot of people try to, how shall I say, bad mouth it and use the most distorted interpretations they really tried their best to make affirmative action quotas when there are not.
Speaker 1: Do you support quotas?
Speaker 2: When they are judicially decided after looking at the data and the case has gone through court, and by the way, that's the way it was being applied.  The courts were saying, thou shalt hire X number of police officers, because those were the kind of cases in which that was occurring, or this number until you get because the entity, the city or the county had done everything they could to avoid bringing on blacks.  And sometimes there were even unions who were involved in, in excluding.  Because you couldn't get into certain positions unless you went through the unions, and the unions were not hiring blacks so, or bringing them into the union.  So, I think it was certainly a very necessary change process, but I've always felt that eventually that if we're doing the right thing, we eventually are not going to need it.  And things will be happening.  As a matter of fact I think an organization is moving if you say, you say that we're not there yet and we've accomplished--when you've accomplished it means that people are coming into your organization, being promoted and its people, their top levels, middle levels, as well as the lower levels and it's doing that automatically without your having to have an equal opportunity office or a [HistoryMaker] Harriett [G.] Jenkins prodding your organization to get it done.  That it's just being done automatically on its own, and then you know that affirmative action isn't needed.
Speaker 1: And what are some of your thoughts in reference to the Michigan case involving affirmative action and education?
Speaker 2: Well, if you recall, there were two cases, one was the regular school and getting minorities in and the kind of quota they were using [Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003] and there was the law school [Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003].
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the regular school, just the undergrad case.
Speaker 2: I think it is unfortunate that that case was brought although I certainly understand the feelings of the student who brought it.  But the other part of the question never gets asked.  How did she compare with all of the rest of white students who did not get accepted at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?  Nobody asked that question.  Nobody ever looks at that data.  And it just makes it look like because she was better than--that her scores were better than one black student therefore it was discriminatory.  And if that is the absolute way they used the scores it shows you the weaknesses and the problems with that.  Normally it's better to use scores as a variety of things, it's not the only factor you're looking at.  You are looking at many things that a student can bring to bear in a university.  And many universities have tried to explain that to the public so they understand it, but it's unfortunate, but she had every right to bring the case.
Speaker 1: Why do you think diversity is important, not only in education, but just in general and in every facet of society, why do you think diversity is important?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the first and most important reason for me is this country's history has made race so important.  It has permeated everything we've done.  So we've got to understand how to get past that, how to understand people and respect them beyond the color of their skin.  And this applies also with other ethnicities.  There are some people who immediately think of the immigrants only in terms of their being different from themselves, or that they're Hispanic or they're Latino, or they have concerns about--I remember in northern Virginia when the Vietnamese first started to come over there was such a hullabaloo and within a year or two they found out that they were very good neighbors, they were very bright people.  Their kids were doing well in school and the objections sort of went away.  I can't tell you how important it is for us to be multicultural in knowledge, to be able to understand there are people who are different from ourselves who've been brought up differently, have different beliefs, but they're still human beings, they can get along in the world and we need to know how to get along with them.  And now you have all the issues of Islam and Muslims and other Arabics and other groups that we've not even been aware of and we see all the multiple languages alone that we need to learn and it's quite a challenge.  Many of us were exposed to some of the European languages.  I took French in school.  Of course I can't speak French now.  And I've been promising myself I'm going to learn how to speak Spanish.  But I couldn't even grasp Farsi, you see, and I'm saying we just shouldn't be so narrow-minded, especially if we're going to continue to be the greatest nation in the world.  We want to be able to show that what we say in our [U.S.] Constitution and what we believe in is what we live by.
Story_ID: 217604
Speaker 1: And what advice do you have for young African Americans just in general?  What advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: I'd say, be as prepared as you possibly can be to be able to take advantage of any and all opportunities that come your way, to learn and contribute, because if you're sharp enough and bright enough you're going to be grabbed up and you're going to be able to make your mark and help others and help our nation.  And I just want African Americans in particular to be ready for that task, but I would say that to also other groups.
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I worry that somehow, we haven't figured out how important education is.  I worry that some of our parents have not figured out how important their role is.  We used to have a saying in Berkeley [California], and I'm sure we weren't the first to say it, but, there was a time, you know, in public schools when public schools would tell parents don't teach your kids to read, that's our job.  We'll teach them to read when they get to school.  Well that's ridiculous, and of course, parents are not, don't believe it.  And, and many kids learn to read on their own.  So if you hold back some until you get in school that doesn't make sense.  But I used to wonder if there was a group of parents who may have heard that at some time, who didn't realize they are their children's first teachers.  And therefore, as their children's first teachers, they have an enormously important job to help prepare that child for the environment outside of the home.  And one--you could ask yourself, suppose my youngster never gets to school, how am I supposed to help raise him?  How do I help him learn?  How do I help use all of his different facilities, whether it's reading, or listening, or is it the musical talent, is it something else?  Is he artistic?  Just to look at that wonderful human being and see what they can do to help that kid understand the wide variety of ways in which he or she can learn and how beautiful learning can be so that they're curious, they quickly pick up on things and want to learn.
Story_ID: 217605
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins, when you look back at your life what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: That I was very fortunate to have had good parents [Vivian Moore Green and Henry Green] to begin with, followed by good surrogate parents in my aunt and uncle, Richard [Moore] and Mattie [Mae Hicks] Moore; to have had a good sister all these years, Aileene Bridget Green Davis, she is currently now, and to have had a wonderful son, Brian Keith Wood.  I am very, very fortunate indeed.  And even my first husband, Benjamin Wood, and certainly my second husband, George Lee Jenkins, Jr., I've been blessed.  There are some women who wonder if they will find their right mate, and I was fortunate to have had good--two good husbands.  So, I think the Lord has blessed me and--with the wonderful people that I have met and have had an opportunity to work with; the teaming together, the learning process, the quality of staff and experiences have just been great.
Story_ID: 217606
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who helped contribute; helped to make things better; helped leave a legacy that's worthwhile to human beings and life.
Story_ID: 217607
Speaker 1: And what do you believe is your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think people will remember me, some people will remember me in my equal opportunity role at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and I think whatever my legacy is, it's going to be helped by the marvelous honor that NASA paid to me by naming the [Harriett G. Jenkins] Predoctoral Fellowship [Project].  One of the things I didn't tell you about the Orlando [Florida] experiences is that that went on for a whole week of nothing but laudatory testimony about to what I had contributed.  I keep telling them I didn't do it alone.  And I think one of the most important lessons I learned is how important working with others and how powerful that can be and watching that occur and unfold.
Story_ID: 217608
Speaker 1: And lastly, why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Well, it helps us remember selectively (laughter) what we want to remember (laughter).  It helps us pick out the things that we think are valuable about our past experiences.  And it may be helpful for those who come after us, if they can learn the way we saw the world, saw the problems, the kind of solutions we elected to attempt to utilize and so, I think history can be important for all of those reasons.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of the top management of NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] that consists of the center directors, that means the head of the NASA installations, the associate administrators and the NASA administrator is in that picture; he's the man standing with the hat in his hand, that's Dr. James [M.] Beggs.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this is you right here?
Speaker 1: That's me.  I'm the only female in the picture.
Speaker 2: That is the--by the way that other one was about the, in the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This also is in the mid-'80s [1980s].  And is the [NASA] Office of Equal Opportunity Programs [NASA Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity (ODEO)].  So that's my staff about mid-'80s [1980s].  And I'm sitting there.  That's right, [HistoryMaker] Harriett [G.] Jenkins there.
Speaker 1: This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hang on one second Dr. Jenkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, there we go.
Speaker 1: Oh, excuse me, could I have that for just a minute and see maybe if I can detect what year, oh, can't read it.
Speaker 2: Let me see if I can see it.
Speaker 1: See those years--there tells you the years on that.  On those little metal plaques, can you read those years?
Speaker 2: Maybe it says 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that is our famous equal opportunity trophy [NASA Equal Employment Opportunity Medal] being awarded to the [Ames Research] Center [California] director, William [F.] Ballhaus [Jr.] on my left here, my right there, in the picture for an outstanding equal opportunity program in progress.
Speaker 2: And who's the other gentleman in the picture?
Speaker 1: He's one of the administrators at the Ames Research Center.  I don't remember his name.
Speaker 2: Okay, and we said 1983?
Speaker 1: Well, is '83 [1983] the one that, the latest one?  There are four plaques (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Why don't we say (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: The '80s [1980s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the first black astronaut, [HistoryMaker] Guion Bluford in a thoughtful side conversation (laughter).
Speaker 2: About what year was that one taken?
Speaker 1: You know I'm trying to remember when they flew.  I figured it out and I dropped it, I've lost it.  I'm going to say early '80s [1980s].  But, I, you know, that worries me.  None of those other astronaut pictures had dates on them anywhere?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Not a, not a clue?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What's that say?
Speaker 2: It doesn't have a date on it.
Speaker 1: What does it say on the back though?  Let me; let me see the NASA code, maybe I can figure this out.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That is a picture reading from left to right of Jim Beggs, the administrator, [Justice] Clarence Thomas, who is now a member of the [U.S.] Supreme Court and at that time was head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], myself and Robert Peterson, one of our center directors.
Speaker 2: And about what year was that one taken, about just take a guess?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Mid-'80s [1980s], okay--
Speaker 1: That's Harriett Jenkins pinning the [NASA] Equal [Employment] Opportunity Medal on [Langley Research] Center [Hampton, Virginia] director Donald Hearth.  And I'm going to assume that also was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: These are the four--four of the astronauts who happen to be black males and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you name them?
Speaker 1: Guion Bluford, Ronald McNair, [HistoryMaker Col.] Frederick [Drew] Gregory and [HistoryMaker Gen. Charles] Bolden [Jr.].  What's Bolden's first name?  What's Bolden's--they don't say the names, do they?
Speaker 2: Charles Bolden.
Speaker 1: Charles Bolden, right.  Okay, Charles Bolden.
Speaker 2: About what year was that one taken?
Speaker 1: I'm going to say the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But don't hold me to that.  Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a group of NASA senior administrators at the [Washington] National Cathedral [Washington, D.C.] when--for the Wernher von Braun Memorial [Dinner].
Speaker 1: About what year was that one taken?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact year.
Speaker 1: Late '80s [1980s] maybe?  It looks like the late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: I would say not, I think it's probably even, it has to be probably the late '70s [1970s] because the tall man, second from the right is Dr. James [C.] Fletcher, who hired me and remember he hired me in NASA in 1974, so, and I can't remember when he left the agency, but let's say four, four years--'78 [1978], so I'm going to say late '70s [1970s] on that.  Why did you think it was earlier?
Speaker 1: Because I'm looking at this lady here, her hairstyle and everything and just doesn't look (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'll tell you another thing that bothers me about it.  I think when I've been saying on the astronauts, maybe the selection might have been late '70s [1970s], on the first black astronauts.  That would be terrible that I don't remember and I'll have to go do research and get back to you on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: But, so that's probably the late '70s [1970s], the end of the year in '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You have Robert [A.] Frosch in the center talking to [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height on his left and to myself.  Robert Frosch was an administrator of NASA (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who is the gentleman on the end?
Speaker 2: [Robert E.] "Ed" Smylie, who was associate administrator at NASA.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Just if you had to take a guess?
Speaker 2: Let me think where he was in the sequence, early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Early '80s [1980s], okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just guessing.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: Guessing.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me just see if I'm right about this now.  That's a meeting of the NASA center administrators with the deputy, George Low, with whom I first worked when I came to NASA (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's in what year?
Speaker 2: So that's in, that's in the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Its Hans Mark standing back behind and George Low, that's fine. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Now let's see what this is.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's your staff.
Speaker 1: All right.  No, that's the equal opportunity officers of the various (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, hold on one second, Dr. Jenkins.  Let's get--okay there we go.
Speaker 1: All right?  This is the Equal Opportunity Council, which is made up of the deputy center directors who are the second in command in the agency and all of the EO [equal opportunity] officers of the NASA centers, along with key members of my staff.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: Mid-'70s [1970s], like '77 [1977], something like that.
Speaker 2: This is you? [Edgar] Carey [Lane], can you zoom in on her? Thank you, um-hm.
Story_ID: 217610
Speaker 1: About 1976, or '7 [1977], I'm probably making a speech at the, what, the Federal Women's Program.
Speaker 2: This was nineteen seventy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you hold on for one second?  That's okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So about what year was this one?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1: That one's '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992], right, with Barbara Bush, the First Lady.  This was 19 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hang on one second.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So Barbara Bush, 1992?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's 2004.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: This--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is the Education Advisory Committee of--appointed by the agency [National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA] to help them make decisions.
Speaker 1: [Edgar] Carey [Lane], can you zoom in?
Speaker 2: And that's 2004 as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, 2004.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  So we know this is late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Right, I'm going to say early '90s [1990s].  Let's say, early '90s [1990s].  When was [President] George [Herbert Walker] Bush in office?  It was--when did [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton go in?
Speaker 2: Clinton went into office in 19 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Was it '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: So it could have been '88 [1988] to '92 [1992], right? So, so--
Speaker 2: Why don't we just say late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 1: Right, that's fine.  Oh, and I want to say that's George [Lee] Jenkins [Jr.], my husband.
Speaker 2: Yes, no, thank you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.  So you know what that is?
Speaker 1: Right, that was the program for the luncheon event at the honoring ceremony, tribute ceremony, they called it.
Speaker 2: For the NASA (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Predoctoral, NASA.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [Harriett G.] Jenkins Predoctoral Fellow[ship Project].
Speaker 2: That is the--now he's going to have to zoom in not to see all that other stuff behind it, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll fix it in post-production.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's the Berkeley [Community] Chamber Singers of which I was a member during the late 1940s and 1950s and '60s [1960s] (laughter) in Berkeley [California].
Speaker 1: What year do you think the picture was taken?
Speaker 2: Well, even the person who sent it to me didn't tell me what year it was taken (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But around--
Speaker 2: But I'm going to say early '50s [1950s].  Oh, excuse me, wait a minute.  I started working at Berkeley [Unified School District, Berkeley, California] in '54 [1954].  Let's just say the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That one there, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Harriett G.] Jenkins?
Speaker 2: This is [HistoryMaker] Adine Ray, one of the HistoryMakers, my ninety-six-year-old friend with whom I go to the symphony and the plays and we are taking a trip to Alaska.
Speaker 1: Okay, about what year was that one taken?
Speaker 2: I can go downstairs and tell you before you leave, but I'm going to say about '98 [1998] or '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm pinning the [NASA] Equal [Employment] Opportunity Medal on Dr. Hans Mark, who went to be chancellor of the University of Texas at Austin [Austin, Texas], and I believe he left the agency in the mid-'90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: So mid-'90s [1990s], right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: This was the administrator, Richard--Admiral Richard [H.] Truly of NASA, along with two members of my staff who were getting awards for some event.  And I would guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That looks like the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Right, or, or even the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --right, well see I'm trying to think when Richard Truly was administrator.  See I should have been able to identify these people by--
Speaker 1: Well, that looks like the '80s [1980s] based on her hairstyle and what she has on.
Speaker 2: But we set up the research centers--I'm going to say mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is my husband and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Would you say his name for us?
Speaker 1: --George Lee Jenkins, Jr.  Oh, please (unclear) (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: Okay, and about what year do you think that one was taken?

Speaker 2: Now, let's turn it over.
Speaker 1: No, I had, I took it out.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: This one was taken in 1999.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is Harriett Jenkins standing by--

Frederick Drew Gregory], and to my left my dear friend Jeanne Holmquist from Pacific--
Speaker 2: And the other gentleman?
Speaker 1: George's brother, Emmanuel Jenkins.
Speaker 2: This is the administrator (simultaneous).

Speaker 2: That looks like it might be mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, see that's not right, late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's Harriett Jenkins; excuse me, that's Harriett Elizabeth Green as a toddler (laughter).
Speaker 1: So that one was probably taken around 1928?
Speaker 2: Or '29 [1929].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twenty-eight [1928] sounds good.
Speaker 1: What year was that one taken you think?
Speaker 2: This is Harriett sitting on our old Nash in which we traveled from Berkeley, California to Fort Worth, Texas; would have been 1949, '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's Harriett Jenkins on the right with Brian Keith, my son, standing in front and my Aunt Mattie [Mae Hicks Moore] and Uncle Richard [Moore] and I'm guessing that was 1949 or 1950.
Speaker 1: And their last names?
Speaker 2: Mattie and Richard Moore.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Okay.
Speaker 1: That is Harriett Jenkins with my son Brian Keith Wood at an event when he visited me here and I'm going to say mid-'80s [1980s].

Speaker 2: Oh you, oh, good, I don't have to worry about it.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This, this is my aunt, Mattie Moore, Mattie N. Moore, myself, Harriett Jenkins and my sister, Aileene Bridget Green [Davis] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And it was taken in 1998?
Speaker 2: --Davis.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is my husband, George Lee Jenkins, Jr. and myself, Harriett Jenkins, and I would estimate that to be late 1992.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is Harriett Jenkins and a friend whose name I don't remember at the graduation--getting my law degree [from Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] in 1984.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the Reverend Dr.--geez!
Speaker 2: Kathy and John.
Speaker 1: Kathy [Dr. Kathryne Favors] and John Favors.  And I'm trying to remember when he passed away, so I can say--I'm going to say it's early '90s [1990s].  Why would I have gotten those, got those materials from her?
Speaker 2: What year was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is Harriett Jenkins in 1941 getting ready to go to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
