Speaker 1: I'm Denise Gines, the interviewer with The HistoryMakers, and Scott Stearns is the videographer.  Would you state your name and spell it for me, please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin.
Speaker 1: Do you have a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or Michael T. Mauldin.
Speaker 1: What does the T stand for?
Speaker 2: Thomas.  And that is Mauldin, M-A-U-L-D-I-N.
Speaker 1: And your date of birth?
Speaker 2: Ten, thirty, fifty-three [October 30, 1953].
Speaker 1: And your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Murphy, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: What is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am--I kind of hesitate when I said that.  I am an entertainment executive.  I consider myself really an entertainment manager.  You know, I run my own company and have kind of managed and been president of Columbia Records in different other scenarios.  But I consider myself an entertainment manager.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: We're in lovely Atlanta [Georgia] first of all, ATL.  And I am here on Spring Street.  We're based here in downtown Atlanta, or midtown Atlanta.  We're actually at 1350 Spring Street, Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is September 12, 2007.
Story_ID: 560123
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you what I call People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to.  And I say that with some hesitancy, but I've always liked blues.  But then I'm color blind, so sometimes my blues are purple, and sometimes my blues are, you know, different things.  So, I would say now more my favorite colors are black and white, because that's easier for me to kind of like connect and get dressed without my wife [Judy Mauldin] helping me put on my clothes and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although she helps me anyway.  She's good like that.
Speaker 1: And what do you like to eat?  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, man.  Right off the bat, I think Italian food is my favorite food.  Just, I just like Italian food. I also love sushi, and I've been eating it for a long time, and the variations of that.  I have restaurants that I would prefer when I eat sushi, but I'm pretty--you know, I don't eat, I don't eat beef and I don't eat pork.  And, but I love soul food.  Just this past weekend I was, I actually had to go to the south side of town of Atlanta [Georgia].  And you know, it was on Sunday and my wife wasn't in town, and I had to go and just get me a nice soul food meal, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Where you go through and get the plate, and it looks like your aunt or your uncle is back there behind fixing it for you.  Hey, I have to do that every now and then.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well, man, these are some--yeah.  I like--yeah, it's hard to say.  I'm not really a vacation guy, so I can't really say I look forward to--I mean summer's cool because that's when I do a lot of my work.  I do tours, concert tours.  So a lot of time the summer is being--
Story_ID: 560124
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: I want to say--wow, I don't know.  I guess I should say the--that is so crazy to me.
Speaker 1: All seasons?
Speaker 2: Because I never really thought about it.  I like the fall.  And why do I like the fall?  The fall is not too hot, and it's not too cold.  And it's my birthday, and--I don't know.  And then the spring--I don't know.  For some reason the spring and the fall jumps out.  The winter doesn't do much for me because I'm not big on cold, but then Christmas comes around that time, and I like that.  So, I'm kind of an all season kind of guy.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you say you don't go on vacation much?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, all right, well, where do you like to go when you do go on vacation?
Speaker 2: I would prefer to have the solitude and to be able to really kind of just chill out.  At the same time, so, saying that, you know, I like going to certain islands.  But I'm not necessarily big on traveling, because I travel all the time as part of my--pretty much every day.  Me getting here today is travel, you know.  So, I kind of like solitude.  But I will say this.  I live in North Carolina; I live in Murphy, North Carolina, which is where I grew up.  It's a little outside of where I grew up, where my home is.  It's pretty peaceful out there.  It's on a farm, I call it a farm.  It's not like we have animals.  We got a couple of horses, but we--when I go there I can really relax.  So my wife [Judy Mauldin] always tell me, and I think I'm just now starting to realize, that maybe I should just go home and chill for a week or two, and then come back.  And I find that it does kind of rejuvenate me now when I do that, versus traveling to go somewhere, you know.  But I've pretty much, I've traveled pretty much--I won't say the world, but I've been a lot of places in my life.  And so I don't know.  I'm longing to take a vacation now, though, and it would probably be a cruise, although my wife says I would go by myself because she's not big on the cruise thing.  But I'd just like to, I think I would just like to--that way I can have a little chill time and then be able to still experience something if I want to.
Speaker 1: All right.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I probably have a bunch of them.  But the things that--and as I'm thinking about that, there's two in particular that I guess I say all the time.  And I like to think that I don't, but I know I do.  One is the world is a ghetto.  That's just, I don't know if that's from the group War, or just something I've done.  And the one other is--years and years ago there was this gentleman that I actually picked this up from when I was a kid.  And for some reason, in the last five or six years I use it a lot.  And Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] said something like, "Keep the faith, but spread it gently."  And I use that all the time.  And you know, I'm sure I throw people off.  They probably say, "What the heck, where did that come from?"  "Keep the faith, but spread it gently."  And I use it so much that--it's so funny.  And maybe, you know, they say when people live together or be together or are together, or whatever, they start to look alike, particularly for a long time--or they say things alike.  In my marriage now, we've been married for seventeen years.  So last week I was doing a concert.  I was doing my tour in, we were in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and it was kind of finishing.  It was a Scream tour, and I was leaving.  And my wife came out because it was our anniversary, you know, our seventeen year anniversary.  So it was on Saturday night, and we were leaving.  And as we were leaving the backstage area, she said to one of the girls that work for us, "Keep the faith, but spread it gently."  I'm like, "No, you didn't just sit there and take my little phrase or whatever."  But I just thought that was funny, because now of all a sudden I guess it's kind of connecting, you know, so.
Story_ID: 560125
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family.  Tell me your mother's name and where she was born, and when she was born.
Speaker 2: Oh you're going to, ooh, you're going to make me have to call somebody (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If you can remember, if you can remember.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I don't have to call nobody to know my mother's name.  But my mother's name is Grace Mauldin.  Her maiden name is Bowman, Grace Bowman Mauldin, B-O-W-M-A-N.  Actually, her middle name is Verbina.  I think Verbina, is that a flower maybe or something?  But you know, Grace Verbina.  I think her mother used to say, call her that, I think.  Her mother was Vallie Mae Bowman [Vallie Allen Bowman], and that was Mama Vallie.  That was probably my, you know, not probably, but that was the grandmother that I really knew and we all spent a lot of time with as I guess most people do, particularly in small towns.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Vallie?
Speaker 2: V-A-L-L-I-E, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Vallie Mae, can't leave out that middle name.  Vallie Mae, M-A-E, Vallie Mae Bowman.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: My mother was probably born in Murphy [North Carolina], too, now that I think about it.  She probably was.  I really should know that, huh?  I'm fifty-three years old, and don't know.  But anyway, no, my mother I think--who is still living, thank God, and doing well--she was born in Murphy, North Carolina, I'm pretty sure.
Speaker 1: And do you know what year she was born?  How old is she?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking hard, hold on a second.  I'm going to get this, this is going to be good.  I believe she was born in 1932, maybe '33 [1933], but I believe it was '32 [1932].
Speaker 1: All right.  And your grandmother was Vallie Mae. What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Walter J., Walt Bowman [Walter Bowman].  You know, he was, you know, he was quite a guy, a Mason.  He, you know, was good at, you know, building things, you know, back in those days.  But Walt Bowman, he was a character.
Speaker 1: And they lived in Murphy also?
Speaker 2: They also lived in Murphy, down the street from us.  You know, and we used to--and growing up at Christmastime we'd go and spend--it was always just special.  You know, you'd go to, that's where you'd go and open up--like I grew up Catholic.  I was--and it's really interesting that I did grow up Catholic, because my mother wasn't Catholic.  But my grandmother was Catholic, and she actually worked at the--as we're talking about that, she worked at the Catholic hospital as a cook, which goes back to the food, I love food.  And as a cook, she--and being a cook--it was ran by the Catholic nuns.  And I say in being a cook, but I think because of that influence or whatever, she became Catholic, and I know there were several members of her family that was.  And we probably were the only black folks in, definitely in the Texana/Murphy area--the community I'm from is called Texana [Murphy, North Carolina], T-E-X-A-N-A.  And we were probably one of the few blacks that were in the region, much less that town, that was Catholic, particularly in that era, as I remember from the '60s [1960s].  I mean I was Catholic from the time I was--because I went with my grandmother to the church [St. William Catholic Church, Murphy, North Carolina] and to the--. And then, you know, we'd go to Catholic church and we'd be in there for one hour.  And then I'd come home and then I'd go up the road to the Baptist church.  Because I could go to church and still go back--you know, I could go to church and be done and still go and just be--they'd just be getting into it at the Baptist church.  But, but that was kind of my thing.  So I think Vallie Mae Bowman was, as we're talking about that, was an interesting person, a really strong woman.
Story_ID: 560126
Speaker 1: Now, did you know much about, about her [Mauldin's maternal grandmother, Vallie Allen Bowman] and where they lived?  Did they own the land that they lived on?
Speaker 2: Did own the land.  Her maiden name is Allen, and she--the Allen family is a pretty big family.  I mean there's a lot of Allens.  And her brother, he must have had, seriously, he must have had twenty-five kids, some of them I can name.  And they're considered cousins.  But I'm saying, they're right down the street.  But the Allens, the Allens probably was one of the most influential families in Murphy [North Carolina], black wise, I guess growing up.  And I say they're not influential from financial means, but influential in not even political means, but just influential from having a big family, and everyone--almost making the entire community be related to each other, you know.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't know how that sounded, but just about everybody was related (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, in a small town that's what happens.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, and your grandfather [Walter Bowman], you said he was a builder?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he could just about do anything, you know--cement, you know.  And then about once a year he would take a, he had a tendency to want to drink a little too much.  So about once a year--back in those days in a lot of communities, people--you had people--I guess ultimately they were alcoholics.  But they were seasonal alcoholics, so meaning they didn't drink every day, but boy, when they drank, they really, really went there.  And my granddaddy was quite a guy, a great guy.  Didn't take no mess, but he was--and everybody knew him.  But man, when he started to drink, look out.  And then it was painful, too.  It wasn't easy on nobody.  When he did that, it was, it was hard.  But he was known for that.  He was known--he would--for a good solid year or a year and a half you would see him and everything was good.  And then one day, it's like, "Darn, what happened, Granddad?  What did you do, man?"  It was that kind of thing.  And we used to always--and talking about seasons--the thing that's so funny to me when I think back--and I hadn't really ever thought about this.  This is actually good, making me--. Most of the time, during the holiday season was when Granddaddy would be about drunk.  I don't understand that.  Maybe that was just, maybe that's the time to open up, festive.  And my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin], you know, or my sister or them or somebody may hear this and say, "That's not true."  But that's how I remember.  And when he was--he drank--he smoked Camel cigarettes.  Either he rolled his own cigarettes--like, you know, back in those days you really, you know, you actually rolled tobacco.  And, you know, if he was really drinking, the gifts that he got on Christmas was either a pack of cigarettes or something like that.  You know, it was always so funny.  But you know, you never really knew.
Speaker 1: Did you know much about his mother and father?
Speaker 2: No.  For whatever reason, I really don't, and didn't, you know.
Story_ID: 560127
Speaker 1: And so, the Allen family was a very big family.  And they, did they own plenty of land?
Speaker 2: They definitely owned land.  As a matter of fact, you know, I'm sure the house that--well, I don't know.  And maybe I should know this, too.  But the house that I grew up in [in Murphy, North Carolina], I know my [maternal] grandfather [Walter Bowman] built for my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin] and dad [Wesley T. Mauldin], or helped build.  And most of the land from where--yeah, pretty much all of the land on that end of the community had an Allen name or a family member tied to it.  So I would say they had quite a bit of property up there somehow, some way.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you know how much education your grandparents might have had?
Speaker 2: Well educated, believe it or not.  I don't know how far they went in school, but--wow, this is interesting.  HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] are making me have to go and do a little history discovery myself (laughter).   Yeah, I don't know how far they really went in school.  But they were very educated, very smart people.  And you know, obviously there was no problem, they could read and write.  So I'm sure--you know, I know people kind of did it on their own a lot of times, but they definitely wasn't ignorant to, you know, things that were going on in the world.
Speaker 1: Since you spent a lot of time with your grandparents, your grandmother [Vallie Allen Bowman] and grandfather, did they ever share any stories about them growing up?  Were they or their parents in slavery?  Was there any talk about that at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, man.  I really have to, I'm almost apologetic on that.  I, I, I--
Speaker 1: Well, if you don't--I mean if you don't know, that's fine.
Speaker 2: No, I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: And I feel bad.  Now, I'm feeling bad.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: No, because I don't know, and I feel like I should.  Because I'm sure--you know, growing up in North Carolina, I feel like there was--I think if I'm not mistaken, my grandmother, the Allen family, had a certain--I think there was a mixture of Cherokee Indian [Native American] in our family some way.  And obviously in that area in North Carolina, there's a lot of Cherokee Indians, you know, the tribes.  And there's a place in North Carolina called Cherokee.  But my grandmother had long, black flowing hair, and I've often heard--so, someway, somehow, I think there's an Indian descent of sorts on my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That didn't help you much with the slavery question, but I just thought I'd throw that in, you know, cowboys and Indians, nah I'm just joking (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well, you gave me what you know.  So that's, that's the main thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 560128
Speaker 1: Now, your mother, describe your mother to me.  Did she, tell me what she looked like, and what your relationship was with your mother.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm the oldest child, oldest of four.  I'm going to say this, not that I've ever believed it.  But, you know, I think most of my siblings, most of my brothers and sisters would all say that I was the favorite, and that if anybody could get away with anything with my mom, it would be me.  Maybe, and if so, maybe it was because with me it was the trial and error.  And then after me, it was like, "Okay, no, I've seen this before."  Because I was probably, I mean I grew up well, and I probably was a pretty rambunctious kid.  But I always had, all I can remember is that I always wanted to hang with the older guys, you know.  And she, she allowed that.  But you know, I think we had a good relationship.  She's often said as I was growing up--because my dad [Wesley T. Mauldin] was, my dad was around.  My dad's still living himself, too.  And he was around all those years, but he was a tractor and trailer driver, so he was gone a lot during the week.  And he also hung out a little bit.  He, he liked to hang out, you know.  That was--he, he, he started what I call the fast life.  And, and, he kind of, I say started it; he kind of--. So my mom often said that when I was growing up, or as I was younger, I was her best, one of her best friends.  So I don't remember her really sharing any stuff with me like a friend would do or anything, you know, or asking me my opinion, necessarily.  But maybe I was her best friend, I don't know.  But to this day, you know, obviously I love her very much.  I think very--what I remember growing up though, very attractive, very--yeah, she was just a very beautiful woman, and definitely spoke her own mind, you know.  Grace [Grace Bowman Mauldin] definitely had her--and still does--has her opinions of things.
Story_ID: 560129
Speaker 1: And she [Mauldin's mother, Grace Bowman Mauldin] didn't work much, which is interesting, outside the home.  Now, she will not--in hearing me say that, she'll probably be mad if she hears me say that.  I don't remember her really working a lot outside of the home.  But she had other jobs.  She had jobs where she worked for people and different things like that.  But due to my father's [Wesley T. Mauldin] occupation, and who he was in the town, and how he was, we actually--growing up we--don't get me wrong, we weren't wealthy or rich or anything, but we did pretty well.  I grew up pretty--I probably was one of the--my family probably was one of the better off black families in Murphy, North Carolina.  But it was just from the hard work my dad did, and it enabled my mom to pretty much take jobs or whatever, but really almost be a--what's the word?  Stay at home mom (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stay at home mom.
Speaker 1: But you know, she did a good job at that.  She kept us in line, and none of us was really bad.  And I guess, you know, I should really speak for myself.  I don't think I was a bad guy, you know.
Speaker 2: How much education did your mother have?
Speaker 1: My mom finished high school, and I remember--I don't remember her going to high school.  But you know, in those days, in Murphy, you had to leave Murphy to finish high school if you were black, because obviously the schools were segregated.  And the furthest you could really go probably was the seventh or eighth grade, maybe the eighth grade.  So it's interesting, because even--you know, I didn't.  I mean, you know, when I, when schools were integrated in Murphy it was in the '60s [1960s], I guess.  But around--I graduated from high school [Murphy High School, Murphy, North Carolina] in '71 [1971], so schools were integrated when I went into the seventh grade.  And yeah, oh, I know what it was.  The last two years, that's what it was.  In Murphy you couldn't really--we had the--and I do remember the segregated school, and everybody kind of went to the Texana [Murphy, North Carolina] school; I guess my mom did, too.  But you couldn't do the last two years there, so you would go through the tenth grade.  The tenth grade was as far as you could go, which is wild, isn't it.  Just thinking about that.  So I would imagine a lot of people during that era, my mom and them, never graduated.  And again, I never really thought much about it.  But, you know, because they could only go to the tenth grade, and then you would have to go somewhere else.  So she went to--her oldest sister, Aunt Louise [Lillian Louise Bowman Johnson], lived in Asheville, and already had a family in Asheville, North Carolina, had a family.  So my mother went and lived with her in Asheville and went to Allen, an all-girls school which is called Allen High School [Asheville, North Carolina], and finished.  And a lot of people--and I know she wasn't the only one from Murphy that did that, but a lot of people that I know now.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Wow, man, I ain't thought about this in thirty years.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Story_ID: 560130
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your father.  Tell me his name.
Speaker 2: My father, Wesley Thomas Mauldin [Wesley T. Mauldin].  Everybody knows him as W.T.  But really everybody knows him as Lightnin', L-I-G-H-T-N-I-N.  And my dad is quite a guy.
Speaker 1: Where, was he born in Murphy [North Carolina] also?
Speaker 2: He was born in Hayesville, North Carolina, which is a suburb of Murphy (laughter).  It's about, it's another little town.  It's probably about twenty miles.  I guess it's east of Murphy.  And he--but he spent most of the time--and he grew up there in Hayesville, you know, running around.  But then of course as an adult, everybody came to the big lights of Murphy.  We had one red light downtown, and I don't know if Hayesville had a red light.  But everybody would come to Murphy.  And I think, you know, obviously my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin] was a cutie, so my dad probably seeked her out.  And he was the guy that drove the cars, the fast cars and did whatever, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: And where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: My dad--now I know he didn't really finish.  I think he went through the seventh or eighth grade.  So he probably went to school, more than likely in Hayesville.  And interesting enough, I never really knew my dad's parents well.  His father who was also called Wesley [Wesley Mauldin]--not called, that was his name.  I mean I know of him as Grandpa Wesley, but I never knew him.  And you know, I don't know.  And then his mother [Lucy Hooper Mauldin], I don't know it all.  And actually, I think my dad really was taken care of more by his aunt, Aunt Minnie.  I know the aunts, I know his aunts.  Wow, I got to do some history lessons on my own family.  But I, I, I, yeah, I know his aunts.  And I think that, you know, Aunt Mentory [Mentory Mauldin Lowery]--I don't know how you spell that, but that's how we said it, and it's probably not said the way it's spelled.  But Aunt Mentory was the lady that my dad and his cousins was around all the time, Sam [ph.] and Willis [ph.].  So I know all those people, but his mother and his father, I didn't, like I said, I didn't really know.  Grandpa Wesley actually moved to Asheville, though, Asheville, North Carolina at some point.  And I think he was out there a lot.  So when he, but when he passed, like I said, I was young.  I was, I don't remember exactly how old I was.  I probably was nine--eight, nine, ten.  And I can, there's just vaguely things I can remember, not of him, but of going to the house that he lived in after he passed, or during, I mean that week that he passed, during the funeral or right after that or whatever the case may be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story, do you know a story about how your mother and father actually met?
Speaker 2: How did my dad meet--I can't really recall the story.  I mean there're a bunch of stories I know about my dad, but I can't really recall how they met.  I do know that I remember them saying several times, though, how he had to go and get permission from my granddad [Walter Bowman] to, you know, to take her out.  Because obviously, you know, back then everybody was pretty young.  So I guess my mom must have been about seventeen, sixteen or seventeen years old, when he started seeing her.
Speaker 1: How old was your--when was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born March 11th, 1925.
Story_ID: 560131
Speaker 1: Tell me about the community in which you lived, in Murphy, North Carolina.  Tell me who your friends are, and give me a description of what the neighborhood looked like.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We called it the hill, because it was up on a hill.  And really it's a gorgeous.  And today as I think about it, moving around, it's the kind of place where you're like, wow, man, if you just built homes or whatever, just imagine.  And I'm sure real estate people and everybody probably just wish they could just come and just swipe it, take it.  But we are, it's called Texana [Murphy, North Carolina].  And you know, I've often thought about the quote, unquote railroad tracks.  And I used to say all the time, Texana was the one--depending upon how you went there--but you didn't necessarily go across the railroad tracks as you would (makes sounds) go across the railroad tracks to get over.  There was a street that actually came in from town that went across the railroad tracks, though.  And the railroad tracks went underneath to get to Texana.  So it's like, you know, because you hear that all the time, you know, black folks, you know, live on the other side of town or across the tracks.  So we never looked at it that way.  I think we viewed it more as, again, up on the hill.  We were about two miles from downtown Murphy.  Growing up, everybody walked.  So the interesting thing was, you know, there wasn't a lot of--it's so interesting now.  You see, people don't walk at all anymore unless they're running in the park getting some exercise.  But everybody walked.  On Sunday afternoons or Saturday afternoon, you'd see a crew of people walking down the hill.  The problem was you had to walk back up the hill.  And the hill was like really--depending on what part of Texana you lived in, the hill could have been two hills.  I lived on the far end, so we had two hills we had to walk up.  And I mean I'm talking about mountains.  I'm talking about like, you know, pretty steep hills.  And you know, growing up was interesting, because you know, the town was segregated.  It was really just a community that you'd--a drive through community that you could come in on one end and come out the other end.  And then there was a highway that connected called Joe Brown Highway.  And Joe Brown Highway, you could actually go in either end, but you didn't have to go through it.  And it used to be strange, because people would--we want to say it was a shortcut.  But growing up we used to say, "Oh, people just want to come through here to see what's going on."  Because you didn't have to come through Texana, you could have drove around.  But nine times out of ten, everybody comes through Texana.  And it was always funny, we used to always joke we were going to put speed bumps or create a toll.  You had to--you know, when I was growing up we used to sit down, and they had the sawdust pile at the end of this town.  And this is where everybody--in Murphy, probably one of the biggest resources is trees, you know, woodwork, lumbering, lumber.  As a matter of fact, that's what my dad [Wesley T. Mauldin] drove for Townson Lumber Company.  He drove, you know, back then they used to make what they called pallets, you know, where you stack things on.  And he was a pallet hauler and a lumber hauler, and that kind of thing.  And so most businesses was--it was called veneering, I guess--most businesses where people end up, you know, taking the bark off the trees or making--you know, that kind of thing.  And it's, it's interesting, because you know, just logging trucks and that kind of thing, you see that around all the time.  And I think that in, in Murphy--and I was kind of going somewhere with that, and it kind of slipped me a little bit.

Speaker 1: But in Murphy [North Carolina], I feel like most people--even though it was during the time of segregation, we didn't really have a lot of segregated problems.  You know, you had the places, you had the places where blacks had to go around to the back and, you know, particularly if you're driving down this way.  If you come--Murphy is literally a hundred and twenty miles from Atlanta [Georgia].  So if you, you know, you start to go through north Georgia, now that's a little different thing, you know, back in the day, you know.  We had, we had; we were surrounded.  We were surrounded by towns that were notorious for being segregationists and creating--and not allowing blacks--or saying that they didn't allow blacks to come to town.
Speaker 2: Which towns were these?
Speaker 1: Like towns in Tennessee.  There was a little town called Copperhill, Tennessee.  And those towns are close.  I mean we're, Murphy's right on the Georgia/Tennessee line, literally.  I mean like, really like right on the Georgia/Tennessee line.  And, you know, people from here, a lot of people--moving forward in history, a lot of people say, "Well, okay, what is Murphy known for?"  Well, Eric Rudolph, which was the bomber [of Centennial Olympic Park, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: The Olympic Park bomber.
Speaker 1: The Olympic bomber, that's where he's from, Murphy and Andrews [North Carolina], in that area.  And that's where they ended up catching him at.  So Murphy became--like a couple of years ago, or whenever that was, Murphy was big news.  The FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was on top of the buildings.  We didn't even know the buildings had a top that you could stand on in Murphy.  So to see people up there with sharpshooters, it was like everybody in the--they call it the four square area--everybody in the area of Murphy was driving to town just to see the big parade of FBI and police officers.  So that was, that was big news.
Story_ID: 560133
Speaker 1: But Murphy's [Murphy, North Carolina] a very, is a very quiet sleepy town.  Really, it was--as I mentioned, the industry was more about lumber and wood and stuff like that.  Years later, because of the cost of--I think mainly because it was so inexpensive, if you may, to hire workers and stuff, you know, minimum wage really wasn't minimum wage.  It wasn't--I don't think you had too many people arguing, "Oh, I want to be paid way more than that."  So, you know, the thing in Murphy I think is that plants--meaning like Magnavox, Levi Strauss [Levi Strauss and Company]--I'm just trying to think of some of the names of them--Remco [Remco Supply, Inc.], some of those plants moved into the Murphy area, and that became a big source of employment for particularly the people that I grew up around and the families.  And there's a lot of people to this day that--well I won't say to this day--I know a lot of those plants are closed--that literally retired from those types of plants.  And then you had, you had people that were orderlies.  Some of the deacons, if you may, of the local church or, you know, Mount Zion Baptist Church [Murphy, North Carolina], and one of the ministers, all of these are relatives, too.  If you remember the Allen family, the Allen family kind of, you know, connected--you know, the Kincaids.  So some of the ministers and stuff like that actually worked at the hospital as orderlies, and those things.  And growing up, I, you know, we had the Cub Scouts, the Boy Scouts [Boys Scouts of America], and we actually--.  And it's so funny, because I grew up in a town--and it's probably the same thing in big towns--but in our town, people didn't lock their doors, didn't close--you know what I'm saying.  You didn't really, we didn't, they weren't--people weren't stealing nothing.  You didn't have, you may have had people that was not doing very well.  You may have had people that was really almost poverty or poor, but you never had anybody that was homeless.  I can't think of a soul that I ever knew in the country that was homeless, you know.  They may have been with very little home, but they at least--well, let me say this.  Maybe they were homeless, but they weren't houseless.  It wasn't like they didn't have a cover, you know, as Luther Vandross says, "A house is not a home."  So anyway, I think that, you know, growing up though for me was very, very good.  It was, it really kept me grounded.  I mean it wasn't a lot of mischief necessarily to get into, you know.  The worse thing I think we ever did was maybe caught the woods on fire, you know.  And you know, we'd hang out in the woods.  I mean I hate snakes, but growing up we didn't even think about it, at least I didn't.  You'd be in the wooded areas, and I mean I don't like a snake at all, I don't even want to see one.  But you know, growing up, you didn't really think about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Think about it--
Speaker 1: --oh, let me--if I raise this rock I might see a snake, you know.
Story_ID: 560134
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory?  Well, I'll tell you this.  When I was-- just went to school.  I was six years old, and I think I was a cute little boy, you know.  But I never will forget.  My mother [Grace Bowman Mauldin] was in the hospital having a baby, so it must have been either my brother, my younger brother Ford [Ford Mauldin], or my youngest sister Jenny [Jenny Mauldin O'Dell].  But I believe it was--I have to look back.  Because if I was in school, even though I started school when I was five, it probably was Ford, now that I think about it.  And I actually was running around the school grounds at our little segregated school [Texana School, Murphy, North Carolina], and fell and skinned my face up.  And I remember the principal of the school, Miss Ragsdale [Ella B. Ragsdale] and some other people, they had to put Merthiolate; that used to be this stuff.  Have you ever heard of Merthiolate?  They had to put Merthiolate, and oh, god, it burned, and I was so devastated.  But the thing that I was so scared about--I remember being with my grandmother [Vallie Allen Bowman], being home at her house because my mother was in the hospital--at my grandmother's house, crying.  And I don't how I remember that, talking about how my mom was going to be so mad, because I done scratched up my face.  And it's so funny.  I mean not that I'm vain or anything, but I think back to that day, that was something that I, that really jumps out; I don't know why.  I never thought about it other than now, but it just--when you say that.  So maybe that was, maybe that was a scar of sorts.  I don't know.
Story_ID: 560135
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your siblings.  You said you had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --brothers and sisters (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's interesting.  I've got, I'm the oldest.  As I mentioned earlier, I'm the oldest of four.  Next to me is Lucy [Lucy Mauldin Raoof].  Lucy is two years and a couple of months younger than I am.  And then there's my brother Ford [Ford Mauldin].  And as I said, Ford is probably--he was, Ford is about, almost six years younger than I am.  I think he was born in '59 [1959].  Yeah, he was, in August of '59 [1959].  And I was born--so I was, so he's literally five years and ten months younger than I am, because he was born August 30, 1959, and I was born October 30, 1953, yeah.  And then Jenny [Jenny Mauldin O'Dell] is, Jenny Kay is the youngest sister.  And she was born, she's about a year and a few months younger than Ford.  As a matter of fact that was kind of fast, now that I think about it. Mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin] and Dad [Wesley T. Mauldin] wasn't wasting no time.  She was about eleven months--is that possible?  Yeah, I guess it is.  She was about eleven--September, October, August--no, I'm sorry, thirteen months younger than Ford.  She was born, she was born on September 27, 19--I want to say 1960.  She'll probably get mad, it's probably '61 [1961].  She probably think I'm adding time to her.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Story_ID: 560136
Speaker 1: Now, with your brothers and sisters--and you have a large family.  Was there anything unique to your family holidays at Christmas or Thanksgiving time?
Speaker 2: Well, I mentioned earlier, yeah, the uniqueness was--holidays were definitely unique.  Because here's what would happen.  My--really weird.  Myself, and my sister next to me, Lucy [Lucy Mauldin Raoof], who works with me to this day--she's an operations manager here at Mauldin Brand Agency [Atlanta, Georgia]--she also was Catholic.  So on Christmas Eve, if anyone knows much about the Catholic lifestyle, we went--they would have something called--Mass was in Latin back in those days, you did Latin.  And they would have something called a High Mass.  So everybody goes to, would go to High Mass [at St. William Catholic Church, Murphy, North Carolina] on Christmas Eve, which is really Midnight Mass that we're really referencing.  And it was always, the sequence was this.  At nine o'clock or eight o'clock on Christmas Eve, we would go to our grandmother's house, you know, Mama Vallie [Vallie Allen Bowman] and Granddaddy [Walter Bowman].  And of course, she would always have food, always had them great coconut cakes.  And I remember the coconut cakes, she was big on that.  And, just, you know, cakes and pies.  She was a real cook; I mean she really threw down, and just loved it.  And she had all the stuff.  And that was every year.  That was almost a--you know, like you see the movie 'Soul Food' today, and they all gather every Sunday.  I mean we did that, too, but not as a ritual at my grandmother's house.  We did it at home, and everybody would eat dinner, you know.  Nowadays, people take Sunday dinners very light.  Back then, you know, you took Sunday dinners--so that was very real.  But the Christmastime was--going back to the holiday period--was always special.  So we would go, we'd open up their gifts, not ours.  We would open up their gifts, and we would eat and do whatever.  And then we would take those gifts that they gave us, if we were able to get any that year, and we would take them back to our house.  And then Lucy and I, or at least myself, and then when Lucy was old enough to do it, we would go to Midnight Mass.  And sometimes our mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin] would--that might be the one time of the year or a couple of times a year that our mom would go with us to Midnight Mass, and we'd do Midnight Mass.  But the interesting thing--going to the whole Santa Claus place, when we came home from Midnight Mass, Santa Claus was always there.  We never really, growing up as a kid, we never waited until the next morning, like eight or nine o'clock, or seven o'clock and get up and say, "Oh, my goodness."  Usually, I would come in--by the time we arrived from the church, you know, Santa Claus would have been there.  And that's how my mom and them always did it, that's when I was little.  Then when I recognized Santa Claus needed a little help, when I would arrive--for my younger brothers and sisters, when I would arrive from church I actually would assist in Santa Claus getting his stuff situated and down through the chimney, and the whole nine.  And then I would go and wake my younger brothers and sisters up and say, "Oh, man, Santa Claus has been here."  So that, those things stand out during the holiday for me.  Now, and I don't think--I could be dead wrong, but I don't think a lot of families in that, in that area did it that way, just because, again, we were, you know, we were the Mauldins, you know.
Story_ID: 560137
Speaker 1: Well, you talk about going to Mass.  And your mother [Grace Bowman Mauldin] and father [Wesley T. Mauldin] were not Catholic.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, just your grand- so, it was your grandmother [Vallie Allen Bowman] that would go with you sometimes, your grandmother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandmother was Catholic.
Speaker 1: Right, so is she the one--you said that she would go [to St. William Catholic Church, Murphy, North Carolina], or was it that your mother would go with you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was saying my grandmother always went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we went with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Really, at the end of the day, we really went with her.  And then sometimes my mother would go on the holidays with us, because obviously my mother drove.  My grandmother didn't drive much.  My granddad [Walter Bowman], I'm not sure, I think he became Catholic.  But then I'm not so sure.  But he would go to Catholic church a lot of times.  And my grandmother definitely was a saint, a saintly woman, I guess that's the proper word.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was a devout Catholic, for whatever reason.  I'm not sure how that ever came about, really, other than the hospital work she did.
Speaker 1: Did you take religious instructions and go through Confirmation and Communion [First Communion]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was an altar boy.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, just being around, being around that and going to Mass at such an early age.  But yeah, I was confirmed.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the nuns' names?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, most of them started with Mary (laughter)--Sister Mary Joseph [ph.], Sister Mary Louise [ph.], I think.  The one I really remember, there was two; there were two.  And I don't want to say it definitely, but more than likely they're not living today, because that was a long time ago and they were already a little older.  But I remember one nun in particular was very pretty, very--she was older, but she just--you know, nuns don't wear no makeup or whatever, but she was just very, very attractive.  And she always seemed like, I don't know if she was Italian; I don't know what.  But Dosithia, I think was her name, Sister Dosithia [ph.].  Then there was one that was like a drill sergeant, and that's the one I think everybody remembers more than anything.  Fidelus, Sister Fidelus [ph.], she was, she was the truth.  Now, she didn't take no mess, you know, she ruled.  I mean she walked in the room like she owned it.  And then I would go on Sunday mornings a lot of times, because my grandmother cooked at the hospital.  So, at the nun's chapel they would have early Mass, which was like at six a.m.  And my grandmother a lot of times would go to early Mass if that was a Sunday that she had to work at the hospital.  So sometimes I would go with her to early Mass.  And that was always, that always proved to be pretty interesting.  And that, I believe, is kind of how I got converted into being an altar boy.  Because in early Mass, they never really had, those guys weren't no regulars.  And there weren't a lot of altar boys, when you think about a little town called Murphy [North Carolina].  We, you know, there were two thousand people or whatever.  So, there weren't a lot of altar boys.  Bobby Jordan [ph.], Jimmy Jordan [ph.], Mike Jordan [ph.], that's all family.  And Chance, what's the guy's name?  His last name was Chance.  Those are the only ones I can really officially remember.  And, and, obviously they were all white.  And then when I came in, I was the little black kid that, you know, started hanging out with those guys, and took the religious instructions.
Story_ID: 560138
Speaker 1: And I think there was a lady though, years later, like from, particularly for my sister; not so much me, I was already in it.  But back then, you had the nuns and you had, they were called sisters.  And then you had the guys, which were called brothers.  So it was the brothers and the sisters.  But, you know, the brothers were more like deacons almost in church, that's how I kind of referenced them.  And usually the brothers were young or whatever.  So they would always have summer camps that were very--the Catholic community in western North Carolina was not huge, but very prominent, I think as far as the outreach to communities and stuff.  And they put a missionary, if you may, in Texana [Murphy, North Carolina], which was a black community.  And there was a little lady, and God bless her, she was amazing.  I think she really helped out a lot of kids.  Her name was Miss Cress [Marie de Porres Cress], very influential.  Again, not so much for me as much as my sister.  I mean, I mean, she was almost like a second mother.  You know, she was a white lady that just ran it, that just--but she had this little house, and obviously it was supported by the Catholic missions.  And she, you know, would do things with the community, and everybody in the community knew her.  And she became like a community person.  Miss Cress must have been there for fifteen, twenty--I mean for years.  I don't know how long.  And she was, she was really a nun, if you think about it.  But she wasn't a nun [sic.].  She was, she was a helpmate.  She was--
Speaker 2: Was she like a--
Speaker 1: A missionary.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But she wore nun's--she always--talking about black and white again--she wore a black skirt all the time and a white blouse.
Speaker 2: I think sometimes what they were called is mother superiors.
Speaker 1: Kind of that, yeah.  And everybody knew her all over (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like the administrator.
Speaker 1: But for whatever reason she came to Murphy [North Carolina], she took to Murphy.  And I used to could never understand, why would this lady come and devote her life to this community?  And I have to tell you, I mean--you know, the musicians--there was a band.  I mean she would do things-- have a little group sitting around singing, and having picnics on her property, and people come out.  So it didn't matter, you didn't have to be Catholic.  She didn't beg people to be, to change their religion to be Catholic.  It wasn't none of that.  But, and then, you know, she had after school programs; it was all about the kids.  And I'm sure even for a lot of parents, growing up, she became kind of that babysitter, if you may.  Not infants, but you know, afternoon programs.  And people would come and that's where we'd play football.  Even we might be in the street, but we'd be in front of Miss Cress' house.  And it was also a good excuse if you weren't home.  "Well, I was at Miss Cress'."  Because you know, parents and everybody was comfortable in the world of Miss Cress.  And that's, that's interesting that we're even talking about her, bringing her up.  But she was, I would have to say, a very godly woman, a very special woman.  And I know my sister Lucy [Lucy Mauldin Raoof]--she was actually Lucy's godmother, I think, when Lucy was baptized; and Lucy was Catholic.  And it's interesting when you talk about family.  Now, my younger sister [Jenny Mauldin O'Dell] and my younger brother [Ford Mauldin], they never was Catholic, they never went to Catholic church [St. William Catholic Church, Murphy, North Carolina].  They went more to the church with my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin].  Now, why and how that happened, you know, maybe it was something that my mom was going through with her mother [Vallie Allen Bowman].  Because my grandmother had me and Lucy, and we went to church and followed her.  You know, who knows?  I mean, people go through it.  I've never asked her that; I might have to ask her that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's interesting, because everything else was segregated at this time, right?
Speaker 1: Very valid point.
Speaker 2: But the church was not.
Speaker 1: Very valid point.  The church was not.  And definitely the influence of the Catholic church was not.  That's a very, very valid point.
Speaker 2: Did they have priests?  Well, of course they had priests.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I mean, Father--
Speaker 2: I mean (laughter) do you remember the priests' names (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I do.  Father Raymond [Raymond Dahan], Father Dean [Joseph Dean].  Father Dean is probably--Father Raymond I remember most, because he was there, he was one of the longest in that era.  And then was Father Joe Dean, who everybody really knew.  And all the priests were great.  I mean when I really think about it, man, growing up Catholic probably opened me up to so many other things in life, you know, in certain ways, as much as it, you know, tried to deter you from doing the bad things, or hanging out too much.  But it definitely opened you up, and also probably made the relationships--.
Story_ID: 560139
Speaker 1: Outside my dad [Wesley T. Mauldin]--now understand something, too.  As I mentioned before, my dad was known as Lightnin'.  And this was black and white.  This wasn't just in our community.  My dad to this day is like the pseudo-mayor of Murphy [North Carolina], seriously.  He is notorious.  He was a bootlegger.  Well, he wasn't a bootlegger, but he was a moonshine runner.  So, he hauled--I guess you're kind of bootlegging if you're running it.  But he, but he drove extremely fast, and had a way of being fast.  The thing that I found out just a couple of years ago, I swear to God, someone else was asking him how did he get the name Lightnin'?  And I had never--kind of as you're doing with me--I'd never asked him--but it wasn't from driving fast.  And I'd always perceived that it was driving fast.  But he said when he was a little boy, everything he did, he did fast.  And, and, he got the tag when he was young, before he even started driving.  I was, my mouth fell open.  I was so amazed.  I looked at my wife [Judy Mauldin], I looked at--I'm like, "I can't believe this."  Because my dad is known for driving cars, you know, racing.  But my point for bringing it up at this point is that this was in the segregated South, in North Carolina.  And I would have to say that probably his best friends were white.  I won't say best friends.  There was Mr. Blunt, Thomas Blunt [ph.] was--and don't get me wrong, he had some really close black friends.  But a lot of good friends--Jack Wimpey, who's still a friend today.  These are all guys that grew up with him and around him, you know, that would probably fight to the end of their life for him, that would do whatever--
Story_ID: 560140
Speaker 1: So we never, as much as--going back to the point that even as much as it was segregated, in the '60s [1960s] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and everybody was going through little towns, I could never really relate.  Because I'm like, well, why would a little town like Murphy [North Carolina] never have those problems?  We never had those issues.  Don't get me wrong.  There would be somebody--you know, you'd get called out of your name every now and then, you know.  And people might say nigger or whatever, and you would, you may say something.  But we didn't have knockdown, drag out fights.  I'm not saying it was never confrontations of sorts, because there were.  I mean, obviously, when schools were integrated, people didn't really understand that.  But we didn't have people in the town fighting, as I remember, or picketing or doing marching or doing anything against the integration, you know what I'm saying, or the bussing of kids or anything like that.
Speaker 2: So, there were no stories about the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK]?
Speaker 1: Nah, and it seemed like up in there was where you would have them, huh (laughter)?  I'm just being honest.  I mean, I'm serious.  And again, you know, the Klan was almost--I mean we heard it and we knew it, and you could see it.  I mean, even though television was black and white, you could, you could see it from the TV images.  But--and there probably was, there were probably people in that area that wanted to be Klan, I'm certain of it.  And there probably was--just because Murphy was kind of remote, they probably didn't even know how to go about it, other than dressing up like they were--and then they were figuring that they wouldn't have been official, you know.  I don't know.  But it's just really weird, because to my knowledge--and probably, somebody probably would denounce what I'm saying.  Probably somebody would say, "Oh, yeah, there was definitely Klan up in there."  'Cause more than likely, there were.
Speaker 2: But you just didn't--it wasn't visible for you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, as far really being an image where you would see them going into downtown Murphy and they're standing on a corner with a sign, you didn't see that.  We never had that issue up there.
Speaker 2: Back to talking about your neighborhood, I'm gonna, I want you to talk about, about your school, and where you went to school.
Story_ID: 560141
Speaker 1: Now, we were going to talk about your elementary school.  But before you do that, I want you to think of that time of your elementary school years and think about a sound, a sight, and a smell that will take you back to Murphy [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Well, you say, you know, you kind of combined a couple of things.  Did you first say a sound?
Speaker 1: Well, just of that time.
Speaker 2: All right.  Our principal was--understand something.  Before schools were segregated, when schools were segregated, I think I told you we went from first through the tenth grade in a three, one, two, three room schoolroom [Texana School, Murphy, North Carolina], maybe four.  And the only reason it was four is because the room that was in the middle served also as the auditorium.  Not like, it probably wasn't much bigger than my office, but they had a dividing partition that you could pull, so you could divide it up.  It literally had four rooms, you know, with the potbelly stove and the whole nine.  Our principal was Principal Ragsdale [Ella B. Ragsdale] when I went to school.  I remember her.  Oh my god, do I remember her, as does everybody.  Now, she, she was rough, but she was--.  The sound?  Again, there were woods all around us.  So the kids, we played, you know.  And they didn't want us to, but we was in the woods.  So, you'd go out.  So the thing I remember is seeing her, you could be anywhere.  And she had one of those bells, old bells, just like that (demonstrates ringing a bell).  She'd have her cup of coffee in one hand. And she squished her coffee, and she was always running, for whatever reason.  Like she ate, and was cleaning her palate I guess with her coffee.  So, she always ran her coffee around in her mouth.  An attractive lady, though, but she was just--but god, she was just--she was attractive, but she was so hard and mean.  And she would paddle you and do the things that took the role of a parent, that she was almost ugly in who she was.  She never married to my knowledge; maybe she did.  But she was just--but I can just see that to this day, almost like cracking a whip.  She'd be out there with that bell, you know, meaning recess is over, and that's what it was.  She would walk around the yard.  She would come out the front door, meaning that recess was over.  So that, that stands out.
Story_ID: 560142
Speaker 1: Oh, as a child.  Oh, my god.  I grew up I had asthma.  I outgrew it I guess, but I really had asthmatic bronchitis.  And I think that kind of runs--not think, I know it runs on my father's [Wesley T. Mauldin] side of the family, not that he has it, but my cousins and my aunt, my aunt has it.  And her son and daughters, two of her daughters and one of her sons has it bad, and has had it their whole life, right.  There was a medicine that almost makes me gag just to think about it now.  So when you say smell--now, that shouldn't be--but there was a medicine that I to take when I had asthma that my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin]--I mean it was the worst tasting stuff you could ever imagine in your entire life.  And I remember as a kid, my mom and everybody holding my nose so I didn't smell it.  And no matter how much they did that, you still almost wanted to throw up.  It was just like, "Oh, my god.  To get well, you have to take something like that?"  That was, I used to joke to the point that that in itself made me outgrow asthma.  I think deep down I was determined to never have to take that medicine again.  So I can't sit here with you right now--I can't necessarily recall, and I don't even want to, the exact smell of it.  But it was absolutely, I remember it being the worst stuff I ever smelt and tasted in my entire life.  And that stands out when I was kid.  Probably by the time I was really--around the time that they integrated schools for me--probably by the time I was thirteen or fourteen years old, I was, had outgrown asthma I think from that standpoint, being plagued with that.

Speaker 1: And what sights do you remember?
Speaker 2: What sights do I remember as a kid (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What stands out in your mind?
Speaker 2: (Unclear). You asked me earlier, and I believe we started to--oh, we started to--anyway we started talking people that owned stores and stuff like that.  We didn't really have any people that was really, people in my community that really owned businesses other than--I mean literally really--when I talk about mom and pop stores, I'm not talking about a grocery store.  I'm talking about a store where you can buy candy, and ice cream, and potato chips, and a loaf of bread maybe.  You know, you couldn't really get groceries, but you could survive if you did that.  But we'd all sit around those porch stores, and that was Uncle Art.  And he was also an Allen, Arthur Allen [James A. Allen].  And we would sit on his--so one thing that happened, I never will forget.  I had a bicycle, it was green.  The bread truck used to pull up all the time right in front of Uncle Art's store, it was the bread truck.  I think it was Kerns [Kerns Bread Co.] or something.  And he was the nicest white guy, I mean the nicest guy.  I mean, he was really neat.  But he would always come through, here comes the bread truck.  You know how it used to be the ice cream truck?  Well, you'd see the bread truck.  And you know, sometimes he'd give people a loaf of bread just to be giving it to them.  He was just a nice guy.  And I messed around and had my bicycle--now I'm a little bitty fellow, right.  I had my bicycle parked right in front of the store, laying down on its side.  And the bread truck ran over my bicycle.  Now that was one of the worst feelings.  And when you say do you remember it?  I remember I had to push it down and hide it--again, my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin]--to take it around to the back of the house and hide it up underneath the porch so they didn't know.  Eventually I knew they were going to find it, you know.  But that the bread truck ran over my darn bike.  I know that wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that was a terrible sight, huh?
Speaker 2: That wasn't terrible, but that was one of the things.
Story_ID: 560144
Speaker 1: And then one of the things that stand out what we would call--it really was bad--the first, the first murder of sorts in and around Murphy [North Carolina] for us.  And believe it or not, it wasn't black folks, but they lived in the black community.  So even when you talk about--there was a couple, Jewel [ph.] and--I want to say Ethel [ph.].  But there was a couple that basically lived a little further up.  There's a mountain right behind Texana [Murphy, North Carolina], a mountain called Fain Mountain.  And there's not a lot of--going right up to the crest of the mountain, that's where the black folks lived.  And then on past that--Ethel hanged--Sam [ph.] and Ethel hanged around my granddaddy [Mauldin's maternal grandfather, Walter Bowman] all the time, and everybody knew them.  They'd walk through Texana, and everybody just knew them.  They wasn't--they wasn't the smartest people in the world, you know.  But they just, they hung around black people all the time.  Well, lo and behold, Sam shot Ethel.  And that was the biggest story.  No one could believe it.  I mean he killed her, shot her dead.  Could not, no one could not--no one could really, really ever believe that Sam shot Ethel, and could never understand why or how, and didn't know.  And it was just--but again, there may be more story to it.  But again, I was young.  Those things stand out.
Story_ID: 560145
Speaker 1: And then we had (laughter), we had people in our community--remember I was talking about the alcohol and stuff like that?  Well, you know, there was bootlegging.  And in North Carolina, bootlegging was huge.  And that's part of my father [Wesley T. Mauldin] being able to drive and move it around.  But, so moonshine and all was big.  There was a lady, there was two people, and they called themselves--I think most people referred to them as the community drunks.  But they also were the nicest people.  But Hardy, Hardy Fain--and that would be a name to look up, because I bet there's some connections to him.  And he probably--but Hardy and Hattie Patton [ph.].  Hattie Patton, I mean that's a name you just wouldn't even hardly hear a kid have today, right.  H-A-T-T-I-E, and I'm assuming its Patton, P-A-T-T-O-N.  They were the public drunks, if you may.  And but these were, you know, back in that era these were people--you know, back then women didn't wear jeans, you know what I'm saying.  These were--it was just different.  You know, you had the long dresses and you had the--that was a different day.  But they would be--I mean, I mean if I can say it on the camera--I mean, they would be what our folks would call pissy drunk, right.  There was a word that we, you know, our older folks used all the time, regardless of how religious or where they were.  And you sort of come up the road, and Hardy would be laying over in the ditch.  And everybody helped him, "Oh, there's old Hardy, let's get him up out of the ditch."  Or Hattie, you know, she would come down the street just cussing up a storm, and fall over in the--.  And it's crazy, because they were almost a couple, and I guess they were.  But they were just, I think they had--they were drinking partners, and then they became probably a couple, I would imagine.  But they stand out big time for me in the town of Texana and Murphy [North Carolina], and wearing those bonnets.  And depending on how drunk she was, it all depended on how the bonnet--it may be tilted to the side like my hat, or it could be, you know, it just depended on exactly what day of the week it was for her.  Those were characters, and that's something that--. You know, when you talk about reality TV today, I would like to say that I often think, but I don't--but now, just imagine if we were able to put all that stuff on camera, because it was so real and genuine.  Those were TV shows to be had.  That people would just--because it was funny.  It was like the kids and everybody cracked up, from old to young, you know.  And your grandparents and people would say, "Now, Hattie, you know better than that.  Get yourself up out of that ditch over there," you know.  And then she'd cuss them out.  But then they'd almost laugh about it.  You know, it was just a comical kind of time.  But again, wasn't nobody trying to hurt nobody.  That's why when Sam [ph.] killed Ethel [ph.], that's why that was such a big thing.  Everybody was like, "What in the world is going on?"  But those are the sounds, and those are the images as really a young kid.  And I'm speaking really before I was fourteen.  Because I think when I became thirteen or fourteen, things started to really change with me.
Story_ID: 560146
Speaker 1: So we talked about the school.  But I don't think we really described your house where you lived, the bedrooms.  Because you talked about a potbelly stove in the school [Texana School, Murphy, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your home in which you lived.
Speaker 2: Well, this is an area that I've always felt a little guilty on.  And I'll tell you why.  My dad [Wesley T. Mauldin] worked hard.  My dad worked hard, and I think that he, he really took care of us.  We had, we never had a woodstove in my house.  We had a coal stove, which back then was probably like--you know, to have a coal stove was like, I don't know--like right now we use gas, but we don't use--it's like a natural gas.  I mean coal stoves were like, you know, you were stepping up.  So, we had a coal stove.  Then, we did get gas.  So we never had--so I used to be with my friends, I'd get a kick out of cutting wood and helping them bring wood in, feeling like, you know.  Check this out, this is kind of deep right here.  Even though I was born in '53 [1953], we never really--there used to be a place they called Cool Springs.  And people that had cars, they would go to Cool Springs and fill up these big things, and they'd drive water back to their house.  So, that's what we basically did before we had water in the house.  But we were the first community--our section of Texana [Murphy, North Carolina] got together--the men of our section, including my granddaddy, Walt Bowman [Walter Bowman], who was very engineering in that kind of way--through the Catholic community and some help, created a water system.  And we had some of the first running water, period, on that end of Texana.  And I say I felt guilty, because the thing was that even though it ran out often and the pump stopped running and all that kind of stuff--my dad and them, we'd have to bring water--we still hauled water.  But as far as my house, my house that my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin] and dad lived in, I'm sure we had it.  But what I don't remember ever having was an outhouse.  Now I remember that at my friend's house, and I remember that at my grandmother's [Vallie Allen Bowman] house, but I don't ever remember having an outhouse at my house.  So, obviously I was born in 1953.  I think my mom and dad built the house in '52 [1952] probably; my grandfather helped them build the house.  So, you know what I'm saying, we had it, but at some point, we had to.  But I can very, very, very--I can't even remember it.  I remember the bathroom being so small, it was smaller than a closet.  But I don't remember that piece.  And I say all of that to say that our house--where most houses were built out of wood and shingles--our house was block.  But again, that's what Granddaddy did, he could lay block.  He became a block mason.  I always wanted to call him a mason, but when I call him a mason, I think a lot of people think about, you know, a Mason, something like joining the organization of Masons.  I'm talking about somebody that could lay brick and lay block, and do that kind of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A brick mason.
Speaker 2: That's what he did, anything relating to cement, you know, he could do that kind of stuff.  And so, we had a block house.  It wasn't that big.  I would say, oh, it wasn't that big at all, probably, you know, fifteen hundred square feet, or two thousand square feet, which might have been big considering that time and that era.  We expanded on it.  Growing up, there were--it was weird.  We had three, it was three bedrooms--my mother and them's room, my room, and then I had a cousin.  Well, my mother had a cousin that stayed with her all the time, who stayed with us, Joanne [ph.].  And then when my sister was born, I can't remember exactly how they did it.  Either Joanne shared a room with her or whatever.  But we had basically a three bedroom house.  And then we had really--after I had family members, then, you know, we had bunk beds.  Me and my brother [Ford Mauldin], we had--I had a bunk bed and my sisters [Lucy Mauldin Raoof and Jenny Mauldin O'Dell] had a bunk bed.  And you know, seems like it was always meant to be--building that house and there were going to be four kids.  It just seemed natural, right.
Story_ID: 560147
Speaker 1: Did you have television and telephones?
Speaker 2: Probably, about as soon as they were available, which is wild, right.  That's why I say I feel--we weren't wealthy, but I didn't do without.  I never did without; and I never, you know, I didn't feel bad about it.  I didn't really ever think about it much.  I'm sure a lot of other people did, though.  People thought, well, you know, that's the Mauldins, they think they all this.  It wasn't that at all.  It's just that my dad [Wesley T. Mauldin] was, like I said, he was known.  So, yeah, we had telephones probably pretty early on.
Speaker 1: And television?
Speaker 2: Television, yeah.  But I do remember this.  In the early '60s [1960s], probably '61 [1961], '62 [1962], I remember going, driving to town, and we weren't the only ones.  When color television started to come into existence, we would drive to town and sit in the car, just like being in a drive-in movie theater, because we used to go to drive-ins.  And we'd sit in the car and look through the window of the--it might have been the Goodyear dealer, wherever they sold TVs in town, to look at these color TVs.  Or either stand out on the sidewalk and look at the color TVs.  Because everybody had the black and whites, you know, with the antenna outside that you had to turn the pole.  And you got two channels, you know.  And by not having a TV--where our TV came--we didn't get Atlanta [Georgia].  We got--we got TV from Chattanooga, Tennessee, that's where the channels came in from, which was always strange.
Story_ID: 560148
Speaker 1: Tell me the name of your elementary school, 'cause we, I didn't get that.  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Texana element- [Texana School].  Well, in Texana [Murphy, North Carolina], it was just a schoolhouse.  It wasn't even called elementary, because all the schools in that county--our classes was one through ten.  So we had in--when I went to school, in the first room was grade four through--one through four, which actually was the room that Miss Ragsdale [Ella B. Ragsdale], who was the principal, taught.  Five, six, seven, yeah.  And then Miss Smith [Helen Smith Miller], who was there when I came in--and there was others before that.  But there was Dr., not Dr., but James Austin and some other people.  Then in the next room was five, six, and seven.  And then the next room was eight, nine, and ten, which considered themselves to be junior high, I guess, or whatever.  That was, that was just the Texana schoolhouse.  That didn't have an elementary or a high school tag to it.  When we integrated schools, which probably--again, I was going through seventh grade, so I'm thinking it was probably '67 [1967] or something like that.  But when schools were--so yeah, I would have been about thirteen, thirteen or fourteen.  I was going into seventh grade, and that was Murphy Elementary [Murphy Elementary School, Murphy, North Carolina] that we went into the school in.  And even then the crazy part, if I remember correctly, one integrated before the other.  I think they tried the high school because we couldn't--they tried to integrate the high schools the year--they did, the year before they did the rest of the schools.  Because we didn't have a tenth--you could only go to tenth grade.  So I think they did it--the high school moved to Murphy earlier, I believe.
Speaker 1: So Murphy High School [Murphy, North Carolina] was there for the white kids to go--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --all along?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So they always were able to go to the twelfth grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Murphy, Murphy is, it's called Cherokee County [North Carolina].  And Cherokee County is the, it has several towns.  I mentioned that Andrews, North Carolina is part of Cherokee County, and little places is around Cherokee County.  But Murphy is the seat, if you may, of Cherokee County.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, it's kind of the center of it.
Story_ID: 560149
Speaker 1: So, now in school, what are the some of the extracurricular activities that you belonged to?
Speaker 2: In school?
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't have--not necessarily in school, but if you were involved in school activities.  I think you mentioned you were in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was in the Cub Scouts growing up.  That was about it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from the urban community before integration, before the integration.  And I know we're in that era, but yeah, I was in the Cub Scouts and I think I moved to Boy Scouts.  And that was, that's about all I can really recall.
Speaker 1: Was that through the church [St. William Catholic Church, Murphy, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, actually it wasn't.  And you know, it's so interesting that you say that.  But there was a Mr. Fess Henry [ph.] who was over the Cub Scouts.  And they were just do right men in the community that was trying to make the kids do right, and they were older.  And then there was Mr. Frank Sutters [ph.], who everybody loved.  He was over the Boy Scouts.  And he was more of the business minded one.  But he was also one of those, he was the deacon of a church which was right across the street from his house.  And he didn't have any kids, which was always weird to me.  He didn't have kids, neither did Mr. Henry have kids.  But they would take care of these kids from the Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts.  And you know, back in North Carolina they had the Scout tel-o-ramas and stuff like that that we would go to, you know.  And I think there were always more Cub Scouts than there were Boy Scouts.  Because again, as they got older, they just kind of moved on.
Story_ID: 560150
Speaker 1: But you know, growing up I had--and I think we were talking about the camps and stuff like that, summer camps, and that was through the church [St. William Catholic Church, Murphy, North Carolina].  There was a place called Buck Creek.  And really the buck I guess was because of the, you know, the buck, the deer.  And the creek was, believe me, there was a lot of creeks.  But it was, Buck Creek was like a little ways away from Murphy [North Carolina], but people went.  And even my cousins and stuff would come in and spend summer in Murphy, and then they would have to go to camp with me for two weeks.  And it was just a good way for our parents and all to go and drop us off somewhere.  But it was also a great environment because it was kids from all over--Dahlonega, Georgia, different parts--more from Georgia than it really was North Carolina, because we were right on the Georgia/Tennessee line where Buck Creek was.  And they had a lot of--you know, you wake up in the morning and--now that I do remember, because it was like mess halls.  It was like, you know, it was--that camp area was just a large grounds.  And they just had activities.  They had a swimming pool, but they had all kinds of activities there.  And everybody didn't get to experience that, but that was a great thing though.
Speaker 2: Was it integrated?
Speaker 1: Oh, very much.  I mean, yeah, I mean big time.  And that's what I'm saying.  That was a, I think that also played a real big role.  I don't think a lot of blacks from my community got a chance to do that.  That was just me being a part of the church, and then the relationships.  And then I think you had to--because you know, obviously there was a list.  So I think you had to--my cousin Van [ph.] and some of those guys who lived in Asheville [North Carolina] who weren't Catholic went a couple of times.  Hated it, because you know, you're leaving--first of all you're going up and you're living--and you have to--the one thing you didn't do--every morning at six a.m. the bells would ring, and you'd get up and go.  And you had to wash your face, you know, with the cold water that was in the--.  It was like being in the military barracks almost.  And then we'd have to go to, you know, you'd have a quick little chapel service.  So you had to go to church.  You had chores.  You'd have to eat.  And I remember they used to have pancakes.  But then most of it was just activities--softball teams, and doing all of those kinds of things.  So that gave me a different perspective growing up, definitely.  And then as I--you know, that was, again, that was in the early days.  That was all pre-seventh grade.  And I think that's about it, other than getting involved with--I knew a lot of white kids, again, because of my dad [Wesley T. Mauldin] and our love for cars and his love for cars, and racing and those kind of things.  So we were always around those people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When did your--
Story_ID: 560151
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When did your father [Wesley T. Mauldin] start racing?  When did you get involved in racing?
Speaker 2: Wow. Probably as long as I can remember.  In a certain way, I mean he raced on the streets, and he did all kind of stuff.  Like I say again, his name was Lightnin', and he was notorious for that, for out running the law and all that stuff.  But back in the '60s [1960s] he had--yeah, he started driving on a dirt track.  They started building tracks around there, and everybody wanted Lightnin' to drive for them.  And he, he was good.  He wasn't necessarily on the track, on a sanctioned track.  He wasn't necessarily the best, but he drew attendants.  People would come from miles because Lightnin' was racing.  And him and a good friend of his, Jack Wimpey, who owned a trucking company and bulldozers and stuff like that, they invested with--they basically built the car and he drove it.  They were partners of sorts.  And it was a white guy.  And we were going to a track up in Andrews, North Carolina on the regular.  And they had a major dispute.  And they were bringing people--and they had a major dispute with the track owner.  And Jack said, "You know what?  Well, we'll just fix this right now.  I'll just build my own darn track."  And that's really the kickoff.  After that, Jack Wimpey went and built a track that exists to this day called Tri-County Speedway [Tri-County Race Track, Brasstown, North Carolina].  And I helped them, you know, pick up rocks.  Because it's a dirt track, so you know, it had to be dug out and built with a bulldozer.  And it took ever how long, but they made it a real project.  And my dad was probably the first one to drive on it.  And his friend Jim Twiggs was on it.  And it just, it created that following.  And even to this day my dad still goes to dirt--he goes to races, period.  I mean even at eighty--or how ever old he is, eighty-three or whatever it is--I take him to NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing] races because I'm a big NASCAR fan.  But he still goes to the dirt track.  And they even now give him a chair, so he doesn't have to sit in the bleachers with everybody.  He's like that guy, one of those guys.  There's probably three or four of them that have their own little chairs that they give them, so they can sit there and be comfortable.
Speaker 1: So he was part of the, the first part of NASCAR.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that was--
Speaker 1: This wasn't something that blacks were really involved in.
Speaker 2: Right, no, no, no.  You know, yeah, he was there in the early days.  He was around, but he was doing it in offbeat way, because we were in the country.  But like he knew Wendell Scott, and we knew those people that have gotten the bill of being those drivers.  But my dad was around.  He never participated in a real sanctioned circuit like some of the, you know, organized racing like that, but in the backwoods he was notorious for that.  And so that kind of--and then I think I just grew up into that.  So, I was driving obviously at the age of twelve.  I remember when my dad probably really realized how good I could drive.  We were working on his racecar one night, he was.  And we were at Townson Lumber Company, where he would keep it.  And you know, he had access to all the equipment.  He used torches and welding guns and all that; we'd do it from there.  And the car fell, you know, like you cut fender wells out and stuff to put the tires on.  The car fell, and fell on his hand and cut his hand really, really bad, really bad.  And it was just him and me, little old me, and I'm probably thirteen or fourteen.  And he had a pickup truck, and he was like, "Mike [HistoryMaker Michael Mauldin], you got to help me.  Son, you got to get me to the hospital."  And you know, we got in the truck, and I took off driving the truck.  I mean, he knew I could drive.  But I mean we drove through town and everything.  And so from that day on--I was thirteen, and took him to the hospital that night.  And people didn't really--I mean this was Lightnin', and I was Lightnin's son.  So the cops and everybody, they knew it.  You know, they would want to get me.  But at fourteen or fifteen years old, I was driving.  I had my first car, which everybody thinks--I know people used to think, "Oh, there he goes again.  He's giving him a car."  But I worked for that.  I was actually, I actually was a young orderly helping out at the hospital.  I washed dishes at the hospital with my [maternal] grandmother [Vallie Allen Bowman].  I actually worked, so I earned money.  And my car, my first car note was thirty dollars a month, you know.  And I paid for it.
Speaker 1: What type of car was it?
Speaker 2: A '63 [1963]--really the first car--I had a '62 [1962] Ford, but I didn't keep that, for some reason, something was wrong; I don't think the engine was quite right.  My dad took that back from me, I had that about a month.  So really it was a '63 [1963] Ford.

Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay, wow, the 29th, that's unique.
Speaker 1: Of 2008.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is a completion interview.
Story_ID: 560153
Speaker 1: The last time, we talked about your growing up in Murphy, Murphy, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you told us that you went to an integrated school, and you had both black and white friends.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your last year in high school [Murphy High School, Murphy, North Carolina].  Was there a teacher that might have talked to you about college?  Was college in your plans?  Had music been a part of your teenage years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, music had been a part of me since I was like twelve, eleven or twelve years old, in one way or the other.  I got in bands and, you know, I always thought I could sing.  And I played the tambourine and whatever.  But all the musicians that I was around were older than I.  And you know, and I always, I don't even know why, but my mother [Grace Bowman Mauldin] allowed me to play with these guys.  I mean we were all in the community, so I guess that was cool.  And then when I was fifteen, I got in a group which I think, you know, as I'd mentioned before, called the Other Side, which, you know, that was mainly because of me singing in the choirs and stuff in high school and those kind of things.  And I guess it really took off when I was more like sixteen.  But we became a pretty well established act around--locally or regionally.  And I was a singer, the lead singer of the group.  All the musicians were white, though.  It was an integrated group, and the group like I said was called the Other Side.  And we didn't really do original material, we just did cover material.  But the good part about us, in 1970 it was the fact that we were, you know, we were doing songs by Creedence Clearwater [Creedence Clearwater Revival], but we were also doing songs by [HistoryMaker] Tyrone Davis, or we were doing songs by James Brown.  But we were also doing songs by Blood, Sweat, and Tears.  So it was kind of a real, you know, mixed role.  And at the same time, because of me being who I was, I think I kind of added a little extra,  because I always added a soulfulness to some of the more rock and pop related kind of songs.  But we had a good little following, and we performed pretty much every weekend.  And we did that throughout high school.  So my senior year of high school, I didn't really always--I ran track and field, but I didn't really do, you know, much on the football field--I tried that--and not much on the basketball field, and I tried that.  But I was really that entertainer guy.  Most people probably thought that that's-- even though I was in a little town called Murphy, and it would probably never happen.  But most people were saying, "If anybody's going to do anything in music, it'll probably be [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin."

Speaker 1: So I went through my senior year of high school in 1971 with the idea that, you know, I'm going to go on to college.  My thoughts were because no one in my family, that I was abreast of, had really had a college education that way.  So, I thought I would go to college and take up political science.  I understood and found out that political science was something that you would take if you wanted to be a lawyer.  Not that I thought I was necessarily a lawyer, but I did feel like I could have the ability to be.  So that being said, I kind of went from, you know, I ended up just being--you know, doing it, kind of going through the motions.  I felt like I did it to, in all honesty, to make my family kind of proud.  "Oh, Michael [HistoryMaker Michael Mauldin], you know, he was a wild kid going through high school but--," you know.  So, I decided I was going to go to A and T University [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in Greensboro [North Carolina].  After doing some research I wanted to, I basically wanted to go to an environment that I wasn't abreast of, was never a part of.  And that was the fact that being an all-black institution [HBCU]--I thought to be able to go to A and T would kind of just give me that which I didn't really have at Murphy [Murphy High School, Murphy, North Carolina] because of, you know, the integration of things, which was fine.  But you know, you'd hear about the AU Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium] in Atlanta [Georgia], or you'd hear about, you know, Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  And I'm like man, that's what I want to do.  And then as I was growing up, probably my senior year in school, I knew I had friends in Asheville, North Carolina that went to some of those schools, and they were just, seemed like they were having a blast.  And I wanted to be a part of that.  So I thought I was going to go to A and T, and was preparing to do that.  But along the way, I always knew music was my thing.  And somehow, some way, there was a gentleman that came to visit me and my family, and discussed the opportunities in Atlanta of going to a school called the DeVry Institute of Technology [DeVry University].  And DeVry back then, even though now it's became pretty well known, it was small.  It was--but it was all about things in technology--electronics, and those things.  And even though I wasn't necessarily looking at myself as being in electronics, I'm like, "Okay, that could be something that I could do.  You know, the tuition isn't something that's going to put my parents [Grace Bowman Mauldin and Wesley T. Mauldin] really out of whack.  And I'll be in Atlanta, and I can take my car my first year, you know."  So, I'm thinking about it on a whole different basis.  And so, that's kind of what I did.  I ended up moving to Atlanta after I graduated from school.  I went to, went down to Greensboro and checked it out for a few days, just to be safe and sure.  But you know, I had a dorm already assigned and everything at A and T, and decided that I wasn't--and you know, my folks didn't fight me on it.  I just decided that I wasn't going to stay down there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So you graduated from high school in 1971?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 560155
Speaker 1: So tell me about the move to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Right after high school, I moved to Atlanta. Well, my move to Atlanta was right after high school [Murphy High School, Murphy, North Carolina].  It was pretty interesting, because again, Atlanta being a fast city.  And you know, my folks [Grace Bowman Mauldin and Wesley T. Mauldin] brought me down and we had a dorm right up here on 8th Street.  Everything was like in the center of Atlanta.  Back then, Krystals were twenty-five cents, maybe fifteen--the Krystal burgers, I'm talking about.  And fries were twenty cents, so you could get a whole meal.  You could get like--you know, the thing that--it's amazing that I remember that.  But the big thing for me was that on the corner of Peachtree Street and 8th Street was the Krystal burger spot.  And that was our hangout.  We would, I'd get me two or three Krystal burgers and two orders of fries and a chocolate shake, and I swear it didn't cost me any more than a dollar twenty-five [cents].  And I was good, and that was it.  But I really started realizing that Atlanta, there was a fast life here, and that I felt I belonged in, and I stayed here for a good little while.
Story_ID: 560156
Speaker 1: I had some really dramatic things that happened.  I had a friend here that was based in Macon; his home was Macon, Georgia.  His name was Jacque [ph.].  And Jacque was a cool guy, and liked music.  From day one when my family brought us down, he was, he'd been at DeVry [DeVry Institute of Technology; DeVry University] for a while.  He was more one of the senior guys, and again, an older cat.  But for whatever reason, we hit it off the first day, and we just started hanging out.  And Thanksgiving of my first year--now I'd only been at DeVry two or three months.  And Thanksgiving, I decided I was going to go home with Jacque, down to Macon, and we went to visit his family.  And we had a crazy incident that took place.  We arrived like, it must have been about midnight.  He had a little old Volvo.  And we went by his mother's house.  And back then, I ate pork and everything else.  And they had chitterlings and all that stuff seriously.  And we ate and then we went out for a while, and then we caught up in some craziness.  We got rammed from behind by a car, through whatever reason.  And there was a guy that was intoxicated.  And the crazy part about it, it was a white guy that was actually intoxicated.  And we never knew him.  And when the car was behind us, it was actually following us really close.  We thought maybe it somebody, or Jacque did, somebody from his community that knew him or knew his car.  So we just ran faster and faster, and the car was right on our bumper.  And back then in the mid-'70s [1970s] in Macon, there was a lot of gravel roads and all that kind of stuff.  So, we cut down some little gravel street and came to the stop sign.  And when we got to the stop sign, we actually stopped.  But right as we got to the stop sign, we got hit from behind and knocked across the street.  And Jacque and his brother was in the back, and I was sitting up front.  And we were like in shock.  So when we got out--we started to get out of the car.  I was one of the first ones to get out.  When Jacque got and went back to--like, "What's going on?"  You know, kind of like, "What the hell is going on?"  And this guy got out shooting, and he shot Jacque.  And I heard Jacque or his brother or one of them say, "Run, he's got a gun."  I went one way, and they--we all went in different directions.  I heard the gunshots, I heard different things.  I didn't know what, I didn't know what was going on.  I was calling Jacque's name, and you could hear because it was dark.  By this time it's like two or three [o'clock] in the morning.  We'd went to the bus station to get some cigarettes or something back then.  It was just kind of crazy.  And the wildest thing to me is that as I was walking up on it after a while--because I'm kind of staying away--and I could still see lights.  I heard dogs barking, and it was just crazy.  I didn't know anything about Macon, Georgia.  Here's this little ol' guy from a little town in Murphy, North Carolina that went down to a place--didn't really know Jacque's family well.  I met them for thirty minutes at the house, or maybe an hour.  And by that time you're seeing houselights come on and different things, because they could hear, people heard the gunshots.  And as I walked up to this gravel road--slowly but surely--because in a minute, I heard police cars and stuff coming, right.  So I walked up to the gravel road, and I couldn't believe it.  I saw Jacque laying face down in the gravel.  And I was like devastated, obviously.  I was seventeen years old, yeah, or just turned eighteen.  And it was the most traumatic thing for me.  I'd never really seen nothing like that.  And this guy was totally drunk, totally drunk, obviously calling us out of our names.  It was just--I don't know for what reason or why.  I think ultimately it came out that we passed him on the road and he felt like we cut him off or something, and he ran us down.  And again, that was in a crazy time, because that was the early '70s [1970s].  And it, it, it wasn't a good scene in Macon, to be honest with you.  Not that it created any kind of, to my knowledge, any kind of disturbance as far as, you know, racial imbalance and stuff like that, but it definitely was something crazy.  And the crazy part about it, Jacque's brother got shot, even though he ended up being okay.  And of course, Jacque got killed.  And I didn't get shot at all. And here I am, I felt so guilty, because I'm with Jacque's mother, his grandparents, and I'm at the jail hospital.  It was--so, again, that was--and I'm sorry to get off on a tangent, but as I kind of talk about it--I really hadn't talked about that in years.  And that was probably my wakeup call, "Okay, [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin, you just done grew up.  You just, you've left Murphy, North Carolina now, and you've kind of grew up."  So, you know.
Speaker 2: So I'm sure that this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even though that was Macon, that was my introduction to Atlanta [Georgia], because it was just an extension, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 560157
Speaker 1: So now, you're here to go to DeVry [DeVry Institute of Technology; DeVry University] and--.  Tell me just a little bit about the school and the people that you know there, and maybe some of the teachers.  And what are you--your course of study?  What do you are you learning there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was about electronics; it was really technology.  You know, my goal was not being an electrician, but really the technology.  And I think about it all the time.  And here I go again with kind of an unfinished project.  I was into it.  I really started realizing, wow, this was kind of--DeVry to me was, at least for a lot of urban kids, DeVry was ahead of its time in a certain way, because of the technology of computers, and just the way electronics and the way of the world was going.  Not that I could necessarily see that, but I think that's what I was buying into with the hope that, you know, this will carry me--to give me an occupation or something that I hopefully can make a lot of money on, and maybe there would be a way of having some association with music.  So, I really was studying to do that.  You know, there were things that was involving geometry and different things like that.  Because, you know, we, I remember we had to deal with the slide rules.  And going into high school in '71 [1971], I never really dealt with that kind of stuff much.  So that was all uniquely different, you know.  And I met a lot of kids from, they were all over.  There were a lot of kids though from the South, South Carolina, Tennessee and all that went to school here in Atlanta [Georgia].  But again, the same thing.
Story_ID: 560158
Speaker 1: I rolled into 1972 and I found out that my girlfriend back at the time, back in North Carolina, through my holiday visit at home, had became pregnant.  And it was kind of like, okay, what are you going to do?  Talking to my mom [Grace Bowman Mauldin] and them, "What are you going to do?"  You know, and I decided, I guess it was March of '72 [1972]--no, yeah, around March of '72 [1972]--February or March of '72 [1972]--that I was going to leave DeVry [DeVry Institute of Technology; DeVry University], in tears.  Because I was in Atlanta [Georgia] and hated it, but I decided I was going to go back to North Carolina and do the right thing and marry her and have this child, although I was only eighteen years old.  And that's what I did.  So early March, I left Atlanta after only being here six months.  And, and, again, the wildest thing was that I didn't necessarily want to leave school, and I didn't necessarily want to leave Atlanta, but there's a lot that had happened.  Jacque [ph.] came, and then this had happened.  And I'm like, you know what?  Maybe this is all--I've just always been that kind of guy--I'm like maybe this is all for a reason.  And if I go back to North Carolina, I've got to just get the band.  I've got to crank up a band or something.  So I ended up going back to North Carolina in that time.  Got married and--
Speaker 2: And what was your wife's name?
Speaker 1: Cecilia, and last name was Mosley [Cecilia Mosley].  And everybody called her Tina, that was her middle name, Vestina.  And I, you know, ended up marrying her.  We didn't necessarily live together because she was still, believe it or not, still in high school.  She was in her last year of high school.  So, you know, I was probably a little fast, I will admit.  And we--but you know, I think I did the right thing.  I went back to say, okay, you know, I'm going to do that.  So then of course, guess what? [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin, you're going to have a kid.  Whether it's a girl or a boy, you're going to have a kid, and you need to get a job, and, you know.  So then I decided I was going to go back and just get a regular job.  But I wanted to do my music, so I did.  I took up a job with a company called Magnavox, which was right outside of my home in Murphy [North Carolina].  So I went back to Murphy and Tina stayed in Asheville [North Carolina] with her mother and father while she was pregnant, so her mother could kind of look after her.  And I'd go to Asheville every weekend and, you know.  But we were joined at the time.
Story_ID: 560159
Speaker 1: And your child that was born, son or daughter?
Speaker 2: Son.  My son was born, and I was really into my music.  So when I realized he was born on September 23, 1972, and when I realized--for some reason I want to say that was either Friday or Saturday, but I kind of get the days mixed up.  We had never really--we'd talked about it, Tina [Mauldin's first wife, Cecilia Mosley] and I, about the name, but we never really talked about it much.  And I guess just, you know, the guy in me or whatever, my influence in music, I named Jermaine [Jermaine Dupri].  And, you know, I was into music.  And quite honestly--you know, my name was Michael [HistoryMaker Michael Mauldin], and I did what I did.  So, I named him Jermaine.  One of my favorite groups at the time was obviously The Jackson Five.  I'm like--even though for whatever reason, it just was--and Jermaine Jackson was a great, or I thought was a really good bass player. I'll say great bass player, but a really good bass player.  And he could sing, and so that's kind of what it was.  It was just like, you know, it was a kid--in a way, it was a kid thing.  But then one of the greatest artists of all time that I really loved was Donny Hathaway.  And I listened, I used to listen to his records all the time.  And the guy that played bass for him--well, Willie Weeks played bass.  But there was a guy that played guitar named Cornell Dupree on Donny Hathaway 'Live,' Cornell Dupree.  And I'm just--so one day I'm riding in the car listening to the song called "Ghetto" ["The Ghetto"] with Donny Hathaway, and he had Cornell Dupree on guitar.  And I'm like, "Wow, Jermaine Dupri, that would be a great name."  And the only difference is that I spell it different.  And because I was into cars, there used to be a car out called the Capri.  And the Capri was spelled P-R-I, like, you know, instead of P-R-E, or like Grand Prix, P-R-I-X.  But it was -pri.  So I said, okay, you know--again, that's kind of the black thing in me I guess.  I just had to make it a little different (laughter).  So it's like, okay, it's going to be D-U-P-R-I, Jermaine Dupri, not like Cornell Dupree, which is P-R-E-E.  I went and, you know, I told Tina, and she agreed.  And I don't remember us ever really talking about it a lot, which is probably not good.  I don't mean to be chauvinistic or anything, but I just told her that's what I wanted to name my son.  And she went along with it, next thing I know that was on his birth certificate.  So, it was Jermaine Dupri Mauldin.
Story_ID: 560160
Speaker 1: Now, you talked about taking a job at Magnavox.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did you do there?
Speaker 2: I was working the assembly line.  We built consoles for stereos and all that stuff.  Magnavox obviously was a furniture company that, I guess they're still around.  I don't know, but back then they were pretty prominent.  But it was the cabinetry and the stuff that we did, which was right outside of Murphy [North Carolina].  And you know, I always, I was a mover and shaker.  So I started on the assembly line, but I ended up getting a job that was kind of, I was able to visit the different stations.  I was taking parts and pieces around to everybody, which kind of allowed me to kind of stay in the mix, instead of being stuck in one spot.  And I, you know, again it was--I knew it was just a temporary scenario.  And I did that until Jermaine [Jermaine Dupri] was born.  And then when he was born, I moved to Asheville, North Carolina and got an apartment, and we, you know--to create the family piece there.  And then I was just getting ready to turn, my birthday is in October, so I'd just turned nineteen.  And I got an apartment, and I ended up working for a company called, it was a steel company called Dave's Steel [Dave Steel Company, Inc., Asheville, North Carolina].  And through my father-in-law and some other people, they got me an interview and I went down there and took that job.  Now, that was a rough job.  So, when you say what did you do there?  It was a dangerous, rough job.  Because it really was a steel company, hot stuff, and I think I was working something called the press machine that you had to be extremely careful on, because it just kind of cut and did whatever.  I didn't like that at all, but I did it.  I did it, and it was hard work.  But the good part about it, I had put back, put together my band again.  It was a different band.  It wasn't the Other Side, but it was guys that I'd played with in Murphy.  And they were, again, younger than me, I mean older than me, but we all got together.  By then, at that time, I was playing drums.  And I met a guy in Asheville that ran a club, a nightclub.  It was a street called Eagle Street, which is where you played the numbers, and you did--it was just one of them streets, you know.  All cities have their streets, but that was the--
Speaker 1: This is in Asheville?
Speaker 2: That was in Asheville, North Carolina.  I was living there then, and this was '72 [1972], or going into--'72 [1972] going into '73 [1973].  And we started playing and putting the band together, and that became my thing.  So I was able to work during the day at a steel company, and able to have a band.  And we rehearsed, and then we started doing shows in and around North Carolina again.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the second band?
Speaker 2: That band was called, this is probably going to be funny to you.  That band was called The Choking Kind [ph.] (laughter).  The Choking Kind was a song, Joe Simon had a song called 'The Chokin' Kind.'  (Singing) "I only meant to love you."  Anyway, and it was--so you know, as crazy as that sounds, we were The Choking Kind.  And with that, we started doing gigs in and around, like I said, North Carolina and so forth.  Because, they were based, the band members were based in my hometown of Murphy, and they would come out to Asheville on weekends.  It was really, I was doing a lot of back and forth.  So when we realized, "Oh, man, we kind of got it together," and we were doing gigs and whatever, I moved back to Murphy.  I still had to take a job, and I still had to do, you know, other things.  And then I went and started working for--I'm trying to remember.  I think it was Levi's [Levi Strauss and Company] or something like that.  Because back then, a lot of those textile companies and large companies were, you know, were big, as far as assembly line types of companies.  So I worked for Levi Strauss, which was right, based outside of Murphy.  And that was just jeans, they were obviously making jeans.  And I did the trim work on the jeans, which meant I got rid of all the loose strings and the stuff like that, what's around them.  But, again, playing music was the foundation of that.
Story_ID: 560161
Speaker 1: From that, I got an opportunity to do a much better job with a company called the TVA.  Well, it was the Tennessee Valley Authority, which was TVA.  But it was, back then it was one of the best paying jobs you could really get, just to be a day laborer.  And so that was really--also I'm thinking I'm moving up, you know.  And, but it wasn't what you call an annual position, meaning that you could not work a full year, for whatever reason.  Or, you could only work like ten months (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was seasonal, in other words.
Speaker 1: You know, seasonal.  It would be almost a full year, but then they have to cut you off.  I don't know what the purpose of that--I never understood the purpose of that.  And you could almost--then you'd have to go back through the process again of getting rehired if you wanted to.  So, in '74 [1974] when they cut me off, obviously I needed to work.  They suggested I go to their office in Chattanooga, Tennessee to get a job and continue.  And I brought one of my bandmates with me, and we decided to go to Chattanooga.  Well, I got to Chattanooga.  I had a van which carried my--that we used to carry my equipment and all that stuff.  And I got to Chattanooga, and I pulled up.  I never will forget this.  I pulled up.  I actually got there at night, so we kind of slept in my van, the whole nine.  I pulled up on the street, and the next morning the line was so long to do the interviews for the TVA, I'm like, "You know what?  I'm not doing this."  And I think deep in my heart I knew I wanted to get back to Atlanta [Georgia].  But I'm like, "I'm not doing this."  And I'm like, "Man, let's go to Atlanta."  And we cranked up the ghetto super van.  The ghetto--my van was called the ghetto super van.
Speaker 2: The ghetto super van.
Speaker 1: It was a Ford Econoline, a '71 [1971] Ford Econoline van, mustard yellow, you know, had mags and custom wheels and, you know, it was all set up on the inside.  So, we cranked up the ghetto super van and shot down I-75 [Interstate 75] from Chattanooga to Atlanta.  Had some friends down here that I knew, and I moved in with them.  And the goal was for me to get my band back together.  And that was what I--so that was kind of the start of--that was '74 [1974], and that was kind of the, I feel the movement for me to get really into the music business at that point and time.
Speaker 2: So, what was going on with your wife [Mauldin's first wife, Cecilia Mosley]?  She decided to stay in Murphy [North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Well, she stayed in Murphy while I just, you know, she stayed in Murphy.  We had an apartment and all with my son [Jermaine Dupri] while I was seeking work or finding out where I was going to ultimately lay.  When I left Murphy she said, "Okay, I guess we're going to be moving to Chattanooga or either you're going to take a job in Chattanooga and come home on the weekends, or whatever."  She really didn't know I was going to go to Atlanta.  Somewhere in the back of my mind, though, when I was going down to Chattanooga--you have to go down this little winding road from Murphy to Chattanooga.  Murphy's right on the Georgia/Tennessee line, so everyone knows you're ninety-two miles from Chattanooga, or one hundred miles from Atlanta; so it's real close.  But when I was going down through there, I really, I don't think I ever really had the real intention of doing the TVA thing, again, unless it was just so automatic that I had to take the job.
Speaker 2: So when you get here, are your friends in the music business, the ones that you come to stay with?
Speaker 1: At that time, not that I knew that they were.  One of the--their brother, their older brother, though, had a relationship with a guy that was in the music business.  And they sold furniture, including the guy, you know.  And his name was Frankie [Frankie Redmond], and Frankie was a singer.  So, you know, that was something that--yeah, so after a while, I was able to play behind him and start doing, you know, being in his backup band, and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 560162
Speaker 1: So, did you bring your band to back up Frankie?  What is Frankie's last name?
Speaker 2: Frankie Redmond.  Yes, I actually, I met Frankie through the big brother of the guys that I was staying with, John.  And John, John Alexander [ph.], God rest his soul, was a great guy.  But John decided that he was going to manage Frankie, and he worked with Frankie in a furniture store business, and they seemed to be doing really well.  But Frankie was already recording for RCA Records.  So, yes.  And then when they realized, "Oh, [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin, he sings background and Michael Mauldin plays drums." I'm like--and then I knew John's family and his brothers.  I'm like, "Man, we got these great guys," and they knew the guys.  He said, "Oh, yeah, they're really talented."  So we made, I went with John, and we made a trip up to Murphy [North Carolina].  We rode in his, he had a Pontiac Grand Prix, a brand new Pontiac Grand Prix.  So, him and I went back to my hometown one weekend, drove up to Murphy, and I introduced him to all my guys.  And then we convinced the guys to come down, and all of a sudden the next thing we know, we had almost like a frat house.  Because his brother's apartment was jam packed with all of us, two or three of us staying in one room off of Mayson Turner [Road], over in the ghetto part of the City of Atlanta [Georgia].  I say ghetto, it really was.  So, my ghetto van worked out perfectly.  It sat out there, and seemed like it was made for that whole scene.  And so therefore, then we got together and started playing and rehearsing with Frankie as his backup band, and started doing gigs, regional gigs and stuff in and around Atlanta and so forth.
Speaker 1: Did you record with him?
Speaker 2: Didn't record with him.  But here's what the interesting thing is.  There was a gentleman by the name of Reggie, Reginald Hargrove--no, Reginald, Reggie Hargis [Reginald J. Hargis], who was actually a member of the group Brick.  And Reggie was, everybody knew him in Atlanta as this really good studio--a great guitar player, and he was playing behind Frankie.  Little did I know; I didn't know Reggie.  Everybody thought I should know Reggie, but I didn't know Reggie.  But he became well known, and he was the one that helped Frankie make a lot of his music.  And from there, you know, that's kind of what started changing my life--people like Reggie and different people I started meeting through Frankie's relationship.  Eventually my guys in the band--because we weren't making a lot of money--they left their families to come down here.  Eventually that went to the side, because they decided that they wanted to spend time back at home.  So they left and went back to Murphy.  So, that kind of broke that up.  So, Frankie had to do his own thing.  And so that kind of left me, I couldn't play behind him by myself.  So I think he went out and seeked another band, and the whole nine.
Story_ID: 560163
Speaker 1: And I was just, at that point I was just, I had already brought my family--I, you know, had a job working at DeVry [DeVry Institute of Technology; DeVry University]--not DeVry--working at Zep Manufacturing Company [Zep, Inc.] here in Atlanta [Georgia].  And again, just another job, an assembly line type of scenario.  And I brought my family down and got an apartment on the south side of Atlanta.  And I took a job, kept striving, and starting taking music lessons and doing different things to really put me on point.  And (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Where were you taking music lessons?
Speaker 1: Just from private instructors, no--you know, no big school or nothing like that.  And I was really--because I was playing drums, so I was really trying to get my drum stuff together.  And along the way, in doing that, I befriended some guys.  Actually, it's so coincidental.  Because the guy that I mentioned earlier, John Alexander [ph.], who put me with Frankie [Frankie Redmond], he started a club, a nightclub, in Stockbridge, Georgia.  And that nightclub, he put it together, the whole nine.  And he ended up getting a regular band to play in there.  Little did I know, that band was called Brick.  Now, I knew most of those guys because they used to play--Ray Ransom and Jimmy Brown [Jimmy "Lord" Brown], they would play in a group called Dawn's Early Light, and stuff like that.  They were playing over on the south side.  But they were just great musicians, and they came together and started making a record under the name of Brick.  And they had a little regional hit called 'Music Matic.'  By then, this is 1975.  And I helped John at the club.  And then through sound--the sound system and all that--because of my experience in doing that, I helped him.  So then, I became very acquainted with the guys in the band, and they got to know me and we started hanging out.  And Eddie Irons, who was the drummer, I started spending time with him, and Donald [Donald Nevins], who was the keyboard player.  So we all just became friends.  And that's what kind of led me at that point into another stage of my life.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the name of the club?
Speaker 1: Believe it or not, because--to show you how people use influence--they named the club either Brick City [ph.], or it was something that--it started out as the Stockbridge Country Club [ph.].  But then I think because Brick played there so much and they started getting such a local following, I think they changed it and added the group's name to it or something.  It was a crazy time.  But--
Speaker 2: Do you have any idea of why Stockbridge was the place that he would put a nightclub?  Because it's very rural.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think he had a girlfriend or something that lived down there, (laughter) and he felt the opportunity to get a club, and wasn't nothing going on down there.  But like you said, it was rural, and people, he felt the people would come out.  If I remember correctly, I think he had went by and visited the spot.  And, you know, it needed entertainment, but they had a lot of people that was showing up and just hanging out and drinking and playing the jukebox and all.  And he had this idea about putting a band in there, and it just kind of--I think again, through the Frankie Redmond--Frankie actually performed there.  But with Reggie [Reginald J. Hargis] and those guys--and Reggie was in Brick.  So, one thing--and again, until now I hadn't really thought about that connection that way.  But Reggie probably played a real role, because they all got this band, and this gave them a way of rehearsing and playing on the regular.  And they were able to leave their equipment there, and they just--and Stockbridge was right down the road, so.
Story_ID: 560164
Speaker 1: So what happens next with, with Brick?  How do you continue the relationship?
Speaker 2: Really, coincidentally--obviously they knew me.  I had, again, the ghetto super van.  And my--they were playing shows.  They started getting more and more popular.  They had a song called 'Music Matic' in '75 [1975] that really took off in south Georgia and in Florida; it really started working in Florida.  And they asked me to--one night one of their cars broke down, because they were carrying all their equipment in different cars and stuff like that.  And I think Reggie [Reginald J. Hargis] or one of the guys--anyway they called me up to see if I would help them get their equipment.  I believe it was in Athens, from Athens, Georgia back to Atlanta [Georgia], because they went and did a gig.  So I said, yeah, you know.  So that Saturday morning, you know, they bought me some gas, ten dollars or five dollars or something like that, and I went up and loaded it.  So when I got there, they were all, they were there with the cars that they had.  And we started just loading up my van, and lo and behold, we were able to put all their equipment in my van.  So, I was able to drive the van, and drove the stuff to Atlanta.  When I got to Atlanta, we didn't even unload it.  When I got to Atlanta, they said, "Man, Mike [HistoryMaker Michael Mauldin], we got a gig down in Savannah, Georgia tomorrow.  Would you, you want to carry our stuff down to Savannah?  We'll give you fifteen dollars, or twenty dollars. You can just be there."  I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, no problem, cool."  And that's what started it.  I ended up going--and when I went with them to Savannah, that was a big show.  A group called Hot Chocolate--I say a big show.  It was in the auditorium, and Brick was just one of the bills.  And a group called Hot Chocolate and some other--and I remember Hot Chocolate.  There were probably a lot of other more well known names, but I remember that group for some reason.  And at that point, I was just carrying their equipment.  But now, I'm on a big stage.  So I helped them put the equipment on the stage, and I started helping them set stuff up.  And it just kind of became a natural thing to me.  And I really just worked myself into a position with them without even saying that's what I was doing, or without them even knowing that's what I was doing.  And so then when they got off stage and got through performing, obviously they were sweaty and everything.  They get off stage, so they have to go back.  And they had one guy, but they would go back and try to get their equipment together.  I just started getting the stuff off stage for them, and helping them.  And the next thing you know, they felt like they had a road crew between me and the guy that was helping them.  And that's kind of the way it kicked off.  So, I became a roadie at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is, now how long do you work with Brick?
Speaker 2: For a long time.  I say a long time, because this was 1975.  And Brick started really, really hitting, and they were doing, they did something called the Kool Jazz Festival, which was in '75 [1975].  And then that really gave me the bug, because the Kool Jazz Festival was at the, it was a stadium event.  It was at the old Atlanta Stadium [Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia], and I was able to take the ghetto super van.  Now that van, oh, god, I don't have it today, it's a shame.  But that van meant a lot to me.  I was able to take that van and really drive on the Atlanta Braves field.  And you know, they had the plywood and you had to follow it so that you didn't--but because I had the equipment in there, I drove--and I never will forget.  I felt like I was--I'm driving out on the field with my van.  And it was like such a, I'm like man, I'm on this, I'm on the Atlanta Braves baseball field.  Mama [Grace Bowman Mauldin], you should see me now (laughter).  You know, but I was doing it to unload the equipment, and obviously there was a lot of groups, you know, from Earth, Wind and Fire--.  I mean there were just groups, prominent bands.  And I'm like, okay, I've made it, this is kind of it.  And again, that was '75 [1975], and things started really taking off.  So from there, I became the stage manager for Brick.  And things took off so good for them.  They ended up doing a song, recording a song called 'Dazz,' and really that rolled us--by that time we were going into more like '76 [1976], I think.  And 'Dazz' really came out in '76 [1976].  But it took off like huge for them.  And then the management company bought a bigger truck, and said, "Oh, Michael do you want to drive the truck?"  So now, I'm driving a bigger truck, a big red and yellow truck.  And you know, I became, like I said, the stage manager extraordinaire.  We started putting crews together, and it just happened really fast.  The next thing I know, I'm flying all over the place.  So, I worked with them--to answer your question, I worked with them up consistently probably through 1978, in and out.  But in '77 [1977], I was able to start my own business [MTM Roadworks, Inc.], just from the idea of that.
Story_ID: 560165
Speaker 1: So you were their, their stage manager.  And through experience is how you learned how to put, you know, how to manage a group.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very much.  I mean because I ended up, you know, obviously working.  And little did I know, even when we had the band in North Carolina, I was always the guy that was talking to somebody about getting us a gig.  Or I was always that guy that was hustling around, "Oh, man, we can go play here," or putting the bands together, you know, and never knowing that that was kind of, probably just my natural instinct.  But I became, being their stage manager, and I then went on to be their production manager, which meant that I was advancing shows, and ordering equipment, and talking to the promoters, and dealing with the record reps to some degree.  And then, you know, and all along the way, my son [Jermaine Dupri] is growing up.  And he had such an inclination for music that, you know, I was buying him drum kits and stuff from the time he was two years old or whatever.  So, you know, I felt myself really being in the music business even though I was doing whatever I could do to make ends meet.  But I became, I became kind of an all-star roadie, if you may, because we got really, really good, and Brick became really a hit act.  And so in, as I said, in '77 [1977], through the suggestion of Mr. David Franklin who was a prominent attorney here in Atlanta [Georgia], he was at the time Brick's manager.  He was also the manager of Richard Pryor, Donny Hathaway, Roberta Flack.  He was that extraordinary manager type.  He saw what I was doing, and he made the suggestion--and I say '77 [1977], but I think it was more like '78 [1978].  And he was like, "Mike [HistoryMaker Michael Mauldin], man, you ought to start your own--you ought to--you could put a business together.  You could really--you know, you're good at doing this.  You should put crews together for different acts."  And so, that's what I did.  I created a company called MTM Roadworks [MTM Roadworks, Inc.].  And obviously, MTM is my initials, Michael Thomas Mauldin.  But MTM also, I came up with a way to make MTM mean something, and I said it was called making tours move, you know, on the road, roadwork.  So, I started putting crews and staff together for different acts at that point and time.  David Franklin had a group, and he managed Anita Baker--I mean not Anita Baker--I'm sorry, Anita Ward, a song called 'Ring My Bell.'  And that was in 1979 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a schoolteacher.  Anita and I was really close.  And so I--you know, he put me with her.  So I put her whole thing together, and The S.O.S. Band, and it just kind of took off from there.
Story_ID: 560166
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you.  Did you know [HistoryMaker] Bunnie Jackson-Ransom?
Speaker 2: Very well, very well.  And it's interesting, because Ransom--Bunnie married Ray [Ray Ransom], who was the bass player after her and Maynard [Maynard Jackson] divorced.  Ray was the bass player of Brick.  I actually knew Bunnie before that, because I would help her--you know, even with some of the things that were going on politically here in Atlanta [Georgia], I was the guy.  I was that guy that--and Bunnie was a public relations extraordinaire and her office was right up the street.  So, for a while, even in the '70s [1970s]--and that's kind of how she got to know me, through the relationship with Brick, really know me.  And then I helped her with The S.O.S. Band.  I put all their band equipment and all that stuff together and helped them with the group.  And eventually moved into her office here on--and as to kind of run my thing, but all the time helping her whatever her needs were from a production standpoint.  So, yes, Bunnie and I to this day I think are pretty close.
Story_ID: 560167
Speaker 1: Tell me some of the other groups that you worked with.  L.T.-, was L.T.D. one of the groups (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) L.T.D. was, we did shows, and part of them was the continuation of the Kool Jazz Festival.  And that really, I think was what also influenced me to do--that really influenced me to start my business [MTM Roadworks, Inc.] this way, and not just what David Franklin said.  But that's when I really saw the ability to do it.  It might have been after the conversation with him.  But in '77 [1977], Brick was big then.  And L.T.D. and The Bar-Kays and Cameo and, you know, a lot of those acts--Frankie Beverly, and Earth, Wind, and Fire--all these acts were performing, and I was just influenced by L.T.D.  I mean we did a lot of shows together.  I never really, I didn't really work hand in hand with them.  They knew me and I knew them, but there was always--because back then, whether you were the crew or the band, you were all big family, and you all traveled together on the same busses and stuff like that.  And I was just moved by how many people they had in their band.  And understanding how much money they were making as a band--because then, I was playing that kind of role with Brick, because I was their production manager/assistant road manager at times.  And I'm like, "Man, L.T.D. got a lot of guys, and they have to split that money up."  And then I met their crew.  And they were based in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], so they had two white kids that was phenomenal, I mean they were really good.  But they were sound--they called themselves sound engineers, and they had those professional names--lighting technicians.  And we were just the road crew, you know.  We did lights and we would do sounds, but we weren't sound engineers and we weren't lighting technicians.  And I'm looking at these guys and I said, "Oh, man, how much, what do you all earn?  What do y'all make?"  And this was 1976, '77 [1977].  They were talking about they were making a thousand to twelve hundred dollars a week.   And I'm getting paid like two hundred dollars.  I'm like, now you know what?  There's a big, something's going on here.  And, and, it can't be because they're white and I'm black.  It's got to be what they're doing.  And, and, I realized their role was a significant role.  And that, to me--I'm like, you know what?  I think I can make as much money, if not more money, than the bands.  Because all of these bands are on salaries to themselves.  They're working, but they're only making five or six hundred dollars a week.  And here their crew is making more money than them.  So that, in itself, kind of also motivated me to go on that side. Didn't really want to give up my dream of being a drummer and playing in the band myself one day.  But again, it just kind of took off from there.
Story_ID: 560168
Speaker 1: What happens in, I want to go to 1982.  And--
Speaker 2: Wow, that's a big jump (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, did we miss a lot (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, not much.  You didn't miss much at all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me--oh, well, from--well, tell me what happens after, you know, you're working with Brick.  And you worked with them you say until what year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked with Brick through '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: Prominently.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In '79 [1979] I started working for a lot of different other acts.  You know, I got calls from like Sister Sledge, different ones.  But what really kicked off in '79 [1979] was promoters, promoters that did shows, again, recognizing that old [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin can move and make things happen.  I became the production coordinator for various promoters--Taurus Productions, Empire [ph.], different promoters around the country that promoted, you know, black shows basically or R&B shows.  And from that, I became the one that put those shows together.  So, that gave me more familiarity with a lot of the major acts and prominent entertainment folks.  It also allowed me to start networking more with record companies and those kinds of things.  But the crazy part about it, in the early '80s [1980s], because the disco craze was starting to come in, the music business really slowed down.  So I was doing shows, not as much on the road.  I still had MTM Roadworks [MTM Roadworks, Inc.], and I would work with whatever bands I could.  But I was just kind of making ends meet and trying to start a business, which was rough, because you had to pay people.  So I'd make money, but I'm paying staff.  And I'm really starting to get the hang of that.  And lo and behold, I ended up--because you mentioned her name--Bunnie Ransom, or [HistoryMaker] Bunnie Jackson-Ransom--through her relationships, or her being the ex-first lady of Atlanta [Georgia], and she tied up with three ladies.  They were building a new Atlanta airport at that time, and they got the contract to do the arcades in Atlanta.  And her and I were real good friends and close, and she hired me to be kind of the general manager, or the manager, if you may, of the arcade in Atlanta.  Now at first I'm like, you know, I'm the arcade--whatever.  But it was a very busy--and I never realized until I took that job, how important it was to have quarters that constantly dropped in--I say important--but how significant it was to have quarters that constantly dropped in machines twenty-four hours a day--the kind of earnings and different things.  And that really started letting me learn even more about business.  So, I managed that for her.  Miss Hartsfield [Tollie Bedenbaugh Tolan Hartsfield] was her partner, and Miss Hartsfield was obviously--Atlanta Hartsfield Airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia].  She was also an ex-first lady of the mayor of Atlanta [Maynard Jackson].  And then a lady who I really respected, Janis Alexander, whose husband was an insurance, a major insurance influence here--the Alexanders.  And they were all friends, and they, that was like the power.  Now, you're talking about powerful women.  Those were the power movers and shakers.  And Bunnie, obviously, she had that influence.  So, I helped them do that.  And through the airport scenario, that kind of tided me over in the early '80s [1980s], by just having a job, because the music was very light at that point.
Story_ID: 560169
Speaker 1: Well, as you're learning and working with these different record companies and promoting these groups, what are you finding, what are you learning about record executives?  Do you know any of them?  Are there any people that you run into that you now say this might be something that I want to become, or do?
Speaker 2: Well, this may sound kind of crazy, but I did.  Along the way, I was able to really get my--you know, the music took back off.  And I always tell people all the time, I think Michael Jackson really changed--even during the hip hop--I mean during the disco era, I felt like Michael Jackson made the transition and brought music back with his first [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones recording.  And, and, it's so funny.  Because I remember them--talking about the arcade--I remember how Michael came through the airport one day, one morning like at six a.m. with his mom [Katherine Jackson].  And it was so early.  You know, and he was a little guy then, in the early '80s [1980s].  I said little guy--he was growing up.  But anyway, he came through the airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia], and I realized then that the music was still very much alive and how much things were going on.  And he was out touring, doing his thing.  But here's what's interesting.  Yes, I did meet a lot of people with record labels.  Most of them was promotional guys.  I never felt--because they promoted radio.  They promoted--that's what they did, they were in the business.  I never felt I wanted to do that.  I didn't feel that that was, I didn't really know a lot of A and R [artists and repertoire] guys, which the A and R guys was where the creativeness was.  They were the ones that was making the records.  But I knew the promotional guys, and what I found was that most blacks seemingly were promotional guys.  And I'm like, that ain't me.  That's not really me.  I'm more creative.  So, I never saw myself going down that route.  But as I started dealing with groups, one of those groups that I started co-managing was a group called The Reddings, which was the sons of Otis Redding, and that was in the early '80s [1980s].  So I ended up helping them and we went overseas.  And I was co-manager with their mother, Zelma Redding.  And so that really started carrying on.
Story_ID: 560170
Speaker 1: And so funny, because as I continued that--I keep bringing up my son [Jermaine Dupri], who's now about ten/eleven years old.  Well, through the influence of something that little people knew about, called hip hop, or rap at the time, I continued to build my relationships.  I ran into a gentleman here in Atlanta [Georgia] that was promoting shows called--his name was Ricky Walker, Cedric Walker.  And Ricky had this idea to come out and do something called the Fresh Festival.  Well, it wasn't so much about that, but it was about taking hip hop in 1984 and marrying that to the rest of the country, because they felt that it was mostly in New York [New York], and he was based here in Atlanta.  So he got with me, because production was my thing, and, "How do we put this show together?  And Mike [HistoryMaker Michael Mauldin], how can we stage this?"  And Ricky was involved with a lot of circus activities and working with the Ringling Brothers [Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey Circus] things, and doing that kind of thing.  So his idea was, it needs to have a circus environment.  So I got with him to build that.  And it was crazy, because through my relationships, again, working with promoters, which is how I was getting to know the record companies, I was working with Luther Vandross, being a promoter/rep for him.  Or, I was working with, you know, just a continuation--The Spinners, and all these different acts.  But here comes this hip hop thing.  Well, I'm also working with The Reddings.  So, now my relationships are really starting to grow and broaden.  And I introduce my son into the mix, because he's liking these groups called Whodini, who I didn't really know.  And he is young enough to start to vibe that, and he's, you know, dealing with turntables and records, which I'm, you know, I'm okay with.  But that wasn't--what I was about was real instruments.  And I think all of that influence allowed me to be, even today, to be where I'm at now.  Because one thing led to the next.  I went out and produced a show with Ricky Walker called the New York City Fresh Festival which became the only national touring hip hop tour ever.  I won't say ever, but at that time, it was the only hip hop rap tour.  And we staged it as the original New York City Fresh Festival.  We did that in '84 [1984], '85 [1985], and '86 [1986].  It was an annual event.
Speaker 2: Was it in New York?
Speaker 1: All around--everywhere (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or did you travel?
Speaker 1: It traveled, and so it really was a tour.   And actually it's kind of wild, because next year will make the twenty-fifth anniversary of the New York City Fresh Festival.  And we used my son, who was a dancer, also a break dancer, as--I call him kind of a mascot.  Because he would open up the tour and he would be the dancer.  And he'd be popping and breaking and spinning, and doing that kind of stuff.  And then that allowed him to also become acquainted with all those well known hip hop artists today--Run-DMC, Kurtis Blow--we all had those acts on that tour.  Well, the crazy part about it, the people that I was associated with, R&B and soul music, thought it was almost a waste of my time--that hip hop and rap was a fad.  "Michael, what are you doing?  Man, you got a career.  You know, all these groups like you.  Why you getting caught out there?  You know, you could be working with Luther, and you could be working with," you know--. And I was, I was able to continue working with Luther and I was able to work with Anita Baker--I mean, yes, Anita Baker.  And I was able to, you know, just kind of continue to broaden all sides of it.  And I started really becoming aware of the music industry and the recording industry.  And I met a gentleman in New York called [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons in '84 [1984], I guess.  And that really opened up my eyes, because Russell had his own record label [Def Jam Recordings], but it was a hip hop label.  And I'm watching how he was doing what he was doing.  And then I decided, "You know what?  Maybe I should start a record label."  And so that really started me heading down that path.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the, the first year of the Fresh Festival?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-four [1984].
Speaker 2: So it was '84 [1984]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 560171
Speaker 1: Take me back to '82 [1982].  Because you're working with Diana Ross as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't work as an employee of Miss Ross.  I worked for, again, going back to the promoters, I worked for Taurus Promotions [sic. Taurus Productions], which was Quentin Perry and Jim Veal [James Veal].  And I did shows all around, and pretty much they did--even though they were national promoters, they were really more regional, more South, Southeast.  And back then, you had so many secondary markets, like Birmingham [Alabama], Montgomery [Alabama], Tuscaloosa [Alabama], I mean all those little towns--Raleigh [North Carolina]--those towns really existed as prominent places.  So, most of the shows that I did with these acts was regional.  And with--then they got the Diana Ross southern part of her tour.  And so, I was their production coordinator with that tour.  And we ended up doing Atlanta [Georgia], and I was, you know, she had, she was one of the first artists to do in the round that I'm aware of--in the round, meaning she's in the middle of the arena and everybody else is there.  So, I remember she had a section in her show where she invited people to come out on the stage.  And I had had my wife at the time, Cecilia [Cecilia Mosley], Tina, bring Jermaine [Jermaine Dupri] because he was a big music--but he was--this was '82 [1982].  So Jermaine was ten years old.  And I had her--her and Jermaine came to the show.  And in the middle of Diana's show, she says--well, you know, she brings kids up on stage to dance for her.  And me being there, I was working, though.  And when she did it, I didn't know she was going to do it.  This is the first time I'd worked with her, and I didn't know she had this segment of her show.  And when it got there, she said, "If any kids out here that are down on the main floor that want to come up on stage and dance, come on up.  Now, I don't want you mothers and fathers--don't do it.  But I want you kids."  So then kids started coming up.  And I'm standing in the back, I could not get to Jermaine or his mom.  But I'm saying--because I'm working, and I'm like, "Now I know Tina's going to put Jermaine on the stage."  And all of a sudden, he never showed up.  And I'm dumbfounded, because that's all this kid does is dance.  I'm like, "What is Tina doing?"  You know, that's what I'm saying to myself.  This is his chance, you know, because, you know, he can dance with Diana Ross.  And I'm thinking about Michael Jackson and Diana Ross discovering Michael and the Jacksons [The Jackson Five].  And I'm like, oh, this is his chance, right.  So, he never goes up.  So she starts her song, and I'm--so then I'm starting to run around to see where he's at.  Well, when she gets to the end of the song, the kids have danced.  All of a sudden, here comes Jermaine.  And she says, "Oh, look at this--."  So, it put him totally in the spotlight.  She says, "Oh, who's this little guy coming up here on the end of my song?"  And she asked his name, and he says, "Jermaine."  And she says, "Oh, Jermaine."  She says, "I know somebody else named Jermaine."  Now, he knew the whole story, right.  He knew all about The Jackson Five.  She said, "I know another guy named Jermaine.  Do you know who I'm talking about?"  And he said, "Yeah."  And she said, "Well, Jermaine, tell me this.  What do you do?"  He says, "I dance."  She said, "So you want to dance?"  He said, "Yes."  She said, "Okay, band, let's see what Jermaine can do."  Jermaine turned the Omni [Omni Coliseum, Atlanta, Georgia] out, to the point that it was talked about it.  It was in the papers, newspapers the next day, "Kid upstages Miss Ross," whatever.  But he really did, because he could really, really dance.  And she was saying, "Whoa, wait, stop it, stop it, stop it.  Cut the music down.  You going to come up here and take my show from me."  So she said, "Well, Jermaine, you're such a dancer, what else do you do?"  "Oh, I don't do nothing but dance."  I like to have died, because I'm like, oh, that was his shot.  But that was so interesting, because that--I think that also kicked off his career and, to the point that that becoming public knowledge, I realized, oh my god, I got a son that can truly kind of follow in this.  And even though I'm making my career happen, maybe I should start working with him.
Story_ID: 560172
Speaker 1: I think that, coming back to where we're at with the hip hop thing, kind of just started, just tying it all together.  And then I started working on trying to make a record on him back in that era.  And there wasn't a lot of kids into hip hop and into rap here in Atlanta [Georgia].  There was a young man named MC Shy D, who was based, who was from New York [New York] but lived in Decatur [Georgia].  And I got him involved with us to help write a song for Jermaine [Jermaine Dupri].  So that kind of got me--Jermaine probably--even though I mentioned The Reddings, who I was co-managing--Jermaine probably was the first artist that I really managed.  But he was my son, so I didn't really look at myself as his manager.  I just looked it as something I was doing, you know.
Speaker 2: Was there something else that--well, I think your son coming up in that era of hip hop, and you--and that was the music that he would be more involved in, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You talked about, you know, the records and the scratching that would lead you to want to work with rap groups.  Because, tell me, in the South, was there an audience for hip hop?  I know in New York it was very prevalent and that's where it began.  But in the South, was there an audience growing at that time?  We're talking about in the '80s [1980s]--for hip hop?
Speaker 1: Yes, there was an audience growing.  There weren't any acts.  And I shouldn't say any.  There were two or three that was starting out in their own way, but everybody was trying to follow in the footsteps of New York.  And most of those acts that were coming here was either influenced by New York City or was from New York City.  But as far as record companies coming here and looking for talent, that didn't exist.  I think rap in itself was just kind of like rock and roll was for us growing up.  It was a rebellion of sorts against what the parents were into for kids.  That's how I always looked at it, particularly down south.  Because so many of us, you know, I remember when Kurtis Blow, during this same time, was starting.  And speaking of Mrs. Reddings and The Reddings who I managed, Zelma Redding had a club in Macon [Georgia].  And I never will forget Kurtis Blow came in there and had a turntable which, coincidentally, I think his deejay was Run [Joseph Simmons; Reverend Run] from Run-DMC.  And people almost wanted to--like, "What are you doing, bringing turntables?  We're used to bands.  You can't--."  Because when you hear Kurtis Blow's music, you know, it was musical.  So, for people to see him with a turntable and hear him--and getting paid--they felt like it was a rip off.  And that was down south.  But that was already a culture though, that was happening in New York City, and the kids were carrying that culture.  And again, you know, it was my son.  It was the influence of me just saying that, that this was a new movement.  And then along the way, as I mentioned, Cedric Walker, who was also my age, was young enough and recognized that this movement was going on.  And I think there was a couple of documentaries and other things that was being done about this whole rap movement in New York City, and again, just recognizing that there was an audience for that all around the country.  And whether you would go--and radio wasn't even really playing rap then.  But whether you would go to North Carolina, or be in Alabama, or be in Mississippi, you're like, "Man, you know, hip hop is working."  So that's really, I think the trigger.  And I got to tell you.  I don't get--you know, people a lot of times reference me as a hip hop pioneer or whatever.  I never really looked at myself that way.  I looked at myself more as an entertainment executive.  I was around--I identified, I recognized that that wasn't all I did.  I took it as an entertainment piece, and I just recognized it as another art form of music.  But I definitely realized also that I was one of the leaders as far as spreading that message around the country--not that I was a promoter or not that I was agent, but because I was the one that could actually stage it in a way to let kids experience and enjoy it.  I've always felt like I had that connection there.
Speaker 2: Well, promoting it through having the Fresh Festival, the tours--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so that it could be exposed.  Hip hop music then was exposed to a lot of different areas.
Speaker 1: Broader areas.
Story_ID: 560173
Speaker 1: You mentioned two things.  You know, first you said movement, and then you said culture.  But do you look at hip hop as a culture?  Because it embraces a lot of different things.
Speaker 2: One hundred percent, 100 percent.  The influence of hip hop when--it's so funny because if you look around now, kids are wearing baggy clothes.  Well, obviously that's a, that's a spinoff in a hip hop culture.  But in the mid-'80s [1980s], kids were, most of them were wearing tight clothes--Lee jeans, the brand Lee; that was Lee.  And then Run-DMC started the whole Adidas thing, without any strings in their shoes.  So they were wearing really tight, colorful, bold colors, bright colors.  Then you had a clothing company coming out called Cross Colours, and it was all a part of that culture.  And when you say--that's why I do refer to it as a culture and refer to it as a movement, because I think that the youth tied in--particularly the urban youth, felt like this was for them.  So no matter whether you lived in New York [New York] or not, you wanted to, if you were going to be hip, you had to take on that element.  A few of us that was older, recognized that movement, and not to know where it was going, but definitely believing there was something there.  And I think what really, what really made me realize that--when we got to 1985--'84 [1984] was the kickoff.  And believe it or not, the first Fresh Festival was in Greensboro, North Carolina.  And we used it as a test date, because it was such a secondary market to us.  If it worked in Greensboro, we felt it was going to work everywhere.  And it worked, but we were shooting from the hip, and we were doing things that were just different.  And I'm like, "Oh, my god, this is going to work."  In 1985, we were selling out arenas around the country with these acts.  And it gave a pride to the art form, to the point that these acts were rehearsing.  And they had real stage shows, and they were trying to follow up with like, the funk bands were doing.  And you know some of them, groups like Newcleus, it was a band.  But they still had a hip hop element, and rapping and so forth.  And, and, I think that that truly carried the message around the country.  And then you--at the same craze, you had a situation called break dancing, which was all about the beats, the music.
Speaker 1: That's all a part of the culture?
Speaker 2: That's all a part of the culture.  And then they started making movies.  All those movies started in 1984, '85 [1985]--'Breakin',' you know, the breakbeats.
Speaker 1: Beats.
Speaker 2: They were kids that we--and then we incorporated that on the tour, which made it a circus type of environment.  And we had groups like Shaba Doo [Adolfo "Shabba Doo" Quinones] and Boogaloo Shrimp [Michael "Boogaloo Shrimp" Chambers], who were dancers and pop lockers that were--that these kids knew from the movies.  So now, we had movie stars that were performing on these tours with acts like Run-DMC.  And LL Cool J was just trying to get in at that time, but this is '84 [1984], '85 [1985].  Grandmaster Flash--and you know, it was kind of wild, because we realized as we were traveling around the country, here is something fresh and new and different.  And I think a lot of the promoters, a lot of the record companies that didn't believe-- all those acts back then was on independent labels.  They didn't have major label support.  They were Profile Records and companies like that.  So you didn't have a Columbia [Columbia Records] or a Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Records, Inc.] or--.  They had nothing, they weren't into rap.  That was a new culture for them (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 560174
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you pick up artists from other places besides New York [New York]?  Were there any L.A. [Los Angeles, California] hip hop artists that became a part of the group?  Even if--you know, because you said this was the twenty-fifth year.  During the years were they added?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were added.  Not initially, but they definitely were added.  You had a lot of groups that came in '85 [1985].  You know, because even if you look--although they were never part of the Fresh Festival--but even if you look at the whole West Coast movement--you know, the group [N.W.A.] that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube them was in with Eazy-E.  And that, they started their own movement, but all started probably, you know, the latter part of the '80s [1980s], in '87 [1987]--'86 [1986] or '87 [1987].  But that definitely started carrying over from what the Fresh Festival was, the influence.  Because we took the Fresh Festival to L.A., and there was a huge turnout for that.  And then the next thing you know, Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Simmons] decided to do a movie called 'Krush Groove,' which I think was '86 [1986]--'85 [1985], '86 [1986]--no, '85 [1985], and it had The Fat Boys.  So it had, all of our artists that was on the Fresh Festival was in there.  And that really made--because now you got movie stars, artists, and then there's a kid named LL Cool J who became known from the 'Krush Groove.'  So as we roll into '86 [1986], Russell Simmons, being the businessman that he is, decided, "Well, shoot, I'm going to do my own tour, because all these acts are basically mine."  So we continued with the Fresh Festival in '86 [1986], but then it became, you know, it came in fractions, because Russell took Run and he took Whodini and he took Kurtis Blow.  And those being his acts, and those being the biggest acts, he's like, "Well, I'm going to start, I want to do the Krush Groove festival and I want to do 'Raising Hell,' you know, which was Run-DMC's album.  And so '86 [1986] ended up being the last year of the Fresh Festival.  But it really, '86 [1986] I think was the determining year to say, okay, hip hop has really arrived.  Because now you had two different tours.  You had more acts coming onboard.  You then had the major labels starting to be involved.  You know, Jermaine [Mauldin's son, Jermaine Dupri], even at twelve years old got a record deal offer from Jive Records, which was Whodini's record company.  So it started, that started really getting me more involved now with the A and R [artists and repertoire] guys.  So when I think about the record business, the hip hop side of the record business is what starting making people pay attention to [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin or who--what I'm doing.  And that, you know, just kind of kicked it all off.
Story_ID: 560175
Speaker 1: So, now what happens after '86 [1986], after Jermaine [Mauldin's son, Jermaine Dupri] gets in, gets his record deal [with Jive Records]?  What do you do now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Jermaine didn't get the record deal.
Speaker 1: Oh, he didn't?
Speaker 2: He didn't get the deal.  I never felt that it was a great deal.  I had my attorney, we looked at it, and it just felt like there could be more.  I felt like they were trying to take advantage of him.  He was a cute kid and all at the time, and it just wasn't a great deal.  I felt I was being taken advantage of, to be quite honest with you.  And so it wasn't that we didn't--we didn't do the deal because I didn't do the deal.  Now I know that Jermaine, as a kid, was a little sour at me at that point.  Because he thought, oh, my god, I'm getting ready to be a recording artist.  But we elected not to do that.  But Jermaine went on, and we started doing stuff with Sprite back then, because Sprite was the sponsor in '86 [1986] of the Fresh Festival.  One thing led to the next, and Jermaine started making beats and doing his own thing.  So in 1988, through certain influences, I decided I was going to start a record label.  And it was called the Rock Label, because I had to keep my music side in there.
Speaker 1: The Rock Label?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And in the process of doing that, we had a group which ended up not being on the Rock Label, but a group that Jermaine was working with, and ultimately they were called Silk Tymes Leather.  That was one of the first major signings for a hip hop act in the Atlanta [Georgia] area, and I'm proud to say that.  Someone may question that, but in 1988, we signed--me as a manager, and Jermaine as a producer, with him at the time only being sixteen years old--signed Silk Tymes Leather, two girls, Jocelyn [Jocelyn Rabon] and Vicki [Vicki Jordan], to Geffen Records, and they came out with a record.  And you know, it was interesting, because it was a movement.  Jermaine was the youngest producer that anybody could really identify with, you know.  And it was, it was, it was a crazy time.  Because again, through hip hop, through whatever, now I become a full fledged manager.  Because now I'm managing Silk Tymes Leather, I got Jermaine, I'm doing some other things, still handling certain shows for promoters, and still working with The Reddings.  But you know, I'm not making a lot of money, but I was in the business.  Now, I'm in the music business for real.  And, and, people knew me.  So, in '87 [1987], '88 [1988], we just worked on developing that act.
Speaker 1: So now you, you are a management company as well?  You have a label?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a management company?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I understand what a manager does.
Story_ID: 560176
Speaker 1: But a producer, what does a producer, what actually is the job of a producer?
Speaker 2: Producer basically takes an art form like music or, you know, and take rap or whatever, and take the artist and match it.  A producer delivers it to the public.  A producer makes it possible to be published, and makes it so it's supposedly--I want to say commercially viable.  But some producers don't produce commercially, so whatever, whatever direction you try to take it to make it successful, the producers are actually the ones who deliver.  He produces it, he puts it all together.  So you take the song, you take the artist, you take the material, you take it to the A and R [artists and repertoire] executive who says, "Well I want this kind of record," or whatever, and you mesh it all together to ultimately give people what it is they want.  And that's kind of--or what it is that you want.  And that's kind of the direction.  And in most of those cases I think I played the title, the role of executive producer, because I was helping to facilitate.  I wouldn't be in the studio, but really I was facilitating the opportunities and the relationships to deliver it.
Story_ID: 560177
Speaker 1: And who were some of the groups that you spearheaded at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow.
Speaker 1: Arrested Development, was--?
Speaker 2: Well, that came on, but that wasn't really until the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Oh, it was in the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After Silk Tymes Leather, or during the Silk Tymes Leather piece, the interesting thing--there was another young girl--and here it goes back to relationships.  Going back to the Brick days which was in the '70s [1970s], obviously Eddie Irons was the drummer.  He now was producing music, but his music was R&B.  It wasn't hip hop, but he had the influence of it because he was a drummer, and back then you were doing drum machines more so.  And Eddie was helping Jermaine [Mauldin's son, Jermaine Dupri] develop Silk--I went to Eddie to let him work with Jermaine because Jermaine was creating beats.  And this was like in the '80s [1980s], '87 [1987], '88 [1988].  But Eddie was working with a young lady by the name of Angie.  I don't remember Angie's maiden name.  But ultimately, Angie ended up being an artist.  Lo and behold, I'd brought--I moved to Macon, Georgia in '88 [1988] to better--to be closer to The Reddings, but I was back and forth between Atlanta [Georgia].  I was managing Silk Tymes Leather.  I had a major record label called Atlantic [Atlantic Records] come to Macon, Georgia for a showcase to see Silk Tymes Leather, but I was also working with Angie.  And I had her come down, her and Eddie come down also.  Because I was bringing this label down, and I'm like, "Y'all should just be here."  Well, in the process of that they came in to see, Atlantic came in to see--this was before we signed Silk Tymes Leather to Geffen [Geffen Records].  But Atlantic came in to see the group, and Angie was there.  That next morning I introduced Angie to the A and R [artists and repertoire] executive, which was Marion Bobb [ph.].  I gave him Angie's CD.  He went back to New York [New York], and instead of signing Silk Tymes Leather, he says, "Man, the girls, I thought they were cool.  I'm not sure, you know, from the South how it's going to work with hip hop. But I really like that girl."  So, I ended up signing Angie to Atlantic Records.  So, Angie actually got signed in '88 [1988] before we did Silk Tymes Leather.  So now I'm managing Anne G.  And I say Anne G. because to make it--because of the hip hop thing--her name was Angie, and I actually changed it to Anne G., like the letter G.  It was A-N-N-E G., Anne G.  But she did R&B.  And so now I've got--you know, and then we get Silk Tymes Leather signed.  So now I'm managing two acts, one signed to Geffen Records and the other signed to Atlantic Records.  This was in '88 [1988], and I'm still dealing with The Reddings.  But it was a struggle.
Story_ID: 560178
Speaker 1: Let's take a minute to talk about The Reddings.  How did you come to be involved with, this is Otis Redding's family.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you became involved with them.
Speaker 2: All relationships, unbelievable. And, you know, you're really making me remember all this.  And I have to really take my hat off and tip everybody that in some way said, "Oh, [HistoryMaker] Michael Mauldin, come over here and let's talk."  The road manager for Brick, who was actually the road manager for Brick, his name was Earl "Speedo" Sims [Earl Sims].  We all called him Speedo.  Speedo was actually the road manager for Otis Redding.  Speedo also worked with the Allman Brothers.  He was from Macon, Georgia.  So, while we're out with Brick and doing different things in 1978, obviously, I was, again, this extraordinary young road manag- roadie, stage manager, production manager kind of guy.  Speedo got a call from Zelma [Zelma Redding] about helping--because she was getting ready to put her kids out on the road, and they were going to get a deal with a company called Believe in a Dream [Believe In A Dream Records], which had a, was tied to CBS [CBS Records] out of Washington, D.C.  So, Speedo suggested that he introduce her to me, and I could help put the band together, because I did this and that.  I went to see the group in Washington, D.C. with Speedo.  They were performing a show, and that's where I met them.  And then I started, you know, from that we just kind of kicked it off.  And I started helping them, the same way, more in a production minded kind of way.  And you know, I could really relate to them, they were young.  And I became their road manager.  And that's kind of what started the relationship.  So that obviously was in the '80s [1980s].  And the thing that was so great about them--because of the legacy of their father--something that I hadn't really done--they had a lot of demand to go overseas.  So, again, going back to one relationship, this just kind of reminded me--and I'm kind of going backwards.  You have to excuse me for this.  But in '82, [1982], '83 [1983] with The Reddings, I was able to be their road manager.  And we were going to, I mean we were throughout Germany, and I mean just places that you just normally wouldn't--young black acts wouldn't be.  But we also played a lot of military bases, and it was really only because people--they were The Reddings, they were the offspring of Otis Redding.  So even though we did Redding songs--and they had songs--we would have to do a lot of Otis Redding tunes, which was great.  So that kind of, you know, spurred it and kicked it all off.
Story_ID: 560179
Speaker 1: During that period, the guy that promoted those shows was a gentleman named John Abbey, a white gentleman that had a record label called Ichiban Records.  And Ichiban happened to be based here in Atlanta [Georgia].  So through John Abbey, a very independent guy, when I started my record label [Rock Label], in order to get distribution and all to do it, I went to John Abbey, which was just a few years later, to help me distribute my product.  So that's--I'm kind of connecting.  I know I'm kind of jumping, and I apologize.  But--
Speaker 2: No, I mean, that's fine.  As far as distribution, that's the hardest part of--well, I want to ask the, I should ask the question.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Is that one of the hardest parts of having your record label, is actually getting the records distributed?
Speaker 1: That is one of the hardest parts.  But here's what's so unique.  And here's, again, how hip hop I think became so prominent, and even how Jermaine Dupri, my son, and myself became more in the mix.  Because there wasn't record companies that were really, particularly down south here, interested in this talent, you couldn't get records out.  You could record them, but you know, it wasn't getting picked up.  "Oh, that's southern, oh, it doesn't sound like New York [New York]."  Everybody had a reason or an excuse not to sign an act.  Most kids started doing their own mixtapes, which was already going on, and that's what we--you know.  So then, it was cassettes.  And even in the--Jermaine, by performing, he had a--believe it or not, he had a tutor.  And this was in the '80s [1980s].  And he had, you know, he didn't go to school as normal kids did, in high school and stuff.  So, Jermaine was making mixtapes, and started writing So So Def [So So Def Recordings] on those mixtapes.  And his friend, Eddie Weathers, who's still his best friend and his A and R [artists and repertoire] guy to this day, would take those mixtapes to high school and they were selling them for five or ten dollars apiece.  So, it became their own little distribution.  And I say all that to say a lot of people--the hip hop movement--people started selling music out of the trunks of their cars and from the streets, and they created their own little distribution.  Again, not big enough to be known nationwide, but a lot of times large enough to sell ten thousand, twenty thousand, or whatever, through a lot of work over a year's time.  And as crazy as that sounds, you know, you sell ten thousand mixtapes at five dollars apiece, all of a sudden you got a business.  So it became a real hustle, but it wasn't any different than the independent record people or anything else.  And I think that also is what paid a lot of respect to hip hop.  But to answer your question, yes, distribution is one of the hardest things.  It's good to make the right record, and it's good to get--and then you got to try to--and then promotion is hard, because ultimately when you promote something, you're trying to get it to an outlet, meaning radio retail.  And you've got to have someone that knows how to get it to radio and convince those radio programmers or music guys to play your record.  So, yeah, it's all--the business--the crazy part about it for kids that always wanted to be in the music business and be in the game--and even me growing up and thinking I wanted to be in the game--it's about the fact that it is business.  It's called the music business.  It's called the entertainment business.  And you've got to have a business connection nine times out of ten to make it work.  And a lot of these kids adapted--because they didn't have the business connection, they found a way to hustle and create the business on their own, which became the birthplace of a lot of hip hop, and particularly the hip hop down south that you're now hearing, or that has kind of taken over.  And it took those mixtapes and those things to be, you know, for people to really take notice too.
