Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Porter Versfelt (ph.), observing is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Joseph, J-O-S-E-H-H, E. Lowery, L-O-W-E-R-Y.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 6, 1921, and I'm a Northerner, Huntsville, Alabama, North Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation, sir?
Speaker 2: I'm retired.  I'm supposed to be retired.  I don't get no respect, but I'm supposed to be retired.  I've been a pastor of churches for almost a half century.  And I guess you might call me a professional agitator.  I headed a civil rights organization for twenty-one years.  And, even now, I chair a coalition of, of advocates in, in the state and across the region.  So I guess my occupation is preacher, advocate, agitator.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Is that all right?
Speaker 1: That's fine.  Sir, now, what is today's date.
Speaker 2: Today is August--according to this watch, August the 13th in the year of our Lord 2003.
Speaker 1: And, sir, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Atlanta, Georgia in my office building which is the home office of Atlanta Life Insurance Company, one of the great insurance companies in our community.

Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I don't know how you ask a complex question like that and expect a short answer.  I guess as a preacher, I'm supposed to say chicken.  And chicken is one of my favorite foods, but I also like rice and gravy, collard greens, things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.  And that's a safe answer.  I also like read (laughter).
Speaker 1: And green (laughter).
Speaker 2: And green and gold.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, any time.  At my age, any time of the year is welcomed, and, and receives great favor from me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.  My wife [evelyn Gibson Lowery] and I--this is a perennial discussion and debate in my house about vacations.  We manage, we, we, we manage to go somewhere, but where, nobody knows.  We're leaving Friday, but we just decided last night where we were going.  My wife's favorite vacation place is a beach.  Mine is any place with a comfortable climate and a good comfortable chair and a book.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I guess if I were to be honest, I'd say--go to say that in speeches and lectures around, I like to close 'em out with "Let's turn to each other and not on each other".  It's something I devised during the children's murder, missing and murdered children's crisis in Atlanta when the community was, was very vulnerable to, to chaos and turmoil.  And I used that to help the community coagulate around a common goal of ending those murders.  But other than that, I guess it would be "Thank you, Lord".

Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you about your family history, as much as you can--information as you can give us.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but I'll start with your mother's side.  What do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I, I know my mother's mother was Sally Fackler, who lived out on Pulaski Pike in Huntsville, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Fackler for us?
Speaker 2: F-A-C-K-L-E-R.  About two and a half miles from where the University of Alabama is located now.  And I was born in her house.  She had eleven children, eleven or twelve.  One or two of them died very early.  I never knew them, but I did know Uncle Peck and Uncle John and Aunt Daisy and Mixes (ph.) and Big Annie.  I knew those five very well, along with my mother, the children of, of Grandma Sally.  I did not know her husband.  He died, Henry Fackler, before I have any recollection of his.  But that's about all I know.  Very--they were relatively fair skinned people, all of them.  And we all suspected that there was some heterogeneous, multi-ethnic, multi-racial composition going on in that, in that family tree.  But we never got to really examine it or, or pursue it.  My father had some interests in it, but if he pursued it, I, I'm aware of any documentation.  But that was my mother's family.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories that your grandmother passed down about what the family was doing back in--during slavery or during the Civil War or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, she died in the '30's [1930s] I believe at the age of, and, and we're not sure of her age.  The bible which posted such things listed her at a couple of dates, born in the 1800s.  And at one point, it was in the 1860s.  At another point, the 1850s.  So we're not sure how old she was.  But, no, I don't recall any stories about slavery.  I recall stories about the early days of, of--her early days when she was a small child and was relegated to the corner of the room when adults were in conversation.  She had stories about the meanness of white people and their attitudes toward colored people in those days.  But nothing that would be of historical significance.  She never shared those with us that I recall.
Speaker 1: Well, some of those stories are of historical significance when you look at the past, and, you know, what people, I mean--do you remember any of the kinds of stories and any one story?
Speaker 2: No, I, I only remember that she emphasized the fact that there was a place for colored people, and that whenever they roamed, voluntarily or involuntarily, out of that place, that there were varied mean and methodologies of putting them back in that place.  But the specifics I do not recall.  It was, it was nothing beyond the ordinary saga of race in, in the early 1900s and the late 1800s.  Of course, they have historical significance, but nothing unique or peculiar to her family that I recall that wouldn't be commonplace among any colored family of that day and of that generation.
Story_ID: 18515
Speaker 1: On my father's side, who we called Ma Polly, she was the, a Lowery.  And before that she was an Echolls, which is where I get my middle name.  And her father was a preacher.  And he was the first black preacher of my home church, Lakeside Methodist in Huntsville, Alabama.  And she had many stories.  Her husband was part Cherokee, whom she recalled having been brought down from the Northeast, probably North Carolina and stopped in Huntsville, and they developed a relationship and they married and they had two sons.  She had many stories of how she worked as domestic, and she used to tell us about how, a place, a house she worked with was not too far from where she lived.  She lived right at a railroad.  And we lived two blocks North of her, away from the railroad.  But her house where we stayed many times was very near the railroad.  And, and she worked about maybe three or four blocks in a big, two-story house, near where she lived.  And she had told us that they used to make her come in the back door.  And she told me one day that she resent--resented it, but she had to work because she had these two boys.  And I don't know what had happened to my grandfather by that time.  He had sort of disappeared from the scene.  But she would go in the back door, and she said, but she wouldn't speak to the family.  They would say, "Good morning, Polly."  And she wouldn't say anything.  She would go straight to the closet and hang up her garment, whatever she wore, and put on her apron or smock or whatever she worked in.  And she'd take the broom and go through the front of the house and out the front door onto the front porch.  And she'd sweep off the front porch.  And then when she finished sweeping off the front porch, she'd open the front door and throw her shoulders back and as far as she was concerned, that was her first time going in the house that morning.  Then she'd speak to them, but not before she had gone through regular routine.  And that was her way of coping with the humiliation and the dehumanizing effect of, of, of racist oppression that she experienced as a--it's very interesting that, and she used to talk about the fact that she and other black domestics that she knew used to make dough, make bread with their fingers, but they couldn't--that, that the white folks would eat, but they couldn't come in the front door.  And she used to talk about--and I don't remember whether she did it, but she had friends who, who fed little, hungry white babies from their black breast.  But they had to come in the back door, which was a good picture of the ridiculous nature of racial segregation and oppression.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  Okay, so any other stories from your grandmother's time that you--?
Speaker 1: Well, she used to talk about how her work in the big house made her privileged to, to many conversations that went on in the house.  And I wish I could remember the names of the people, but she died too when I was very, very young.  And I don't remember the names of the people where she worked.  I just remember the place, which no longer exists.  The urban renewal and other kind of, of progress, quote, unquote, and displaced those places.  But her stories were always interesting.  She had a, a great memory.  And I wish I, my memory matched hers.  So I wish I had been old enough to write down some of the things she said, but she had a recollection of conversations that her employers had, which oft times included black people.  But they always, and it was interesting, she said, how they ignored her and were aware of her at the same time because they would try to codify some of the stories and conversations they had, and the instances of amusement and despair and ridicule for her benefit.  But she always ready to, to break through the code.  She could break through the code and tell when they were speaking in a derogatory manner about black people.  And that she kept her cool because she had to keep her job.  But she always resented the conversations, and she always said that she would drill into the children sometimes, another version of race and race relations that was not, that did not conform to the, the positions of the family and their stories, but always when she was alone with the children, she would try to drill into them some respect for her and for people of color.  She was quite a woman because she had a very limited academic--her educational experience was very limited, but she was a very strong woman who raised those two boys almost by herself, but she was a strong and beautiful black woman whom we called Ma Polly.  And we had a great deal of respect for her, and my family, my, my knowledge and my pride in my family history rests, a, a great deal of it rests in her dignity, her sense of who she was and her pride and her, her, her self esteem, in spite of all the oppressive things that she had to experience.

Speaker 1: Can you tell us then now about your mother and her life?  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name was Dora Marie Fackler.  And, of course, later, Lowery.  She grew up in this large family out in the Western part of, of Huntsville.
Speaker 1: Can you give us her birth date?
Speaker 2: No.  That, that again, had more than one number in the bible.  I'm trying to--I think that my mother was born in the 1880s.  And she died in 1966, and we estimated her age to be in her eighties, but that was not documented.  And it was more of a guesstimate than anything else.  But she grew up in this family, attended what they called Normal School, which I think was perhaps a little better than high school, but not much.  I remember--and she played the piano just a little bit, and she used to recall with great joy that she met W. C. Handy, who composed the "St. Louis Blues", who was born in, in Florence, Alabama, about forty or fifty, sixty miles Northwest of Huntsville, and mostly West Huntsville, and a little North too.  But she remembered that.  And she attended Normal School, which grew into Alabama A& M University that it is now.  And she sang in the choir in my church, and I went to church at least twice every week; once for choir rehearsal, I had to sit while the rehearsed and wait on her, and the other was the Sunday, when I went to Sunday School and through 11:00 o'clock [a.m.] service, which, which is--I always say it's a wonder I didn't become a great sinner because I resented going to church so much when I was a boy till I vowed that once I became my own man, I would never set foot in a church (laughter).  But obviously, that didn't, it didn't work out that way because God had other plans for me.  But she planted the, those seeds in me as a boy.  And we lived--the back of my house, you go out across a field where we used to play.  And the back of the church was on the, the next street.  And so we walked, we made a path through the field to the back of the church from the back of my house.  And I could walk it blindfolded because I walked it so much.  And my father did not attend as much as my mother, but eventually he did.  She, I guess she kept working on him until finally he came and became treasurer of, of the local church, although he vowed he would never be an officer in the church.  But he was, he was more bark than bite.  And he became a stalwart in the church as well and wanted me to go to law school, and, and succeed him as a businessman.  He was a small businessman.
Speaker 1: Now, I wanted to ask you how your parents met.  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: No.  If there's a story behind it, I, I'm not aware of it.  My daddy, he used to tease her by saying that her mother encouraged him to court her, date her, and that, that her mother sort of managed the relationship and talked him into marrying her.  But that never met with a great deal of affirmation from my mother.  She had a different side, but I'm not sure that any of that is, is documented.  And I think they just met as young people in the community.  I don't recall how because--except to know that he knew, he knew her family.  And he met her, and, and really I think dated her and one of her friends, and finally made his choice of my mother.  But I don't know too many of the details.
Story_ID: 18517
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His full name was Leroy Lowery.  And we don't, we're not sure about the date of his birth.  We think he was born in the 1880s as well, but we're not certain of that.  He, he dropped out of school before he finished high school and worked for a physician in the community and wanted to be a doctor, a pharmacist, doctor of pharmacy so that he could fill prescriptions when he grew up that the doctor would write.  And he opened a little ice cream parlor with a, one little billiard table in it and intended to work there for a year or two--run it for a year or two and save money to go to Nashville to pharmacy school, and ended up running the business for over a half century and never went to pharmacy school, but always talked about that was his plan.  But he, instead got married, and then he had two children prior to my birth who passed, did not survive.  And then they had me, and then a, a younger sister three years later, and first saved enough money to go to school.  Then he used it to buy more equipment and expand, rent a bigger place for the ice cream parlor and the billiard table.  Then he put another billiard table.  Then he finally rented another store for two or three billiard tables and the ice cream parlor separate.  And he just stayed that way for, for more than a half century.  Oh, I guess maybe sixty years or more as a businessman in Huntsville and never got to go to pharmacy school, but developed a good business and invested in, in a Supreme, Supreme Liberty Life Insurance Company which was based in Chicago.  And I remember on occasion making a trip to Chicago with him once or twice a year to attend the stockholders and, and board of directors meeting.  And he was very proud of that as a, sort of a self-made businessman in a small, textile town in Alabama, who invested in an insurance company in Chicago and became a member of that board of directors.  And he was very proud of that, and I was very proud of it, and, and have some pictures somewhere of him with Truman Gibson and people like that who, who were fathers of that insurance company, which I think now has, has merged with other companies and no longer exists.  But he was very proud of that.  But he was a, he was an interesting man who had heavy influence on, on my life.  I remember he bought a new once, and I was sitting up front by him, and he went through town, and the police stopped him.  And they said, "Whose car is this, boy?"  And my dad said, "Oh, this belong to Mr. Lee Lowery, it's Mr. Lee Lowery's car."  And the officer said, "Oh, okay, well go on and drive careful, boy."  And so he drove on.  Of course, we got a big kick cause he was Mr. Lee Lowery (laughs), you know.  And, but he was, he was a dark brown skin, handsome man, short.  My mother was very fair skinned, and I remember once riding out in the countryside with my--with him and my mother.  And his right rear tire blew out and became flat, and I was very young, and just barely remember it, and probably that memory was helped by repeating it over and over as the years went by.  But he was changing the tire, and he said he saw some hobnail boots right beside him.  He looked and there were two or three big white fellows, with boots and hats on and chewing tobacco, spitting on the ground, part of it getting on his head, and asked him, "what are you doing out here, boy?"  And used curse word.  And my daddy said, "Shhh said, ol' Miss in the car; said, ol' Miss don't like no, no curse words." And so they looked and saw my mother, and I guess they, (unclear) took their hat off, said, "get out of the way, boy."  And they helped him change the tire.  And, and we got back in the car, and my daddy drove on, and I remember he looked back and thumbed his nose at those fellows.  And then my mother said, "Lee, for God's sake, stop--make sure the car runs," (laughter).  And they got away.  And I never forgot that.  He was feisty.  He was, in a way, he was kind of a philosopher.  I remember that there was a fellow in my town named Monk.  And Monk was a bad fellow, I mean he was a mean fellow, got in fights and everything.  But he would curse out the white people.  And the, and my daddy said that they had to support Monk because he was the only Negro in the town that had enough courage to curse out white folks, and that they had to support him because he, he--they thought he was crazy.  And the said that once the white folks think you're crazy, they either do two things.  They kill you or they just ignore anything you do and tolerate you.  And Monk was one they tolerated.  And so he said the black folks found ways to support Monk (laughter), so that he could express their, their, their protestant feelings toward the white community.  But it was very--they also, my daddy always told me another story.  There was a new doctor came to town, and he was always fascinated by a doctor cause he worked for this old until he died--before he, before he died and went in business.  And he said, this doctor didn't have any patients to start with, and that every day about noon, he would get him a sack and a sandwich and get in his buggy and ride right down the middle of the black community, whipping his horse, just going, going, going.  He said the really didn't go any where but the edge of town and sat down and eat his lunch.  Then he would come back through the town the same way, and people said, oh, the doctor's busy.  He's taking care of his patients.  And pretty soon he had more patients than he could (laughter) handle.  My daddy thought that was the mark of a genius for the doctor to do that.  But he loved to tell those stories, and he was a, he was a grand man.  He was a great inspiration to me.  Not having finished high school, he learned--he could read and write and figure, kept his records himself very well, and was a successful, small businessman in a little town where, where success meant that you, you know, you could live above the, the existence level.  But he made a good living, and my sister and I benefited from it.  And, and hold him in great, with great reverence, I think of my father and mother, but my father, especially his honesty, integrity.  He would not tolerate any kind of dishonesty or that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 18518
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I guess my very earliest childhood memories are those of my parents [Dora Fackler Lowery, Leroy Lowery].  I mean I remember my parents.  They were the great figures in my life, and so I remember a very warm and loving mother and a father who's sternness was sort of a mask for his warm and kindness.  And his bark was loud and tough, but his bite was soft and easy.  And, but he was a hard-working man.  He worked from, as they say, sun up to sun down.  I was, for most of the--many years, I never saw him in the daylight except on Sundays when his business was closed.  And, and even when the ice part--that little ice cream some time would open on Sunday, he would be there all day.  And I'd see him (unclear), but other times, he was gone when I'd get up and not back when I went to bed.  But the memories of him are very fond.  He was a very, very kind and generous man once you got through that, that protective barrier he put up there of being tough and stern.  He could be tough and stern, but once you got through that, he was a very kind man.  So my earliest memories are, are fond memories of, of a happy relationship with my parents, of, of competitive, adversarial relationship with my younger sister (laughter), who always wanted to tag along, you know.  And I'm, I had to be responsible for her, and yet we had a loving relationship as well when it got over that barrier.  But my memories were, are all fond, and I, I remember walking to school a long way, across town to get to the colored school.  I remember walking back home in the afternoons, coming through a hostile, white community.  I remember a family called Hoopers, a white family.  They had some mean boys who got home about the same time we got to their house.  Their school was near, closer, and they were home usually when we passed by.  And sometimes they would throw rocks.  And sometime we'd have a rock battle.  Occasionally, we might wrestle a little bit and swing a few fists, but there were about five of them and it'd be two of us.  So eventually, we get in a lick or two and then head, (laughter) head home, but, but it was, it never seemed to be anything that anybody got seriously hurt, although we anticipated it with a great deal of fear and trepidation from time to time.  But I remember those things.  I remember my early teachers.  I remember my first and second grade and third grade teachers who were warm people, who thought I could sing.  And every time there was a school program, I had to sing.  And, and I remember if I, if I misbehaved in school, there, there were two sets of punishment, one at the school and one when I got home because the teacher would call my mother, and my mother would be waiting.  I understand you talked in school, class today, etc., etc.  And it might even happen on the way home because my mother a couple of friends whose, whose homes I'd pass on the way home.  And how the word got from the teacher to my mother to the friends, I don't know, but oftentimes, I would get chastised and rebuked by mother's friends on the way home.  And I knew, because of that I was gonna get a little whipping, if not, some form of punishment when I got home.  But they were very fond memories.  I have a, had a good childhood and, and--.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your, sir?
Speaker 2: Council, the name was Council, named after William Hooper Council, so it was Council Elementary School.  Later my--.
Speaker 1: Who, I'm sorry, but who was William Hooper Council?
Speaker 2: Well, he was an educator who worked out at [Alabama] A&M at the Normal School that my mother attended and later became a very noted figure in, in education in, in the black community.  And they named the school after him.  I never knew him, but I always knew of him.  In fact, out on A&M campus, they had a building or so named after him.  In fact, they had a high school later built called Council Training School, and to distinguish it from Council Elementary School in Huntsville.  But William Hooper Council was a noted educator in those days and had those schools named after him.
Story_ID: 18519
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, Huntsville [Alabama] was textile, mill town.  I remember one mill out toward the North, Mary Mack, and another one out East--can't remember the name of it, out at Clinton.  But it was a textile, cotton, agricultural center.  Madison County was, grew a lot of cotton.  And so the textile mills took advantage of that and, and some of wealthy white people in town were, were people who were cotton brokers or cotton merchants, and that sort of thing and connected with the cotton industry.  Black people who worked with them were, were among the more affluent black people in the community, aside from the professional people and the people who worked in the post office.  So that Huntsville was not a very big town, not a lot of people except on weekends.  Now, Saturday all the people who lived out in the rural areas came to town to do shopping and socializing and so forth on Saturday.  And so Saturday was a busy day.  You would have thought Huntsville was a big town if you went downtown or to town on--we didn't really call it downtown.  We called town, if you go to town on Saturday, you run into everybody.  But during the week, it was a quiet village, but it took new life on Saturday.
Speaker 1: Did people primarily come on horseback or in buggies?
Speaker 2: They came in wagons.  They came in wagons and they came in, in--and as soon as cars came, pretty soon black folks came in cars, old cars most of it.  But they came in cars and in wagons.  And they road horses, but pretty soon they came in cars.  And then I left Huntsville.  My father thought I was getting a little bad company, and that I wasn't getting the best education.  So he sent me to Chicago.
Speaker 1: So this is while you were still in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was while I was still in elementary school
Story_ID: 18520
Speaker 1: Sixth, seventh and eighth grades, I was at St. Elizabeth Elementary School in Chicago.  So those first five were at Council, but then sixth, seventh and eighth, I stayed with some of my father's friends in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, is that on the South side?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's on the South side.  I stayed in the Rosenwald Building.  I don't know--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's between 46th and 47th and Michigan and Wabash.  And I was a celebrity there because while I lived in that building, Joe Louis lived in that building.  And people used to line up outside the entrances, particularly on 47th street, if ever this long car was out there and a chauffer, they knew Joe was coming out.  And my friends and I, we, we used to play a little game.  They would go out there and get with the crowd.  I'd be inside the building.  Then I would walk out the entrance.  And they'd say, "Here comes Joe."  And everybody would look and look and it would, it would be me (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is Joe Lowery.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Joe Lowery, not Joe Louis.  And so, everybody say, ah, and my friends would applaud, you know.  And, and I would walk right up to the car as though I were gonna get in the car, but his chauffer never let me in.  But soon or later, Joe would come out, and I--we had a front-seat view of Joe Louis who lived in the, in the Rosenwald Building.  He was a, it was a relatively affluent community on the South side and it had something that you hardly see anywhere else, they had patrolmen.  They had their security, uniformed security in the building.  And so--and we had our little playground and across Wabash, we had another little playground we could go, so it was--and I attended St. Elizabeth, and my father was very pleased that I was exposed to that, what he thought was a better educational experience and a better environment all together in Chicago.  And I stayed there three years at St. Elizabeth and then went to [Jean Baptiste] DuSable High [School, Chicago, Illinois] for my ninth and tenth grade.  And, and enjoyed that experience at DuSable High which I, I could walk to DuSable from 47th and up to about 49th, two or three blocks to DuSable High.  And I stayed there ninth and tenth grades.
Speaker 2: Now, were you involved in many school activities when you were in grade school and high school?
Speaker 1: In, in grade school, I was, I was always in every program, whenever they had a program, I had to make a speech or something like that.  But I didn't get involved in athletics until later in high school, but in the elementary school, there were no, there were no athletic activities that I recall except out on the lots you could play ball with classes and so like that.  There were no intramural or (unclear) or inner, inner-school activity that I was aware of until senior high.  But in, in senior high--well, let me go back to St. Elizabeth.  There were classes and they had little discussion groups and groups that specialized in poetry and that sort of thing.  And I remember the strict discipline of the nuns who taught us at St. Elizabeth, and it was--I, I think a very beneficial experience in that, while I never became a Roman Catholic, I did appreciate the, the discipline that was taught at the school, a discipline of study, the discipline related to behavior and, and attitude and all that sort of thing, I, I enjoyed that very much.  I got a lot of whippings.  They, they had a little switch, they whipped your hand, had (unclear) those whippings, and I remember when I first went there that I got more than my share, I thought, of whippings.  But soon, I learned to deal with that and to become more disciplined and improve my behavior and thereby avoid the whippings.  As I went back to that school in later years, I had a pretty good record.  They gave grades in numbers, and my numbers were ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, and I was very proud of my, my academic achievement in, at St. Elizabeth.  But at DuSable, out of two years at DuSable, I don't remember any particular activities that, that I participated in beyond the, beyond the studies.  And in the eleventh grade I went back to Huntsville.  The lady I was staying with became ill.  My father brought me back home to go to school.  And then I went out to Council Training School at Alabama A&M [University, Normal. Alabama] , which is the, the school I referred to later that was also named after William Hooper Council, and I finished high school at this training school out at A&M, where I played on the soft--school softball team and for one year on the school football team.  And I was a quarterback and halfback.  I liked both positions because I got to play a lot.  If I, if I wasn't in as quarterback, I could go in as halfback.  And we had a lot of fun, didn't win a lot of games, but we had a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: Now, that's like at Council Training School?
Speaker 1: Council Training School, at Alabama A&M.  I don't know if it still exists.  Whether they still have the high school at A&M, A&M now, that I don't know.
Speaker 2: Who are some of the teachers in high school that took an interest in you or that you admired, you know, in, in both Chicago and Huntsville?
Speaker 1: I don't remember any teachers from DuSable.  It was crowded and very impersonal, and while, I remember some of the kids, I just don't remember the teachers.  But back at--.
Speaker 2: Were there any kids that were memorable, I mean some of the other students that--?
Speaker 1: No, I, after I left there, after those two years, I lost track.  There were two girls, one named Doris and one named Emerald, and we were very close.  And many, many years later, one of those girls called me, saw my name in "JET" or something connected with civil rights, and, and called me.  And she was married and, and had children and had not seen my name since we were at DuSable, but that was just a brief conversation.  I never saw them again.  But now, back at Council Training, I had several teachers that I remembered.  One was a man named Stevens who, who was, taught math.  And he was a very effective teacher and was very--a former football player and took a lot of time with the fellows in the classes to talk with them after class about life and manhood and that sort of thing.  And he was very--impressed me greatly.  And he later became a physician.  He left and stopped teaching and went to medical school and practiced in Oklahoma until his death.  His name was Stevens.  He made a great impact on my life on issues related to manhood and manliness.  He was, he was a race man, what you'd call a race man.  He was interested in the race question and, and took a strong position in terms of race relations and injustice against black people in the country.  And he impressed me tremendously.  One other teacher was a preacher, a--Sam Williams, who was from, whom later I, whom I knew in Alabama, and then I knew in, in Atlanta.  And he was, he was very impressive.  He taught classes in religion and, and civics.  And he was very impressive.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So when you were in high school, so when you were a senior--now, you graduated in what, nineteen--?
Speaker 1: Thirty-nine [1939].
Story_ID: 18521
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation [1939], did you know at that time what you wanted to do with the rest of your life in terms of career?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I was confused.  All of my childhood at Lakeside Church, almost every preacher--I guess because I recited so many poems on programs (laughs), that every--almost every preacher would say, you know, boy, that one day the Lord may call you to preach.  And I said, yeah, right, you know.  And I would tell my mother, I said, you know, your, your, your pastor, they, they're a little off in the head, you know.  And she would say, what are you talking about, boy?  I said, they keep telling me I'm gonna preach.  And she'd laugh.  She said, yeah, they're probably off in the head cause you, you not gonna preach cause you--you could, but you just not gonna do.  I know you not.  You gonna be hard headed.  And it passed on, but, and my father was talking about my going into business with him.  And, if not law--and I could do both.  I could practice law in the town and, and work with him in the business as well.  So I guess I was satisfied to think about going in business with my dad.  And it was later in college when I decided that, that perhaps preaching was, was gonna, gonna knock harder on my door than business and law.  When I first told my dad that, he said, well, you know, okay.  He says, I got a lot down here on the corner near where our, Ma Polly lived, and we could build a church, and you could preach there, and you could still go on to law school and run the business and just preach on Sunday's (laughs).  And I said, I don't, I don't think, dad, that's, that's what the Lord has in mind for me to do.  I'm thinking more of a full-time minister.  And he was uneasy about that.  And it was only after he heard me preach my first sermon that he became reconciled to the fact that, that I was gonna preach.  And he was pleased with it.  And I thank God that before he died, he came to my third church out in Mobile.  It was the first real, major church that I had in Mobile, Alabama.  And he came down there--I went to Mobile in '52 [1952].  He came down before he passed in '56 [1956] and saw my ministry and talked with the people in the community who, who appreciated my ministry, the fact that I was concerned about helping people, making their homes heavenly, as well as making heaven their home.  And he was very pleased with that.  And so when he passed a year or two after he came down, and he passed at peace with my vocational choice.  And that pleased me greatly because I never was at ease with the fact that I had not followed his counsel and where he wanted me to go.  So when he became reconciled, and he, he was at peace at what I was doing, I was then at peace with what I was doing.

Speaker 1: You went to Alabama A and M first, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I went to high school at Alabama A&M [University, Normal, ALabama].  This Council Training School was related to Alabama A&M.  And I later took summer classes at the college too.  But that was the high school.  When I went to college, I went to Knoxville [College, Knoxville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, why did you decide on Knoxville College?
Speaker 2: My father decided on Knoxville, because a physician across the street, Dr. Beard, had gone to Knoxville and was from Knoxville.  His children had gone to Knoxville, and he persuaded--my dad really wanted me to go to Fisk [University].  But Dr. Beard persuaded him to send me to Knoxville.  So that's why I went to Knoxville.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how was Knoxville and--.
Speaker 2: Knoxville was a good school.  It was a church school, Presbyterian school.  I came out of a Methodist background, but it was Presbyterian.  That wasn't too much difference, and it was a, a good school, small enough for teachers to relate to students on a, on a one-to-one basis so that it was not impersonal as some of the big college and universities.  And I enjoyed matriculating at Knoxville, played a little football, not, not a lot.  That was the beginning of the big giants, you know, and the little fast guy was fading away.  And the big strong guy was coming into vogue.  So I didn't play a lot.  But I enjoyed my matriculation there and it was there that I met another preacher.  Sam Williams was the first preacher I met when I was at A&M in the high school and in the summer classes.  But I met a man name Ben Evans, who was a Presbyterian preacher at Knoxville and the chap--and the pastor of the college.  And he impressed me greatly.  I enjoyed his sermons, and he used to talk with me about--and he asked me once or twice--I never told him that the pastors I had had as a boy had said I was gonna be a preacher.  I never told him that because I didn't want to hear it from him.  But he seemed to sense it somehow and asked me once or twice, has anybody ever said to you that God might call you to preach?  And I don't think I gave him any answer.  I just sort of talked about something.  But he impressed me, and I think I made the decision during those years that I would go to seminary and preach.
Story_ID: 18523
Speaker 1: God has a way of, of, of hounding you, you know, it's--.
Speaker 2: Now, so you didn't--did you have a moment or an incident that caused you to feel that that's what you ought to do?
Speaker 1: No, I, I kept waiting on that instance where God would knock me off the horse or off a bicycle, you know, and lightening would flash, and, and the Lord would--a voice from heaven would say, hey, Joe, you got to go preach, you know.  But it, it never came.  It, it was more or less a, a slow process of, of, of nagging, you know, that this is something--I didn't think, I, I became more and more interested in sermons that I heard.  I, I became interested in, in the social aspect of the gospel.  I became active in the, in the NAACP Youth chapters and so forth.  And when I'd come home back to Huntsville during the summer, I would work with youth activities related to, to, not only church activities, but civic activities.  And it just kept nagging on me that, that, that the gospel that I became interested in couldn't, I couldn't reconcile it with the, with the life in, in the South and, and the segregation and the separation and the discrimination and the abuse I had seen.  And one other instance that I had when I was probably just moved from elementary to high school.  I was coming out of my dad's sweet shop, we called it, and as I was coming out of the door, a big white policeman was coming in.  And I was two thirds out of the door, and he was one third in the door, and I would, thought he would just let me out.  And he punched me in the stomach with his nightstick and said, "Get back, nigger", and "don't you see this white man coming in the door".  And, of course, I got back.  And when he came in, I went out and went home.  I lived down the street, and I remembered my daddy had a little pearl handled pistol in the, in his drawer.  And I went to get that pistol to shoot this cop.  And when I came out of the door--my mother didn't see me, and I came out on the front porch, my dad met me on the front porch.  This was about three or 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon.  It was a shock because, as I mentioned earlier, I never saw my dad in the daytime at home, during the week.  And for some reason, and I'm not aware of it to this day, why he was home, but he was there, and saw something was wrong with me.  I was crying.  And then he saw my hand in my pocket and took the pistol away from me, and gave me a couple licks with the back of his hand for having his pistol.  And finally when I told him what it was all about, he then, the next day went to see the mayor to complain.  And I'll never forget what he told me the mayor told him that, that I sympathize with you, but it's nothing I can do about it, Lee.  That's the only kind of white man I can hire to be a policeman, nothing I can do about it.  Go on home and forget about it.  And I'll never--I never forgot that.  That was a impression--as I got exposed to the gospel, those incidents and other incidents with my father and his attitude to his lying to the police about the car, you know, and all those kind of things, those--they nagged on me.  And it was a sudden, dramatic experience like Paul had on the road to Damascus, but a series of small instances and events that generally--that eventually led me to say that I, I want to preach.
Speaker 2: Now, in the black community, I know there's two views of what a minister ought to do, maybe more, but these are the two prevalent views that seem to fight it out.  And I think they're exemplified by Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Joseph Jackson in Chicago.  One view is that you just, you know, prepare people for heaven, you know.  And the other view is that you try to change and make life better, you know, here.  And did you have a--were you taught, you know, by, by your teachers at Knoxville College and those ministers that you saw to, that the ministry could be like an avenue for social change?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--Reverend Evans and Reverend Williams, at the senior high and at the college level, both of them were, were ministers who looked at the gospel holistically, that the gospel speaks to the whole person, to his, not only his soul, but his mind and his body and his well being in the community.  So that from the very beginning, my interest and attraction to the gospel was related to, to, to civic matters and social conditions.  I, I had a tough time reconciling the fact that, that God loved all his children and God created us all equal.  The Constitution talked about equality and this sort of thing, and I, I couldn't reconcile that.  So from the beginning I was, I had an interest in, in the gospel from the holistic prospective so that it related to, as I said earlier, not only to make heaven your home, but making your home here heavenly.  So from the very beginning I was attracted to the gospel by social dimensions as well as its so-called heavenly dimensions.

Speaker 1: How long were you at Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Two years, stayed there two years, and then I went to A &M, and then went back to Payne College [Birmingham, Alabama] and finished.  But, but Knoxville made a lasting impression and, and then I went on to Payne and went on to seminary at Payne as well.  And my dad, as I said, thank God, was reconciled to my preaching, and died at peace with it.  And I (unclear), but I always went into the ministry with this, social dimension was foremost in my mind.  The nonviolence came later when I met Martin [Luther King, Jr.], and I was in Mobile [Alabama].
Story_ID: 18525
Speaker 1: When you finished with Payne [College, Birmingham, Alabama], what did you do?  I mean what did do next?
Speaker 2: In the seminary, well, I started pastoring at the same time while I was still in seminary; had a little church in Birmingham, now they call East Thomas, and out on the, sort of the Eastern suburb--edge of Birmingham, very small church.  My first little church.  And--.
Speaker 1: So you're out of the, a United Methodist?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, well at that time we were ME.
Speaker 1: ME.
Speaker 2: Methodist Episcopal who were always the, the multi-racial group.  We never, blacks never pulled out.  We stayed in there and fought it out, and East Thomas--St. James really was the name of the church.  It was in the little section of town called East Thomas, little one-room church, about to fall down.  It, when you, when you hear people pray, Lord prop me on every leaning side, I think of that prayer when I saw that little church, that was leaning (laughter) for you, for you to prop it up on every leaning side.  But it was a good experience and was, it was an unusual church.  It gave me an urban flavor, but yet it had the small-town setting, in that it was a little village by itself out there on the edge of Birmingham.  And I had an--I didn't stay there but a year, but I had a very interesting experience.  My daughter, my oldest daughter met her future husband at that church.  And we moved from there to Alexander City, which was a larger church, but, of course, a smaller community.  And not unlike Huntsville, it was a textile community, and Russell Mill was the major employer there and, and Avondale Mill was twenty-some miles away in another town called Sylacauga (ph.).  So it was a textile mill and really agricultural, but mostly the textile, people employed in that mill.  And it was very interesting.  I stayed there three years, and that was at about the time that integration movement--it was the late '40's [1940s] and early '50's [1950s].  And there was a Baptist preacher on the other hill, that--I was on the Methodist church on one hill and a Baptist church on the other hill.  And Reverend M. Nunn was the Baptist preacher, tall fellow, always reminded me of King Fish.  And he wore a long coat, and he talked like King Fish, always wore a big round hat like King Fish.  And I learned a lot from him.  He was an old preacher who had a lot of experience.  And, but he was--worked, worked with the white folks very cooperatively.  Whereas my sermons were a little more problematic for the white community, but--and the strange thing was that when I left Alexander City--I went there in '49 [1949], left in '52 [1952] and went to Mobile, I had a member of the church who worked for this old man Russell, who was a big man at the mill.  And she came to me, and Mr. Russell said that he wished you'd stay in Alex City, and whatever money you're gonna get going to Mobile, they would deal with that.  And I wouldn't have to worry about, but he thought that my--even though he disagreed with my social position on integration and so forth, that I had a, a very Christian, you know, a Christian way of dealing with it.  And he thought it would be better for me to stay there, and let--[they?] could work together and work out the problems of segregation and so forth.  But, of course, I wasn't about to stay there and work for Mr. Russell.
Story_ID: 18526
Speaker 1: I went on to Mobile.  And it was in Mobile where I had the, the baptism of fire.  I went to a seminar in Boston once, which was Boston School, the, you know, Methodist school.  And there I met Martin [Luther King, Jr.].  And we talked briefly, and then I didn't see him again for a long time--.
Speaker 2: And he was a PhD candidate?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, he was doctoral candidate.  And then I didn't see him for a long time until he came to Dexter in Montgomery, and I was still in Mobile.  And, of course, and then the boycott began.  But I met him before the boycott at a meeting in Montgomery, the Alabama Council on Human Relations, and he spoke and I spoke.  And after the meeting, we exchanged greetings and said we gonna preach--he was coming to Mobile, and I was going to Montgomery, we're gonna preach for each other.  And we developed this friendship.  Then the boycott started in Montgomery.  And I was president of the Ministry Alliance in Mobile.  And I raised some money and carried a few thousand dollars, I think it was about 3,000 dollars, which in 1955 was a tremendous amount of money .  And I went up there for one of the Monday night mass meetings and carried this, this money to, to the MIA--Montgomery Improvement Association.  And that was the beginning of our, our relationship.  And then the Movement started in Mobile, and we, after the bus situation broke in Montgomery, we decided to--we were going to desegregate the buses in Mobile.  But Mobile was different from Montgomery.  When we rode the buses the first day, we organized the ministers and two-by-two, we rode different bus routes.  And Reverend Sam McCree (ph.) and I rode--the fellows said I should ride the Pritchard route.  Pritchard was a mean suburb (laughs), cracker country, they called it.  And they figured, since I was the leader, I ought to ride out to the, the most dangerous (laughs) thing.  I didn't think that was nice.  But they thought that was appropriate.  So Reverend McCree and I did, and we had had these workshops on how you will react in difficult situations.  So we got on the first cross seat on the bus, and we did all right.  There were a couple of white people behind us.  They didn't seem to say anything, and blacks were in the back.  And then a white fellow got on the bus after about five minutes with a sack, obviously, a bottle in the sack.  And he sat on the side seat right behind the driver.  And at first, he didn't seem to notice that blacks were sitting on the front seat.  And, but after a block or so, he looked, and he told the driver, says, "Make 'em move back." And the driver said, "I'll drive, you ride."  And he said, "Well, by God, if you don't make 'em move back, I will."  So he got up with this sack and this bottle in his hand, and I felt Reverend McCree reach in his pocket, I, I nudged him, cause you're not supposed to have any weapons.  He had a little bitty, (laughter) pocket knife, gonna protect himself with that bottle.  But then we put into practice what we had rehearsed in the, in the workshops we'd had, nonviolent workshops.  We take the initiative.  That's one of the firs things they teach you, if you can, in a confrontation, take the initiative.  So I stood up, and I said, "Sir, please sit down."  I said, "it's dangerous to stand up when the bus is moving.  I'm gonna sit down, you should sit down; said, we mean you no harm.  I'm sure you don't mean us any harm.  Sit down and be comfortable."  And to our surprise, he sat down.  And then we sat down, and the next stop, he got up and got off the bus.  And Reverend McCree and I said, whew, you know.  (Unclear) Nobody knew, we, we were as frightened as we could be, but we kept our cool.  That nonviolent workshop paid off, and taking the initiative and it disarmed him.  And he got off.  And, and when we got off the bus at the end of the line, so the black ladies got off with us and said, yawl, yawl, segregating the buses?  Yes, ma'am, we're desegregating the buses, and we rode back without incident.  But Mobile--and that was the end of segregation on the buses in Mobile.  They never enforced it after that.  Some blacks continued to go to the back, others were upfront.  They never enforced it anymore after that.  That was the difference in Mobile and Montgomery.  We then petitioned the--that's why we got no, no media attention because there was no resistance.  So we then asked the bus company to hire black bus drivers.  And within five or six months, they had hired two black bus drivers.  So we never the kind of crises in Mobile that they had in Montgomery and in Birmingham.  So we never got the media attention.  But Mobile was--and, and media attention always followed resistance.  It was the white behavior that determined how much media coverage you got.  If, if whites didn't resist, then no matter what blacks did, you didn't get much attention.  But if the Klan was gonna show up or if the town was gonna arrest, then you got attention.  So Montgomery and Birmingham got the attention, and Mobile didn't.  But Mobile desegregated their buses.
Speaker 2: Now, did you--would you say that the gulf coast a little easier to desegregate than the rest of the--.
Speaker 1: It was, it was, because, I think, in Mobile, now--and when you say the gulf coast, I'm talking about Mobile.  I'm not talking about the little communities.  Some of them took it along with any place else, and New Orleans had a tough time; never was a real great, strong movement in, in New Orleans.  It was a tough town, tougher than Mobile for some reason.  But in Mobile, not only was there the coast and the--which gave it a kind of a cosmopolitan flavor.  You had merchant marines and others coming in and out.  You had the Creole, Cajun kind of population mix, but you had a man, one man, a white man, a Roman Catholic layman named Joe Langdon (ph.), who was a city commissioner.  And he was the man who took a very progressive posture toward desegregation, and he had a great influence on the city.  And that, I think, was as important a factor as anything else in, in Mobile's relatively smooth desegregation process as compared to Montgomery.  And then Mobile was just behind Montgomery and wanted to avoid all the explosiveness and volatility that was experienced in Montgomery and Birmingham.
Story_ID: 18527
Speaker 1: We were meeting, we were meeting in those days, [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and Ralph [Abernathy] in Montgomery, Fred Shuttlesworth  in Birmingham and I was in Mobile, C. G. Gamillion (ph.) was in Tuskegee. And we used to meet in Montgomery every month to talk about our different trials and tribulations to strengthen each other, to commensurate with each other and to talk about strategies.  And out of those meetings, came the suggestion to hold a South-wide meeting.  And that's how the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was born.
Speaker 2: Now, was SCLC born before the lawsuit, "Sullivan vs you and [Ralph] Abernathy and Shuttlesworth?
Speaker 1: Yes, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] was organized  in '57 [1957].  We started having these meetings in '56 [1956], while the Montgomery Bus Boycott was going on.  And we'd meet in Montgomery and Fred--we'd meet at 10:00 o'clock in the morning.  And Fred would leave Birmingham at 8:00 and drive down in two hours.  I'd leave Mobile at 6:00 and get there at 10:00.  Fred would get there, and then Martin and Ralph would come across town and get there about noon.  It took them longer to come across town in Montgomery than for me to come from Mobile.  But we had those meetings, and, and SCLC, somebody suggested a South-wide meeting.  And we met in, at the end of '56 [1956] in, in Atlanta.  And while we were here, Ralph's church was bombed.  And we adjourned and, and met later in February in New Orleans.  And that's where SCLC was organized in '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: Was that the one in Dukey (ph.) Chase Restaurant?
Speaker 1: No, we weren't organized in (unclear), we were organized in, in Zion Church, a Baptist church.  And we may have eaten in Dukey, but the organizational meeting was at, was at the Zion Baptist Church in New Orleans in 1957.  And Martin was elected president.  And I believe, I was elected assistant secretary.  But then we had another organizational meeting later in Tallahassee, and I was elected vice president.  And I think C. K. Steele was first vice president, and I was second vice president, and Martin was president.  Ralph was secretary-treasurer-- financial, secretary treasurer.  And I believe, T. J. Jemison in Baton Rouge was elected secretary, and then Fred Shuttleworth was elected assistant secretary.  And later when, when Jemison left, Fred Shuttleworth moved up to secretary.  But that was the beginning of SCLC and the beginning of my relationship with, with Martin, which grew of the years he--throughout the years Martin tried to get me to come to Atlanta to become executive vice president of SCLC.  But I was pastoring first in Mobile, then Nashville, then Birmingham, and could not come, partly because I was appointed by the bishop to serve in Birmingham, and not Atlanta.  But he kept insisting.  And so I met with the bishop once and talked about it.  We discussed it around January or February of '68 [1968].  But then in April of '68 [1968], Martin was killed.  Then in June of '68 [1968], I was assigned to Central Church here in Atlanta.  So I did come to Atlanta, but not--only after Martin had passed.  He never lived to see me move to Atlanta.
Story_ID: 18528
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about a couple of--the lawsuit first of all, "Sullivan versus The New York Times, you, (unclear) (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: And Abernathy and Shuttlesworth.  Yeah, that was a, you know, that's, that's the classic suit on libel in the country.  The Movement was in Montgomery, and the boycott was still going on.  And we were in Mobile [Alabama], Fred in Birmingham, and Bayard Ruston, and a group of, of supporters in New York were trying to raise money for us in SCLC.  And they took out this ad in the "The New York Times", and the ad said that the police in Montgomery ringed the campus of Alabama State where the students were doing sit-in's and protesting segregation.  And the city commissioners and the governor took exception to that ad and filed a libel suit against "The New York Times" and the four of us, Solomon (unclear) and Abernathy in Montgomery and Shuttlesworth in Birmingham, and I was in Mobile.  By that time Martin had moved to Atlanta.  But we were sued, and the case was tried in Montgomery.  And there were three different suits, one by--well, there really were four, one by each of the three commissioners and one by the governor.  And, of course, we lost all of them, and the jury in Alabama found us guilty in every case.  Eventually, the Supreme Court reversed the decision, but the before they did that, they took our property because when they found the judgment that totaled about a million and a half dollars, we had to put up what they called a supercedeous bond, which is twice the amount of the judgment.  Well, none of us could, could put up that kind of bond.  "The New York Times" did, but "The New York Times" refused to allow us to go on the bond.  Their argument was that if they let the Alabama residents go on their bond, then that established them as an Alabama entity, and that would be make them--whereas, their argument was that, that the courts Alabama had no jurisdiction over them.  So they felt that would weaken their argument.  We didn't buy that argument any more than the courts did, but--because we wanted to get on the bond.  That would have protected our property, but they wouldn't let us on the bond.  So they took our property.  And all they could find that I had was a car.  All they could find Fred had was a car.  And Ralph, they found more because they found his family property in Marengo County, and so they took the farm.  I was from Madison County up in Huntsville, so they didn't associate me with, with Huntsville.  And when we went to trial, well, I told the lawyer, "Now, listen, don't ask me where I was born because that will wake up the fact that I'm from Huntsville, and I do have--my father left some little houses up there, so I do have some heir property in Huntsville and don't want to get that involved."  He said, okay.  So when I got on the stand in Montgomery, he said, your name, please, and your address?  So I gave him my name; said, where were you born?  I said, oh, my God.  You know, my heart jumped (chuckle) in my mouth.  And, and somehow, the Lord spoke to me, and I said, "Madison, Alabama," which was true.  I was born in Madison County, Alabama.  So they never associated Huntsville with me.  So my property never got involved.  So all they could find, all I owned in Mobile was my car because I lived in the church parsonage.  So they took my car, which created a big stir in Mobile.  And they took pictures of them bringing the wrecker out and hauling my car off and the kids were throwing rocks at the--I had to stop the kids from throwing rocks and so forth.  But that was the libel case.  It is "the", the flagship case in libel because, and interestingly enough, when it was, when the Supreme Court reversed it, and they had to give us our property back, the Justice Black, Hugo Black, who was from Alabama, is the man who wrote the majority opinion, which said that you can't libel a public official unless you can prove malice.  And so they reversed the case.  Fred got a new car, Solomon got a new car, Ralph got his farm back, and he got a new car.  My, my members were Methodist.  They were smarter than the Baptists.  They, they went down to the auction where they sold the car, and they bought it for eight hundred dollars and gave me my old car back (laughter).  So I'm the only one didn't get a, didn't get a new car.  They--it was a Chrysler, and they sold it for eight hundred dollars at the auction.  So they bought it.  My members went down and bid on it and bought and then gave it to my wife for a dollar.  So my wife owned the car, and I didn't, I didn't get a new car.  I'm the only one didn't get a new car.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, the decision was a landmark decision, though, right?
Speaker 2: It is a landmark decision on libel, which today is, is paramount in those kind of--that kind of litigation which, as I said, ruled that you can hardly--it's hard to libel a public official.  You have to be able to--the public official has to prove that there was malice, and if it's, if you can't prove malice, then you can't win because the court says that he's fair game, that once he becomes a public official, or even a public figure, that, that you're fair game.  But that is the classic case.  Interestingly enough, later, years later, in Atlanta after I became president of SCLC, a reporter, I felt, libeled me in the paper, but my lawyer said, you can't sue because of the case "New York Times versus Lowery and Abernathy" because you're a public figure.  And therefore, you can't sue them.  But it is a classic case.  And interestingly enough, the, the justice from Alabama made the, wrote the opinion, one whom we thought was a member of KKK at one time, and yet he made a very progressive and liberal ruling on that issue.

Speaker 1: What about Birmingham in '63 [1963], did you--what was your role in that?
Speaker 2: I was in Nashville in 1963 and went back and forth in Birmingham to visit the Movement, but I was living in Nashville.  I left Mobile in '61 [1961] and moved to Nashville to be administrative assistant to the bishop whose territory included Tennessee and Alabama.  So I was in Nashville where I became president of the, what we called Interaction Council in, in Nashville.  And we worked to desegregate all the public accommodations in Nashville, restaurants, hotels and so forth.  But I would come down to Birmingham during some of the marches and the Movement in Birmingham.  Strangely enough, I moved to Birmingham in '64 [1964] and became pastor in '64 [1964] immediately after the, the Movement had come to a, to fruition in Birmingham.  And Fred had moved to Cincinnati.  So I became head of the Ministerial Alliance in Birmingham, and we continued the process of desegregation because it had not been completed because we were still fighting public, segregation on public accommodation.  That didn't occur until the middle of '64 [1964] when the '64 [1964] Public Accommodations Act was passed, and the public facilities were, were desegregated in, all throughout the country, but throughout the South where the law demanded segregation on the buses.
Speaker 1: In terms of the SCLC's [Southern Christian Leadership Council] involvement in Birmingham, and there's the famous incident where the children from school come out and march and are sprayed with hoses and (unclear), were you in Birmingham for that time or were you in--?
Speaker 2: In '63 [1963] I was in Nashville.
Speaker 1: In Nashville.
Speaker 2: I moved to Birmingham in '64 [1964], but I visited Birmingham as vice president of the organization.  The, Birmingham was the first instance of a mass arrests.  They couldn't find enough jails to hold the students.  It was, it was the introduction of school--of students and mass arrests.  That was the first instance of that was in Birmingham, and that was what was significant about Birmingham, is that mass arrests became a new dimension of the Movement.  Montgomery had the mass withdrawal from riding the buses, boycott, but it was Birmingham that introduced the mass arrests.  And that broke the back of, of segregation and the Public Accommodations Act was passed.  Birmingham, of course, in '63 [1963] had the terrible Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing, which--and also the bombing of, of the A. G. Gaston Motel.  We were in the A. G. Gaston Motel meeting, planning the '65 [1965] Voting Rights crusade down in Selma.  And one night--we were meeting in room thirty.  Room thirty was the only great, big room they had in the motel.  So we always met there.  And I was still in Nashville.  And I was catching the train that, going to catch the train that night, and then I decided to stay.  I had to be in Athens, Alabama the next day for a commencement.  And [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] said, "stay here tonight.  Why don't you just stay here?  We're in this big room.  We're gonna leave and you going to Atlanta.  You stay here and go up to Athens."  And so I decided to stay.  They left, and I was lying in the room by myself, and I heard a train.  And I said, I'm going home, I' mo get the train anyhow.  And I jumped up and got my bag, got on the train, went to Nashville.  The next day I drove my family down to Athens.  That night, they bombed the motel.  And right by the bed where I would have been sleeping was the gaping hole that the bomb blasted in the hotel.  So I always thank God for letting me decide to go home and get my wife and go to Athens, Alabama the next day or I certainly would have been killed by that, by that bomb.  But Birmingham was known as 'Bombingham'.  And when I came in '64 [1964], the desegregation because of the Public Accommodation Act, had been completed, and--but there was still a great fight on for employment.  We, we then led the fight for hiring black police officers and blacks in the stores, as cashiers and managers and so forth. And that movement continued in Birmingham. And the back of that employment and that sort of thing had to be broken as well.
Story_ID: 18530
Speaker 1: Tell us about the 1965 march from Selma into Montgomery or the--well, Bloody Sunday, I guess.  Tell us about that, and then, you know, after that?
Speaker 2: Well, Selma was--after the Public Accommodations Act, [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] took a group to meet with [President] Lyndon Johnson  to ask about voting rights.  Mr. Johnson said, well, you know, we just to the Public Accommodations Act, can't have any more legislation this soon.  So he discouraged us.  So we went on back to Birmingham and, and started planning a voting rights campaign and chose Selma.  SNCC [Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee] people had already been to Selma and had met with very stiff resistance.  Because Selma was in the 'Black Belt', and because blacks were a majority in, in many of the counties, we felt this was the logical place to launch a voting rights campaign.  And so, one, because Selma had been in the news resisting voter registration efforts by SNCC kids, and they had just about given up on, on the effort.  So we sent staff into Selma.  And eventually Martin and all of us went to Selma.  And we had a number of demonstrations and marches.  Jim Clark, the sheriff and [ Joseph] Smitherman, the mayor, they were vicious opponents of desegregation.  And Selma put up just the kind of resistance that we though it would because we knew we could get the nation's attention based on the level of resistance.  So--.
Speaker 1: So this is an interesting point here, that you actually, that SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Council] actually met and chose Selma based on the kind of--?
Speaker 2: Based on three things.  One, the fact that it already had been--voter registration efforts had been initiated and rebuffed.  Secondly, a black majority in the Black Belt of Alabama.  If ever there were instances where blacks out to be able to vote, it was where they could hold office, and where they were the majority.  So that was it--and we knew the resistance would be fierce.  And so that would get the nation on our side because the nature of the resistance always attracts attention and simplifies the process of change.  The more, the more drastic the discrimination, the, the, the more obvious the need for change.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that was why we chose Selma, those three reasons.  And finally, the, the, the march was not supposed to happen that Sunday.  By that time I was pastor in Birmingham.  And we had had word that Martin , we might go to Selma and initiate the march to Montgomery.  But then I got a call and said, Martin had said, we would not go that day.  We'd do it, we would plan it and do it later.  But John Lewis and Hosea Williams were in Selma.  They vetoed Martin's [Martin Luther King, Jr.] edict and decided to lead the march anyway.  And so they did.  Hosea was, you know, a roughed individual and John was more identified with SNCC than with SCLC.  So they decided the heck with what Martin said.  They were going to have the march that day.  So they did.  And the results are historic, as you know, it's, that's history.  It's called Bloody Sunday.  They met them and turned them back and beat them mercilessly.
Speaker 1: I think they trapped them in the middle of bridge, right?
Speaker 2: They, they met them at the bridge.  And once they, once they stopped them, some of the officers came around to sort of surround it, and the, the marchers fled.  But they caught them with those night sticks and horses and beat them mercilessly.  John got a severe blow to his head which, which he suffered, which was a very serious matter.  Others were hurt, gassed.  They were run, run--they were forced back to the church and into the city.  And, of course, that hit the news.  And as I said, it's the nature of the resistance very often that determines national attitudes and positions.  And people became disgusted and outraged and infuriated at such fierce and vicious and violent resistance to people's right to exercise their first amendment rights and to seek the right to vote.  And so that became the, the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of voting.  And, of course, and we did have the march from Selma to Montgomery, march all the way.  And the government protected us as we marched from Selma to Montgomery.  When we reached Montgomery, Martin made his historic speech, "How Long? Not Long".  Martin appointed a committee to, to take the demands of the march to Governor Wallace, and he named me chair of the committee.  And there were about twelve or fifteen people on the committee, A. G. Gaston was one of them.  So we, we--the, the troops were guarding the capital, and we didn't know if we would get by.
Speaker 1: These are state troopers, right?
Speaker 2: The Alabama State troopers.  So I went to the--now, the National Guard was present.  And the President had federalized them, but, but the, the state troopers were around the capital.  So we went to the general who was in charge of the National Guard to say we want to these, this petition to the governor.  So he then got on the telephone, and he told us, go ahead.  We'd be cleared.  But when we got to the steps, the troopers didn't move.  They were, they were a blue sea.  Moses faced the red sea.  I faced the blue sea (laughter).  And they had on these blue uniforms.  So I looked back at the general who had just told me we'd be cleared to march.  And he shouted some commands to the national guard, hep, hep, hep.  And they marched over and faced the troops.  And they threw those rifles over their shoulders, and the general barked one more command, and they spread their feet, legs.  And the blue sea parted.  And, and I marched through on dry land (laughter).  So I know how Moses felt going through the Red Sea with his body (unclear).  And we carried the petition up to the door, and [Alabama governor, George] Wallace would not receive it.  He sent his secretary.  And I said to him, we're not about to march all the way from Selma to give these demands to a secretary.  We will not do it.  So he closed the door, and we took the petitions back.  So he did not meet that day.  Several days later, at the urging of the Methodist bishop of Alabama, Bishop--what was his name?  Bishop Buesely (ph.) Goodwin.  And he persuaded Wallace, who was a Methodist himself, a member of St. James Methodist in Montgomery, to meet with us.  So then Wallace's secretary called me in Birmingham and said, "The governor is gonna meet with certain members of your committee."  I said, "I beg your pardon".  He's not gonna meet with you nor with many of them, but we'll meet with certain members, said, Gaston, Attorney Shores and people like that.  I said, "well, my opinion is, if you don't meet with all of us, you won't meet with any of us.  But I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll poll the committee and see what they say, and I'll call you back."  So I polled the committee and unanimously, we said, no.  If we all don't meet, none of us will meet.  So I called the secretary back and told him what he said.  He said, well, I'll call you back.  So the next day, he called me back, he said, "okay, we'll meet such and such a day."  So we did.  We met with the governor for about an hour and a half.  And at the meeting he was tearing up little pieces of paper on the desk all while we were talking.  At the end of our conversation, he had a mountain of little pieces of paper on the desk.  And I said to him, I said, "Governor, I, I'm speaking to you now not as a civil rights leader.  I'm speaking as a Methodist preacher to a Methodist layman.  God's gonna hold you accountable for what you're doing in resisting what is right; said, "you're sewing seeds of violence.  You're seeds of, of nullification."  I said, and, and "God's gonna hold you accountable. " And, of course, he argued that he was against violence.  I said, "yes, but the people in the street won't identify with what you argue.  They don't have your platform.  They get lead pipes and shot guns."  But anyway, he wouldn't yield.  And so, of course, you know, that same, that, right following that march, Valerie [sic. Viola] Liuzzo was killed.  Later James Reed was killed in, in Selma and, and another man, preacher in, in Lyons County.  So that the violence that Wallace inspired continued.  But that was--and, of course, he, he ordered the troopers to beat us on Edmund Pettus Bridge in March of '65 [1965].  When I became president of SCLC, one of the things I did, beginning in '85 [1985], I believe, was to have a new march, reenact that march from Selma to Montgomery, not only to commemorate the voting rights act, but to encourage more voter registration in the country.  And in '95 [1995] when we marched, which was the thirtieth anniversary--he, he was governor when I marched in '85 [1985].  And I met with him at the end of the march.  And then in '95 [1995] he was no longer governor.  He was paralyzed in a wheelchair from his wound.  He came out to meet me at St. Jude, the City of St. Jude, which is this Roman Catholic institution out on the edge of Montgomery.  He met us there, and apologized for what had happened in 1965 and made a speech in his wheelchair.  "The New York Times", which wouldn't let us get on their bond earlier, they put a front-page picture of Governor Wallace and me singing "We Shall Overcome" on the steps of the, of St. Jude in 1995.  Almost a year later, a year later--more than a year later, Wallace--I was at Alabama State in Montgomery for their commencement.  And Wallace sent for me.  He was then bedridden.  He couldn't get out of his wheelchair.  He sent for me to pray with him.  And I did.  I went out to his house after the commencement and prayed with him.  And he--when I got ready to go, he then revealed another reason he wanted me to come.  He said, by the way, he said, "I know you know Ted Turner."  And he was writing because he couldn't talk.  And I said, yes.  And he said, "he's doing a movie about me, my life, and in that movie--I've seen the script, in the movie he depicts me as a womanizer and a alcoholic.  And he said, and both are lies.  I'm neither, but that doesn't bother me in movie is that my African American friend whose been with me for a generation, in the movie they say that he plots to kill me.  And it's not true.  And that hurts."  He said, and there he is right there.  He's here with me today.  Ask him if he plotted to kill me.  I said, oh, no, I'll take your word for it.  He said, "I want you to ask Mr. Turner to take that out of his movie."  I said, "Well, I'll, you know, I'll talk to him, but I don't have that kind of influence."  He said, "Well, promise me that you'll do it."  I said, "I will.  I will certainly tell him this story and give him your message."  He thanked me.  I prayed again; he cried.  And I left.  I called Ted Turner and told him what the governor had said, and Ted fell out of his chair laughing about it (laughter).  And he said, you call the governor and tell him I--it's already done.  And number one, I don't have anything to do with that film.  That's some division of my company, but it's finished.  It's completed.  I said, no, I'm not gonna call him.  You call him and tell him.  Now, whether he called him or not, I do not know.  But he didn't do anything about the film.  I saw the film later.  It did have the part about this guy plotting to kill Wallace.  But Wallace did repent.  I think he was heartily sorry when he, when he came out to meet us in '95 [1995], there were those with me on that march, reenacting, who didn't want me to meet with him.  And I said, I would not stand in the door of his repentance as he stood in the door of the university to, to stop the young people.  Incidentally, last May, that same university gave me a Doctor of Humane Letters at its commencement exercises.  And I couldn't help but wonder when I marched down the, the aisle to get that honorary degree, I couldn't help but wonder what George was thinking as he saw this rebel-rousing agitator get a degree from the institution where he stood in the schoolhouse door.
Speaker 1: And everybody remembers that day when Nicholas Katzenbach confronted George Wallace on the steps of the school.
Story_ID: 18531
Speaker 1: You were vice president SCLC from '57 [1957] to '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Became chairman of the board in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And president in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  Now, you were chairman of the board for ten years, but then you become CEO for almost twenty years.
Speaker 2: Twenty-one years.
Speaker 1: Twenty-one years, yeah, twenty-one.
Speaker 2: From, from February of '77 [1977] to January of '98 [1998].  I served longer than [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] and Ralph [ Abernathy] combined.
Speaker 1: Now, in '82 [1982] you, you did a 2,000-mile march to strengthen the voting rights act, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was on the occasion of two--there were two black women in Alabama who were indicted for voter fraud, Maggie Bozeman and Julia Wilder, two elderly women.  One was a school teacher, one was a domestic worker.  Their only crime was registering black voters and teaching them how to absentee ballots.  And that's what they were convicted of.  That was the voter fraud.  White folks had been voting absentee for years.  In fact, at least the people that Maggie and Julia got were alive (laughter).  The, the folks that had voted absentee in, in counties all over Alabama by white people were dead.  They got the names, statistics off tombstones.  But at any rate, when we defended, we, we came to the support of those women.  And on the day of their conviction in a courthouse down in Carrollton, Alabama, we watched the state troopers drive away from the courthouse with those two elderly women in the car, taking them to prison.  And the courthouse was full, and the young people said to me, let's burn this 'mother' down.  And I said, it'd make a good fire, but it won't free Maggie and Julia.  Let's go down to the little church and have a prayer meeting and talk about strategy.  So we did.  And we stayed down there several hours, and we decided to march from Carrolton to Montgomery, to the state capital to free Maggie and Julia.  In the meantime, the voting rights act was expiring, Section 5, particularly, expiring in '82 [1982].  And so we tied the two together because what Maggie and Julia were doing was securing voting rights, and we wanted them free in the name of their right to secure voting rights.  So we not only marched to Montgomery.  We continued to march all the way to Washington, D.C. to free Maggie and Julia, and to extend the voting rights act.  We were successful in both.  Maggie and Julia were eventually freed, and we arrived at the state--at the United States Capitol in Washington on the same day that the house voted to extend the voting rights act for twenty-five years--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which, which expires again in 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I don't know if you're aware of this or not, and you probably are.  There's quite--every, on every black talk show, at least once a day, somebody calls in and says, well, black people don't have the right to vote cause, because the law's gonna expire again, and we really don't have the right to vote in the United States.  And then somebody--there's a discussion about, well, no, we're supposed to have the right to vote, but the voting rights act is separate from the right to vote.  And, you know, do you have any comments about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, the right to vote is in the Constitution.  So that will not expire.  What expires is Section 5 of the voting rights act which is called a pre-clearance section; that is, certain states that had a history of discrimination, when the act was passed, they are required, before they make any change in election laws or election procedures, they have to clear it with the Justice Department, and the Justice Department--or with a federal, the federal district court, three-judge, panel court in Washington.  And that's what will expire.  And that's where we're beginning now to agitate and plan to have that section extended.  I wish we could make it permanent.  We probably cannot because it only specifies certain states.  So it's pretty difficult to get that permanent just for those states, states that have a history of discrimination.  But if they extend it for twenty-five years, that'll be fine because we still need it because if those state are free from having to clear, those states will still discriminate.  There was just a--"Georgia vs. Ashcroft" case this year before the Supreme Court about the voting rights act where it's, it's where the State of Georgia re--relined their districts and diluted majority black districts.  Three of them, the three-judge panel said, you've diluted too much to the point of retrogression and we reject it.  So it went back to the Supreme Court.  A coalition which I head called "People's Agenda", we filed an amicus curae brief to support those three judges who said, on these three senate districts, you've, you've diluted too far.  The Supreme Court had said, well, you can have an influenced district.  You don't have to have majority all the time.  You can have influenced district and sent the case back to those three judges.  We don't know how it's gonna come out, but we are very disturbed about the court's definition of influence.  And we don't know what that means.  And they are saying you have enough blacks to influence the election, but you may not have enough to decide or to elect a black representative.  We think that's very, very nebulous, very, very unfair.  It's hard to define.  How do you define, define influence?  We want the law to stay as it is, and to, to insist on district that, that give blacks an equal opportunity to elect a black person.  The argument in the case which came strangely enough from a black attorney general, in Georgia, saying that we can have forty-four percent bottom.  We object to that strenuously, and we think the bottom has to be around fifty-four percent in order to give blacks an equal opportunity to elect a black representative.
Speaker 1: Now, you lost a rep here in Georgia recently because of cross-over voting in the primary, didn't you lose--?
Speaker 2: Well, there was, there was a congressional seat held by Cynthia McKinney that--the claim is that--and it's disputed, it's a disputed claim.  But we do know there was some crossover voting of white Republicans who wanted to defeat Cynthia McKinney because of her, what they consider radical stand on a number of issues.  One of them was the Middle East crisis where  the, her, her enemies charged that, that she was anti-Israel, and that therefore, that the Jewish vote and the white vote in that district ought to be leveled against her.  There were, there were crossovers.  A study is still being conducted to determine to what extend the Republican crossover may have served to defeat Cynthia, but she also had lost some support on the Democrat side as well.  Some of the African Americans had, had pulled back from supporting her, but I--she unquestionably got the majority of the black vote in that district, but the white voters, and it's claimed, Republicans who crossed over.  In this state, you do not have to register your party so that you, you, you can't vote in both primaries.  And if you vote in the Republican primary, you're supposed to vote the same way in the run--off.  Whether they can enforce that or not is another question.  But there is legislation pending now in the State legislature to call for registration.  So that if you register as a Republican, you have to vote in the Republican primary.  If you register as a Democrat, you have to vote in the Democratic primary.  Whether that'll pass or not is doubtful, but it's there.
Story_ID: 18532
Speaker 1: I want to go back a little bit to 1968 when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, where were you at the time when you heard about Dr. King's assassination?
Speaker 2: I was pastoring in Birmingham at that time.  Martin  had been to my house in March of '68 [1968].  We were preparing for the poor people's campaign, building up pilgrims to join in a, in a march to Washington on--mule trains were going from different places, buses were going.  And he was in Birmingham.  And we also, came by my house one evening in March was the last time I saw him alive.  And when he was shot, I was in Nashville, Tennessee.  I was living in Birmingham, scheduled to go to Memphis that weekend.  But I had to go to Nashville for a church-related meeting.  And I was to drive, but decided not to drive and to catch the train.  And I caught the train back to Birmingham, and I came back to the station--when I arrived in the station about 7:00 o'clock or something like that, seven or 8:00 o'clock, my wife and two of my children were waiting for me at the station.  And I saw this terrible sad look on her face.  And I knew something terrible had happened.  And when I got off the train, she told me that Martin had been shot and that the TV stations were trying to reach me to have me call for calm and that kind of thing.  But that's where I was.  And I later got on the phone to Memphis with [Rev.] Ralph [Abernathy], who was in Memphis and told him that he--I was chairman of the board then, that he must assume the responsibility of the presidency and that, to assure him that he had my support as chairman of the board to assume that office upon Martin's death.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you remember, of course, the tremendous anger and depression in the black community after the death of Dr. King and the subsequent, I guess, lack of confidence in SCLC and other black organizations on the part of a lot of black people, that felt that our one leader was, was, you know, had been destroyed, and that all we had.
Speaker 2: Well, that was, that's the--that's true.  That was--it is no question of what Martin represented, black leadership.  At that moment in history, he was the spokes person for the whole struggle to throw off the shackles and break the chains of racial segregation and racial discrimination.  The Movement was Southern-centered, and Martin led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference which headed the Movement and led the Movement.  And so he was the spokes person.  And so when he--he, he became the symbol of our resistance and insistence on social change.  And so when he died, it was a very severe blow.  That's the, the danger of, of putting everything on one leader, that they can knock him off, and then you're, you're in a quandry.  And so I think that we've moved toward the day when there are many leaders, in many fields.  And I think we probably have more leaders today than any other time in education, in the Congress, and with more than three hundred and some black mayors in his country, in addition to the civil rights and advocacy groups that have continued to serve.  So we have a proliferation of leadership so that if any one person is killed now, it does not, should not, would not have that same effect.
Story_ID: 18533
Speaker 1: Let's talk about a few of the high points of things that you've been involved in and done.  In 1975, you were involved in a march that was attacked by the Klan--.
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979], right.
Speaker 2: That was a young, African American boy named Tommy Lee Hines, teenager, chronologically, mentally, he was a minor, maybe eleven, twelve.  He was accused of raping two white women.  They had been raped and the case unsolved, and the pressure in the community was to solve it.  So the police arrested Tommie Lee Hines.  He was a mentally and emotionally challenged young man, in his teens.  But as I said, mentally challenged.  He couldn't ride a bike because he lacked the coordination between, you know, the motor control that he had, and yet he was accused of driving a car in, in raping these women.  So we were called to Decatur, Alabama to try to help him.  And we intervened and had marches and protest demonstrations.  And one day we were--he was convicted, but one day we were marching in protest in Decatur, and the news people came and said, we just heard the Klan over the radio, and they plan to kill you as president of SCLC.  They're gonna kill you when you're around the corner, downtown Decatur today in the march.  So we went in the church, and first of all, we asked everybody put their knives or anything they may have had, that looked like a weapon, put it in the box, and then come back and get it.  And then we prayed, and then we said we had to march, that this was a small town, and if they could intimidate me and keep us from marching, I mean black people would be hopeless in that community.  So we decided to march.  We called the highway patrol because the City of Decatur didn't have as many police officers, as we thought, thought the Klan might have there.  So--.
Speaker 1: Especially if some of them were actually in the Klan (laughter).
Speaker 2: And some maybe have dual membership.  So we called the highway patrol.  They said, they didn't know whether they could come or not because they didn't think it was an imminent danger.  And we told them what the news media folks had told us.  But they didn't give us any hope that they would come, and they did not come.  But we marched.  Usually my wife marches by my side, but on this occasion, because of that threat, I would not let her march.  I persuaded her to drive the car in the back of the march.  So she did.  So when we rounded the corner, surely enough, there were twenty, twenty-five, thirty or more hooded Klansmen waiting on us.  A shot rang out.  I heard bullets singing over my head.  And pandemonium broke loose.  Three young people were shot in the head.  Some young men who were marching with me just literally picked me up and carried me out of the line of fire.  My wife--that exposed the car.  When the marcher dispersed, my wife was in the car.  She saw the Klansmen, she saw one aim a pistol at her car.  She fell on the seat, glass shattered all over her.  She said, she stayed on the seat about five minutes--actually, it was about forty seconds, but (unclear) it seemed like it hour to her.  And she decided she wasn't gonna stay there.  She just got up and drove through the crowd and out of danger.  I kept telling the young men I had go back to see about my wife.  They wouldn't let me go back.  They carried me back into the black community.  And then I saw her coming in the car.  And I was greatly relieved.  But they shot the windshield out of her car, shot these three or four young people in the head.  We never could get law enforcement to do anything about it, claimed they couldn't identify the Klan, although we heard the Decatur police people call the names when they tried to intervene.  They were, "get back, Clem, don't, don't y'all do that."  They knew who they were.  But they overwhelmed the police department and us and shot these four young people.  And, but later on the Southern Poverty Law Center--none of those kids died, thank God.  The Southern Poverty Law Center and some of their staff infiltrated the Klan up there in North Alabama--.
Speaker 1: That's Morris Dee's--.
Speaker 2: Yes, they, they fil-infiltrated the Klan, and, and then used the evidence they gathered to, to force the Justice Department to bring them to court.  And they were convicted, four--five or six of them were convicted--more than that, about seven or eight were convicted.  They either had to go to jail or pay a fine and this sort of thing.  Well, we really had no desire to see them bankrupt and their families become destitute, and so the lawyers came up with a scheme.  They recommended to the judge to offer the Klan an opportunity to either take a, a one-day course in human--race relations from me or go to jail.  And five of them chose to take the course.  One of them said he'd go to jail because to take a course under me would be cruel and unusual punishment.  So he, he opted out and would not take the class.  But we did hold the class.  Three of the Klansmen denounced the Klan after the class and said they recognized from our discussion that they were being used and so forth.  One of them was silent.  The other one who was the Grand Cyclops of the Klan or whatever you call it, he said, it was a waste of time.  I've not changed my mind or anything because he made money from the thing.  But that was an interesting experience.  And one of the--I lost friends with Oprah and some other people because I would not agree to let them tape the session because I felt that it--with cameras in the room, that the Klan would have just, you know, they would have, they would have exploited that situation.  We would of got nothing constructive, no decent discussions.  They would have taken advantage of the cameras.  And so I would not agree to it.  And I agreed to interviews afterwards.  Only one of the Klansmen agreed to an interview, who lived in Huntsville, my hometown.  And later he, he agreed to CBS, and before--the day before the interview was scheduled, he called me and told me he was not going to do it, that he decided he did not want his children to see him and know that he had been a Klan.  So he declined.  So none of them would give interviews.  And that was the end.  But it was a very interesting experience--experience, and the Klansmen were, many of them were surprised to learn that their leaders made money off being Klansmen and, you know, they raised funds and using it for their own personal gain.
Speaker 1: So that was part of your message to them, that--?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a, that was the workshop.  One was--I started out from a theological and religious basis, the oneness of the human family, that we're all one and that this color thing was an accident of birth and that when we're pricked, we all would bleed and the blood would look the same, and that our hopes and aspirations were similar.  We just had different economic backgrounds, different racial background, different cultural backgrounds.  I talked about the oneness of the human family.  And then from that level of discussion, into the thing about the realities of what the Klan was about; what hate does to you, how it destroys you and how the leaders of the Klan were exploiting them and using their hatred, their bias to fill their coffers to raise money and to get attention and so forth and so on.  And they recognized that.  And then that, that was the end of that, that Klan in that section of, of the, of the country.  We marched, incidentally, after they shot us up that day, we did march.  We had to march about a week later.  We had about ten thousand people joined us in the march, and the Klan was back, and but, the police separated us.  And the Wizard, the Grand Wizard was there, and I met him in the airport after the march, and he shook my hand (laughter).  Well, that was the end of that Klan.  And incidentally, it turned out that that Grand Wizard was an informer for the FBI, which is part of the thing we, we used in the class later to tell them about the hypocrisy of the leaders of the Klan.  And, and that's why those three fellows said they were through with it.  They would not be used any more.

Speaker 1: Speaking of the FBI, now, you conducted a workshop for William Sessions of the FBI too.  What was that about?
Speaker 2: Yes, Mr. Sessions came to me, and he said he had, had asked five people around the country to suggest somebody to lead a workshop for the, for Klan leadership.  He wanted somebody who would tell it like it was and blah, blah, blah.  And he said ,"Four of the people named you.  He said, "so you're it.  We want you to come to, to Virginia Beach, where we've having a retreat and meet with fifty of the top Klan--FBI officials in the country.  And we want a discussion of how the FBI can change it's image in the black community."  And we had an interesting--we had an all-day session, and I think I got off to a rough start with--cause I suggested the first thing the FBI ought to do is change the name of the J. Edgar Hoover Building.  I thought that would be a gesture of, of goodwill to show that they meant to be a new FBI.  Well, that shocked them because many of those fellows in there were old, career guys who worked under J. Edgar Hoover, and that didn't set too well with them.  But we had an interesting discussion.  They didn't know--they claimed they didn't know about COINTELPRO, which was the code name for the program they had to, to, to kill the credibility of black leaders around the country,--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Counter Intelligence Program.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's exactly what it was.  And, and they claimed--Mr. Sessions claimed he didn't know about it.  He may not have.  But the, the old vets, the old pro's knew about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's something that's well documented now.  In the papers, you can buy them in the bookstore now and read them.
Speaker 2: No question.  And one of the youngest of the FBI regional leaders who was in that meeting came to me privately afterwards, and he said, it was a great meeting.  He said, but I'll tell you what, Sessions will not survive it.  He will not survive this.  Those old guys will not let him survive subjecting them to that kind of an experience, and especially after you suggested the name of the J. Edgar Hoover Building be changed.  He said, Sessions will not survive.  It wasn't long after that, as you recall, Mr. Sessions did not survive.  They got him.

Speaker 1: Tell me about your involvement in the struggle to free South Africa.  You were involved in the, in trying to change the focus of an organization Southern Company, that did a, that had a coal contract with South Africa--.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  They had, they had a--we had two encount--two major encounters around South Africa.  One was with a grocery chain, that the women discovered and that was selling South African products, some frozen and canned products from South Africa when we were in the midst of the sanctions against South Africa.  And the other one was against the Southern Company.  Right after I became president in 1977, the Southern Company entered a contract with South Africa for ten million tons of coal.  And when we approached them and asked them to cancel it because we were boycotting South Africa, because of their apartheid policies, their response was that they were buying it because it had a low sulfur content, and therefore, you know, didn't pollute the environment as much as the regular coal was.  But we, we, we ins-instituted several demonstrations against the Southern Company, at their stockholders' meeting, at different places in Mississippi and Birmingham and around the country.  Eventually, they, the contract was, was cancelled and the sanctions were, and the sanctions were congressionally imposed.  The other (unclear) oppon--was against Winn-Dixie [grocery store chain], where the women discovered that Southern, South African products, frozen foods, fish and canned goods were coming from South Africa.  So we initiated a boycott against Winn-Dixie across the South.  They had about thirteen hundred stores across the South.  We initiated a boycott that lasted several months, probably about three or four months, very intensive boycott.  And they capitulated in January, after several arrests in several cities where we picketed them against their selling those South African products.  They wouldn't tell us that they had taken the products out.  They took out a whole page ad in the country--they spent about fifty thousand dollars.  They could have given us that money to help with our programs and sent us letter (laughter), but they wouldn't do it.  But we did force them to take those South African products out of their stores, and eventually, the Southern Company cancelled the contract for coal with South Africa.  They, they said it had low sulfur content.  We said, it may have low sulfur, but it has high blood, our brothers and sisters blood on this coal that's mined at slave wages and under slave conditions in South Africa.

Speaker 1: It seems like that's the, one of the staple qualities or the cardinal qualities of somebody who's gonna be a civil rights leader, to be able to cut the issue so people can understand what the issue is, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, that's, that's always a challenge.  When, when you have simple, concrete issues to deal with, it's the back of the bus, the lunch counter, the South African products, apartheid, oppression, slave wages, but when you get down to the tax cuts and the elimination of services for the poor, these are more difficult issues.  We're talking systemic issues that are not, are not sound bite issues.  And, and, and that's more difficult to get people organized and mobilized around, although the effects are just as devastating, but the challenge is to find ways to get people to do this.  I think in the present day, we're at, we're--you had me give the date here so people know when this is being done in August of 2003, that this country now is on a perilous course in its foreign policy.  We have moved from a protector to a preemptive predator in our foreign policy.  We're, rather than defending, we're invading, and we are witnessing the death of American military personnel every day in Iraq, and we're counting them.  We're also killing Iraqi's every day, and we're not bothering to count them.  But this is a serious transition of what America was and what America's supposed to be and what America actually is now, under a new level--a new foreign policy.  Domestically, our economy is, is in ruins, more bankruptcies, more bankruptcies are occurring every day.  So I think we're beginning at, at the extreme end of this, this kind of, of philosophy and, and economic policies to see plainly, as we did earlier, when the back of the bus.  We're gonna find ourselves on the bottom of the pile economically, bankruptcies, children having to drop out of schools.  People are, are losing their jobs, they're losing their homes.  I think it's becoming plain and simple now, once again, it was earlier, and people will be able to resist in a more effective manner.  People will be easier to organize I think, as, as we come down to wherever this nation is going.  The stacking of our judiciary.  That's not as simple as, as the back of the bus, but continuing to put people on the, the Supreme Court and the federal bench where they're there for life, who are right-wing analogues, that want to turn back the clock, this will become visible, and too late, I'm afraid.  So we've got to find a way to, to help people understand the, the more complex issues of today.  They were very simple and plain and visible in the '60's [1960s], but not so now, but just as devastating if not more devastating.
Story_ID: 18537
Speaker 1: What are some of your other hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was asked--we're, we're forty years from the March on Washington.  And the March on Washington produced the '64 [1964] Public Accommodations Act, the '65 [1965] Voting Rights Act, and a, and a, a new agenda for America.  It made poverty and racism visible, put it on the agenda.  I think now, we need a new birth of spirituality to begin with.  I think one--the power of the Movement in those days was that it was morally anchored.  It was spiritually based.  It was not simply a political issue.  And it was a political issue grounded in a moral issue so that it had the force of, of, of the spirit behind it.  I think we've got to have a new birth of spirituality.  I think that black folks, like the rest of society, we have deserted the good spouse of spirituality.  And we're shacking up with the prostitute of materialism and greed.  That's incestuous affair that produces off springs with congenital defects like racism, sexism, greed, materialism, apathy toward critical issues, a, a turning away from the common good to seek personal and selfish gains.  Me and my wife, my son, John, and his wife, us four, no more; we're gonna try to do well.  The rest of yawl can go to--some place down there.  It begins with an "H".  So, so we've got to have a new birth of spirituality.  We've got to stop looking for this magic, giant leader that's gonna come, this twelve-foot tall, black dude, riding a black horse, wearing black shining armor, and waving a magic black wand, making every black instantly wealthy, wealthy and wise.  He ain't coming.  His grandmother hasn't been born, won't be.  We've got to learn to organize at local levels and, and, and directing efforts towards national goals and objectives.  And we've got to have at least those things to, to, to renew the movement and, and, and transform this country.  We must be again the saving force of this country.  I think that militarism--and [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] said it, thirty-some, forty years ago, "materialism, racism, militarism".  Dwight Eisenhower said it, the military, industrial complex is a great threat to our democracy.  It has come to past.  We are, we are, we are experiencing the most right-winged, ultra reactionary administration in my lifetime.  And I think it--that we must sound the alarm, and we must--I think we're beginning--I noticed the other day that a fine, young lawyer from Atlanta is resigning his post of deputy attorney general.  And I think he's had all of Mr. Ashcroft he can stand.  And I heard rumors that Colin Powell is leaving.  I shouted for joy, only to find out the next day that they might not be true.  Condoleezza [Rice] isn't gonna leave.  She's, I think she's a female hawk, even though she grew up in Birmingham.  She had the audacity the other day to compare what's happening in Iraq to, to the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham.  I don't know how in the world a brilliant scholar who speaks several languages like Condoleezza Rice could make that kind of analogy, but she did.  But I think that the election in 2004 is the most critical election in American history.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you see, in terms of the candidates and what they're about, what do you see as a hope, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think this may be one election where people are forced to look at issues rather than personality.  And maybe that's got to be it, because I, I don't know that there's coming a personality.  Maybe one will evolve by the time we get around to election time.  But right now, I think people are being forced to examine the issues and to look at who embraces issues that  liber--that will liberate us from, I think, a perilous future, a devastating future.  And, and, and I just, I just--I'm not gonna call names.  The most exciting two candidates that I know are not running.  One is Al Gore.  I think, I think if Al Gore ran, we could take a theme like re-elect Gore.  This time we'll inaugurate him (laughs), you know, cause we elected him before (laughs).  It's just that this stupid electoral system we have and the Supreme Court violated its commitment to states' rights and overruled the state supreme court.  But, and another man is a general that, Wesley Clark, seems like a bright prospect, as well as one or two people in the, in--who are announced candidates.  I'm, I'm surprised at what's happening to Governor Dean, at the support he has.  I don't know if, if it can last or not, but I do think that by the time of the election--I hope and pray, that we will have seen through what this administration is all about.  We've been misled into, into a predatory, preemptive striking, invading nation, on a foreign level, and to a terrible economic decline on the domestic scene.  And I hope the people will, the people of this country will--and I'm neither Democrat nor Republican.  I'm Methodist, Baptist, but I just think that we are headed toward a--we're, we're in a turbulence, but I, we're headed toward a, toward a deep tunnel of turbulence that, that will be devastating for our future.

Speaker 1: Just going back to spirituality for a minute, today we see this tremendous growth in mega churches with black people and white people on a level.  And it seems particularly pervasive in the black community, huge churches, people, you know, packing these churches, and they're with--that seem to have an emphasis on acquisition and God's ability to help you acquire resources.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I, I don't want to be critical of that, except one thing does bother me, that I don't hear the holistic gospel.  I don't see the holistic ministry that we've had before, that is, ministering to the whole person, not just charity, but love.  Charity is seasonable.  Love is eternal.  Charity speaks to one aspect; love, to the total aspect of life.  Love embraces justice.  Charity can, can tolerate injustice.  Love cannot.  And I miss from the, the so-called mega-churches and that movement, I miss the, the justice aspect.  I, I, I want to make heaven my home, but I want to see my home here heavenly, as well.  That includes justice and it includes an end to, to disparities.  It includes an end to the wholesaling of our people to jails.  In Georgia, blacks are thirty percent of the population, but seventy percent of the prisoners.  And most of them had no defense, and certainly inadequate defense.  Indigent, poor folk can't afford lawyers, and the state's not providing them as the Constitution provides.  So I think that's the kind of thing people have got to wake up to and, and let justice roar down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
Story_ID: 18539
Speaker 1: You knew Nelson Mandela, and you participated in the Free South African Movement at a high level, and you were his host when he came to Atlanta.  And you knew two great leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Nelson Mandela.  Can you compare the two?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they had similar roles, but very different personalities.  Nelson Mandela is a great figure in history.  There's no question about it.  I guess he was more spiritual than we thought.  Martin was a preacher, so we expected his spirituality to be at a high level.  But Nelson Mandela--it occurred to me when he came out of prison that day with his head high, the, the essence and quintessence of, of manhood, particularly, African manhood.  He was not bitter, had every right to be bitter after twenty-seven years of, of imprisonment without crime, without guilt.  And yet he, he was positive.  He, he remained full of good will.  I, I didn't see, I, I never--I talked with him and never saw hatred; hatred for the philosophy of apartheid and the practice, but not for the people.  ANC was forced to embrace violence.  I think they, they tried to be nonviolent.  I'm trying to think of the guy who received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Speaker 1: Bishop [Desmond] Tutu?
Speaker 2: No, before him.
Speaker 1: Luthuli.
Speaker 2: Luthuli, Albert Luthuli, and that, and the ANC for a long time after that tried to be nonviolent, but one of the things necessary--of course, I think, I wish they had continued, but, but there has to be conscious to which you can appeal to be effective in nonviolence.  There was no conscious in South Africa.  We had--in this country, we had a conscious and a constitution.  In South Africa, they had no conscious and the constitution was against them.  So we had the--so, so that Mandela and, and his--they, they, they finally committed acts of violence, but never against people; always against things, against buildings; against munitions installations and that sort of thing.  But Mandela was patient, long suffering, visionary and all of those things, I think he had in common with Martin.  I think that religion might have been the, the, the one, one distinguishing factor is that Martin religious.  He was a preacher.  Mandela was, was ethical and moral, but not necessarily as religious as a Martin Luther King.  But both were great spirits.  Both, both were inspiring figures.  Both had a great deal of influence because of their personal sacrifice, Martin's death, Martin was a martyr.  His martyr--martyrdom was death, Mandela's was imprisonment.  They had many, many things in common, and yet there was--there were distinguishing factors that I think made them individuals in their right; both great figures.  I feel blessed to have, to have to known them both.  Martin was--I knew Martin much better for a much longer period of time.  He was, he was--I think God was in both plans because I'm sure anybody else could have stayed in prison and been the inspiring motivating figure that Mandela was for all the time he was in prison.  I'm not sure anybody else could have been in Montgomery at that time, and been as effective as Martin.  Martin was the man, both by his training, by his disposition, by his personality, by his commitment to nonviolence, by his articulate abilities, and Montgomery was perfect, both by its geographics and it's demographics.  So that the, the men are, have parallel histories and, and similarities.  And yet they're both distinct figures in our history, both great men.
Story_ID: 18540
Speaker 1: The concept of being religious and spiritual or having inner strength and if you have to be religious to have that inner strength or not, when I think about people like Bob Moses or Ella Baker who weren't religious but seemed to be very strong and some would say spiritual people--.
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think spirituality is at its best when it embraces some expression faith and discipline of faith.  But I think you can be spiritual without actually being religious in the terms of organized religion.  I think your spirituality is a part of your relationship to the creator, which puts us in the context of religion, but it's not organized religion.  It doesn't have to be organized religion.  I think that spirituality is a bigger term.  It, it--it, it allows more versatility and diversity than religion.  So I, I--but I think it includes, it can include religion, although I think there are some people who, who act like they're religious without being spiritual.  I call that religiosity and piousity rather than religion and piety.
Story_ID: 18541
Speaker 1: You've received numerous awards and accolades, and you're seen as one of the surviving elders of the Civil Rights Movements.  What do you see yourself right now as your legacy?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I, I guess I would like to be remembered as a preacher who tried his best to apply the moral imperatives and to help people apply the moral imperatives of the faith to the practical problems of our time, that being loving is being a good neighbor, is being a good citizen, is being a good Samaritan to whoever needs your help, irrespective of race, color or creed; that being faithful is, is not letting people make you compromise on principle for what you believe in, in terms of justice and righteousness and parity.  I, I'd like to be remembered as a preacher who tried to, to preach that kind of a gospel, and to practice it in his leadership and in his, and in his life.  I don't think you can be loving without being just.  I don't think you can be faithful without refusing to compromise on your principles regarding justice and morality and equity.  And I like equity better than equality because equity has a dollar side in it and people understand equity.  People get confused with equality.  They want to mix it up with intermarriage and all that mess.  Equity is pretty clear, and like the man who made rabbit sausage, you know, he ran out of rabbits.  And he, he started using horses.  And the, the, the federal, feds got on him and said, you're misleading.  He said, nah, says, it's equal.  He said, well, if it's equal, we might let you get by, but we understand it's, it's really horse sausage, not rabbit.  He said, nah, it's equal.  They said, what do you mean it's equal?  Said, every time I put in one rabbit, I put in one horse (laughter).  It's equal (laughs), you see.  Well, it, it may be equal, but it ain't equitable, and so I like the equity part of justice, just--and when people talk about diversity, I want them to include equity and justice in the, in the principle of diversity.  So I hope that, that I could be remembered as a preacher who preached truth to power in terms of equity and justice and love and human dignity, a small-town preacher who, who the big city tolerated (laughs).
