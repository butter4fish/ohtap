Speaker 1: Good afternoon.  I'm Cheryl Butler (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hi.
Speaker 1: I'll be conducting the interview today for this HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview.  We're also joined by Matthew Hickey who is the videographer.  I'm gonna have you say your full name and spell it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My name, Sandra Elizabeth Fortune-Green [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green].  Sandra, S-A-N-D-R-A, Elizabeth, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Fortune, F-O-R-T-U-N-E, Green, G-R-E-E-N.
Speaker 1: Where were you born and when?
Speaker 2: I was born in Washington, D.C., on March the 2nd, 1951.
Speaker 1: And where are we holding this interview today?
Speaker 2: We're holding this interview at the Jones-Haywood School of Ballet, which has recently been changed to the Jones-Haywood school of dance [Jones-Haywood Dance School].
Speaker 1: In which city?
Speaker 2: In Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is Sunday, September the 23rd, 2007.
Story_ID: 579942
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you a few questions just to get you in the mood.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: People magazine style questions.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Wow, let's see.  Actually my favorite color is black.  Can you imagine?  It used to be red, but it changes when I change.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yogurt.  I love yogurt.  Combinations of yogurt and strawberry, combinations of yogurt and oatmeal, wonderful.  No milk, no sugar, just oatmeal and yogurt mixed together (laughter).
Speaker 1: What's your favorite season?
Speaker 2: Summertime.  I love outdoors; I love gardening.  I love to go swimming, I love to go walking.  I adore all of the summer annuals.  I love summertime.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anything that deals with the ocean.  I'll go anywhere if it has an ocean (laughter).
Speaker 1: What about a favorite saying or quote?
Speaker 2: My new favorite quote is: "The greatest reward comes from the greatest commitment," [Arlene Blum].  None of those--those are not my words, though.  I read that in some leadership book and I have fallen in love with that, because I believe that that has been my life.  Because if I'm gonna do something, I do it at 100 percent.  And it's not always the easiest effort, but I keep, I keep at it.  So I, I have adapted those words from somebody else.
Story_ID: 579943
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk a little bit about your family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother.  What's her name, when was she born?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name is Elizabeth Davis Fortune Beeler Speed [Elizabeth Davis Speed].  My mother was married three times.
Speaker 1: Can you spell, I understand Davis Fortune, Beeler Speed?
Speaker 2: Beeler is B-E-E-L-E-R.  Speed, S-P-E-E-D.
Speaker 1: And she was married three times?
Speaker 2: Yes she was.  The third time around when she said to me that she was gonna be marrying Calvin Speed.  I looked at her like have you lost your mind?  But she did it anyway, so.
Speaker 1: When was your mother born and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Gee, what year was my mother born?  I can't remember, but she was born in Washington, D.C.  She just recently had a birthday this past July 18th, so she probably would have been like seventy-five-ish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she come from a big family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was one of five girls.  She was the oldest girl, and they were called the Davis girls.  And sometimes when my aunts and my cousins are talking to us, they will--my mother would--used to always say to us that everybody wanted to be a Davis girl.  And I can only imagine what that meant at that time, based on who my aunts were as adults, as I was, as I observed them as a young child.
Speaker 1: What do you think that meant?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it meant always doing fun things, very popular, a lot of laughter, a lot of pomp and circumstance and just fun.  Because I was the first grandchild, my mother's four younger sisters, they all took care of me, and we had a ball.  We had such fun.  And so I would imagine that that's what that meant when they were young.
Speaker 1: Were the Davis girls pretty girls and smart girls?
Speaker 2: Well I thought they were of course (laughter).  I thought they were.
Story_ID: 579944
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your mother's [Elizabeth Davis Speed] family, your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My grandmother, her name was Lucille Davis, and my grandfather was Coley Davis.  My grandmother was a domestic worker, and my grandfather worked on the railroad.
Speaker 1: Do you know when they were born and where?
Speaker 2: They were both born in Virginia.  I don't know the year that they were born.  My grandparents never talked about any of their stories.  Even to this day, and both of my grandparents are deceased, we don't know any of their stories, per se.  I can imagine perhaps based on the year that they were born, but nothing specific about how they were as children and what they did.  I know my grandmother used to always say that she was a very sensitive child and that she cried a lot.  But other than that--and she, she also said that she didn't like to get her hair combed because she had real long hair and she was very tender headed.  And when it was time to get her hair braided, it was a situation (laughter).
Speaker 1: And she was a domestic worker?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She, she took care of a family that had a young girl and an older son.  And I can remember going with my grandfather to pick her up from work in the evenings, because my summers as a child were spent with my grandparents.
Speaker 1: In Virginia.
Speaker 2: No, in Washington, D.C.  They, they lived in Northeast, Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: So they were born in Virginia and moved to D.C. (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother, did she care for a white family?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  The last name was Jones [ph.] I believe, yeah.  She cared for a white family.
Speaker 1: And did she discuss how she was treated?
Speaker 2: No, no she didn't.  There was--the younger child's name was Emily [ph.].  And Emily adored my grandmother, and that's the beginning and the end of that story as far as we were told.
Speaker 1: Did your grandfather ever speak about work on the railroad?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.  It was--those stories--and it's interesting because some of my cousins when we're all together, we're still pondering as to why they never shared their stories with us.  And which brings me to another point.  In the '50s [1950s] when I was a young child, I did not even know that there were certain places in Washington, D.C. that I could not go to as a black child, because it was not ever discussed.  I thought that I could go and do anything that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: And that was because of the silence in the family about race (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The silence, the silence in the family.  I had no idea.  And when I think about that as old as I am now, like I said when our cousins, my cousins and I are together, we're still pondering well why was that?  Because none of us--we thought we could just walk into Garfinckel's [Washington, D.C.] and buy whatever we wanted to buy.  It just was not a conversation.
Speaker 1: And your grandparents were born sometime around the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Probably.  Let me see.  I believe my grandmother would be, let's see 93, 94, 95, 96.  I believe today she probably would be around 97 years old, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 579945
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about her [Fortune-Green's maternal grandmother, Lucille Davis] mother and father?
Speaker 2: I know about her mother.  Her name was Mary Love Williams [ph.].  I don't--I never knew her father.
Speaker 1: Do you know what her profession was?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  I really don't.  Other than the fact that she used to take, help take care of us.  In the summer times when I would go to my grandparents' house [in Virginia], they would both be at work.  But my great-grandmother, my grandmother's mother, Mary Love, would be home.  And she was the caretaker for the working hours of the day.  And she prepared our meals and we could go outside--couldn't leave the yard, though.  And then when it was time to come in for lunch, and then we would take a bath, take a nap.  And then by the time my grandparents got home, we were up and dressed, and then dinner was being prepared.  And then we had family time on the front porch.  And then it was time to go to bed again, and that was pretty much the regime.
Speaker 1: What about your grandfather's [Coley Davis] parents, your maternal grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know anything about his pa- my grandfather's parents.
Story_ID: 579946
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father, his name and--
Speaker 2: Raymond Fortune [ph.].
Speaker 1: Where was he born and when (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was born also in Washington, D.C., and he joined the [U.S.] military right after high school.
Speaker 1: The [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he serve in any wars?
Speaker 2: He was there I think--I think he was there for three years.  He was, he, he was there for three years.
Speaker 1: In one of the wars?
Speaker 2: So that was, let's see 1950.  What war was that?
Speaker 1: Well it was before Korea [Korean War] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before Korea, yeah.  Another untold story about his experiences in the war, or in the military per se.
Speaker 1: There's another story?
Speaker 2: No, another untold, untold story (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Untold story, silence.
Speaker 2: Silence.  And then shortly after he returned from the military, then, then they were divorced.  I was still very young at that time.  In fact, I do remember when my father got remarried.  And I remember talking to my cousin, asking her, her name was Joyce [ph.], "Well what do I call her?"  And so my cousin said, "Well she's not your mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed], so you call her by her name."  And consequently, my stepmother's first name was also Elizabeth [ph.].  So there were two Elizabeth Fortunes, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how old were you when your dad remarried?
Speaker 2: I was about maybe five.  Old enough to know that this, this new female presence in my life was not my mother.  And here again, another conversation not told.  So you go to your immediate peers to find answers.  And so that's--I went to my cousin who was two years older than me, she's seven, I'm five.  Now what does she know?  So I say to her, "Well Joyce what do I call her?"  And she says very, very clearly, "Well she's, she's not your mother 'cause that's Aunt Liz.  So you call her by her name."  A seven year old, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And your father's profession?
Speaker 2: He was an automobile mechanic.  He--when he was remarried, he was the manager of a Sunoco [Sun Oil Company; Sunoco] automo- gas station in Bronx, New York.  Because his Elizabeth Fortune wife was a New Yorker, so he moved to New York.  And he was manager, owner of a Sonoco gas station.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell me about his parents?
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you that his father's name was Alfonso Fortune [ph.].  I never knew my grandmother on my father's side.  She died when my father was a teenager, actually, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Story_ID: 579947
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let's talk about your childhood.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Let's see.  Well clearly I remember when my father [Raymond Fortune (ph.)] got remarried.  I remember that.  And then I also--and then by that time my mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] had gotten remarried to Samuel Beeler [ph.].  And here again, another silence because you don't know what to call all these people.  So I called him Sam.  And shortly after they were married, then I had two other brothers on the way, Curtis [Curtis Beeler] and Michael Beeler.  And I can remember, I can remember thinking how my life was going to be when I was twenty years old.  I used to play apartment.  And my, my bedroom was my apartment.  And I remember thinking what kind of job I had, and I was gonna have a car and work, and all of these things I was gonna be able to do.
Speaker 1: What kind of job did you imagine?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was going to be a doctor.  And--but this was all in my imagination, because this is what I was going to be by the time I was twenty years old.  And I would close the door in my room, because that was my apartment, and I would just, I would just play out the, the thoughts in my head.  And then my brothers, they were also a part of this play as well.  And they would knock on the door and they would say, "This is the mailman, we have packages or Ms. Sandra Elizabeth Fortune [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green]," and, and I would open the door like I was twenty years old and it was all in my mind.  So I remember that.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: You had an active imagination.
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to think that I did, but I remember how I was going to be when I was twenty years old.  Now of course we know what we all are at twenty years old, as we get to be twenty.  We don't have a clue about most things, so that was kind of interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, tell me about even earlier, 'cause your dad got divorced when you were five.  Do you remember life inside the home with your parents while they were together?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I don't remember life inside the home with my parents because he was gone.  That whole transition is, is, is very, very, very fuzzy.  But I clearly remember his return and this new presence.  This second lady named Elizabeth Fortune [ph.].  So, so, so all of the transitions, all the connecting pieces, I probably was removed from the transition.  And it's interesting because my mother's younger sister to this day, to this very day, still will not discuss those missing pieces with me.  She still won't, and I think it, I think it just depicted the era where everybody was closed mouthed.  Because my cousins and I to this very same day, there are pieces missing and we can't seem to, to bridge or connect because there's information missing with the grandparents deceased, parents deceased.  And my mother's younger sister, she has all the pieces, but she is still true to her mission of whatever that was.
Story_ID: 579948
Speaker 1: Now you lived with your mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your neighborhood in Washington [D.C.].  Tell me about the sights, smells and sounds of that neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I lived at 535 Buchanan Street, which is about a ten minute walk from this dance school.  And we lived in a row house.  My--I had my own room and my other two brothers [Curtis Beeler and Michael Beeler] had their own room.  We had lots of kids on the block.  And I was, I walked home from school and I used to let myself in.  And then shortly thereafter, my brothers would come in and I would go outside.  I mean we played kickball, we jumped double dutch, we, we played outdoor games that you see no children play today.  And so then one day my mother said this coming home from school thing, we need to, we need to fill in that space.  And that was how I came to dance at the Jones-Haywood School of Ballet [Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.].  And so when I came home from school, I would walk home from school, get a little snack, freshen up a little bit, and walk to class.
Speaker 1: And what school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So she filled--I went to Barnard Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], which was in walking distance.  And I've been coming to this building ever since for one reason or another.  I didn't wanna come because I wanted to stay home with my friends.  And so then eventually I had another whole peer group.  It was the peer group that came to this school.  And I was soon isolated from the peer group in my neighborhood.  That was a very awkward transition.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about the peer group in your neighborhood.  Who were your friends?
Speaker 2: I had, I had a friend named Linda Harvey [ph.] whose daughter comes to this school now.  I had a friend named Katy Gordon [ph.].  I had a friend named Brenda Baumgartner [ph.], Deborah Baumgartner [ph.], they were sisters--Sheila Joy [ph.].
Speaker 1: And they would play games outside with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we played kickball in the alley every day after school.
Speaker 1: Were you pretty athletic?
Speaker 2: Yeah, without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Give me a sense of your athleticism at this young age.
Speaker 2: I was quick, I could run, I could change directions fast.  I was well coordinated.  And I was excited.  I had a high level of intensity from a, from a physical point of view.  In the summers my cousins and I walked to Takoma Pool [Takoma Aquatic Center, Washington, D.C.] and stayed there until 9:00 at night.  Those were the days that you could do that.  And then we would walk home.  So those were my summers.
Story_ID: 579949
Speaker 1: And you lived--was it a--you mentioned earlier that you weren't necessarily conscious of segregation.
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was this a, a black neighborhood [in Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  This was a black neighborhood.  But when I was a child, when I used to go to my [maternal] grandparents' [Lucille Davis and Coley Davis] house in the summertime.  Now I'm a little older.  But as a kid, I had no clue that we couldn't go to certain pools in the neighborhood at that time.  This was in the early '50s [1950s] at that time that I had no clue.
Speaker 1: So tell me which institutions you could attend and which ones you could not.
Speaker 2: Well I didn't really know, you know.  It was my assumption that when I, when we went downtown to go shopping, that there were certain stores that we couldn't go into.  Garfinckel's [Washington, D.C.] was one of them.
Speaker 1: How did you know you couldn't go into Garfinckel's?
Speaker 2: As I, as I was told later.  At the time I didn't know.  But I was always with my grandmother, so she was well aware of where we couldn't go.  We couldn't go to certain movie theaters, and if we did, we had to sit in the balcony, but, but you don't know the reasons why.  You just go in and go to where you're told to sit.  Now I, I can remember the first time I ever saw a water fountain that said colored only, and that was in Culpeper, Virginia.  And at that time, we used to go to Culpeper, Virginia with my mother's [Elizabeth Davis Speed] second husband, Samuel Beeler [ph.].  So summers were spent down there.  And we went to the drive-in movie theater, and that was the first time I ever saw a water fountain with a sign.
Story_ID: 579950
Speaker 1: And at school, you went to a colored school as well.
Speaker 2: I went to a public school, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it was, it was a black school?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How were your teachers?
Speaker 2: They were okay.  We didn't--it was a predominant, it was a predominantly black school, and we had some white teachers.  There were, there were no incidents that I can retrieve that I felt were unfair or not correct.  I was a member of the honor society during that time.  So I was getting--and I was in the, I was in the first track, because at that time, you know you had the tracking system.  So I was in the top track, whatever that means today.  So--
Speaker 1: You excelled at which disciplines?
Speaker 2: You know actually when I was in high school, it was interesting, I was doing very well in foreign language.  I was doing very well.  And the Spanish teacher that I had, Ms. Lois Carol [ph.], actually sent me the plant that's on the table up there with a card that said, "Congratulations on your new adventure.  Your Spanish teacher from Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]."  So I go home and pull out my yearbook and look her up.  And lo and behold, that's who she is, she's about eighty-five years old now.  And she remembered me as a student, (shrugs) so.
Story_ID: 579951
Speaker 1: Tell me about this picnic in Culpeper, Virginia.
Speaker 2: It was j- it was just a picnic.  I mean the one thing that my family does, is they have these gatherings, and it's all centered around: well what are we gonna eat?  And I saw my stepmother, my father's second wife, the second Elizabeth Fortune.  And we were just all there.  Which brings me to the last family event.  It was Thanksgiving and it was at my house, circa 19--maybe, oh maybe it was around the early '80s [1980s].  Thanksgiving dinner at my house.  It was my father [Raymond Fortune (ph.)] and his second wife [Elizabeth Fortune (ph.)], my mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] and her third husband [Calvin Speed], my stepfather and his third wife.  They're all sitting at my dining room table, and we are having Thanksgiving dinner.  And I look around and I say to my younger brother Curtis [Curtis Beeler], I said, "Something is definitely wrong with this picture."  And he says, "Well, yeah but at least everybody is getting along fine," and, and it was a wonderful, wonderful dinner.
Speaker 1: Nice.  And so did everybody get along fine from the start?  You mentioned one early memory was seeing the second Elizabeth the first time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everybody always said when my father and my mother got divorced, he still came to my grandparents' house, and he still took my mother's sisters out.  Every--any time one of my mother's sisters needed some money, he was always there.  He was really just like a brother that lasted throughout his life.  It, it was amazing.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your mother's second husband, Sam Beeler?
Speaker 2: Samuel Beeler [ph.], he is still living.
Speaker 1: Now back then--
Speaker 2: Back then.
Speaker 1: What was your earliest memory with him?
Speaker 2: Well my earliest memory with him was that he was not gonna tell me what to do.  I was not a very nice child.  I had this thing about people telling me what to do.  And I just, I just didn't like anybody to tell me what to do.  But he was, he, he was a good man.  I mean he, he wasn't trying to tell me what to do.  It, it was almost like I was creating something just in case he tried.  And I was a good kid.  I mean I, I already knew what I should and should not do, but maybe that was just a way that showed some kind of resentment, you know.  An unspoken kind of well I don't really like this situation, so I'm just gonna make sure that he doesn't tell me what to do.  That was my first memory of him.  But he was--as I let my guard down and humbled myself to the point of accepting this new relationship with my mother, and once I realized that he was excellent in math.  I was getting A's in geometry like you wouldn't believe because of his help.  And so then I let my guard down a little bit because it was more of his instruction more so than the teacher's instruction that gave me elevated grades in math.
Speaker 1: So it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So then I was okay, then I was okay with that then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was almost like, it was almost like he had to give me something in return.  And once I realized what he had that I needed, then I was okay with that.
Speaker 1: And do you remember holidays with both sets of parents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  We--the grandmothers [sic. maternal grandparents], the Lucille [Lucille Davis] and Coley Davis, that was like, that was like the centering place.  And, and since my mother had four sisters, there were fifteen grandchildren.  So that was the place and everybody came.  It didn't matter who your significant other was.  Everybody came, everybody was invited.  There was a gift for everybody, the stepchildren, the half-children, the whatever, whatever, whatever.  And that's just how it was.  And it was, you know, it was okay.  Once you understand the dichotomy, you know it, it, it worked out fine, you know.  When my mother died, my--Samuel Beeler, her second husband, married to Betty Beeler [ph.], came up for the funeral.  This was amazing.
Story_ID: 579952
Speaker 1: You were talking about the transition.  You're going to the elementary school [Barnard Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], playing with your friends in the neighborhood, and then your mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] decided she wanted to fill the gap.
Speaker 2: She needed to fill it in.
Speaker 1: Why did she need to fill the gap with dance?
Speaker 2: Of all things, right.  You know, my mother was an interesting lady.  She was in a social club.  I can't tell you what the name of it was.  But they did things, and I remember one aspect of this club was that they were all going to learn equestrian arts.  And she had the outfit of life, never been on a horse before in her life, it didn't matter, because she liked the way it looked.  And I remember when this (air quotes) social club was having this event and horses and all of that.  And so then after this, this riding extravaganza, then the next thing she was doing something else.  She, she was, she was just like that.  And so this dance thing, where she got this from, I don't really know.  I don't really know.  Maybe it was something that she always wanted to do because my mother used to ice skate because she broke her arm ice skating.  So maybe it was just something that she wanted to do but at the time didn't have the opportunity or couldn't afford it.  And so like most mothers, they always try to create these opportunities for their children.  So my mother liked theater, we always went to the theater.  We listened to musicals at home.
Speaker 1: Give me some examples.
Speaker 2: I knew every song in 'West Side Story,' every song in 'West Side Story.'  I knew every song in 'The Sound of Music' because--and I remember when The Supre- Diana Ross and The Supremes did their Christmas album.  And to this day, every Christmas Diana and The Supremes are singing 'Merry Christmas' in my house.  My mother, she just liked the arts.  Both of my brothers [Curtis Beeler and Michael Beeler] draw beautifully, my stepfather [Samuel Beeler (ph.)] can draw.  She just--she likes that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the theater you attended?
Speaker 2: We went to the up--no, the Ontario Theatre [Washington, D.C.], that's where we went.
Speaker 1: What did you see there?
Speaker 2: I think we saw 'West Side Story' there.  I don't even know if that Ontario Theatre is still there.  We went to the Uptown [Uptown Theater, Washington, D.C.].  Where did we see 'The Sound of Music'?  Gee, I can't even remember now.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember the audiences versus--were they whites, black (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I didn't even pay any attention to that.  I really--I knew you were gonna ask me that.  I didn't pay any attention to that.  It was my mother, myself and my two brothers.  And for me, that was all I needed.
Story_ID: 579953
Speaker 1: So tell me about your first day at the Jones-Haywood School [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: The--my first day here?  Now this is interesting.  My mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] wanted me to come, but I didn't wanna come.  I wanted to be home with the neighborhood children playing kickball and jumping double dutch and so forth and so on.  I didn't want to come.  So I came here with the attitude of life, and I got enrolled and--
Speaker 1: This is 1961?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. I'm eleven, ten, eleven years old.  And so I'm coming here and I'm, I'm coming here.  And Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones], the rules and regulations relentless.  And I can remember standing right over there thinking I don't know who this woman is, but I am sick of her telling me what to do.  Now what is wrong with me?  You know, here I am, taking a dance class.  I'm clueless about it.  So somebody's gotta tell you something.  But it was just her whole demeanor.  It was too commanding.  It was too rigid.  Her tone was not encouraging.  And I didn't like it.  So--but I was respectful.  I had enough sense to know, okay don't cross this boundary because you're gonna cross over into a territory.  Now you might be able to do this at home, but you can't do this here.  So--
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did she tell you to do?
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was just the physical command and the repetition of it.
Speaker 1: Like for example?
Speaker 2: And the exactness of it.  Like when we got to--say for example we got in the center of the floor and it was now time for the jumping part of the co- of the class.  The jumping part of the class, which is you know, you have to have good cardio conditioning.  Which I had, but it was just that attitudinal piece, and it's amazing how your attitude just can affect everything that you do if you don't want to do it.  So mine was more attitudinal than really not being able to do it.  I let it, I let it interfere.  And, and not understanding the protocol and the format and the boundaries.  I, I just didn't wanna do it for really no real rhyme or reason.  I just didn't want to do it.
Story_ID: 579954
Speaker 1: Had you--you had attended the theater, so you--had you seen dancers on stage?
Speaker 2: You know, I hadn't really seen dancers (air quotes) like live concert work.  Only through like 'West Side Story,' movies, you know that, that kind of thing.  The first time I saw a live performance was after I had come here [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] and went to see the Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and the Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University [Washington, D.C.].  And then it began to have a different meaning and feeling and perspective.
Speaker 1: What did you see at that Alvin Ailey performance?
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure I saw 'Revelations' [Alvin Ailey] you know their signature piece.  I, and I went with this girlfriend of mine who was in my class, her name was Lindell Walker [ph.] at the time.  She and I went together.  And that performance kind of changed everything.
Speaker 1: What was it about, what did you see?
Speaker 2: Well, I saw the company dance.  All black dancers, like me, and like every other child, you sit and you say, "Wow, I, I really would like to do that."  Now interesting when I would go see the musicals, the thought of, of being a singer never came into my mind.  Or the thought of being a dancer and a singer like the rooftop scene in 'West Side Story.'  It didn't, it didn't really have the, the artistic effect on me.  But when I went to see the Ailey company, it kind of changed my world a little bit 'cause it was live, you know.  And so that gave me something to think about.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you saw Alvin Ailey?
Speaker 2: I was still, I was still young, I was still a child; still that ten, eleven (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eleven?
Speaker 2: I was still new to this whole world.
Story_ID: 579955
Speaker 1: Then when I auditioned for the Bolshoi [Bolshoi Ballet], and did the Bolshoi 'Ballet School' [Asaf Messerer] as one of the children, then I had a different respect for order and process.
Speaker 2: How old were you when did Bolshoi?
Speaker 1: Maybe eleven, maybe eleven.
Speaker 2: So how did that opportunity come up, and what was it?
Speaker 1: Well, it was the Bolshoi had come to Washington, D.C.  And they have a piece called the 'Ballet School,' and what they show is the methodology of training.  They show class, but it's in performance style.  Bingo, there it was in living color for me too.  So then I said, "Okay, so I get it now."
Speaker 2: And you performed with them?
Speaker 1: And I was chosen as one of the children to show the process.  They show children and it goes straight on up to the professional dancer, the methodology of training.  That's what the piece is about.  And I was one of the children in that particular ballet.  I had to audition.  The audition took place at the Washington School of Ballet [Washington, D.C.].  So I auditioned and I was selected and I was the only African American child to be selected in that particular concert piece.
Speaker 2: So tell me about that audition.
Speaker 1: Well, I remember going through the doors of Washington Ballet and there were a lot of kids there.  And what we did was we took a little bit of a ballet class, and that was it.  That was it.  And then I can't even remember who took me.  I don't know if it was my mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] or if it, or if Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] took me.  I don't even remember now.  But what we did was just a sample class.  Just a small snippet of class because they're looking at size and height and, and some technical information, and some understanding of what you're supposed to do.  And it was real short, it was real brief.
Speaker 2: Now at this point, at eleven years old, how far had you come in your own technique?  You had learned the positions and what else (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I was still a beginner.  I was still a beginner.  I was still toying--I was still dealing with not wanting to come here and the rules and the regulations and not wanting to do it and these two ladies are too rigid and too demanding, and all of that was entangled in, in the same part of my life as a child, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what had--and what had you learned technically?
Speaker 1: Well I had learned the positions, first, second, fourth, fifth, battement fondu, passe, grand battement, saute, glissade, jete, pas de bourree, position of the arm, standard, basic beginner text.  I was very thin.  Course at the time I didn't know that you needed to be.  I just was, you know.
Speaker 2: And so when you returned after the Bolshoi performance, how were things different?
Speaker 1: Well, my attitude was different, and from, from that point on, it, it, it was working.  The attitude had changed completely.  And now that I'm teaching and I look at my young students, I better understand something like working towards something as opposed to just coming for the sake of coming.  The kids seem to perform better when they clearly can say, "Okay, I can't miss class today because we, because we're working toward this goal over here."  And so my challenge now as the director of the school [Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] is to keep, keep a goal visible so that the kids understand that this is what we're working toward.  And they understand the process better and they understand their responsibility better.
Story_ID: 579956
Speaker 1: And so when you were a girl at this school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, a girl, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what, what was the next goal for you here?  Was there a performance you could look forward to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The next goal, let's see.  What were we doing?  Starting on pointe.  That's a young girl's dream until you start, you know.  Because at that point, I hadn't started pointe, but I got to see it.
Speaker 1: Where did you see it?
Speaker 2: Well I saw it within the Bolshoi Ballet, I saw it.  I didn't see it here at Jones-Haywood [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.], because that was not my class, and so generally the rule is that you come, you take your class and then you go home.  So you don't, you don't know what's happening in the rest of the school, you know, until there is a performance event.  That's the only time you see it.  But when you're training, you just know what's happening in your class.  So for me at that time, I hadn't started on pointe.  So I hadn't quite seen it yet.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first performance before you started on pointe?
Speaker 2: Actually, I do.  We did a piece called Mendelssohn [Felix Mendelssohn] suite, which was choreographed by Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones].  And it was a excellent training piece.  You know, everybody has to have like a training piece that connects to the next level.  And that was a good piece because it had a lot of releves to the demi-pointe.  It had, it had all of the ballet steps, you just did them on demi-pointe.  So it was strengthening the ankle, you were getting leg strength and, and the ability to rise and, and, and releve to that three quarter demi-pointe.  I remember that piece.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the training?  Tell me about what Miss Jones and Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood].  What was their training style like teaching you that piece?
Speaker 2: Commanding, commanding, demanding, accountability (laughter).  Nothing in this building for me has ever been easy.  So it teaches you to figure out strategies so that nobody's fussing at you the next day, because that gets to be too much.  So eventually you say, okay, let me go home and take some notes, whether I write 'em down or I sing a song or I write a book or whatever.  Just so that when I go back the next day, I don't have to hear the redundancy of the same reprimand.
Speaker 1: So you would actually go home and, and make up songs to help you remember things?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Because you just didn't feel like hearing it.  Because--and see the one thing about dance, it's abstra- it takes place in that time and in that space.  So if you don't spend some time reviewing, when you come back into that space, you have to train yourself, your mind and your body to recall, retrieve.  And eventually you figure that out.  Especially if you just don't feel like hearing anybody fussing again.
Speaker 1: So give me a sense, what would happen when you would leave this school and go home and you're in your own room?
Speaker 2: Just think about it.  And see we got real good here.  My class in that dressing room, it was like we had a Geneva conference.  We would say, "Okay now you, don't forget your attitude 'cause I do not feel like hearing Miss Haywood talk about it today."  "And you, make sure you don't look like somebody's mother today," 'cause she would say things like, "Sylvester [ph.], you were a radiant prince, and Sandra [ph.], you danced just like his grandmother."  And you would be sweating like a dog thinking that you had done something so fabulous.  And then you realize that in her eyes, you haven't done anything.  And, and, and it's, and it's the inner kind of woundedness.  And you don't like it because everybody wants to be praised.  So my class, we would in that dressing room, just say, "Okay now, let's just have a good class.  Let's not make her angry.  All right now let's go over everything so we can keep peace."
Story_ID: 579957
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of the fellow students here [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Any of them people we may know?
Speaker 2: Well Hinton Battle who was the choreographer for 'Idlewild' the movie.  He--what else did Hinton do?  He danced in 'The Wiz.'  He has several Tonys [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre].  What was that movie Hinton just did?  You know I can't--it's a recent movie and I can't even remember what the name of it is.  So Hinton Battle.  Let's see.  We have of 'course Sylvester Campbell; Chita Rivera is a product of this building.  We have [HistoryMaker] Louis Johnson.  We have Charles Augins, the choreographer of 'Five Guys Named Moe.'  We have Renee Robinson, principal dancer still at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
Speaker 1: And at the--while you were here, I mean some of these people were contemporaries, some preceded you, some after you.  Were you aware of this legacy?  Were you aware of Chita Rivera?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, as, as a kid I was.  Renee Robinson was in my class.  Hinton Battle was in my class.
Speaker 1: Did you see--so some of these people were classmates of yours?
Speaker 2: Renee and Hinton were.
Speaker 1: Did you see the greatness in them at the time?
Speaker 2: As kids?  Yeah.  Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] used to allow Hinton to choreograph on us, interesting.  As a, as a kid, they allowed him to choreograph on us for fun, and then they allowed one of his pieces to actually go in a concert.  Renee Robinson was an extremely disciplined child in this building.  She was--we used to tease her because when the rest of us got in trouble, she never did, because she was always on top of what she was supposed to do.  And when the rest of us goofed off and got reprimanded and told to sit down and blah, blah, blah, blah, she never did.  So we used to tease her about, "Well Renee you know they're not gonna fuss at you today.  Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green], you know you're gonna get it as always, you know, so."
Speaker 1: What was your reputation?
Speaker 2: I was a good--they were very, very, very, very hard on me.  But what was interesting was that I never showed how wounded I was.  I could cover that up like a heartbeat.  But then I would go home and have my nervous breakdown.  But then when I came back, I was very cavalier about it, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Do you r- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did never--I didn't want--I never wanted them to see, "Okay I got her."
Story_ID: 579958
Speaker 1: Do you remember one of those occasions when you were really wounded?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I came--this was the--one--I had, I was having a rehearsal with Sylvester Campbell.  We were working on a pas de deux.  I believe it was 'Don Quixote.'  And the night before Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] had complimented Sylvester about how radiant his perf- his dancing was.  And she said to me, "Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green] and you danced like his grandmother."  And I was like okay, fine, you know.  So then the next day I came to class, and I sat on the steps.  I wasn't changed.  I was not participating.  So Miss Haywood says, "And what's wrong with you, dear?"  And I said, "Well I don't feel well today."  But I was just in a mood.  I had a attitude bigger than life because I felt that I should have been complimented.  So Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] says, "She's not performing today because she has the swan flu."  And they had a little chuckle between the two of them and the rest of the class--they were like (laughter), you know, but nobody--and I was evil as I could be.  I sat there and I didn't crack a smile.  And I sat on those steps for three hours and I just wouldn't participate.  And so I remember that because everybody trivialized how I was feeling and I didn't like it.  I really didn't like--and that was the first time I ever just blatantly just did something like that.
Story_ID: 579959
Speaker 1: So after the Bolshoi [Bolshoi Ballet], you did have some performances here--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with the Jones-Haywood ballet school [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.].  Tell me about the first couple of performances.  What was it like being on the stage and what were you performing?
Speaker 2: Well as a child, it's just excitement.  You are just excited to do it and you don't think about all the things that, that you didn't do well.  As you get older, that's your worst nightmare, and especially as I got older and performing got to be more and more demanding.  I was afraid of not performing at my best.  And a lot of times I could work myself up in a way that I was just so tense, that the performance wouldn't be good.
Speaker 1: Tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it's just something that you have, you have to monitor your own feelings and your own level of anxiety, you know.
Speaker 1: What were the names of the first few performances?
Speaker 2: The first few performances here in this building as a young child, we like I said, Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] choreographed a Mendelssohn [Felix Mendelssohn] suite.  We did a piece called 'Colors' [ph.].  We did a piece called 'Ebony Concerto,' score by Stravinsky [Igor Stravinsky], which was very difficult musically.
Speaker 1: And when, when it's difficult musically, how does that affect the dance?
Speaker 2: Well it doesn't.  You just have to know your music.  I mean, it affects the dance if you don't know your music, and especially ensemble work.  But once you get how Miss Jones was counting it, musically, then, then, then it was fine.  She was very good at giving you that blueprint if you just couldn't hear it naturally yourself.  And not every dancer can, can hear music in a certain way that everybody dances on the same count.  So, so 'Ebony Concerto,' we did--Miss Jones was an avid tap dancer.  She choreographed a piece called 'Bach' ['Bach Vibrations'] for six, which is still in the repertoire, repertory work at Lynchburg, Virginia with Keith Lee.  They still perform her piece.  What else have we done?  Gee, you're conjuring up quite a bit here.  'Flair for Movement' [ph.] was a wonderful ballet choreographed by Doris Jones.
Speaker 1: Was it tough moving from the training stage to the performance stage?
Speaker 2: It's not tough if you understand the process.
Speaker 1: What's the process?
Speaker 2: The process is, now you've got to put a quality on top of these steps.  See class is technique.  Now you've got to put a quality and a style on top of those steps and still stay true to the aesthetic of how the step is supposed to look.  So if it's a difficult step, your mind has to pay homage to how it's done so that it--and it has a performance quality and style to it.  So it can't look like I have to remember to make sure I don't fall off my leg, you know.  And those things happen, but then you've got to, you've, you've got to come out of with a sense of grace and charm and you know you've seen somebody almost fall up the steps when they're trying to be, when they're trying not to fall up the steps.  How do they recover from that so that you didn't notice it?  It's kind of like that.
Story_ID: 579960
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mentioned a big turning point, and that was toe, toe shoes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?  Describe the earliest memories of that.
Speaker 2: Well the earliest memory of that is that it was very hard, and it was very painful.  Very hard and very painful.  So now you have the challenge of pain and discomfort, staying inside of the boundary of how you're supposed to do it, and putting a performance quality on top of that.  See, one thing about dance is that you're always layering.  Soon as you get something straightened out, you've got to put another piece on it.  You're always accessorizing.  It's not just the black dress.  You know you--so--
Speaker 1: Do you remember Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] and how she would instruct you?
Speaker 2: Miss Jones was--
Speaker 1: In pointe, specifically.
Speaker 2: She was--it was interesting because I'm older.  Now I understand the psychology of people a little better.  Miss Jones was the type that could really kill you with kindness.  Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] was very literal.  And so when it was wrong, it was just wrong.  But Miss Jones, her, her way of explaining something that was wrong was kind of like Chinese water torture.  It was--you just wanted it to hurry up and be over with.  Miss Haywood, it was wrong, it's over, now we gone move to the next phase.  But not Miss Jones.
Speaker 1: Can you recall a memory of this?
Speaker 2: Case in point.  When Miss Jones was choreographing--when we had to perform a piece that she was choreographing.
Speaker 1: For example.
Speaker 2: For example, 'Flair for Movement' [ph.].  Miss Jones could get stuck in the first sixty-four counts of that ballet from 6:00 until 9:30.  So it's 9:30 and you have not performed the ballet from the beginning to the end yet.  So you never get a feel of going all the way through, and what that feels like, because she can stay in a spot so long that it's relentless.  Because every single detail, and, and that was just her approach.  It's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't work for everybody, you know.  So, so that was her approach.  I like to go from the beginning to the end, and then go back and fix.  But she would just stay in a spot, and it was almost like you never, you could never build up the stamina because you couldn't, you couldn't go.  And sometimes you just have to get through something, good, bad or indifferent, before you can figure out how you edit yourself as you go through it.  So that was Miss Jones' approach.
Story_ID: 579961
Speaker 1: How were you able to balance the rest of your life as a student, the academic world, and as a ballet student and family life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, that was easy for me.  That was very, very, very easy for me.  I didn't have any problems.  There were periods where I felt that I was missing out on some social activities.
Speaker 1: Tell me a story about that.
Speaker 2: But not really.  Senior year, class picnic, Rock Creek Park [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: This is Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: This is Roosevelt High School, senior year, June, 1969.  So we have our senior class picnic in Rock Creek Park, and I'll never forget it because I had on a pair of gold Wrangler jeans and a chocolate colored shell.  Now, remember that.  And so I'm saying to myself okay, do I really wanna go to this picnic?  And my girlfriend, "What do you mean?  You're gonna miss your, you're gonna miss the senior picnic to go to dance class?"  And I said, "Well you know I kind of really don't know half the people here, that's number one.  And do I really wanna go to Rock Creek Park and be with the mosquitoes and the gnats?"  I, I was pondering.  So I went for about an hour and a half, and I was so bored.  And I left.  And I went home and I came here for my class at 6:00.  I'll never forget that.  And I remember coming up the ramp, Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] said something sarcastic like, "Oh, I guess the senior picnic was boring."  Just, just something to say.  She didn't have to say anything, but that--she was, she is, she was the type of woman that she was always gonna say something.  So I didn't say anything, I just went to the barre and just, you know.  And I had a choice to either stay at the picnic or come to class because that was my, you know how they have all these festivities, the picnic and the prom and this and dah, dah, dah, dah.  And while those are events in every young person's life, for me they were just okay.  Now the average senior like the seniors over at Duke Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.], my lord.  When they are getting ready for a prom and all those senior activities, it is unbelievable.  But that's their excitement, it wasn't like that for me.
Story_ID: 579962
Speaker 1: Were you aware of other dance schools in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at this time?
Speaker 2: I knew about Washington Ballet [Washington School of Ballet, Washington, D.C.], and I clearly knew that that was a white school.  I knew about a ballet school called Therrell Smith [Therrell Smith School of Dance, Washington, D.C.], and I knew about a ballet school called--well Bernice Hammond was the director.  And both of those women are still living; I don't know if they still have schools or not.
Speaker 1: Now were these white schools, black schools?
Speaker 2: These were black schools.  In fact, Therrell Smith, Bernice Hammond and [HistoryMaker] Doris Jones, they had an exhibit at the Anacostia Museum [Anacostia Community Museum, Washington, D.C.], and it was called 'Three Dance Schools' [ph.] or something like that.  And it was, it was a--either a master's [degree] or a doctorate program that Tamara Brown--she was the young lady who did that exhibit, and it was well done.  She documented both schools.
Speaker 1: What was your sense of the Washington ballet school?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a sense.  I didn't have a sense.  We had Bob Davis [ph.], who worked at the Washington school, who often came here to assist and help Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones.  We had the National Ballet [National Ballet of Washington, D.C.] at that time.  And we had one or two white dancers come here to assist Miss Haywood and Miss Jones.  But other than that, I didn't have a sense of anything other than the fact that they existed.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of what it meant to be a black ballerina in the country?  Were there two systems of ballet?
Speaker 2: No.  You know it's interesting, and I've been thinking about that very same question before you came.  We weren't necessarily coached or drilled from the point of view that, "You are black and this is a European art form, and you have to do--" dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  They didn't use that approach.  They came down those steps and they said, "If you are going to study this, this is the standard and this is what you have to do, and we don't care who you are or what color you are or where you come from, or who your mother is or who your father is," because they, they take all the way when they, when they said something.  So we didn't get sense of okay, I'm black, so I have to do A, B and C.  The sense that we got that if you study this, you do A and B and C and D like everybody else.  Now was that wrong or right?  Because when we went to School of American Ballet [New York, New York] in the summertime, we were with a different culture, so to speak, at that time.  We took class like everybody else.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I was a Ford Foundation [New York, New York] scholarship recipient.  So maybe that was in 1960, maybe 1961, '62 [1962], or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were still young, still eleven, twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And now we went to the School of American Ballet, the official training school for New York City Ballet and we trained just like everybody else.  I was in the level two class.
Speaker 1: So you were in New York City [New York, New York] for the summer at the premier institution.
Speaker 2: It's the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] of classical dance, and I was right there.  And I didn't see myself any different than anybody else.  Now I don't know if, if that's distorted, I don't know.  But as a child, sometimes, sometimes some things can work better unsaid, sometimes.  Because I walked in and you couldn't tell me I didn't belong there, because nobody told me that I didn't belong there.
Speaker 1: Now did this come from your upbringing?
Speaker 2: I think it was their approach, it was their approach.  And probably a residual of that because like I said earlier, there were places in D.C. in the early '50s [1950s] that you know my family said, "Oh no, we can't go there 'cause we're black."  Ne- I never heard anybody in my family say that.  We were sheltered from it.
Story_ID: 579963
Speaker 1: What about, you know this is also around the time of the Civil Rights Movement.  Were you conscious of any of that?
Speaker 2: I would say for me the, the real first consciousness that was a bit daunting, was when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that was in 1968.  So I was, I was older then.  I remember coming home from school, my girlfriend and I, Delores Franklin [ph.].  She was afraid to go home.  I lived closer to the school, so she came to my house.  The dance, the ballet school [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] was closed.  And that was a little--then, then it kind of started, then it kind of started.
Speaker 1: There were riots and things like that in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Well via TV you know 'cause we were--I mean everybody was in the house and you know that kind of thing.  And we--dance classes were closed.  This building was on shutdown, you know, during that time.
Speaker 1: And so that was your first sort of--
Speaker 2: Kind of like, yeah.
Speaker 1: That race was real.
Speaker 2: That it was real.  And, and for the first time, it was affecting me in a different kind of a way, you know.  Because even though, okay I'm in high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and you're talking about segregation and you're talking about Jim Crow and you're learning certain lessons, but until it has some real, direct impact to you personally, it, it, it kind of just you know, it, it doesn't resonate yet.
Speaker 1: So you didn't feel necessarily discriminated against, either in the dance world or outside of it until this moment (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Until this moment.  And, and then at that moment, it wasn't, it was, it just made me sick and, and think about some other kinds of things, you know.  But as a child, no.
Speaker 1: Was colorism an issue?  Light skin, dark skin.
Speaker 2: Well I'm sure that it was, but it just didn't, here again something else that I never thought about.  And one of my dearest friends, she and I talk about that now, you know.  It's, it's interesting what you--if it's not broached, then--and when you--if you think about if everything that is negative is drilled inside of a child every single day, "You can't do this because of that.  You can't go over here because that."  You like, "Well, well what can I do?"  You know.  So I think I grew up like that because I never thought in my wildest imagination that there was not any place that I couldn't go.

Speaker 1: And so for example in 1961 or '62 [1962], you were in New York City [New York, New York] at the School of American Ballet, the premier institution for ballet instruction in the country, in the world perhaps (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  And I went in the building just like everybody else.  And I was taught just like everybody else.
Speaker 1: Tell me about--
Speaker 2: I remember I was in a class, Madame Tumkovsky [Antonina Tumkovsky], she was a Russian ballet instructor.  And I was also in the class with Bujones, Fernando Bujones, gold medalist in Varna [Bulgaria] of the year.  He was in my ballet class.  Level two, that's what it was.  And I remember I liked Tumkovsky because she was, she was commanding and the whole tone of someone who speaks Russian and they're speaking English, they always sound like they're fussing.  So I was like, "My God, this woman's fussing all day long."  But she kind of really wasn't.  And she liked me for some reason.  And I remember she called this girl a dummkopf, which is stupid, because this girl was obviously having some problems with left and right (laughter), so.  So that was kind of like the joke in the class with this white girl who's she calling dummkopf.  And I liked Madame Alexandra Tumkovsky [sic.].  I liked her.  I liked her approach and I guess when I think back on it, probably why I liked her was because she taught everybody, and as a teacher, that's what she is supposed to do.  Now these other pretentious teachers who only teach the talented children, as far as I'm concerned, that's not teaching 'cause it's easy to teach somebody who's talented 'cause you don't have to do that much work.  But you try to work with somebody who's not so talented, and look at your results at the end of the year.  Then you can evaluate your own pedagogy.  So I can remember being a little nervous when George Balanchine and Diana Abrams [ph.] came into the studio to take attendance or take notes or whatever they were doing.  They were pointing and talking and writing.  And I always thought they were talking about me, I did.  I said, "Oh god, okay Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green] get yourself together and you know, you lose your scholarship and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] is gonna kill you," you know.  So--but I went in that building just like everybody else.  And I never for once thought that I didn't belong there.
Speaker 1: Were you ever treated any differently?
Speaker 2: Well maybe in ways that I was too immature and naive to notice.  You know I can remember one teacher in particular who would walk past me, you know 'cause you walk the line.  And she would say something to the girl in front.  She would skip me, and then she would say something to the girl in back of me.  Now I remember her, but it kind of--it didn't, it didn't bother me because this particular teacher, her approach was kind of like--I thought she was really not my style, so it didn't affect me.  I liked Tumkovsky because her, her, her tone was commanding, her tone was energizing, her voice could drive you.  And she was, she was more engaging in her teaching and her students.  And this other lady was detached and I didn't like her style.  So the fact that she wouldn't say anything to me, it didn't really bother me.
Story_ID: 579965
Speaker 1: What were you learning at the school [School of American Ballet, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was learning a lot of things other than dance.  I was learning about different styles, different approaches.
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: Well, just like I said, the teacher who said something to me, the girl in front and the girl in back, the fact that her voice was very one dimensional.
Speaker 1: And in terms of technique you were learning some things as well?
Speaker 2: You know, I can honestly say that maybe I was learning more about the people side of dance, the behaviors in dance, the unspoken words in dance, gestural language, eye contact or lack thereof.  The whole culture in the dressing room was interesting as a young child (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Describe that.
Speaker 2: The ki- and this was with the older, more proficient dancers.  The kind of time that they spent grooming themselves, not a hair out of place.
Speaker 1: Describe that scene for me.
Speaker 2: Well you would go into the dressing room and you would see a dancer sitting on the floor in front of the mirror and combing her hair.  The bun is more than perfect.  So I learned that class grooming is equivalent to how you groom yourself for a performance.  That's how you learn how to do that.  I learned a lot about what dancers eat, the ritual that they go through before class even starts.
Speaker 1: What kind of rituals were these girls going through?
Speaker 2: The stretching, the stretching in the dressing room, warming up a little bit prior to class.  Oh, the perfume was crazy in the dressing room because every dance, every young dancer wants to be able to have the full attention of the instructor.  Every dancer wants that.  So you have to figure out ways in which you get that.  First of all, you have to be immaculate; that's number one.  When you come into the studio it has to be evident that you, that you take good care of your body.  You have to be on time.  You have to be attentive in class.  So I think for us or for me, it was, it was more of those kinds of things that was more rewarding.  This is the other thing I learned, that I needed to do a better job in the teacher's classes who appeared to be distant, because I really didn't know how to drive myself.  I needed the energy of somebody else to push me to do what I was supposed to do.  I learned that about myself. 'Cause when we, we were--there were about sixteen of us in New York [New York] at that time, and we were all over the place.  Some were at Joffrey [Joffrey Ballet School, New York, New York], some were at the Graham School [Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance, New York, New York], but they all stayed at my house, my father [Raymond Fortune (ph.)] and the second Elizabeth Fortune [ph.], because she had a three story brownstone.
Speaker 1: So all the Jones-Haywood [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] students stayed at your father's house.
Speaker 2: Yes we did, yes we did.
Speaker 1: Well what was, what was the culture like inside the home?
Speaker 2: Yes we did.  So when we came, when we all came home from dance class, we would sit in the living room, we'd say, "You know I just feel like we're not working."  We had to keep journals too, because when we came back here we had to pass them into Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones].  And somebody said, "Well it's because we don't know how to work for ourselves.  We only can work if we are being driven to do it.  That's why we're not feeling like we're not physically tired," you know what I'm saying?  So once we discovered that about ourselves, we said, "Okay, now okay now the teacher's who's like this (gesture), that's no problem.  But the teacher who is like now today we're going to do--okay dear and one, and a two."  Now you gotta find the energy somewhere else.  So we discovered that about ourselves.  So basically I think that's what we all learned was different approaches, the teacher's style, spending time with yourself, things that you don't know about yourself because somebody else is driving you.  You don't have, you don't have to think about which direction you're gonna go for yourself and by yourself.
Story_ID: 579966
Speaker 1: Tell me about life in your father's [Raymond Fortune (ph.)] house with sixteen ballerinas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Right, we had fun.  We were all scattered throughout the city.  S- I was at School of American Ballet [New York, New York], some were at Joffrey [Joffrey Ballet School, New York, New York], some were at the Martha Graham School [Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance, New York, New York].  At that particular time, American Ballet Theatre had a school.  So in the evening when we all came home, my stepmother, the second Elizabeth Fortune [ph.], would have dinner already ready for us.  She was gone to work by that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did she work?
Speaker 2: She worked at Manhattan State Hospital [Manhattan Psychiatric Center, New York, New York] on their mental ward.  So we would have dinner and we would clean up the kitchen.  And if we needed to wash our dance clothes out, we did that, and then we would all assemble in the living room and discuss our day at various schools.  We had to keep a journal.  And what was drill in everybody's head from Claire Haywood and [HistoryMaker] Doris Jones, "Go to New York [New York] and lose your scholarship, you are in big trouble when you return."  And we didn't want to hear that lecture.  So we had, we had to keep it together.  So we discussed different approaches from different teachers, and I personally realized that for some reason unbeknown to me that I was not able to work unless I was driven to do it.  And so once I figured that out, I was better the next day that I went back.  But we were very good at discussing our own issues, trying to sort through and figure out because we all wanted to--we all wanted to be praised and rewarded and say--we liked to hear job well done.  We really did not like the reprimand every day.
Speaker 1: Do you remember attending some of the performances of the American Ballet?  Did you see them perform (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, that summer we mostly saw musical theater.
Speaker 1: What'd you see?
Speaker 2: I remember seeing 'Sweet Charity.'  No, was it sweet--yeah, 'Sweet Charity.'  And I remember crying.  It was, it was wonderful.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: On Broadway or where?  In Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it was on Broadway or--it was in New York, so maybe it was--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Now you were living on--in which section of New York?
Speaker 1: We were in the Bronx [New York].  We were at 1327 Boynton Avenue.
Speaker 2: And so obviously theater a big deal in New York City.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  We, we, we saw a lot of musical theater that summer.  We didn't do many amusement parks like the Coney Islands [Coney Island, New York, New York] and the Palisades [Palisades Amusement Park, Bergen County, New Jersey].  We mostly did shopping and movies and musical theater.
Story_ID: 579967
Speaker 1: Were you aware of, of the black prima ballerina Janet Collins?
Speaker 2: At that time, no.  At that time, absolutely not.
Speaker 1: Or Raven Wilkinson?
Speaker 2: I knew about Raven Wilkinson only because her, her interaction here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] with Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones].  So that was why we knew about her.
Speaker 1: Was it helpful to have role models like that?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  I don't know if it was helpful or not.  As a young person, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Because you always believed you could do it, no barriers.
Speaker 2: I, I don't know if it was helpful or not.  That is, that's an interesting question.  Something else I never thought about.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) At the, at either of the Jones-Haywood School [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] or at the American Ballet [School of American Ballet, New York, New York], the school there, did they teach you a little bit about the history of ballet?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have any kind of theory classes.  We just knew who people were.
Speaker 1: Who did you know about?
Speaker 2: We knew [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell.  I knew Mimi Paul, and she was a dancer in the company at that time.  And she also did a, a fashion thing in Glamour magazine.  And I remember because I knew that she was a member of New York City Ballet, and now she was in this magazine.  And I remember going to the store to buy that magazine, which I still have in my house today.  And what's also interesting about Mimi Paul, is that her daughter graduated from the visual arts department at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And you also knew of Arthur Mitchell.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well Arthur Mitchell used to come Jones-Haywood School during that whole Ford Foundation [New York, New York] scholarship era, and he taught my class every Monday night.
Speaker 1: So this was well before the Dance Theatre of Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.  And I can also remember how excited we were as young children, and he was good looking, and he was with a premier company, and we were excited and to even take that excitement a little further, my mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] used to take him to National Airport [Washington National Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.].  And I remember the first time she did that, she got lost, he missed his flight, and I was so totally embarrassed.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Which dance company was he with at this time?
Speaker 2: New York City Ballet.
Story_ID: 579968
Speaker 1: And in your mind, what did the New York City Ballet represent?
Speaker 2: It represented something exciting.  Probably because of [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell.  Not necessarily because it was New York City Ballet or George Balanchine.  But it all kind of connected once we went to the School of American Ballet [New York, New York] and, and I actually got to see George Balanchine himself.  So it--that, I think that was a pretty full experience for me.  I think the company represented something that was admirable to me.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of ballet in other parts of the country, like Los Angeles [California], with the First Negro classical ballet [First Negro Classic]?
Speaker 2: No I was not, not at that time.
Speaker 1: But New York [New York], that was the epicenter.
Speaker 2: That was, that was the center.  You know that was the center.  No, I was not aware of, of that kind of classical ballet history as a child.
Speaker 1: What was the highlight of your summer in New York that year?  Did you perform?
Speaker 2: Oh no, it was just training.  I think it was just all of us being together because one thing that the Jones-Haywood School [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] did for me, was it helped me create a positive peer group that still has tenure today.  And I loved being in the company of my peers at that time.  Living together was wonderful.  We had fun, we made fun of each other, we laughed.  When the phone rang and it was Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones], like total silence.  It was like, "Well who is gonna answer the phone?"  "Well you answer the phone," you know.  So we stuck together.  And if one person in my class was feeling bad or reprimanded in a way that communicated total defeat, we rallied around that person and we said, "Look, you know how Miss Haywood and Miss Jones are.  It's not the end of the world.  She says no, somebody else will say yes.  You know, get over it."  You know we did that for each other.
Speaker 1: Now I know you also spent time at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that and when was this?
Speaker 2: Okay, I was, I was fifteen now.  And also that same summer we were in New York, and then all of us traveled from my father's [Raymond Fortune (ph.)] house to Martha's Vineyard.
Speaker 1: So did you spend every summer in New York City?
Speaker 2: We spent ev- once we were all ready, we spent every summer training at professional schools in New York City.
Speaker 1: So name some of the schools where you trained?
Speaker 2: Well I always went to School of American Ballet.
Speaker 1: On a Ford--
Speaker 2: On the Ford--and, and when the, and when the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] scholarship era was over, then that was the end of School of American Ballet for me.  And then, then I was getting older too.
Speaker 1: So were you advancing in terms of your tenure at the American Ballet school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I got it every year, I got it every year, you know.  And I don't even--and actually they--Ford Foundation is still around I think.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you--were you the only student of color?
Speaker 2: Let me see.
Speaker 1: I think there was a Cuban student, perhaps there.
Speaker 2: Okay, Fernando Bujones was there 'cause he was in my class.  You know, now Sara Yarborough was in the--was she in the company?  I don't remember.  But she was in training there.  Sara Yarborough was in training there.  I remember her.  I don't, I don't recall any other African American kids that I connected with.
Story_ID: 579969
Speaker 1: Was there an issue--many of the ballets had a romantic theme.  Was there ever an issue about race and playing a specific part in a specific ballet?
Speaker 2: Oh, always.  There was a little blurb in Dance Magazine this past Christmas.  It was a grandfather who had taken his granddaughter to see 'Swan Lake' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] and his commentary was that he was appalled that there was a black girl in the corps.  Because for him it had messed up the symmetry, and I actually Xeroxed that article and we had a discussion about it at Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.].  And the kids were like, "Well why would the editor of Dance Magazine put something like that in there?"  And I said, "Well I don't know, but that's not the point that it's--the point that it's in the book is not the point that we need to talk about right now."  But I thought that was a bit--well I don't know what the word is.  But when you think about what's going on right now down in Louisiana, it's still very much alive.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your observations when you were a student during the summers at the School of the American Ballet [School of American Ballet, New York, New York].  Do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Like I said unless--I'm sure it was there.  But it was probably too subtle and too sophisticated for a child.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get the principal role?
Speaker 2: Well in the summer it was just class.  So, so there was no concert or no performing.  So it, it, it seemed that everything was on even, even, on an even keel, you know.  So there was, there was no performing; it was just training.  And, and class is set up in a way that sometimes you know the hierarchy of the class and sometimes you can't tell, you know.
Speaker 1: Did people know you were African American?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I mean so--why would they not know that?
Speaker 1: Well, they could think that if they're from a different orientation, they might think that you're a member of another minority group.
Speaker 2: Well I know when I went to Moscow [Russia] in '73 [1973], I was--my ID number was mixed up with a Cuban girl.  For three weeks they could not get that straight, so (shrugs).
Story_ID: 579970
Speaker 1: So in the mid-'60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you went to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] for the summer?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, 'cause I was fifteen years old.  We were there for the month of August after being in New York [New York] for the last week in June and all of July.  And we had training at a firehouse, which Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] had rented out for the summer.  And we trained and--until about 3:00 and then we were free to go to the beach, we all had bikes and we had our meals catered at a little diner, and we were together once again.  We didn't get in a lot of trouble up there, though.  They lived in a house next door to us, so we, we kept it the way it was supposed to be.
Speaker 1: And Martha's Vineyard is known as a very progressive place.
Speaker 2: Very beautiful.  It's like the mecca of middle class, upper class, African American professionals.  And it's the place to be I guess if you listen to certain kinds of conversations.
Speaker 1: Did your parents go as well, or just the students (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, just us.  We had one mother who actually stayed in the bed and breakfast house with us.
Speaker 1: So you stayed at the bed and breakfast.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  We all had, we had shared rooms.  We were the only guests in the house.  And bathrooms--we didn't eat there.  We had our meals catered.
Speaker 1: And pretty rigorous practices?
Speaker 2: We had to show up after breakfast for a 9:00 class.  We did class, class, class, class, class, class, class.
Speaker 1: Who was paying for all of this?
Speaker 2: Good question (laughter).  All I know is that we were there.  I'm sure that the parents funded to some degree.
Speaker 1: Were these students mostly middle class students, come from middle class families?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were.  Probably not me, but most of my peers were.
Story_ID: 579971
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well you told me about your father [Raymond Fortune (ph.)] and your stepmother's [Elizabeth Fortune (ph.)] profession.  What about your mom [Elizabeth Davis Speed] and stepdad?  What was, what was the profession?
Speaker 2: At that time my dad worked as--he worked at the National Zoo [National Zoological Park; Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: This is Sam?
Speaker 2: Sam Beeler [Samuel Beeler (ph.)].  And he was one of the caregivers for the--he was in the lion house.  So, so that was, that was the job that he retired from.  And he was also [U.S.] Air Force Reserves.  And at that time, my mother was working at--it was either the immigration department [U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service] or Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], which was a part of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Were they educated?  Educated--?
Speaker 2: They didn't--my mother nor my stepfather went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your classmates.  You said they came mostly from middle class families.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  We had like one girl's mother was an elementary school teacher.  And her dad was a real estate person.  He owned a lot of property in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at that time.  Then we had another lady whose mother had a restaurant on U Street.  Then let's see.  Then we had another friend whose mother was a housewife.  And--
Speaker 1: So were these classmates, were they, was this unusual for them, the idea of going to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], to spend summers in New York City [New York, New York]?  Or was this the standard?
Speaker 2: This was kind of a standard.  These were the kinds of opportunities that Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] provided for us as children growing up in the school [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.].  So now I've got to match that because I really would like to get back to that, that kind of exposure.  These children in this building, they have, they have been to the Riviera [French Riviera, France] studying at Rosella Hightower [Ecole Superieure de Danse de Cannes Rosella Hightower] for eight weeks in Cannes [France].  Now by the time they were doing that, I was grown and a mother.  So those kinds of perks and opportunities for me were over at that time.
Story_ID: 579972
Speaker 1: And so when you came back after that experience at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], what were some of the highlights you remember at the school in your later high school years?
Speaker 2: Well I remember coming back because now we took a bus home, okay.  So how many hours is that?  About eight or nine hours.  And I remember getting off of that bus and my mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] hadn't seen me all summer long.  And I was really happy to see her.  I found that I was liking that kind of being gone kind of an experience.  I liked that a lot.  I was a little sad because now we're back to the, the, the redundancy of daily life, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: You were excelling as well as a student academically in that redundancy.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Academically?
Speaker 2: Yes, kind of, you know okay so here we--so now, now it starts all over again.  So for me, the, the, the excitement was gone because I enjoyed it tremendously.  And I, I, I wish that I--my whole life could just be like that, you know.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate in high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: From Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Roosevelt High School.
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: Then I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And was in the liberal arts program, I stayed at home.  I was not engaging in it at all.
Speaker 1: How did you choose Howard?
Speaker 2: Well it was kind of like it was already chosen for you.  'Cause my mother worked at Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], so the tuition was free.  And so it was chosen for you already.  No one at Roosevelt High School at that time even remotely suggested, "Why don't you think about conservatory training at some other school?"  Did we even know anything about that kind of opportunity in 1969?  Clearly my counselors didn't.
Speaker 1: Now did [HistoryMaker] Doris Jones or Claire Haywood, did they know about this?
Speaker 2: Well if they did, they didn't initiate any kind of conversation because I think, well I know for sure, that they wanted me to pursue the performing track, you know, so--
Speaker 1: As opposed to?
Speaker 2: As opposed to what (air quotes) appears to be the academic track.  From, from that time and period, and that kind of mentality.  Because dance is very much academic and practice at the same time.  Now this is the other challenge that every young dancer has.  When you graduate from high school and you wanna perform and get in a company and get a paycheck, chances are you cannot go to school full time, 'cause you're gonna tour and you're gonna--you cannot do it.  Then the other old adage is you can always use your, your head when your body is finished.  This is a very young occupation.  This is not like medical school.  It's over before you even realize it got started.  So, that's the challenge that's facing every young dancer now.
Story_ID: 579973
Speaker 1: So at this time, 1969, what was your dream?  Did you still have a dream to be a big time professional dancer?
Speaker 2: What was my dream?  You know, I think at that time there was no dream.  It was just kind of like okay, this is what people do.  You graduate from high school, you go to college.  My stepmother said, the second Elizabeth Fortune [ph.] said to me, "When are you going to forget about this dance thing and think about something that's more serious?"
Speaker 1: Was that the general attitude in the black community at this time?
Speaker 2: Well it certainly was the attitude from the counselor's office at Roosevelt High School [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  Should I have expected more guidance from Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] and Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood]?  Yes.  I can say that now, but at the time, maybe the answer to that question would be well I'm not sure.  But as I reflect, it was, I think it was their duty to guide just like I guide my seniors in high school now.  But I didn't get any guidance from them in terms of realistically what do we do now.  Now I can remember one Christmas I was invited to be Clara at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet with Sylvester Campbell.
Speaker 1: In 'The Nutcracker' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky].
Speaker 2: In 'The Nutcracker,' and I didn't wanna do it because the dance was kind of, it was, it was, it was traveling and it was kind of--it was, it was not clear.  And they called and Miss Haywood and Miss Jones were terribly delighted that I got this offer.  And they were very encouraging that I do that, because that was something that they wanted me to do.
Speaker 1: This is what year?
Speaker 2: Oh dear.  Well, I'm out of high school for sure.  I'm still at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], so maybe this is like--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970] or so.
Speaker 2: Something like that, right.  And I'm thinking that gee, I just wanna stay home.  I just wanna have a regular Christmas.  I wanna go to my [maternal] grandparents' [Lucille Davis and Coley Davis] house and I wanna be with all my cousins and, and maybe I'm becoming a (air quotes) normal person, unbeknown to me.  I didn't want to do it.  So I finally get myself together and I go and I do it.  And I did very well.  I mean it was, it was great, it was wonderful.  But my heart really wasn't in it.
Speaker 1: And where were you performing?
Speaker 2: Well I was still in D- Royal Winnipeg, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet company in Winnipeg, Canada.
Speaker 1: Did you travel at all?
Speaker 2: No.  It was, it was local.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't the earth-shattering experience some thought it might be.
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't an earth-shattering experience to me.  I mean I did it and I did very well, but it wasn't earth-shattering, you know because I, I was vacillating, you know.  I--and the one thing about dance is that it teaches you how to do things you don't wanna do and do it, do it very well.  It doesn't mean your heart is in it at all.
Story_ID: 579974
Speaker 1: What did you do next?  How long did you remain at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I stayed there until it was time for me to go to Moscow [Russia], which was in 1973.  I had to come out to start a very rigorous training process.
Speaker 1: So tell me about this Moscow experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that took, that whole experience took--the training took a whole year.
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: I came here 10:00 in the morning, I did class, then I started rehearsing.  I left here at about maybe 3:30 or 4:00.  I went home, showered, came back, taught my children's class.  Then I did the night shift with all of the repertoire things that Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] had for me.  So the Moscow thing was in the morning.
Speaker 1: And this was training for the international ballet company.
Speaker 2: Yes, the Second International Ballet Competition in Russia [Moscow, Russia].  That's what that--
Speaker 1: So this is a big deal.
Speaker 2: This is, now this is a big deal.  Okay so is my heart into it?  Yeah.  Is it serious?  Yes, because you know you've heard all the lectures and the, the one thing about this building is that the lectures you don't wanna hear them over and over and over and over again, because it is a beat down like you wouldn't believe.  And that pull--that takes your energy somewhere else.  So you try to avoid that.  So now my head is in the game.  And we go and it's--and it goes--
Story_ID: 579975
Speaker 1: Before we return to the Moscow training [for the Second International Ballet Competition, Moscow, Russia], I wanted you to tell me a little bit about the behind-the-scenes culture of ballet.  You see lots of things.
Speaker 2: Well, you see lots of things.  I was one that never even started to smoke, because I didn't really have a weight problem until I got older.  But I don't smoke.  Dancers who purge because they feel guilty and they--if they eat something and--
Speaker 1: Was there lots of pressure to stay thin when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I remember the first time I was seventeen years old and I had come to pointe class, and we had to wear white leotard.  And I walked into the studio to take my place at the barre, and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] did just like that (gesture).  And I turned around and from the barre to the piano, my mind is racing.  I'm like okay what is it now?  So by the time I get to her, she says, "Do you know that you're gaining weight?"  And I said "Well, no."  And she says, "Well you are, and you need to do something about it, and do something about it now."  Now she doesn't tell me what to do.  So here again, the dancer is left wide open.  So that's why we always pray that young dancers have good sense.  So--
Speaker 1: But you never had some of the--some African American ballerinas talk about the difficulty with hips and the big behind and things like that.  You never had those issues (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, because white dancers have the same problems.  That's not applicable only to us, you know.  So I just don't believe that it is, you know, because when you're in this (air quotes) white world with dancers, you see everything just like you see it anywhere else.  So--
Speaker 1: So you saw eating disorders, smoking--
Speaker 2: Or just eating nothing, you know.  And we were not, we were coached to think that if you, if you ate what you were supposed to and you, and you had a healthy diet, and you worked hard in class, that it would balance itself out.  So when she's, when she did this to me and she said you know, "You're gaining weight."  And I said, "Well I didn't know that."  And she says, "Well you are."  So I knew at that time I had started to drive, and I drove my mother's [Elizabeth Davis Speed] car to school.  And every lunch break we went to McDonald's.  And so I knew that that was, that was the different part of my behavior that was making me look different, so I stopped doing it.  And in a, a month, that five or seven pounds was gone.  So you know, but she, she, she put the pressure on us to, to stay thin, but, but healthy thin, not anorexic or, or anything like that.
Story_ID: 579976
Speaker 1: And so during your training for Moscow, for the International Ballet Company [sic. Second International Ballet Competition, Moscow, Russia], that was pretty rigorous it sounds.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life, and it was hard on me in every aspect of a human being.  It was difficult emotionally; it was difficult physically; it was difficult--I always had to keep my coping skills intact because many times I wanted to pick up my bag and walk out of that door.  Nothing I ever did was right, was never good enough.
Speaker 1: Give me an example of the--with Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones], what did they do on occasion?
Speaker 2: Well, on occasion it was just, it was just the relentless repetition.  And with them sometimes, there was no--there was--it, it seemed like, and I'm sure it was a meth- there was a method to their madness.  But it seemed like to me, okay, if you put an unbelievable amount of stress on the same muscle group, you have to give it a rest.  That's just common sense to me.  But it didn't seem like it was common sense to, to them sometimes.
Speaker 1: And you were practicing how many hours a day?
Speaker 2: I was here from about 10:00 until about 3:30 or 4:00.  Then because I lived in walking distance, and then I came back to teach my children's class because they were also grooming me in that way as well.  So I had a, a children's class that I was responsible for, and I had to do lesson plans.  I had to be real clear of what they were gonna learn and what my approach was and what the objectives.  So I had all of that on me too.
Speaker 1: Were you the star student?
Speaker 2: Well I don't think I was the most talented student.  But I do think that I was the most compliant student because what they said was the gospel.  And nobody ever said to me that what they said was not the gospel.  So I, I took it at face value.  And it always was very rewarding to me if you ever got a compliment from either one of them.  And it was something that everybody in this building wanted, but I don't think they wanted to put that kind of time in to get it.
Speaker 1: Was there a distinction between the Jones-Haywood School [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] and the Capitol Ballet [Capitol Ballet Company]?
Speaker 2: The Capitol Ballet was the performing arm of the school.  That was the company that performed, and we were paid to do so.  So they were two separate entities, but they both took place in the same building.
Speaker 1: And so with Jones-Haywood, your parents would pay tuition.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then with the ballet company, how, how was that funded?
Speaker 2: You know through grants.
Speaker 1: Were there white benefactors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were.  Who they were at that time, I don't know.  I wasn't--I got a little like stipend to teach my children's class.  But then when I became a (air quotes) full company member, then I was earning a, a paycheck.
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see, maybe I was about maybe early twenties, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 579977
Speaker 1: So taking you back to the Moscow situation [Second International Ballet Competition, Moscow, Russia], tell me about the actual audition.  So you trained for a number of weeks, months?
Speaker 2: A year.  I, I trained a whole year for that, and then it took place in June.  So we left a couple of days prior to when we were all supposed to arrive and we left out of Dulles Airport [Washington Dulles International Airport, Dulles, Virginia], and I remember having a wonderful reception there before I left, a good luck kind of, kind of thing.
Speaker 1: At Dulles.
Speaker 2: At Dulles Airport.
Speaker 1: Were you the only student from Jones-Haywood [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This school, and I--when I got there, I was the only African American female.  My partner at that time was Clover Mathis.  He was a--at that time he was currently a dancer at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, at that time.
Speaker 1: And he was your--you hadn't met him prior to this trip?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You had practiced together.
Speaker 2: We, we trained together as sporadic as it was, because you know he was in a company, so he had to perform.  And he was kind of only here like on Mondays because that's their day off and I would go to rehearsal just like I had a partner.
Speaker 1: Was it a big difference?  I imagine it would be going from being a ballerina, dancing alone, solo performances, and then dancing with a partner.
Speaker 2: Well it's a big difference if you were rehearsing without him because you do have to, you know you do have to get a feel of, of each other.  And because we couldn't rehearse every day.  So I was already somewhat (air quotes) functioning at a deficit.  So I had to be totally responsible for my own work.
Speaker 1: So the idea of being lifted and--
Speaker 2: And all of that, you're right.  That's, that's just for me at that time because he was not here, it was just, it was a feeling in my mind that you have to--you, you just have to know.
Speaker 1: So you lived all of those performances in your head.
Speaker 2: All of those rehearsals.
Speaker 1: The rehearsals, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  And so then maybe before we left, we had a chunk of time that he was here, with permission of course, from Ailey himself so that he could do this.
Speaker 1: Did you meet Alvin Ailey?
Speaker 2: I didn't at that time, but I did later as, as we go through this conversation, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe 19--late '80s [1980s] I believe that's when I met Ailey for the first time.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll have to come back to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 579978
Speaker 1: So tell me about the actual audition [at the Second International Ballet Competition, Moscow, Russia].  You were the only African American woman.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your partner [Clover Mathis] also African American.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was that audition like?
Speaker 2: Well you go and you get, you check in.  And you, you get an ID number and you get assigned to your, your hotel room with a roommate.  I had a girl who was from Brazil, actually, and that was interesting because she was not nearly as stressed as I was.  It was--when, when I compare the two of us, it was almost like she was on a vacation.  And I can remember looking at her at night and wondering, is she serious about this or what?  But you know we all had our own agendas and our own programs.  But it was just interesting that it just didn't seem that her ritual was, was centered on the reason that she was there.  And maybe I was, maybe my anxiety was just too severe.
Speaker 1: What was your ritual?
Speaker 2: Well, I--first of all, and everybody does their different things to, to make them relax.  I mean she had music going on in the room, and, and she was dancing and I mean she had all kinds of--I don't know.  She just didn't seem to me like she was serious.  Now maybe I needed to relax a little bit like she was, but I couldn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were you doing?
Speaker 2: I was just mortified.  I lost twenty-one pounds, and I was very, very nervous because of the accountability, the adjudication of the responsibility, and you know everybody wants the best result at the end of something like that.  So I just didn't have--I think I was very, very, very uptight.
Speaker 1: So the actual--
Speaker 2: Unnecessarily, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Were you greeted with open arms in Moscow [Russia]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  After my first tour, and that's what each section is called.
Speaker 1: And there were three tours.
Speaker 2: Yes.  They--and, and, and the, this, they throw flowers on the stage.  And they did that for me and I was just so emotional.  I mean I just can't even explain to you how wonderful I felt that I was received in the way that I was, you know.  But that still didn't relax me because you know like they say in dance, you're only as good as your last review.  So then the next day it starts all over again.
Speaker 1: And you had to go through your entire performance.
Speaker 2: And so then the next part I had to dance a contemporary pas de deux and a classical pas de deux.  I did not receive enough points to go into the third and final part.
Speaker 1: And how were you feeling now?
Speaker 2: Well I was feeling still overwhelmed.  I was feeling--I didn't feel like I had disappointed anybody.  But I was still overwhelmed because I was still there.  And it was not over yet, kind of, sort of.
Story_ID: 579979
Speaker 1: And give us a sense, for people who might observe your interview who do not come from the world of dance, explain to us how big of a deal this was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This kind of competition could be equivalent to the Olympics, because you are training with first class dancers.
Speaker 1: From all over the world.
Speaker 2: From all over the world.  So it is like that.  And for me coming from America, I had to perform in the Bolshoi [Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, Russia], doesn't get any better than that.  It doesn't.  It's not--even the Taj Mahal [Agra, India] can't match the Bolshoi, and it's a rate stage.  So that's what it's like.  What other events?  Well, I guess the Olympics.
Speaker 1: Were you getting recognition in the American press?
Speaker 2: While I was there?  I got a lot of press before I left, a lot.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Just, just from the newspaper, Essence magazine, the--being invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.] with Betty Ford, and--
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well that was just pomp and circumstance, you know.  It, it was, it was wonderful.  It was very proper.  It was very I guess correct.
Speaker 1: So Betty Ford, the first lady, hosted you and your partner.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who was your partner at the time?
Speaker 2: At that time it was Sylvester Campbell when I went to Bulgaria [Sixth International Ballet Competition, Varna, Bulgaria], right.
Speaker 1: And Bulgaria was when?
Speaker 2: Varna, that was in 1974 and 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So before you go to Bulgaria, was there any other, were there any other highlights from the Moscow experience [Second International Ballet Competition, Moscow, Russia]?
Speaker 2: I remember when I went to Moscow [Russia], this is a good point. I was walking up the steps to the Bolshoi Theatre, and this white man who is obviously intoxicated, he says to me, "What the hell are you doing here?"  And I said to him, "You need to mind your damn business."  And I went straight up the steps and into the front door.
Speaker 1: And what nationality was he?
Speaker 2: He was American.  I mean he spoke English pretty well.  And I had a, I had a coach, her name was Nina [ph.], a Russian dancer.  She was my coach.  Wonderful, wonderful girl.  I often wonder where she is at this point in life.  And she ushered me straight on up the steps because he was getting ready to make a spectacle of himself.  But he was, he was messing with the wrong girl (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you meet or see any other celebrities in the world of dance?
Speaker 2: I saw Maya Plisetskaya.  The grande dame of the Bolshoi Ballet.  I saw Messeroff [sic. Asaf Messerer], her uncle.  Well I guess Maya Plisetskaya, she takes the prize.  In, you know a little Russian girl won gold that year.  She was exquisite, she was fifteen years old.  She was absolutely divine.  I can, I can re- I can still remember sitting in the theater watching her once I had been eliminated.
Story_ID: 579980
Speaker 1: And you returned to the states, and what did you do next?  I know in 1974, Bulgaria.
Speaker 2: Okay, we returned to the states, 1973, and then we go to Bulgaria in 1974 with Sylvester Campbell.  We're gonna try this international thing again on the Black Sea, very beautiful resort.  So by this time I'm a little more experienced.  I'm a little older and a little wiser.  So I'm okay from a anxiety, panicking kind of thing, but I'm still focused.  I have an older partner now 'cause Clover Mathis and I were more less about the same age.  So now I have an older, more seasoned partner and coach.  So we go and this time I accumulate enough points to go all the way through.  And I am rewarded with an honorable mention kind of a recognition, and a cash prize.
Speaker 1: So what's the name of this competition?
Speaker 2: This one was the Sixth International Ballet Competition, Varna, Bulgaria, right.
Speaker 1: What was your--was your cash prize pretty significant for the day?
Speaker 2: For the day if you're gonna spend it in Bulgaria (laughter).  Clearly you can't go to Nordstroms [Nordstrom], but it was, it was, it was just the honor of being recognized in that way, in that kind of an event.
Speaker 1: Now that you have at least two international experiences under your belt, were you able to compare and contrast the social climate of the United States to Russia, Bulgaria?
Speaker 2: The social climate in Bulgaria I thought was better.  Now maybe it's because I'm older.  I have, I have a more seasoned partner so he can help keep me, keep things in, in a better context.  So I think--and this is the other thing that probably now that you mention that, Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] did not go.  See they went with me to Bulgar- to Russia.  So that comes with another whole level of, of pressure and adjudication and evaluation and reprimand and dah, dah, dah, dah.  They did not go.  Sylvester Campbell went with the same kind of qualities, but it was just different, you know.
Speaker 1: And race issue, still a non-issue in Bulgaria?
Speaker 2: In Bulgaria we--just there to do the job.  Just there to do the job.
Speaker 1: And well received.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: Well received.
Story_ID: 579981
Speaker 1: What was next for you?
Speaker 2: Then, we are now in 1975.  Then I get married.  So now I have another part of my life that I've got to sort through and, and work at a standard.
Speaker 1: And this is an era sort of post-civil rights, women's liberation is, is taking off (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are you affected by any of these ideas?
Speaker 2: No.  The good thing I guess that the man that I married didn't have the image that a wife has to be home and fix dinner and clean house and that kind of thing.  And probably because his occupation is not like that.  Law enforcement is just as abstract as dance.  You have to edit on your feet.  Every situation doesn't require the same kind of rules.
Speaker 1: Tell me his name.
Speaker 2: Joseph Nelson Green [Joseph Green].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Connecticut, Hartford, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: And he went to school in Connecticut as well, high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, actually his parents moved to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  He went to D.C. public school.  He went to Calvin Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And where did you two meet?
Speaker 2: At my girlfriend's house, and my girlfriend is equivalent to his god sister.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Linda Shaw [ph.].  I met my husband through Linda Shaw.
Speaker 1: And what--can you tell me anything about the courtship that led to the marriage?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember going over to Linda's house and he was home from Delaware State [Delaware State College; Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] on some, maybe spring break or something like that.  And so--and Linda Shaw is--her temperament is--she's very bossy, you know.  So I come over to her house and Joey says to her kind of like on the side, "Who is that girl?"  And so Linda says, "Well that's my friend Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green].  We, we--" I think I was still in high school [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  We go to Roose- we go to, to school together.  And so Joey says to her, "Well why does she look like that?"  And so he says to her, "What do you mean why does she look like that?"  And so he says, "Well she's so skinny, is she sick?"  And so Linda says no, she's not sick, stupid.  She, she, she takes ballet or something like that.  And so he says, and so Linda says would you like to talk to her?  And so, so then Linda says well I, I'll make these arrangements.  And Linda is just very bossy.  She thinks she's everybody's mother.  So one thing led to the other and so then Joe and I just started dating each other.  Based on her approval, that's kind of how it was.
Speaker 1: Now throughout your tenure as a ballerina, was it difficult to dance?  I mean difficult to date.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.  But when you're young, you can do it.  I could leave here at 9:00 at night and then Joe and I might go have dinner or something or whatever, go home, fix my pointe shoes for the next day, get up, be here at 10:00 and not miss a beat.  I could do that then.
Speaker 1: And so ultimately you got married, 1975.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 579982
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-six [1976], back to Bulgaria?
Speaker 2: Back to Bulgaria.  So I can remember packing.  We [Fortune-Green and Joseph Green] got married, we had the most adorable house.  And I can remember in the extra bedroom I was using that as the room to pack, and I had stuff everywhere.
Speaker 1: Is this in Northwest Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: This is in Northeast [Washington, D.C.].  It was on Faraday Street [sic. Faraday Place], Northeast.  It was a demi-detached house, and it was charming.  It was just enough for the two of us.  And the second bedroom was the room that I used to get ready to go, 'cause you have to be very methodical for packing 'cause it has to be a certain weight and I have to make sure I don't forget anything.  So that's a science project.  So--and he would come home from work and he would say, "I see you're getting yourself ready, you're getting closer and closer."  I said, "Yeah, in a couple of days I'll be gone," you know.  So, so that was a balancing act for me during that time.
Speaker 1: How was the second trip to Bulgaria?
Speaker 2: I had the exact same results as before.  Easier, not so overwhelmed, not terribly anxious, necessarily.  Things are in better perspective and, and just, just good.  Just enjoying it more, you know.  And looking at the other dancers and being a little more inquisitive and more intuitive and--
Speaker 1: Now at this time I'd asked, I'd asked you earlier about Janet Collins.  At this time were you reading more and more about prominent dancers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At this time.  Now, now we're, we are--we're at another level, we're at another level.  And here again I'm still the only black representative, my partner [Sylvester Campbell] and I.  Of course he's not competing, he's just my partner.  So now you're, you're starting to think about well what does all of this really, really mean, and now what do we do with all of this?  And so now we, we--I'm at another level.  I'm married, and so what does all of this mean?
Story_ID: 579983
Speaker 1: So what's the big moment post-Bulgaria?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Post-Bulgaria in 1976.  I'd been married for a year, and so now Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] are trying to encourage me to, and maybe encourage is not the correct word.  But they're concerned about, what are you going to do with dance and a husband?  Okay.  How do those two parts of your life work itself out?  And so really I think that what they are trying to say without saying it is that, we would really like for you to think about leaving D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and find a company, okay.  Well that's not that easy to do.  You know my husband [Joseph Green] is employed with the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] and you know we have a mortgage and, you know, life is gonna, is gonna go somewhere else now.  So, so, so what are we gonna do with this thing called dance?  And so and I said to her, "Well you know I don't wanna leave Washington, D.C.  This, this is where I live and you know my brothers [Curtis Beeler and Michael Beeler] and my mom [Elizabeth Davis Speed] and you know my grandparents [Lucille Davis and Coley Davis] and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm not so sure that--that I need to do that."  So we still have the company here, so that does give me the, the dancing opportunity, but it's, it's, it's in D.C., you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Were they hoping that you would take your career to a place like New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I think they were.  I think they were (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell, at this point I mean, '68 [1968], '69 [1969], he started the Dance Theatre of Harlem.
Speaker 2: At this point DTH is up and running, right, but I'm, I'm thinking that that's not what I want to do.  So the question is--so now the question is well what is it that you do want to do?  So now I've got to really kind of put a plan together because you know I just can't just be whatever that word is, okay.  So, so it's 1976.  So I'm still coming here.  I'm working more in the school [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.].  Working with the children.  And I, and I'm still dancing because we still have Capitol Ballet [Capitol Ballet Company] and I'm still earning some money.  So that takes place in 1976.  Nineteen seventy-seven [1977], the same thing is going on.
Story_ID: 579984
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978], Miss Jones' [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] partner dies, okay.  So now Miss Jones is here alone with a company [Capitol Ballet Company] and a school [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] and she really kind of doesn't have anybody to help her.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the circumstances surrounding Miss Haywood's [Claire Haywood] death?
Speaker 1: She--Miss Haywood died of cancer.  She died of cancer.  And we knew things were going downhill.  We knew it, you know how you know, but nobody tells you?  But we see the wear and tear on Miss Jones.  The fact that she isn't able to spend the kind of time in the studio that she used to, and so when Miss Haywood finally went to the hospital that was where she passed.  And so in 1978 Miss Jones' sister [Celestine Bayne] moves from Boston [Massachusetts] here to Washington, D.C.  And Miss Jones brings in Keith Lee to be her assisting artistic director.  His job is to keep the company working, and he does that.  So also what happens for me in 1978 is that I come on board at Duke Ellington School of the Arts [Washington, D.C.] as a part-time teacher, bingo.  So I come here at 9:00 for company class.  Then, yeah that's right.  Then I leave here at about 12:15 to go to Duke Ellington to teach my classes there.  Then I leave Duke Ellington at 5:00.  I go home, I take a quick shower.  I come here to teach my children's class.  Then I rehearse with Keith Lee and the company until 10:00 p.m.  So now my life is going in another direction, and I do that for as long as Keith Lee was here.  Let me see.  And the--and things are going well.  I mean the grants are coming in, the company is getting paid.  My dancing, my body is looking good.  I'm learning new rep [repertoire].  We have choreographers coming in.
Speaker 2: And so are you the prima ballerina at this point?
Speaker 1: I--sort of, kind of.  But there are other dancers who are equally as good.  These are all new peers now, you know.  Quite a few white dancers.
Story_ID: 579985
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now when did that happen, the integration?
Speaker 2: When Keith Lee came, 1978.  Now at first some of the, some of the older leftovers, we were kind of like, "What is this about?"  You know.  You know how you have those quiet conversations on the side.  But it was--I mean you know we finally were okay with it, you know.  But at first, we were not.
Speaker 1: Was it taboo for them to join Capitol [Capitol Ballet Company]?
Speaker 2: No, it was just you know how people start to personalize stuff.  You say well this is mine, so you can't do that, when theoretically it didn't belong to any of us, it belonged to [HistoryMaker] Doris Jones.  But we took ownership.
Speaker 1: Was there a certain prestige associated with Capitol?
Speaker 2: In terms of?
Speaker 1: In D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  You have the Washington Ballet, the National [National Ballet of Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: I think in the black community, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: But now you have some white dancers here as well.  And so how are they looked upon by the wider public?
Speaker 2: There were concerns, but here again they were, they were only expressed to certain people in certain arenas at certain times.  But when it first, when it first happened, there was a conversation, you know, over in the side, "Why is Mr. Lee bringing all these white dancers in here?"  You know.
Speaker 1: So give me a sense of the numbers.  How many black dancers?
Speaker 2: Well it was a small company, so maybe we had twelve people, which I guess you would call it a chamber size dance company.  And out of those twelve, maybe we had five.
Speaker 1: Five white?
Speaker 2: White dancers, um-hm.  But the fact that we had any because we thought that this is ours, it was a topic of conversation.
Speaker 1: Was anyone writing about this phenomenon?
Speaker 2: No, it was just a conversation.  And you know it's interesting.  I've learned a lot of lessons about what happens to you when you personalize something that doesn't belong to you.  It's taken away is what happens.
Speaker 1: What--how were relationships?
Speaker 2: Relationships were fine.  Relationships were fine.  So then Keith Lee did his, his time and then we had Billy Wilson come in as Ms. Jones' assisting director, and that had its ups and downs as far as I was concerned because a girl named Sabine [Sabine LaBonne], she was a white dancer.  She was casted in a role, which was fine.
Speaker 1: What role was it?
Speaker 2: Billy Wilson's 'Afternoon of a Faun.'  And she was partnered by Nat Orr [Nathaniel Orr].  And two or three days before our opening season, they said that I had to do 'Afternoon of a Faun.'  And I was furious.  And the reason was because opening season they needed me to be the dancer in that particular pas de deux.  And I said, "Well why is that?"  "Well we just need somebody black to be in that role."  And I said, "Well are you just discovering that Sabine was not black?"  I was furious because it meant that I had to spend time rehearsing a ballet that I hadn't been rehearsing in off season.  I knew it, but I hadn't had the coaching.  And then here again the attitude comes in, and I'm famous for that.  But I did it, but I was not pleased with how it was done, you know.
Story_ID: 579986
Speaker 1: Do you remember who attended some of these performances, like that one ['Afternoon of a Faun,' Billy Wilson] in particular, that opening performance in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just, just the general public.
Speaker 1: Were there an- you know sort of any of the prominent figures in D.C. at that time, the mayor?
Speaker 2: Unbeknown to me, because you know why?  When you have to dance, you only think about what your job is.  And not necessarily--I mean of course you read the review the next night, but it's not really all that important I wouldn't think because you have a job to do and you're gonna do it well if John (Unclear) is sitting in there, or some other prestigious person.  You're gonna do the same quality.
Speaker 1: Do you remember having other dancers come?  I mean people like [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham has done some revolutionizing of dance.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, she never came to anything that we did.
Speaker 1: What about you mentioned before [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell.  Did he make the trek down (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Arthur Mitchell was not a permanent audience member, no.  He, he came down for the Moscow extravaganza [Second International Ballet Competition, Moscow, Russia] in support of me, but then our relationship started to dissipate as the years went on.
Speaker 1: Just because of time and space?
Speaker 2: Well I would like to think that it's time and space (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) How would you compare what was happening here in D.C. with Capitol Ballet [Capitol Ballet Company] and the Dance Theatre of Harlem?
Speaker 2: Well, in terms of performing opportunities and touring opportunities, clearly the Dance Theatre of Harlem was superior because of who they were and who Mr. Mitchell was, and the fact that he was in the right place at the right time.  And the kind of support that he got.  We didn't have that.  On the level of training and dancing well and who we were exposed to in the studio, I would say from a quality point of view, it was the same.  It's just that his was more--his quantity was more.  But quality wise, it was the same.  We invited Lydia Abarca, one of his principal dancers, to dance here with us one year, and she was equal as everybody else, so.
Story_ID: 579987
Speaker 1: Now I know that [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell was fueled by the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] as well.  You mentioned that that was a pivotal moment for you.
Speaker 2: Just, just for my inner self.  Not, not in, in, in his, in his global sense.  Mine was more internal.  I didn't feel that I needed to make a statement in that regard.  Mine was just more internal.  Because here again, we were true to the cause and true to the commitment.  It was just more internal and more personal.
Speaker 1: Were you conscious of the larger political climate of D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at this time?  Elections and people like [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had a lot of summer opportunities to be paid because of Marion Barry.  We could go to the Department of Employment Services [D.C. Department of Employment Services] and sign up for a summer job and be paid and come to this building and train.  That was our summer job, learning and training because of Marion Barry.
Speaker 1: And what was this called officially?
Speaker 2: Summer youth employment job opportunities.  I can't remember.
Speaker 1: So he was supportive of the arts?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was an avid supporter of the arts, and an avid supporter in young people.  And all of us had a summer job.  And we didn't have to work at McDonald's, or any of the other kinds of summer jobs.  We came to this building and we studied and we trained.  That was our summer job.  Now Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] had to work out the logistics.  You know we had to--they had to do their part so that we were able to do that.  And so therefore, we earned a little money, our skill kept growing, and our informational base about dance continued to have more volume.
Story_ID: 579988
Speaker 1: So take me from the '70s [1970s] up until the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Up until the '80s [1980s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) over the highlights.
Speaker 2: The '80s [1980s], okay.  I'm still at Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.], 1970--1983 my mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] dies.  Now that year, okay, all right so now by this time Capitol Ballet [Capitol Ballet Company] is defunct.  No money, can't make payroll, dancers can't wait around until you write some grant and so forth and so on.  So now there's no company.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that period of struggle?
Speaker 2: Yes I do, 'cause they had a meeting up there in the living room and, and payroll was very, very, very problematic.  So now the company has dissolved.  So this is what I do.  I go to Washington Ballet and consequently, I know what it was.  The year my mother died, 1983, she died--her funeral was Christmas Eve, 1983.  And Mary Day, the director of Washington Ballet, had an interview on '60 Minutes.'  And somebody asked her how come there were no black dancers in Washington Ballet.  And she said, and this is not a quote, this is, this is my understanding of what she said.  Well you know black dancers are not really suited.  And my phone was ringing off the hook.  "Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green], did you hear what Mary Day said about black dancers?"  And dah, dah, dah, dah.  I said, "What?"  And somebody said, "You should go and audition for a job there," and I did.  It was a dare and I did it (laughter).  I hate to say--I shouldn't be saying this.  And so I went for the audition and I was accepted with the condition.  I didn't wanna tour because I knew I had to keep my teaching job.  I knew I had to keep paying into social security.  I knew I had to keep doing that.  So Miss Day said, "Okay, fine."  So you'll just do the local performances and you won't have to tour.
Speaker 1: Wow, that was huge.
Speaker 2: That was huge.  That was huge.  And I went to Washington Ballet.  I was respected.  I got to dance the Balanchine [George Balanchine] rep [repertoire].  I was--I got good reviews, and no problem.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of those specific ballets in addition--
Speaker 2: I did 'Concerto Barocco,' Balanchine.  I did 'Scotch Symphony' [George Balanchine]. I did 'Fives' choreographed by Choo San Goh who was the resident at that time.  We did Albinoni [Tomaso Albinoni].  That was kind of like a modern pas de deux, which I did.  Let me see, we did--
Speaker 1: Now were you partnered during this time?  Were you doing romantic roles?
Speaker 2: We, we did 'Nutcracker' ['The Nutcracker,' Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky].  Twenty-two performances of 'Nutcracker.'  We did--mostly we did Choo San's, Goh's work because he was the resident choreographer at that time.  Wonderful, wonderful teacher and choreographer.  And I must say that he liked the way I danced.  So that was a short term good experience.  So I would go to Washington Ballet; company class was at 9:15.  Then I would run down the street to Duke Ellington.  And then while I was at Washington Ballet, Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] was mad at me.  She wouldn't speak to me.  Because now I'm not committed to what's going on here [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.].  So I couldn't come because of rehearsals or a costume fitting or photograph session.  I just couldn't do it.  But she did come to see me dance before the season was over. And so then I said, "Okay Sandra, now okay, now how much longer do you think you can act like you fifteen years old 'cause you're tired now, you know?"  So I stayed there for a year, and it was a good year.  I can go to Washington Ballet right now and get anything I want.  Last--couple of years ago I did a ballet, a classical piece for my kids at Ellington.  I went to Washington Ballet and they let me wear some--let me use some jackets for the boys.  No cost.  Here, whatever, you know.  So it's, it's all good, it's all good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How would--
Story_ID: 579989
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How would you compare the training, the performances at the Washington Ballet to the training at the Jones-Haywood School [Jones-Haywood School of Ballet; Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.], and the performances with Capitol Ballet [Capitol Ballet Company]?
Speaker 2: All of the same caliber, and all with the same expectation, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how were you treated at the Washington Ballet by other dancers?
Speaker 2: I was, I was fine.  I was fine.  No pecking order, no hierarchy, because everybody has the same struggles.  I mean their struggles are no better or no different, you know.  I had a problem.  I had a blister on the back of my heel, and you know the last thing you want to do really is to succumb to any kind of discomfort.  And so in one of the rehearsals, Choo San [Choo San Goh] said to me, "Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green], what is wrong with your foot?"  And I said, "I have a heel, a blister on the back of my heel.  And you have to put the pointe shoe on every day, it won't heal."  He said, "Dear, take the shoe off.  It's not that deep."  But you know dancers are always trying to prove something, you know.  And at some point you have to say okay, this makes absolutely no sense, so.
Speaker 1: But you made history at the Washington Ballet.
Speaker 2: I kind of think so.  I, I kind of think so.  I was there with Charles Calhoun, he was a black male.  Nat Orr [Nathaniel Orr] was there.  I was the only girl at that time.
Story_ID: 579990
Speaker 1: And so what was next for you?  How long did you--
Speaker 2: I just stayed there a year.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I just stayed there a year.
Speaker 1: --recommit yourself to the Capitol Ballet [Capitol Ballet Company] in a new way?  And Duke Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.] as well.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, well see I, I never relinquished my contract at Duke Elling-.  The chairperson was just working with me.  I was feeling guilty about not being able to come all the time.  And Edith Williams [ph.] was the chairperson at the time, and she said, "If you withdraw your contract from D.C. Public Schools, you will never get back in."  And boy was she correct.  So she said you just work, I'm just working with the situation, and she did.  But she encouraged me not to quit because she said, "Down the line you gonna need this teaching job," and she was so right.  And I was part-time at that time.  Now I'm full time.  She was so right.
Speaker 1: Now then most of your students, black kids from the city.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did they absorb this?  Were they, were they thirsty for this instruction?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We had a kid Terrence, Terrace Jones [ph.] who graduated from Ellington.  He went right to the Washington Ballet, right out of high school.  He was ready; he was good.  He didn't quite have the maturity because he didn't understand the structure.  He was new and he was young and he thought he could stand in the front line in a company class.  But, you know once you, once you teach them you're new, your, your place is in the back.  But you know it's a learning process.  So he went to Washington Ballet.  Couple of kids passed through there in the summertime, yeah.
Story_ID: 579991
Speaker 1: When was your daughter born?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1982.
Speaker 1: And tell me about her, what's her name?  When was she born (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her name is Kellye Elizabeth Green [Kellye Green].
Speaker 1: Spell her name.
Speaker 2: K-E-L-L-Y-E.
Speaker 1: Y-E.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she was born when?
Speaker 2: And she was born in February 1st, 1982.
Speaker 1: So that was another turning point in your life.
Speaker 2: Yes indeedy (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you did--you had a baby, then you joined Washington Ballet.
Speaker 2: Yes indeedy, yes indeedy.  And it still is, twenty-five years old.  So I've had some challenges.  But you know what?  I think going to Russia was the creme de la creme.  And the second challenge was when my mother [Elizabeth Davis Speed] died.  I was not ready for that.  I was not even remotely ready for that.
Speaker 1: Was she sick?
Speaker 2: My mother died of an aneurysm, a brain aneurysm, of which I had the exact same thing in April of 1997.  I was in a coma for almost, let's see, April, almost a month.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And when my mother had her aneurysm, she was babysitting Kellye.  It was during the Christmas holidays.  It was the last day of work, D.C. Public Schools.  And I said to my brother, I said, "Come on and ride with me and let me pick up Kellye."  And I said, "Well gee, I'm so tired.  I really should do it tomorrow," and Curtis [Curtis Beeler] says, "No, let's do it now because it's the holidays.  We need to go grocery shopping, we haven't cleaned up the house, we don't have a tree," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Let's go now.  So I said okay, let's go.  So I drive over to Hyattsville [Maryland] which is where she lives, and when I turned up her street, there was an ambulance.  And I said gee, I wonder what's going on.  When I saw the paramedics go up her steps, I freaked like crazy.  So I got there and her husband, Calvin Speed, husband number three, had just come home by sheer coincidence because he was a tractor trailer driver.  So he drove trucks long distance, but he just happened to come home at that time.  My mother was laying on the floor, the house was full of smoke because she was heating up Kellye's dinner.  And we rushed them both out to the hospital because Kellye had to be checked for smoke inhalation.  And it was said to me that my mother had a ruptured aneurysm, and she was hooked up to lifesaving equipment.  So that went on for a couple of days.  And then the time comes where you have to be disconnected because she's brain dead.  And the doctor said to me, my two brothers and all of my first cousins, "You need to be checked because this is hereditary."
Story_ID: 579992
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna--before I get to the 1990s, your mom [Elizabeth Davis Speed] passed away rather suddenly in 1983.  And your father [Raymond Fortune (ph.)]--
Speaker 2: Passed away in November of 1994.
Speaker 1: Oh, '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So one right after the other.
Speaker 1: Eighty, '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: I mean, I'm sorry, '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mom is '83 [1983], Dad is '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: And how did your father pass?
Speaker 2: Kidney failure.  He was in the hospital for the last of many, many, many, many times, and there was talk of a nursing home.  And his wife, the second Elizabeth Fortune [ph.], was really not able to care for him at home anymore.  So now there was talk about a nursing home.  And I really just believe that he gave up.  I really do.  He was not taking his medication.  He just--and you know when your spirit gives up, the body just doesn't, doesn't know, it doesn't have anything to keep it going.  So I, I would--I believe that's what finally happened.
Speaker 1: So that was a, a tough couple of years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Story_ID: 579993
Speaker 1: How did you I guess channel your emotions?  Were you still dancing?
Speaker 2: Let's see, let's see '84 [1984].  Well no, but I was still very much, I was really into my teaching at that point.  I really, really was.  My head was, was in teaching for real now.  There was still conversation about revitalizing Capitol Ballet [Capitol Ballet Company], and actually it did come back for a hot minute in 1988.  We had a benefit performance as, as a kickoff to the revitalization.  And that performance really was the last time I performed.  We had guest artists of [HistoryMaker] Louis Johnson.  We had Chita Rivera.  We had--April Barry from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performed.  We had Sylvester Campbell.  We had Hinton Battle.  Miss Jones [HistoryMaker Doris Jones] resurrected everybody, and it was wonderful.  However, it was a brilliant kickoff.  It was kind of like a family reunion, it was at The Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.] in the Eisenhower Theater, but it didn't actually kickoff.  So that was my last time performing for real.  Now I just play around with stuff, so.
Speaker 1: And what did you perform that night?
Speaker 2: I did the pas de deux from 'Don Q' ['Don Quixote'] with Sylvester Campbell.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what the experience was like on the stage that night at The Kennedy Center?
Speaker 2: It was daunting.  When I look at the videotape now, you can see that, you can see a little tension in my face.  But you know when--but that's me, that's who I am, you know.  So that was--luckily I was able to retrieve the, the video from that event out of this building as I sought--continued to look through Miss Jones' estate.  So I have that as a part of my archival collection.
Speaker 1: Could you hear the audience or the see audience from the stage, or did you tune 'em out?
Speaker 2: You don't pay that any attention, because your mind is not on that (laughter).  You just know that when it's time for the pirouettes, you better be on your legs.  So that's where your, that's where your head is, or at least that's where it should be.
Speaker 1: How are you received at the end?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Because I think in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], it is something that is so needed, and over the years Capitol Ballet has had great support.  Even if it's no more than buying a ticket.  We've never had the kind of salary support.  We've never toured or anything like that.  There was a time where we, we danced at the black colleges [HBCUs].  But in terms of a real (air quotes) touring season, we just didn't have the, the financial support to do that kind of a thing.
Speaker 1: Were all of the administration support you mentioned, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, Sharon Pratt Kelly [HistoryMaker Sharon Pratt], was she supportive as well?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  We always were very well supported through D.C. Commission on the Arts [D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities], and National Endowment [National Endowment for the Arts], and any private donors that Miss Haywood [Claire Haywood] and Miss Jones knew.  They were very, very strategic and had a different kind of what I would say unorthodox way of doing whatever they wanted to do.
Story_ID: 579994
Speaker 1: What did the '90s [1990s] have in store for you?
Speaker 2: The '90s [1990s], by the time we're at the '90s [1990s], let's see.  Everything is kind of--the, the hurricane is over for me a little bit at that time.  Things are going along well.  I've--just kind of coasting until I have an aneurysm in '97 [1997].  I was at Wilson High School [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.], at--I had taken my daughter to swim practice 'cause she was on a swim team by this time.
Speaker 1: And which school?
Speaker 2: She was on a swim team called the Metro Marlins.  It's a, no, no, no, that's, that's wrong.  She was on a swim team, department of recreation, D.C. [D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation].  So she was on the D.C. swim team for the department of recreation.  And their swim practice was at Wilson High School.  So I take her to swim practice, and the parents and myself, we decide that we're going to take a water aerobic exercise class at the other end of the pool.  And when I get there, I'm really tired and I kind of don't wanna do it.  But they're like, "Come on Ms. Green [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green], it's gonna be fun, we're gonna have a good time."  So I put on my swimsuit and I get in the pool and it's a good workout because the swim instructor is a former student of mine.  So she's like, "I'm going to get you back."  But it was all good.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her, her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Cheryl [ph.].  I don't remember her last name.  But she says see, I'm gonna get you back for all those grand battement you used to make us do.  So she was the instructor and we're over on the other side of the pool, and the parents and I, we're just, just doing the exercise.  So at the end of the workout, I go in the dressing room and I just put on some sweatpants and a t-shirt.  I'm ready to go.  My daughter, she's got to take a shower, she's got to wash her hair, and I'm like, "Kellye [Kellye Green], can you please come on, I wanna go."  But she's got to go through her whole ritual.  So she's finally ready, no.  She's not ready yet; I'm outside waiting for her.  And I'm speaking to one of the swim parents, her name was Linda [ph.].  And I say to Linda, I said, "Gee, I feel like I'm gonna faint."  And she said, "Girl if you fall, I'll catch you."  And lo and behold, I saw myself go down.  Now if Kellye had been dressed as quickly as I was, I would have been in my car.  You see how things work out the way they're supposed to.  So I was able to get immediate care, and I go to Georgetown University [MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], the best neurosurgery hospital in this area with Dr. Kevin McGrail [Kevin M. McGrail], written up in the Washingtonian magazine all the time.  He was my doctor.  And that's why I'm sitting here right now.
Story_ID: 579995
Speaker 1: But you were in a coma for a month.
Speaker 2: I went in April, early April, I wanna say it was April the 7th.  And I was able to return to Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.] for their spring dance concert the Memorial Day weekend in May, and every last one of those seniors stepped off of that stage, and gave me a rose, and I was in tears.  And then after I was recognized for a, a blessed return, then the concert went on.  And you could see, I could--it's been almost ten years now and I can--it still fills me up because--and the kids were sneaking out of school, coming over to the hospital to see me, and I was in critical care and I couldn't understand how they were getting in.  They were like, "Ms. Fortune [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green], are you gonna come back?"  And I said well I hope so.  So, so after I had physical therapy and physical therapy and the speech pathologist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you had to relearn--
Speaker 2: I had to relearn.
Speaker 1: Almost everything.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I did lose my ability to smell.  But I remember what everything smells like, and I'm always flattered with myself when I try a new perfume and somebody says to me, "You smell divine."  There was a man at the gas station, he said, "Oh my god, what is that you have on?  You smell absolutely gorgeous."  And I told him, he says, "I'm gonna get some of that for my wife."  And I said, "Yeah, okay."  But what do you do?  You just keep doing what you do.
Speaker 1: A miracle of sorts.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So I'm very thankful for that.  There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about that 'cause it didn't have to end up like that.  So now I learned how to complain less and just gather up your energy and do what you have to do.
Story_ID: 579996
Speaker 1: At some point in there your daughter went away.
Speaker 2: She went to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000], June 29th, 2000.  That's when all the plebes as they recalled, as freshman, must report.  They call that Reception Day.
Speaker 1: Is this the vision you had?  Did you think your daughter would wind up at West Point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are you kidding?  No indeedy.  I wanted her to go to Washington University.  No indeedy.  This was, this was Kellye [Kellye Green] and Joe [Joseph Green].  That was, that was their little--
Speaker 1: 'Cause he had a military background as well.
Speaker 2: Well I think law enforcement, military.  It's, it's all pretty connected to some degree.  That's what I think.
Speaker 1: Well it's a prestigious place, West Point.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think that she would become a dancer?
Speaker 2: No.  Kellye was in my dance class.  And, and it was messing up our relationship because she had a very, she had a very good body, but she was very weak.  And the kind of muscle tone that she needed because she was--she's a little taller than I am.  And she was very loose.  And it's, it's hard to train a loose, tall body.  And it just was not good for our relationship, and that's how she ended up on a swim team.  And it toned her very well.  In fact, she made the swim team at West Point, which was quite an accommodation, really.  So but she didn't do it because they have swim practice at 3:00 in the morning (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so she graduated from West Point with a degree in--
Speaker 2: Engineering management.
Speaker 1: And she did some time in Iraq?
Speaker 2: She's been to Iraq, she was there for a year.  She was in Taji [Iraq], yeah.  So she's home now and she's currently stationed at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs [Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in the last seven years or so, she started West Point in 2000.  Right now it's 2007.
Speaker 2: And she's a captain, and she has about maybe a month, no, a year and maybe four months left before her commitment time is paid back.  I do pray and hope that she will be relinquished.  Because I do understand that some of them are not given permission to leave at this time.  So I hope that she can leave when her time is up.
Story_ID: 579997
Speaker 1: The last couple of years, what have, what have the highlights been for you in your professional and personal life?
Speaker 2: Well, in my personal life, one thing that's kind of exciting is that I'm now eligible to retire from D.C. Public Schools.  I have the paperwork on my table.  I still haven't filled it out yet, though, but I'm sure that when the time comes, it'll feel right and I will do it.  I'm very proud of my tenure at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: What's your position there?
Speaker 2: I'm a part-time instructor in their dance majors degree program.  I'm very proud of that.  I'm going--I've been there since the inception of the new degree, which was 1994.  So I'm very proud of that tenure.  The highlights are when we take the Ellington [Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.] kids out of the city.  We take them to the International Association of Blacks in Dance.  We take them to the conference.  Last year we took them to Toronto [Canada].  And we've taken them to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and we take them to the National High School Dance Festival in Miami [Florida].  So those are highlights because that's fun for the kids.  We've taken them to Bermuda to perform.  And, and all of it is dance performance related.  So those were some of the highlights for me.  Another highlight is that we've gone through probate in [HistoryMaker] Doris Jones' estate so now I am the official owner of the school [Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: You've come full circle.
Speaker 2: I've come full circle.  So now I just have to be grateful and thankful and not complain and not look at the glass if it's half empty, 'cause I have a tendency to do that.  I can find everything wrong and I, I neglect to see what's right first.  Eventually I get to it, but I will always go to what we need to fix first.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be as you look back on your life?
Speaker 2: As I look back on my life, I would like for one of these children in this very same school [Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] to grow up and have the kind of dance life and personal life that I have had, so that I can pass the torch.  That's what I would like.  I would like for this institution to continue to flourish by one of the students that come, that are raised in this building.
Speaker 1: So in a sense [HistoryMaker] Doris Jones passed the torch to you upon her passing, in a sense.
Speaker 2: In a sense.  She made it hard, but why would I expect it to be easy?  I believe that.  I believe that she purposely made this as difficult as it has been.  But I didn't give up; I continued to navigate through it because it was what I wanted.  And her nephew had no interest in preserving her legacy.  He just wanted to fulfill his responsibility as the executor of her estate, and move on with his life.
Speaker 1: What would you like young black kids to learn as they study your life and the life of Doris Jones?
Speaker 2: These girls, how to navigate through any challenge with poise, dignity, commitment and integrity.

Speaker 1: What is your hope for the future?  Your future and the future of these young dancers.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My future is that I wanna have some time in my life where I can just do what I wanna do.  I love to be able to do what I want to do.  I like to be outside, I like to exercise, I like to swim, I like to look at old movies.  I love to go shopping; I call it retail therapy.  I love to laugh.  What I would like to do here in this school [Jones-Haywood Dance School, Washington, D.C.] is to cultivate, cultivate and try to interest these young children that if you wanna do this thing called dance, there are so many options for you.  Yes you can go to college.  Yes you can have a career.  I was on cloud nine last Saturday.  I had two parents come to me and say, "Sandra [HistoryMaker Sandra Fortune-Green], my daughters want conservatory training."  Well you would have thought that I had won the lottery.  I talked to them for almost two hours about, "Okay, this is what we, this is what we need to do now," you know.  One of them went to the, went to a dance audition.  I would have never thought that these two children even remotely had an interest in this beyond twelfth grade.  It changed my whole perspective of these two girls; I couldn't believe it.  So that's what I wanna do because the constituency that comes here, the goal is Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].  And that's the only world that they know.  So now I'm trying to give them some other worlds that are, that have the same kind of prestige, so--
Speaker 1: Has it been a life well lived so far?
Speaker 2: I think so, so far I think so.  I'm very blessed, I'm very thankful.  And I just have to be more mindful of that.
Speaker 1: Sandra Fortune-Green, thank you so much for this wonderful interview today.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
