Story_ID: 26710
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side and your father's side but separately so we can keep them you know apart and then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: She was Jeanne Belle Kaiser and that's--
Speaker 1: How can you--can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: --the Jeanne is J-E-A-N-N-E and the Kaiser is K-A-I--K-A-I-S-E-R.  And the Belle, Belle, I said Jeanne Belle Kaiser and Belle is B-E-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth I've written it, can I look at my sheets?
Speaker 1: Was it about 1900 or--?
Speaker 2: Hmm?  It's in the writing that I gave you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she died when she was ninety-four [years old].  I know that she, I know her birthday was November the 23rd.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I forget what year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it before 1900?
Speaker 2: Was it before 1900?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I was born, in fact that's a good, good, since--I was born 1919 and she was 20 hmm, 22 or 23 years old when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about 1897 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now--and where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: Where was my mother born?  My mother was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, sir can you tell us what you know about your mother's family, how far back can you trace them and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no--I know that my mother's mother was a seamstress.  My grandfather on my mother's side was a Pullman Porter and he made the long trips from Philadelphia to Los Angeles [California] when they first started doing that.  That's about all I know that he did.  I'm not sure whether he was--I think he was the dining car steward, something like that.
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories about your family, your mother's family living anywhere else than Philadelphia?  Did they come from the south or someplace?
Speaker 2: No, I, all I know is that they were in Philadelphia and she was proud of that, because my father's family came from Maryland and she was just proud of the fact that before the Civil War and all that, her family was in Philadelphia.  But I don't know where they came from before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 26711
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories about growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that your--are passed down from your [maternal] grandparents or anything?
Speaker 2: Not from that side of the family no stories.  None that she relate--the only thing she, my mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser] would say was that the kids at school teased her because of her name.
Speaker 1: Oh, because of Jeannie Belle, Jeanne Bell?
Speaker 2: Jeanne Bell, yes.  That's--they used to call her "Jeannie" Belle because she spelled Jeanne like the French spelled Jeanne and they were used to the American, you know Americans still spell it J-E-A-N and that's it.  But she said the kids teased her at school about--and called her Jeannie Belle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a, my mother was a seamstress too, a dressmaker.
Speaker 1: Now did she have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to high school I know and that's as far as she went.
Speaker 1: Do you know what high school she attended in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your grandfather have any stories about being a Pullman Porter?
Speaker 2: My grandfather on my mother's side?  I never--she was--he was dead by the time she got married.  And she didn't have any stories about him that you know I recall.  In fact she didn't say much about her mother either.  She made much of the fact that she had ended up living with some cousins, that's right.  Her mother died too before she finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26712
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: Yes. Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Albert Queely Stewart.  Queely is Q-U-E-E-L-Y, I think.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind his middle name?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  There is a story but I don't recall it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's people came from Salisbury, Maryland which is close to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I did visit them when I was in college.  I visited my grandmother and grandfather there.
Speaker 1: Do you know the year your father was born?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't find any information about his birth or the death.  When I looked it up I looked in my files and I couldn't find that easily.  I've, I'm not sure but I know he was older than my mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser].  I don't know how many years older he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was born sometime in the 1890s would you guess?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Maybe, you think he was maybe born within ten years of your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So some time in the 1890s I guess he was born.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did some calculations and I ended up thinking that my grandfather on my father's side must have been a baby during, at the time of emancipation proclamation.  So you know I, and I think he was in his first five years as a child from all I can remember, my grandfather that is you know.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories on your grandfather's side about the Civil War or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there's, there are stories but I don't put much credence in it.  I've been told that my great grandfather was a politician, high up in Maryland--in politics and somebody said he was a governor once but I, that's, those--that story I discredit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he would have been a white politician?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well he--my father was much lighter than my mother and when I met my grandparents, my grandfather was much lighter than--he looked white and, which wasn't unusual at that time.  But that was in Salisbury, Maryland.
Speaker 1: So it would have been that, it would have been your great grandfather was a child of the governor of Maryland?
Speaker 2: No, my great grandfather was--my grandfather was a child of this guy who was a politician, they claim and apparently had children by apparently a slave wife or something so that's all I can figure out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know the governor's name?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the governor that--?
Speaker 2: Just Stewart is the only--
Speaker 1: Stewart.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the only name--
Speaker 1: So that would be the name that's passed down.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't think it was important enough to even look it up but I think that should be easily checked come to think of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could, well if you knew--know the names of your relatives and can see if they were associated with the governor there's a possibility.  I mean I don't know if you could ever know for sure but--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --unless you did a DNA test and I don't know if that's really conclusive you know these days (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I didn't hear that.
Speaker 1: --call.  I, I'm not sure if there's a conclusive way of doing it.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: You can you know find, if you know the names you can find if they were in the same region or if--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --they were on his property or you know (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, I agree.  They--although he might have had children by a slave, he might not have used his own name for those children, right.
Speaker 1: Right, when--sometimes all the slaves on a plantation use the name of the master, the last name (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well interestingly enough, the, remember the story--my grandfather on my father's side and my father were all carpenters, okay.  And then some of the--my uncles were cooks.  And remember that that meant that they weren't field hands because they said that the house slaves were the ones that ended up doing things like being cooks or drivers or craftsmen like carpenters or plumbers or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.  That's true.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 26713
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Albert Queely Stewart] grow up in Maryland?
Speaker 2: My father, they had fourteen children, that I know.  And as far as I can tell my father grew up in that family.  He did not have much formal schooling.  I don't think, I, I'm pretty sure he didn't go to high school in Salisbury, Maryland.  And a new--nearby town, let's see, the name of that town is Quantico, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Oh he's near Quantico, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Maryland.
Speaker 1: Quantico, Maryland, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 26714
Speaker 1: So did your father [Albert Queely Stewart] meet your mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: My father met my mother at Horn and Hardart Restaurant.  They were in--they did--Horn and Hardart was one of the first restaurants that was automatic cause they didn't--people could--didn't sit at a table and have waiters and waitresses.  They got their food out of a display case and my mother and father were in--worked as cooks or chefs, you know part time but not professional chefs.  But my mother worked and as I said, they met in that restaurant.  I don't know how but--
Speaker 1: Now those restaurants are called automats, right?
Speaker 2: Auto what?
Speaker 1: An automat, that's what they called those restaurants.
Speaker 2: Yeah, automat, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I haven't seen one in a long time but they were around for a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was--and a couple of my uncles worked in Horn and Hardart too.
Speaker 1: Okay. And this is in Philadelphia, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26715
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how they [Stewart's parents, Albert Queely Stewart and Jeanne Belle Kaiser] you know fell in love or--?
Speaker 2: Well it's sort of mysterious.  They fell in love and ran away to near Atlantic City, New Jersey as I understand it. But all I--the only story I have is that my father would date her at her, the cousin's she lived with then ran away from there.  Seemed suspicious to me that they ran away for--because they then moved from this [New] Jersey site to Detroit [Michigan] where they were recruiting people for the war. Remember I was born in 1919 and the war was around 1917 and so forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the war would have been over by the time you were born.
Speaker 2: By the time I was born, yeah but they were--when they ran away to Detroit I remember they said that they lived in Hamtramck [Michigan] which was near the Ford [car company] plant.  And that's the only part of the story I gathered.  They moved to Hamtramck and then they moved to--and that was predominantly Polish they said.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And then they moved to a more predominantly African American part of Detroit before they moved to Chicago [Illinois].  And they moved to Chicago because they, apparently my father was having trouble finding work as a carpenter in Detroit after you know, after the war and did--Ford, they talked about Ford as the place he worked, didn't need all of these workers and my father couldn't get a job as a carpenter.  And a--his cousin from Chicago was visiting and she sold them on the idea that there was plenty of work for carpenters in Chicago.  And that's, well they say I was four [years old] when we ended up in Chicago based on that tale I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1923, and you're four 'cause you were born in 1919.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: So right at the end of the war, World War I.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26716
Speaker 1: So your parents [Albert Queely Stewart and Jeanne Belle Kaiser] are now in Chicago [Illinois] in 1923.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So did your father find work in Chicago [Illinois] as a carpenter?
Speaker 2: He found work in Chicago, but then along came the depression.  You know not long afterwards, but he did find work as a carpenter in Chicago and I don't have any tales of him doing anything other than being a carpenter until later when he went to work for Sherwin-Williams [paint company].
Story_ID: 26717
Speaker 1: Is Sherwin-Williams [paint company] out at 115th Street in--out in Pullman [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: He--what did you say?
Speaker 1: I know the Sherwin-Williams plant now is out in Pullman, 111th, 115th Street?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, but I--let me tell you there's a little story there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He [Stewart's father, Albert Queely Stewart] was--my mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser] and this cousin that they lived with didn't get along so my parents moved to an apartment still in Chicago and it was owned by a Jewish couple I know that.  It was a, I think a 12 flat building and then he lost his job during the [Great] Depression.  Didn't have any money, but this Jewish fellow had contacts at Sherwin-Williams and Sherwin-Williams hired laborers at their lithopone plant.  And he got a job for my father at the lithopone plant.
Story_ID: 26718
Speaker 1: There's more to that story too.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well the lithopone plant was on one side of the tracks at the Sherwin Williams [paint company] plant and they were all blacks there and then the other side is where they did the experimental stuff in making paint and so forth, okay.  Well fast forward, when I was in college and getting my bachelor's [degree], I was just a little too young for the draft.  I was in--the Department of Physics at [University of] Chicago was training weathermen for the Tuskegee Air Force.  I got--when I finally had to register for the draft, I got a deferment based on the fact that Chicago, the University of Chicago was going to, would train me to be a meteorologist for the Tuskegee Air Force.  However I graduated, I was still not drafted and I went to the placement office because see I was deferred pending (unclear) being a weatherman.  I went to the placement office at Chicago and the guy there told me that they didn't generally have blacks come in to look for jobs because most of the blacks who went to the University of Chicago were in graduate school and were teachers, mainly in the South generally.  And I know since I lived near the University of Chicago that there weren't anybody from my neighborhood going there.  Well he sent me out to Sherwin-Williams to interview for a job.  My father [Albert Queely Stewart] insisted on taking me.  He had a, he was no longer working there.  They recovery had come and he took me out and while I was being interviewed for a job, he was cursing out the placement people because I was on that side of the tracks where he couldn't go.  Well they hired me at Resin Research at Sherwin-Williams and I worked there until I was drafted.  I don't have it on my resume.  I didn't think about it as much of a place of employment.  I worked as a--in Resin Research as a beginning chemist.
Speaker 2: What year is this?  What--?
Speaker 1: Well I graduated in '42 [1942] and I worked there for over a year and a half or something like that before--I then got drafted because they no longer needed at the end of the war in--or near the end of the war in Europe, they weren't building up the Tuskegee Airmen anymore and they didn't need me and so--and they didn't need Chicago training people.
Story_ID: 26719
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' [Albert Queely Stewart and Jeanne Belle Kaiser] personalities, their sense of humor, their dispositions, how they looked and how they walked, talked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Who do I take after?  I think I take after--that's a good question.  I hate to think of it but I think I take more after my mother and I mean, disposition.  My father was a nice, mild mannered guy and I worked for him as his assistant when he started doing contracting on his own.  I worked as his laborer.  But my mother ran things and strong-willed person and tough, not like my father's a nice, gentle guy as far as I was concerned.
Story_ID: 26720
Speaker 1: Now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: An only child.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So in your household [in Chicago, Illinois] growing up it was just you and your mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser] and father [Albert Queely Stewart]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father after the Sherwin-Williams [paint company] experience, he started con, doing contract work on his own and was successful enough so that eventually they bought a house in--I know, you know I said my mother and this cousin they lived with didn't get along.  They moved to this apartment, my parents moved to this apartment building and then after he got the job at Sherwin-Williams the--this Jewish couple sold that building and my father moved to another place still owing money to this Jewish couple which he continued to pay.  Then they moved from there to another, from the place they moved to was a six flat building.  Then they moved to a two flat building owned by a black, who worked for the post office.  And from there they bought their own house.
Story_ID: 26721
Speaker 1: Did you have to change schools a lot growing up [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Did I have a chance to--?
Speaker 1: Change schools?
Speaker 2: Change schools?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well I went to McCosh Grade School all of my grade career but somehow or other, that neighborhood West Woodlawn was changing.  There were more blacks moving into Chicago and they had not much education and some of the classes were split.  It would be like third grade first--second semester and first--fourth grade first semester in one classroom.  [Coughing] Pardon me, it was a year to finish school.  And I, somehow or other, got to be on the winning side and as blacks were moving from the South, they didn't have much education so I would--got moved--double promoted for example.  Like I was in the--I started out in September in say the third grade and during that year, I got put into the fourth grade.  And then the next year I was--the same thing happened.  So I graduated from grade school after I just turned twelve [years old].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were a year ahead?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--
Speaker 1: Two years, almost two years ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I remember having trouble on the street car when I had enough money to ride the street car to high school.  They--the conductor would want to charge me seven cents which was the adult fare and I wanted to pay three cents because of my age.  But he said I looked too old for that so they'd either kick me off of the train if I, or the street car if I didn't have any money, more money and I generally didn't.  I ended up walking to school most of the time.  But I graduated from--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --high school at, not at eighteen but at sixteen.
Story_ID: 26722
Speaker 1: Tell us about growing up.  Now did you grow up basically in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Basically in Woodlawn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in West Woodlawn.  West Woodlawn was a division, pardon me again-- [Brief Pause - Blowing Nose]
Speaker 1: West Woodlawn was divided from East Woodlawn by Cottage Grove Avenue and kids on the east side went to Hyde Park which was close to the University of Chicago.  West Woodlawn kids went to Englewood High School.
Speaker 2: Okay, right, right.
Speaker 1: And the big division was, there was South Park Avenue.  West Woodlawn was mainly from 63rd Street to 67th Street and there was an amusement park, Atlantic City--White City it was called.  And back as I say, West Woodlawn was changing and whites were moving further south.
Speaker 2: Now where was White City?
Speaker 1: White City was at 63rd and South Park to 67th and South Park I think and then from South Park over to several blocks to the railroad tracks and I forget where the railroad tracks came in.  I think it was like Prairie, well Calumet--there was South Park, Calumet, Prairie, Indiana, something like that and then the train tracks were there and the, White City was 63rd to 67th between South Park and this Prairie and the railroad tracks.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So White City, now that's a remnant of the, must have been a remnant of at least a name of the--
Speaker 1: Louder?
Speaker 2: Yes.  White City--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --sounds like a remnant of the Columbian exposition of 1893.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause they called the whole entertainment complex the White City at one time.  And there's a book called the White City--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --about the 1893 Columbian exposition so this had something to do with that but I'm not sure, exactly what (unclear) I know it does.
Speaker 1: I'm, I--but I say--and when we first, I remember when I first went, started going to White City it was highly segregated too, as was the whole town.
Speaker 2: So White City actually let you--did they have special days for black people or for colored people--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --to go to White City?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  And special rides after--even on the special days you still couldn't get in some of the rides.  They had a roller coaster I remember--
Speaker 2: Would they let black people ride the roller coaster?
Speaker 1: They didn't at first but then as more and more blacks came in they finally had to let them.  But they at first, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When I first started going there and I was a little kid, not then.
Story_ID: 26723
Speaker 1: Now this is a question we always ask in this way so just, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Some of the sights, smells and sounds, uh-huh.  The big thing that attracted me was barbecue and I remember that I used to go to barbecue places on Monday because they had leftover barbecue from the weekend and the guy was selling it at such low prices to recoup some of his money from the left over barbecue.  So that smell was important to me.  The other thing that was important was the high--the grade school had a playground attached to it and we kids started at that playground and I started playing softball there.  And I not only played softball but they had a brick wall there were we played handball.  I played handball and touch football and we were the only school that was being integrated and they had a league in Chicago and--for these small kids.  So we started out with white and blacks on this McCosh [Grade School] playground but then it became all--oh, and at the time you see there was one or two blacks on the team and we would go to the other schools which were all white on the South Side.  And it ended up with all of the whites moving out of McCosh and the teams became all black.  So my recollection is playing touch football and softball and such things with--as a big endeavor.  My big enjoyment was playing on these teams.  And somehow or other my parents--oh, my father [Albert Queely Stewart] did some work for Dave Malarcher [David Julius Malarcher; baseball player]. They called him Dave Malarcher.  According to the spelling it would have been Malarcher [pronounced Muh-lah-shay]. He was from, originally from New Orleans [Louisiana] but he was the third baseman and eventually the manager of the Chicago American Giants, I guess they called them--a black team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we used to go to--over the weekend they would play on Wentworth near the White Sox Park.  Sometimes when the White Sox [baseball team] were out of town they even played in the White Sox Park.  But this place was at 39th and, near Wentworth, I'm not sure.  But at any rate we became supporters of the, this--of the Chicago American Giants.  And I used to sit on the bench since my father was friends with Dave Malarcher.  And when we, when my parents [Albert Queely Stewart and Jeanne Belle Kaiser] bought their home, he, Dave who was the manager of the White Sox, was also a real estate man so that when I was in high school and we were in this house that they had bought, I was still sitting on the bench at the games.  And then we start tearing down that White City too about this time.
Speaker 1: Your father worked on that project, tearing down the--?
Speaker 2: No, my father didn't but--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --my best friend father and he had, he hired us and I was about 13 at the time.  And they tore down the roller coaster I remember, and I remember that we three kids with this fellow, Jimmy Morrison's father who was working for one of the contractors and had us, had the--Jimmy, (unclear), and I forget the other kid's name, picking up after the laborers that he hired to tear down the roller coaster and other facilities in White City.  But that was an event in my high school days helping tear down White City.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26724
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, go back to the Chicago American Giants [Chicago, Illinois] for a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know Double Duty Radcliff, the--?
Speaker 2: I know--yes, but I forget the details of--yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know he was a catcher for the--
Speaker 2: He was a catcher--
Speaker 1: Yeah, for the Chicago American Giants, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now Dave [Malarcher] played third base and he--Dave was a good field no hit and they say he took me to sit on--he had no children and I would sit on the bench the--and act as a bat boy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the Chicago American Giants and not for the visiting team.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the players that played for the Chicago American Giants that--are any of them like well known now?
Speaker 2: I didn't have that kind of acquaintance with them.  I was with Dave and I can't remember any of the players but some of the later ended up in the big leagues.  I was trying to think some catcher, some catcher end up, was still young enough to, when they started integrating the leagues that he got on to--
Speaker 1: Oh, you--
Speaker 2: There was some of the white team--
Speaker 1: Roy ["Campy"] Campanella [held the position of catcher in the American Major Baseball League]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Are you talking about Roy Campanella?
Speaker 2: Roy Campanella's yeah, Campanella is a name that, yes that's it, and a pitcher.  There was a--
Speaker 1: Satchel Paige [Leroy "Satchel] Paige] was--
Speaker 2: Satchel Paige but Satchel Paige played for the Kansas City--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Monarchs.
Speaker 1: He never played for Chicago that I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Somebody from Chicago pitched in the big leagues?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, so I'm trying to think who from Chicago would have been on the--I don't know.  But did you get a chance to see Satchel Paige play?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, but see I--we would go every Sunday to the American Giants game and I would leave the stands and go down to the bench.  But my mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser] and father [Albert Queely Stewart] were there because it got to be a pretty social thing when the people would go through--mainly the clients for the American Giants were people who had moved from the South generally, probably recently to Chicago.
Story_ID: 26725
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that Chicago [Illinois] was filling up with people from Mississippi and Arkansas and--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --other places South.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And they moved and populated South Parkway and the big apartments there they made six room apartments into six flats on a floor, kitchenettes they called them.  Or I remember come to think of it, that's how my father [Albert Queely Stewart] now got to do his work as a--no longer at Sherwin Williams [paint company] but as a carpenter helping remodel these places to make them--
Speaker 1: I know what you--
Speaker 2: --somewhat livable.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because there are these huge townhouses on South Park--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which is now King Drive in Chicago.  These--
Speaker 2: That are what?
Speaker 1: South Park is now King Drive now.
Speaker 2: Oh, it is?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Martin Luther King Drive.  But these huge townhouses--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --were when I moved to Chicago in '77 [1977], were the home of maybe four, five, six families.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yes, yes.  And--
Speaker 1: You know and so a big townhouse was once a mansion for a rich person was now like subdivided up into all these--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's, and that's what my father was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dave Malarcher [baseball player] during the week was also selling these sort of things and I remember that.
Story_ID: 26726
Speaker 1: Did you meet Rube Foster [Andrew "Rube" Foster, player-manager of the Chicago American Giants baseball league]?
Speaker 2: I know the name but I'm sure that these were adults that I--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the owner of the Chicago American Giants.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--
Speaker 2: Okay, but I don't remember.  I know the name.
Speaker 1: I believe he's the founder of the league too.  Founder of the league you know as well but you know you might not remember him but that's--but, so I thought I'd ask anyway cause he's very important to Negro League Baseball.
Speaker 2: I couldn't hear you.
Speaker 1: No, he's a very important figure in Negro League Baseball because he was the, I think the president of the league you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's--
Speaker 1: And he was in Chicago and he was the owner of the--
Speaker 2: Of, of--
Speaker 1: --of the Chicago American Giants, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So but you had, it sounds like you had an exciting time you know on the bench in the base--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -- at the big baseball games.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you saw Satchel Paige play.  What about Josh Gibson?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, got, you know--
Speaker 2: And all those names but you know just as a kid I, they didn't associate with me.  And--but the exciting thing was--remember this was prohibition too and so people were drinking in the stands and so forth.
Speaker 1: During the games they were actually drinking there?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So much for what prohibition was able to do for--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh I remember prohibition.  Prohibition was going along just after I got into high school and so I remember going to this garage when I was fourteen years old, a junior or something and getting a half pint, a pint of liquor when we were going to dances on Friday and Saturday night at Bacon's Casino and Warwick Hall and there was one other place that they, the kids always had parties.  And as I say I'd go to get this bottle of liquor which I guess it must have been ten cents or something, that cheap.
Story_ID: 26727
Speaker 1: I started working early on [in Chicago, Illinois].  At the time I remember the first so-called full scale job I had was the 'Chicago Defender', the newspaper.  And it came out on Friday and they would, some guy would have it and then he would hire kids like me to deliver the paper which was something like ten cents to various people.  And we would try to steal as much as we could from him but they, the people were usually indebted to the man that had hired us and I remember the reason they had the clients for the 'Chicago Defender' was because of the congressman, not Abbott.  Who was the congressman--?
Speaker 2: Dawson.  You're talking about William Dawson?
Speaker 1: I couldn't--
Speaker 2: William Dawson?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That, that's, I remember that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dawson was, I think when you were a little kid it was Oscar [Stanton] De Priest [former lawmaker, civil rights activist the first African American to be elected to Congress from outside the southern states and the first in the twentieth century].  He was a congressman.  That's who it--okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Oscar De Priest, I remember that name, yes when I was a little kid, Oscar De Priest, I remember that.  And then as I say later on when I was old enough to--oh, no I, I'm wrong. That wasn't my first job delivering the paper.  We had milk deliveries.  The milk man came up the alley with his horse drawn wagon and kids like me would deliver milk to the third floor of the apartment buildings mainly.  The owner of the milk wagon would do the first and second floor but we would carry milk up to the third floor in these apartment buildings but we didn't collect any money or anything like that.  He, but he would hire you for the weekend and that started out early in the morning you'd deliver milk for the kids going to school and so forth.  And you would get up early and deliver this milk before school time I recall.  And then we used to laugh at another family who happened to have the name of Stewart too but their parents--the two Stewart kids were delivering milk but they also were picking up horse manure in the alley because their father, they had I think something like six kids in the family and the family had a garden.  And they would pick up--we used to ridicule them because they would pick up the horse manure to take the, fertilize the garden, yeah.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 26728
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about school now.  At, when you were going to McCosh [Grade School]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --school, did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was pretty happy about spelling because we were learning spelling and math.  They had a spelling book that was a long, long and narrow and the teacher would read words and you would have to write the word, the, spell the word in the book and then she would come and walk down and correct the papers then, not--she wouldn't collect them and hold them any length of time because it was a chance for people to cheat and so forth.  She would read the ten or fifteen words, go down and check each class, it was about 30 kids in the class, check each number and this--the math people would do essentially the same thing.  They would read off words, I mean numbers that you'd multiply or divide and so forth and grade them right then and there.  And I did pretty well because I remember my mother [Jeanen Belle Kaiser] was working at the time but she was working for a costume maker and they had a lay off period and I came, I was bringing home excellents, all excellents, superior and excellents as grades and I came home with a G, good and not even poor.  And my mother, the only time I remember her going up to school, she went up to school to ask the teacher why I had only gotten a G.  And the teacher said, told her that's because all the kids made fun or disorderly in, the boys were disorderly in her class.  And my mother said for years after this, she told that teacher that if she wanted to grade me they had deportment on there.  She should have made remarks there and not on my academic, not on the spelling or whatever that was.
Speaker 1: Academic record, yeah.
Speaker 2: But I remember, math and spelling were two big things.
Story_ID: 26729
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did you have a favorite teacher at McCosh [Grade School]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did have but--McCormick sticks in my mind but I don't recall.  I know I did have this favorite teacher and I think she's the one that moved to Englewood High School, herself getting promoted. And she still remembered me I think.  I'm not definite but I remember that--
Speaker 1: Was her name McDormand [ph.] by any chance?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Was her last name McDormand?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just, I thought, yeah I thought, (unclear) kind of--well any rate.  But, now did you have any idea that you wanted to be a scientist when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: No.  When did I--oh, I know.  I went to Englewood High School and I was having trouble with some of the academic subjects because the other kids--see there was Wendell Phillips High School and what's this, what--Wendell Phillips and then the other black school.
Speaker 1: DuSable?
Speaker 2: DuSable, yeah.  My wife went to DuSable, that's right.  Well the kids, the black kids went to either Wendell Phillips or DuSable, but the West Woodlawn kids went to Englewood and Englewood was, had Jewish kids from Jew Town, you know 12th Street and--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --State or something.  I forget where that was.  But they--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maxwell Street.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Maxwell Street.
Speaker 2: Maxwell, yes.  And those kids were pretty good at the academic subjects.  Chemistry, well I--in grade school I'd had printing and woodwork, I remember doing those.  But in high school they started--I start this chemistry and I did well at that while the academic subjects were not, I wasn't such a--because the Jewish kids were the stars in the academic subjects.  And I didn't have any friends who were going to Englewood because they would either, the more apt kids and the kids that looked like white would go to Hyde Park which is, their parents would arrange for it and get them--and if your parent didn't do anything you went to Englewood.  But I remember that was where I picked up chemistry and some parts of physics, but I don't, can't recall what part that was.
Speaker 1: Well you got to be a pretty good mathematician to be involved in physics so, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well you remember I had done this arithmetic in--and yes I did like math.
Speaker 1: Now did you--
Speaker 2: I didn't take history and foreign language.  My mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser] had taken German and she thought she knew all there was about German. But these Jewish kids did it like that, and I had trouble.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of the German--the Jewish kids had parents that came from Germany actually.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Lived in places like--yeah, so.  So, were your grades okay at Englewood?
Speaker 2: My grades in high school were okay, good enough so I could go to the community college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which had just opened.  Woodrow Wilson [Junior College] had just opened a year or so before I graduated from high school.  But see, I was graduating from high school at, what did I say, sixteen [years old]--
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: --instead of eighteen and--
Speaker 1: Now were, in high school, were you involved in high school activities?  Could you get involved in school--?
Speaker 2: What did you say?
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any high school activities (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was too young because not only were the kids graduating at eighteen, but those kids coming from the South were going to school, high school until they were twenty or so.  But they were all, they were playing in the sports so I couldn't make it on the football team.  I went out for football, went out for hardball because I'd start playing hardball because of my experience with the [Chicago] American Giants [baseball team].  But I couldn't compete with these older kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although I tried, particularly hardball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26730
Speaker 1: So did you run for a class office or anything like that or--?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  In fact, we hardly, the black kids hardly talked to the white kids.  At the, at Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois], remember there was little money around.  There was a White Castle on 63rd Street and you got a hamburger--I remember they used to have a hamburger sales thing and you could get five hamburgers for some cheap price, I forget what it was.  But I'd do that.  But mainly instead of going to the school cafeteria on one side of the school nearest the South--the Wentworth and South Park side, there was a guy who rented a build--apartment that had food for the black students.  And there was a guy who made fried pies.  He sold fried pies and such stuff to the black kids.  Well the black kids didn't go to the--there was another white guy who had also a store and so the kid, white kids who didn't have any money went to that instead of the cafeteria.  And only rich kids went to the cafeteria.  Pardon me. [Coughing] But there was no real association with the white students in Englewood.  The black girls had started school in West, pardon me, in West Woodlawn.  The professional people, the doctors, lawyers and so forth their daughters had school--had clubs.  And they gave dances and the like at Bacon's Casino.  And while the white kids were going to the Stevens Hotel and the blacks were not welcome.  Blacks were not welcome in these big hotels and never on the North Side.  When what's her name, the celebrated black woman who lived on the North Side, the television person.
Speaker 1: Oh god, you got me.
Speaker 2: You know of recent who bought--
Speaker 1: Oprah?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Oprah Winfrey?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was--I was so surprised when it turned out she was living on the north side because I always thought of that as a big division in Chicago.  In fact, from, till 12th Street on the South Side, below 12th Street on the, in Chicago that was all white, nothing but.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When you were growing up could you go past 63rd Street south?  Did you go south of 63rd?
Speaker 1: Down 63rd Street?
Speaker 2: Yeah, did--no, did any black people live south of 63rd?
Speaker 1: Down--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Below?  No, 63rd Street was the dividing line.  From 63rd to Washington Park was white between South Park and Cottage Grove.  And that didn't turn over for quite a--never while I was growing up.  And the big fight with West Woodlawn was the kids that lived at 58th and Calumet and over in there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 26731
Speaker 1: Now did you develop a love for chemistry in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I had a, yeah I loved the chemistry in high school and continued it in junior college [Woodrow Wilson Junior College, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And all the way through college [University of Chicago].
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite teacher in high school?  Was your chemistry teacher a good teacher?
Speaker 2: Not in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you went to Wilson, now Wilson is near Englewood, right?  It's near Englewood High School?
Speaker 2: Near Englewood.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Teachers' College was connected to Woodrow Wilson.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I didn't take--oh, in order to graduate I had taken all the scientific subjects.  I didn't take history and all those arts and--because I didn't have to.  And so I stayed out of that until I was forced to take history and English to graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did you do okay in those subjects?
Speaker 2: I did okay, but performance, kids who really could study and do right were going to Teachers' College on the same campus.  And it was, the kids who were not quite good enough for that that went to junior college.  But there weren't many blacks doing that.  Most of the black kids when they, if they'd--oh, that's right.  From McCosh [Grade School], if you had any ability you went to Englewood.  If you were about to drop off you went to Tilden Tech Technical High School].  And that was a big split and most of the kids went to, most of the black guys went to Tilden Tech.  And I don't know where--oh yeah, there was a Lucy Flower, well--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's on the west side, yeah, Lucy Flower Academy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a, yeah the girls went there, um-hmm.  The guys went to Tilden Tech to learn woodworking and brick laying and plumbing and--um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were amongst the elite of the black community going to Englewood, I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yes.
Speaker 1: In that sense.
Story_ID: 26732
Speaker 1: At Wilson Junior College [Chicago, Illinois], did you have any special teachers or mentors?
Speaker 2: Not at Wilson.  I was spending most of my time being the laborer for my father [Albert Queely Stewart] who--and I--Wilson was a--[Blowing Nose].  And (unclear) I mean you know just barely attending and hanging on and not being kicked out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I made the amazing discovery because a kid down the street, the Parkers' father was a truant officer or something.  He had six kids and he--one of the kids was about my age, told me about the professional exam for--that they had at the time to be a page in the library.  This is, you put the books, you--people would take books out you know three days or so forth.  When they brought them back they were just piled up and then they hired, then they had these people who took the exam and became pagers and you'd put the books back on the, according to the Dewey Decimal System.  And I took that exam while I was just, where was I?  Well I don't know.  No, I had graduated from Wilson when I took that exam.  I was doing nothing but working--oh, I worked for my father and then I tried to get a job on the railroad, lied about my age and did a couple of trips until somebody found out my age. I was you know sixteen [years old] or seventeen and they wouldn't hire me any longer on the railroad.  And I'd only made a few trips as a, as the guy that picked up dishes from the dining room after the meal.  I didn't, I wasn't a waiter.
Speaker 1: Let me go back a minute cause I didn't establish the year--you graduated from high school at what, in 1935?
Speaker 2: Did I graduate from high school in--?
Speaker 1: No, the--I'm trying to establish the year you graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Was that 1935?  You would have been sixteen then I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Let's see, when did I graduate?  1942 I graduated from Chicago--no.  I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, so sure so I was sixteen so--
Speaker 1: That's 1935, right?
Speaker 2: 1935, yeah around there.  Yeah, around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were sixteen then and then you started Wilson around--so it took like two years to get out of Wilson or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you would have been eighteen in 1937, I guess right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, all right, I just wanted to establish the date.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 26733
Speaker 1: And then-eighteen [years old; in 1937], yeah.  Then I took this page [in a library] exam and went to, yeah.  What's the name of the school, they still write me, a YMCA [Yong Men's Christian Association] college.  What was the name of it though?  Avalon-[possibly Central YMCA College]
Speaker 2: Down--the one downtown Chicago?
Speaker 1: It was in, no it was on--in the fifties where--
Speaker 2: Loop College?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Loop College, was that it?  Loop College?
Speaker 1: I can't--but that's where I met the prof [professor] that really liked me and I liked him in chemistry.  That's where I really picked up the chemistry.  What was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: Not Roosevelt [University]?
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt University?
Speaker 1: What was--?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt University?  No, (unclear).
Speaker 1: No, Roosevelt became famous later but this school was, and the YMCA college became important out of this school.  But I remember he recommended me to the University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Well what happened?  Tell, just tell us what happened.  This is your chemistry professor right?
Speaker 1: This is a chemistry prof--he was a, he was really a physics major but he taught chemistry at this school and I'm having trouble with the name.  But he recommended me to University of Chicago where I went and took these classes that I had rejected at Woodrow Wilson Junior College.  I took biology, general course and I passed all those general things that I had rejected taking at Woodrow, at junior college.
Story_ID: 26734
Speaker 1: So you must have been a really sharp student?
Speaker 2: I must have been.  Well I guess.  I know I--because I did take these chemistry courses and, at [University of] Chicago after I got in and had no problem with any of that.  And I was working full time at--I was so poor that I walked to school to University of Chicago down Midway Plaisance--is it still there, the--?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir. And I'd walk to that school and I didn't walk through Washington Park on the way home because by then there had been some blacks moving into that neighborhood where they hadn't been before and they would pick on guys like me.  So I would walk Midway Plaisance and down Cottage Grove home, eat, go to, walk to school, come back and walk, eat, walk to the library at Woodlawn and 62nd Street and walk home and then do my homework and stuff after--the library closed at what eight or nine o'clock and I would walk home because I couldn't afford the car fare which was now ten cents I think.  So I didn't ride to school or back from school.  I didn't ride to work which would have been, cost me you know a half an hour or so, more than that.
Speaker 2: Where did you--sir, where did you live?
Speaker 1: Where did I live?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 6319 Champlain.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: See how fast that came.
Speaker 2: Yes, it sure did.
Speaker 1: And that was after my parents [Albert Queely Stewart and Jeanne Belle Kaiser] had moved from this house that was owned by the postman, the second place after the--we--second one after McCosh [Grade School].  And I went, started high school at this, the rented place and then moved to 6319 which was a frame house on the 63rd block where most of the houses were brick.  But my father put siding on one side of the house.  The other side was so close to the six flat building next to us we didn't have to put anything there.  But then he put, made a brick front door and door case and took away the front porch that they had there and put a little facade of some kind on the house.  And--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember helping him put this plastic siding, not wood siding on the house and I'd say that the front porch and the like were made by a brick layer who, whose daughter I dated later on.  I remember Stahls [ph.] was his name.  But that house, 6319, I lived in until we got married.
Story_ID: 26735
Speaker 1: How was your tuition paid at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: How was my tuition paid?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, all--the salary at--as a page was precisely the amount at University of Chicago tuition.  And I think the tuition at Chicago was about a hundred dollars a quarter I think for a full load.  And that's you know and that was three months.  And I, that's what, about what I made in three months. I was in a chemistry course at Chicago and I got a pain in the stomach and I stayed until the end of class and then went to the hospital to check in because of this severe pain.  The guy that interviewed me there at the hospital took me in but the hospital was segregated and they had, we had a black hospital.  What was it?
Speaker 1: Provident.
Speaker 2: Providence, yes.  They wanted to ship me to Provident from the white hospital but the guy that let me in, his father was a teacher in a physics department and I, somehow or other, he just wouldn't let them.  They operated on me for acute appendicitis right there in--I forget the name of the hospital in Chicago.  But I stayed at that hospital in Chicago, not Provident.  And I left that hospital and went home from the hospital after a few days.  Now the problem was that I now missed that semester, I mean that quarter and I didn't, I wasn't working and I didn't get paid.  So I went to school but didn't tell anybody that I hadn't paid tuition.  The prof [professor] called me in and the Rotary Club paid my back tuition and the tuition for the next semester or something like that.  I mean not semester, quarter.  So Rotary later on, I joined because that was the only help that I got for tuition was that amount that they paid when I was sick.  But in addition to working at the, in the library, I still worked for my father [Albert Quincy Stewart] and I did odd jobs.  What other--I can't think of a place where I had a regular job, but I did odd jobs and worked in grocery stores and other places in addition to the page at the library.  And I would study from eight o'clock at night until midnight generally.  Those were my general hours.
Story_ID: 26736
Speaker 1: So the Rotary Club came to your rescue [tuition at the University of Chicago the quarter that Stewart got sick]?
Speaker 2: They--Rotary came to my rescue, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right that's an interesting story.  So you had a, you did a lot of--you really had to work hard to finish school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Yeah, I worked my way through and I graduated at the--and when I graduated in '42 [1942], it was just at the beginning of the Christmas break.  But instead of just quitting and taking a little rest before I went to work with Sherwin Williams [paint company], I stayed on and continued to be a page in the library until I started work at Sherwin Williams cause I didn't have any money at all.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you this, at the University of Chicago were there any special teachers there or mentors--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: George [W.] Schaeffer was an assistant to Hermann [Irving] Schlesinger, the chairman of the chemistry department and he was the guy that sort of took hold of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So George Schaeffer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is he the one that got the Rotary Club to help you?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Is he the one that connected the Rotary Club to you?
Speaker 2: No, that was just one of the admissions officers that directed me to the Rotary Club.  At the time I was lucky because you paid tuition but you could rent your books.  So I paid tuition and rented my books throughout all of my college.
Speaker 1: Now were there any other black students in the chemistry department when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, there were--I didn't meet any black students in--there were girls in the class but I didn't meet any black students until after the war [World War II] when I came back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But no, these were all white kids in the chemistry department.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, were there any--did you--were there any other black students on campus?
Speaker 2: Well yes there was, were a couple of girls but I didn't have time to seeing them, any of them because of the, my work and school schedule.  I was trying to think if I made any real connection with--. One girl I dated but can't remember her name even.

Speaker 1: All right, so you graduated from University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in 1942, so, and you went to work for Sherwin Williams [paint company] shortly thereafter?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you were there for about a year and a half you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was it like working at Sherwin Williams?
Speaker 2: Well, they had two black--and by then the helpers--I went to work in Resin Research Department. The guys that washed the dishes for most of the sciences and cleaned up the lab were blacks.  And one passed the police exam and the other actually ended up doing some work with my father [Albert Queely Stewart]--but they were all whites as the workers.  The guy that I replaced had just been drafted.  I had never spent any time dating a white girl or having any contacts with whites in high school or these other places.  I remember being attracted to seeing girls at this high, at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] College I went to whose name I can't recall.  But at Sherwin Williams, I met a white girl and started on the sly secretively dating her.  And there was a guy who came there from [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] and he started dating the secretary to the chairman of the, yeah the chairman of this department, this Resin Research Department and the secretary was married but her husband was out of town.  And so it ended up that on the sly I at least one time dated the, this white girl, Betty and he and the secretary, the four of us went to date at the girls', the secretaries' apartment.  That was the only sort of contact I had.  But I did date this, Betty until I got drafted.  And then I got drafted and wanted her--she hadn't finished high school, this girl.  I wanted her to come out to see me at boot camp which was segregated but my parents [Albert Queely Stewart and Jeanne Belle Kaiser] would have none of it.  They said no white girl was going to come and visit on their, with them and how bad it would be for me if I, it was known that I was dating a white girl even.
Story_ID: 26738
Speaker 1: Great Lakes [Illinois] had a black section boot camp and that's what I--now what, meanwhile, by the way while I was working at Sherwin Williams [paint company; Chicago, Illinois] and I no longer had the draft status, I still started taking graduate courses at the University of Chicago thinking that was going to rescue me again from the draft, which it didn't. But I remember that that was the end of that relationship with Betty [whom Stewart met while working at Sherwin-Williams] because as I say my parents would have none of the idea that a white girl would come and visit me at the boot camp.
Speaker 2: I could see where it might have gotten you in some trouble in boot camp but I don't know.
Speaker 1: I couldn't [hear]--
Speaker 2: No, so yeah, I guess--they thought it would, you would, it would cause trouble for you back then.
Speaker 1: Oh yes it would have caused--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --trouble.  There was no association with, between whites and blacks.
Speaker 2: Now, so this is--
Speaker 1: In fact, when I got drafted, Chicago had had the 8th Regiment and it was a social as well as military operation.  And those guys had gone to war in Europe.  The 8th Regiment were the backbone of the black community in Chicago.  And the idea that a black would go to the [U.S.] Navy was very fascinating.  I just got dressed, went down to the office as I was required to do to report and the guy looked and stamped me for Navy.  And so I went down that morning and got to the draft and went right on to boot camp there.  And they were--we--I got drafted in the morning and we were there all day long waiting till we had enough blacks to ship to start a group.
Speaker 2: So what year is this now?
Speaker 1: This was '42 [1942] was it?  No, no, no, '44 [1944].
Speaker 2: Forty-four I think yeah.  It was just before the end of the war?
Speaker 1: Yeah, just before the end of the war.
Speaker 2: All right, that's 1944.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yep.
Speaker 2: So, okay so 1944.  So now I heard, I've heard stories about Great Lakes and about--
Speaker 1: About what?
Speaker 2: About Great Lakes from other black people that were in the Navy around that same time.  And they talked about the band at Great Lakes.
Speaker 1: Wait, I can't hear you.
Speaker 2: No, other black people that we've interviewed --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --talk about the band at Great Lakes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Do you remember anything about the band?
Speaker 1: The band?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No, uh-uh.
Speaker 2: There was supposed to be a black band that toured the United States at Great Lakes--
Speaker 1: No, I don't.
Speaker 2: --full of all these great musicians.
Story_ID: 26739
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember when I was a kid my mother [Jeanne Belle Kaiser] bought me a saxophone because the only popular people were Duke Ellington [former American composer, pianist, and jazz-orchestra leader] and Cab Calloway [former African-American jazz singer and bandleader; regular performer at the Cotton Club in Harlem, New York City] and they would go to the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and we would go see them.  And my mother thought that was a job that I could really do.  But I wouldn't practice the saxophone she bought me and she was working so I would sneak and play ball and, but--and then I played, that's right.  I went with a band, with an orchestra that was formed of black kids but they didn't--I wasn't good enough to play with them because I wasn't practicing and so forth.  So when I tried later to get that saxophone from my mother, my mother was indignant and would not give me that saxophone.  But that was what she had intended for me.  I didn't have any real big support from my parents.  Well my father [Albert Queely Stewart] wanted me to be a carpenter.  My mother just knew that they would, no one would ever hire me as a scientist and so they weren't spending any of their money getting me an education.  So--
Speaker 2: So did you have--what did you think about it?  Did you think that you wouldn't find work or would it be hard to find?
Speaker 1: I didn't.  I guess I liked the courses enough and was treated well enough that I thought everything would turn out all right.  Oh, I know what it was.  The water department in Chicago had hired some blacks and I thought the water--well, there's going to be some job in the city that would hire me as a chemist.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought where I would end up.
Speaker 2: As they do need chemists, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 26740
Speaker 1: After boot camp what did you do--after boot camp [at Great Lakes, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, went to boot camp and they had an outgoing unit.  All the blacks that graduated from boot camp went to this outgoing unit to this, so the school that gave them further training would have a spot for them.  So with my background as a graduate of [University of] Chicago there were two places where I could go.  I could be a chef or I could be a hospital orderly in the Navy.  So I was sent to the boot camp.  I now was selected by the white officer in charge of the outgoing unit to keep order with these people who were coming in and being shipped to a fleet or--I mean the various places that use black labor and so forth and so on.  So that was--I was now waiting for the opening in the orderly school or the chef school for me as a black.  So I was there for, going to be there for several weeks because these schools were always full.  Well remember, this is Great Lakes and I could have a date in Chicago on my time off.  And I did.  I dated and I got a particular date because one of the guys who was in the boot camp staff's, you know there was managing for this officer, was a guy who owned cabs in Chicago.  You remember they had the Jitneys that ran South Parkway for ten cents or--I think it was ten cents that you could ride ten cents which was the bus fare between wherever it was to 30 something and 63rd Street.  If you went off of that on a Jitney cab they paid, you had to pay them additional amounts and you'd negotiate that.  But this guy ran some cabs, a couple of cabs there, got me a date with a girlfriend, with his girlfriend and I missed the plane--the train back to the camp.  The, I forget what time that was but it was a fifteen minute delay.  The train that usually I took was 6:30, this would have been 6:45 or 7:00 and so I was late getting back and I then had to go to this officer in charge because I was late.  Well, I went up to see him and he didn't really know that I was, that I--University of Chicago and so forth.  He knew that I was a company honor man in boot camp.  They select their best guy and my fellows had selected me as the honor man from my boot camp.  But when he found out I was University of Chicago and so forth, it turned out that he had been on station duty that night and they had mentioned the fact that they wanted to recruit some black guys for officer training because blacks didn't go to officer training at all.  They--if they went to some of the other camps that they had, they then went to the ships or the yard oilers, no big ships or anything, or staff at other white camps and so forth.  And they were going to train, they wanted to give some tests to some black guys to go to officer school.  And my punishment for being late was that I had to take the test.  So--
Story_ID: 26741
Speaker 1: So you had to do what you have to do right?  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  So I took the test and I ended up at Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] as--that was great.  The one black guy in this camp of a couple of thousand people and they had little customs in this mid-shipment school.  And you took the classes but after each class you would have to run to your next class and being lazy I remember trying to walk as some of the kids did between classes.  And an officer shouting out at me, hey Stewart, get to running because I was the only one they could recognize.  So I was at boot camp where they flunked a third of the people.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you made it all right.
Speaker 2: And that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you became an officer, yeah, right?
Speaker 2: I became an ensign [first officer rank of the U.S. Navy; renamed ship-of-the-line sub-lieutenant].
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is 1944.  And oh okay, 1945 it says--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were commissioned as an ensign, okay.
Story_ID: 26742
Speaker 1: After I got the commission [as an ensign in the U.S. Navy in 1945], I laughed at the--well, my fellow graduates who I'd become friendly with because in health--in order to do the homework and so forth some of the--I had to join some white groups and so forth and so I did meet a few people and I laughed at them.  I said well the Navy was highly segregated so they were going to go to war with Japan and, because D-Day came while we were in camp.  But I was going to go just to you know this segregated school.  Well then we went to get our assignment and they told me AO25 and I went back and boy the guys laughed at me because some of them know that the AO was a fleet oiler and that was going to be my assignment.  And it was (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now what does that--now tell us what that means 'cause I don't know.
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: Well what does that mean a fleet oiler, what does that mean?
Speaker 1: A fleet oiler?
Speaker 2: At the time ships were, oil ships, there were no nuclear ships.  The oiler that was the largest that would fuel battle ships was the fleet oiler.  It was, you couldn't bring it to port because there wasn't a dock big enough to hold it and so smaller oilers would come and feed the oiler that was going to fuel battle ships at sea.  And the fleet oiler was that sort of ship.
Speaker 1: So it was sort of like having a floating gas station I guess?
Speaker 2: Floating gas station.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was it.  Big enough to fuel a battle ship, a couple of battleships.
Speaker 1: And they were too big to come into port so you were saying then, so you didn't get any time off?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Did you get any time off on a fleet oiler?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, by--you would park out--when, it turned out that this fleet oiler was in Shanghai [China].  I didn't know it at the time but the war ended and when I shipped out from San Francisco [California] I went directly to--well we went north and stayed up north for a little while and then went directly to Japan and went to Yokosuka [largest overseas United States Naval base in the world] Naval Base in Japan where I found out that my ship, the fleet oiler--and the name of the fleet oilers was named after rivers in the United States.  So AO25 was the Sabine River in Texas.  And I flew from Tokyo [Japan] to--after landing in Yokosuka and staying there for, till we found out where the ship was, then I went to Tokyo to fly to Shanghai and boy the people in Tokyo had a holiday with me cause they had never seen a black sailor.  There'd never been any, there were few, only a few white airmen and so forth who had been there.  And here was this guy, black who was in officer's clothes and they would laugh and point and I would laugh and point back and it was quite an adventure.  And when I went to Shanghai it continued.  So that's when I went from Tokyo, flew to Tokyo, from Tokyo to Shanghai, China and picked up my ship there.  And the, there was a--there were a few group of blacks who served on white ships.  They were stewards mates and they wore officer type uniforms but without the gold braid or anything.  And what they did was just that, they were servants to white officers on white ships.  And when I got to Shanghai and was coming up the gangplank, the guy that was on duty thought that I was a stewards mate--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --until he saw the gold braid and then he laughed and that mistake he had made, later on told me he laughed.
Story_ID: 26743
Speaker 1: Tell us what, now you're in Shanghai [China] on the [U.S. Navy fleet] oiler, right?
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: You're in the Navy where we left off and you're--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --on the oiler, right in--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I was in the Navy, that's right and in Shanghai and we were there fueling ships.  And among the ships we would fuel were the Japanese ships that were going back to Japan since the war had ended and these little--and we were in the Yangtze River and these you know Japanese ships, Destroyers and such stuff would come up and we would fuel them.  And it's quite an adventure for the American sailor staff to fuel these Japanese ships but that was our job.  And we stayed there until decided somebody decided we should go--oh, when our fuel, we finally had gone down and so we went to the ocean and to the Bahrain [ph.] Islands which had been in the news recently here too, to get more fuel and that's what we did.  We went down to the Bahrain Islands and then came back up and instead of going to Japan or China again, we went to, by way of Hawaii, we went back to the United States.  And then they had a point system for people getting out of the service and my points had come up and I was put on inactive duty.  You weren't released, you were just, had enough points to go back to civilian life. So I was now on inactive duty but still Navy.
Story_ID: 26744
Speaker 1: You went to graduate school right?
Speaker 2: Oh then, yes.  And I went to, back to Sherwin Williams [paint company], talked to them and then there was the GI bill was popular then.  But when I went back to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] I told you George Schaeffer was the guy that, well George Schaeffer had gotten a grant.  Hermann Schlesinger, the chairman of the department and these were inorganic chemists, not organic chemists and they had gotten a grant from the [U.S.] Navy to do research work and they hired me, so I didn't have to take the GI bill.  I was working for the Navy and enrolled in the university.  Meanwhile, George Schaeffer got an offer from St. Louis University to become the chairman of their chemistry department.  St. Louis University by the way is a Jesuit University.  And that--he offered me the opportunity to become his assistant and continue to do research work for him at St. Louis University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So off to St. Louis University.
Story_ID: 26745
Speaker 1: Meanwhile I had been helpful to other black students at the University of Chicago in the chemistry department in helping them--they were black males in the chemistry department, helping them get dates.
Speaker 2: Get dates.  Now well, was Henry McBay there?
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: Was Dr., was Henry McBay at University of Chicago then as a student?
Speaker 1: Henry--?
Speaker 2: McBay?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That name somehow hits but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause I know he got his degree from University of Chicago.  He's the mentor of so many black chemists.  You know he went to teach at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: What, as the--he was at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Well yeah he went on to teach at Morehouse but he--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Henry McBay.
Speaker 1: But chemistry or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah chemistry.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Chemistry.
Speaker 1: But the name sounds familiar but I know that I helped guys get dates and my girlfriend helped me find girls for these guys.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --this girl, my girlfriend had been the girlfriend of a, pardon me, of a guy who went to--she went to--Juanita Edwards was the girl.  She went to Woodrow Wilson Junior College [Chicago, Illinois] and she was dating a guy who played basketball at Woodrow Wilson.  Well this guy who played basketball at Woodrow Wilson had gone to, oh I forget the name of the school now but any rate, he was passing for white and played basketball, was playing pro basketball in Ohio as a white guy.  But I knew that Juanita still had affection for him.  He came home one visit and she had a date with him but at any rate I used that as an excuse for dating one of the girls that she was supplying to people in Chicago.  Her family just loved Juanita.  There were three sisters that were friends of hers and they didn't like the fact that I dumped Juanita for--two of them didn't like it.  I dumped Juanita for Colleen, their sister and ended up that that was the girl that I married.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. So that's an interesting story.  So--
Speaker 1: So Colleen went down to St. Louis [Missouri] with me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And made more money teaching the mentally retarded than I made as assistant to the dean at St. Louis University.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So she was a teacher already, teaching school then?
Speaker 1: Oh she taught the mentally retarded as they called them in Chicago when I met her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I always joked that she married me because she thought I was mentally retarded and needed help.
Story_ID: 26746
Speaker 1: Now did you get your master's degree from University of Chicago before you left?
Speaker 2: [Nodding head yes].  Before I went down I took exam, I got my master's degree and then went down with the work that I had done at [University of] Chicago, I didn't neglect that.  He [George Schaeffer] went with it and if I had stayed at Chicago further I would have lost that time.  But I went down with the same research that I had done at Chicago as his assistant and with a couple of students that went down there too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well tell us what were you working on with Dr. Schaeffer?  What kind of project was it?
Speaker 2: Inorganic chemistry and it was in inert--vacuum system.  We would put, we'd build a line of glass tubing with some I don't--the stopper is not of glass but that could move with magnetic force and so forth.  But any rate you could have glass tubes, evacuate them, put chemicals in to interact in this vacuum sys, vacuum line so that they weren't done in open air like any other, like regular chemicals where you do these experiments in a vacuum, and did a large number of experiments in this system for the Navy Department still.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay, you did experiments in vacuum lines for--
Speaker 2: These are vacuum lines, yes.
Speaker 1: --the, mixed it with--
Speaker 2: So then, as I'm doing these experiments with him and get to a point, he went to--George had got sick and went to the hospital and I did the total work without his direction while he was in the hospital.  But it became apparent that the school wasn't big enough to have both of us doing the same research and when he got out of the hospital he would come back to be the boss again.  And so he had contacts and, in the chemical industry and knew more people and found out that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was hiring scientists to do research in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  And his suggestion, he suggested good, go down and do the nuclear research there then you can come back to St. Louis University as a professor doing nuclear research.  It could be inorganic but it would be different from the kind of research that I was doing with him for the [U.S.] Navy.  And I even forget what we were working on but at any rate, that's what I did.
Story_ID: 26747
Speaker 1: I went to St. Louis [Missouri] in 1945.  I was there till--no, 1949 and I was there until 1951.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then I went to Oak Ridge National Laboratory [Oak Ridge, Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: In '51 [1951]?
Speaker 1: In '51 [1951].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. 1951. Now had you, did you have your Ph.D. [degree] at this point?
Speaker 1: Did I have what?
Speaker 2: Did you have your Ph.D.?
Speaker 1: No, I was, I still had not, hadn't written the thesis.  My data had been accepted at St. Louis University but I hadn't written up my thesis yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So okay, so you go to Oak Ridge National Laboratories.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And well what happened there?  What happened next?
Speaker 1: At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they were not doing vacuum line research in the radiation chemistry department.  And I didn't--they were doing a lot of organic chemistry but I was an inorganic chemist.  So I went to work with these guys who were doing a sort of physical science work and we started doing vacuum line work at the, in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And all this was classified too by the way. The research was Schaeffer and Schlesinger and for the Navy it was classified and so was this work now at Oak Ridge.
Story_ID: 26748
Speaker 1: Oh, meanwhile I left my wife up in St. Louis [Missouri] where she was teaching at a school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Go ahead.  Okay, so you, your family was split I mean your wife's in St. Louis and you're in--
Speaker 1: What you say?
Speaker 2: Your wife's in St. Louis and you are in--?
Speaker 1: Oak Ridge.
Speaker 2: Okay, Oak Ridge, yes.
Speaker 1: And she was going to finish the semester in St. Louis.  Meanwhile she was having female trouble and she went to a doctor up in St. Louis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But how was it?  She was there for the first semester and was supposed to stay till you know the end of the year but we couldn't take it.  And so she at the end of the first semester, she moved down to Oak Ridge.  And Oak Ridge was segregated by the way.  They had--they didn't have any black scientists.  They had only helpers and clean up guys and so forth.  And so I was the first black guy getting a Ph.D. that went to work down there.  And they suggested, Oak Ridge suggested that I move to, they had a big apartment arrangement for guys like me who were married with no children and they suggested that I now move to this white apartment building.  And I rejected on the basis that if they were segregating anybody, I was black so I was going to move to a black community.  It's very interesting in this that my wife's father was passing for black.  He was--
Speaker 2: He was passing for black?
Speaker 1: He was Scotch/Irish playing, who had claimed he was black.  He had come from New Orleans and married my mother in law on the basis that--
Speaker 2: That he was black, huh?
Speaker 1: So, it's all a big mess.  As you must remember this is 1951 and they're--it's bad enough that blacks had to ride the back of the transportation in St. Louis and in Oak Ridge, Tennessee there were--ride--there was discrimination in the transportation.  Colleen went to--the reason I thought of that was that the blacks wouldn't hire her for the black school that they had there, cause they were seg--they were--and my wife was from the North and she was--she's very light but she's from the North and the blacks in Knoxville, in Oak Ridge didn't want anybody from the North teaching their children.  So there she was teaching, I mean she went to, decided to go to school and she went to University of Tennessee Law School, but had some trouble.  The real trouble came when she got pregnant in Oak Ridge and she was in the hospital and the doctor wanted to take care of her but he didn't want this black woman to stay overnight in the hospital in Oak Ridge.  And he released her and, to home and she lost the baby there which she said--and we had become Catholics while we were in St. Louis and she heard this doctor who was a Catholic point out to the priest in confession that he was, he had had this trouble with her and so--sad.  And later on she had two miscarriages that we had, with no real facts to back us up, to trace that back to the, that early, that trouble.  And so the doctors there claimed, in later, claimed that that was sort of the--had some connection between the miscarriage and that.  She--the child, the miscarriage was old enough so it had to be buried in a plot.
Story_ID: 26749
Speaker 1: So did you finish your Ph.D. work while you were in Oak Ridge [National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I wrote up the thesis and got the degree, yes.  And we continued to do the work and they liked the research that I was doing.  They have, we went to the--I went the first Atoms for Peace Conference.  I was elected to the panel council because I was against discrimination and so forth.  And I was elected by--they had an open election and I--
Speaker 1: This is at the--
Speaker 2: --testified before Congress, before the senate committee on desegregation of the town even.
Speaker 1: This is in Oak Ridge, Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Of Oak Ridge, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: About what time is this?  Is this like--?
Speaker 2: When was it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  About, was it in the--?
Speaker 2: Well you have it there, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: This is in the early fifties I guess, right?  Between--?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty.
Speaker 1: It's in the 1950s right, early fifties?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then one of the--my reason for leaving Oak Ridge was pretty obvious.  I was successful and they wanted to promote me to group leader, but the white guys didn't want to work for a black because this was still in this age and I said okay, I can't become a group leader and that would mean I'd be a chemist just the rest of my life.  And I couldn't see that.  So I said promote me or fire me. And they thought about Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico] for me to go out to New Mexico but it turned out it was segregated too.  So even though Oak Ridge could not send--Union Carbide could not send, could not hire people from Oak Ridge in their facilities, their private facilities, but because of this connection with me, they allowed them to promote me up to--in Cleveland.
Story_ID: 26750
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your Ph.D. dissertation.
Speaker 2: My Ph.D., yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Can you tell us what your dissertation was about?
Speaker 2: It was about the complicated boron chemistry.  It was boron chemistry that was done in a vacuum and interacted with sodium chloride principally and the various compounds that came out of that.
Speaker 1: Now what is the difference between doing chemistry in a vacuum and doing it in the open?
Speaker 2: What's the difference?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well in, if you do it in the open atmosphere, you have oxygen and air and nitrogen and these enter into the reaction along with whatever chemicals you're using.  If you do as I did, reactions in a vacuum, the basic chemicals that you're using are the people--the things that interact.  There is no interaction, additional interaction or additional products that come from the oxygen present.  And that was, that's the principal thing.  But in Oak Ridge, in addition to the vacuum line thing, we used nuclear radiation, high energy radiation, much higher than any x-rays or anything to do the--to supply the energy for the X.  And that's what--we built a facility that allowed us to take the, put the tubes that we sealed off from the vacuum line into this high energy sources.  So we had a differenal--additional thing, a vacuum and high energy.  And we actually put a vacuum solution against the reactor and had nuclear particles bombarding the thing.  So we had a lot of interesting things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were the experiments just to basically--were you doing experiments to find out what would happen when these things, when you got these --?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We would, that's when we would find out--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --what chemicals you were doing and we've, we concocted some pretty interesting things.  We could make light appear and visible light and all sorts of interesting things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So 1956.
Speaker 2: Six, yes.
Speaker 1: You're on your way to Cleveland to--now you're going to Cleveland to work with Union Carbide [Company]?
Speaker 2: National Carbon [Company].
Speaker 1: National Carbon?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that was--they were connected to Ever Ready Battery Company too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, well tell us what happened in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Tell us about Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Well I started radiation chemistry there and had, got a radiation source like the one we had down in Oak Ridge and did all sorts of experiments but my main function was to be a group leader.  And I hired, got some people from Oak Ridge, I mean from, not Oak Ridge, from St. Louis University and others and did a variety of experiments that were not classified but Union Carbide property.  And things were going great there until Carbide decided to split up and split up some things.  They sold the Ever Ready Battery Company and gave me a promotion to New York City.  Well they promoted me and the laboratory they were going to send me to was in Niagara Falls, but they decided instead to send me to New York City.  And when did Kennedy [John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy, 35th President of the United States] get assassinated?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-three.
Speaker 2: Nineteen--?
Speaker 1: --sixty-three.
Speaker 2: --sixty three?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: I was in New York trying to decide what sort of research we were going to do and I had just been to the library and was walking down the street in Manhattan and I heard this report.  I had an interesting time because, in New York City because they wanted me to, when I was looking for an apartment, the real estate people wanted me to move to Harlem.  And--because we're now in a desegregation period, I said uh-uh, served my time there.  We're desegregating communities, want to move to Manhattan.  So they wanted to send me to a plant that, oh the aluminum--Alcoa was building in, near Harlem and I wouldn't go there.  And finally ended up in a place where I could walk to work.  So I started walking to work--
Speaker 1: So where was that in New York?  Where was, this is--?
Speaker 2: On the west side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: West 65th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was an adventure in itself because then we ended up deciding that we wanted to buy something and well, I worked in Chicago.  I mean, Chicago--worked in Manhattan and they had changes.  And I got promoted again to--out of science into a marketing department.
Story_ID: 26752
Speaker 1: You're in the marketing department, this is 1965 I have on this calendar.  That's about right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, 1965.  So, well how did that take place?  How did you get promoted to marketing?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: How did that take place?  Why did they promote you to marketing or out of a--?
Speaker 2: Oh, because they had no, they were selling their research facilities and doing, and offering a promotion based on my abilities, my managing abilities.  And so they gave me a chance to do this market research and I went out to people and decided what sort of research they would need in various companies.  It was just sort of a make work thing then.  And decided that well there was no problem, no real research effort that we could support from Manhattan.  When I thought about moving out of Manhattan, it turned that if you moved in, and wanted support from the corporation, you had to move a certain distance before Carbide would support, would buy your mortgage for you.  So a bunch of to and fro and discussion and I ended up as the sales manager for the northeast, sales manager.  And--
Speaker 1: Now this is--
Speaker 2: --convinced everybody that my technique of interviewing customers and supplying customers was good.
Story_ID: 26753
Speaker 1: 1966, you were issued two patents, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what those were about?
Speaker 2: '66 [1966], let me see what the title (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well one was--
Speaker 2: Again, it was this boron chemistry treated with boron treated with iron and lithium and such things in a vacuum and examining the products that came out and what they were useful for.  And thereafter (unclear) didn't find much use for it as a commercial product.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I know one patent was, is concerned with a sealed self-contained device for converting high energy radiation to electricity.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that--so is that like a battery or something for--?
Speaker 2: Oh batteries, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Ever Ready Battery Company was interested in and we made some lights that could have been used along railroad lines for light.
Speaker 1: And another one is for, it's concerned with a device in which an electrolyte soluble depolarizer--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --may be employed in conjunction with suitable electrodes to produce electrical power.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So these are both like battery cells or power cells, right?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: These are both power cells right, energy cells?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  One is a radiation cell it's called and one's called an electric cell.  So with these patents you don't get any--?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I--no royalties.  And Carbide owns them by the way.  Um-hmm, or Carbide owned them.
Speaker 1: So, anyway so they--you get credit but no money for these?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 26754
Speaker 1: When you made the transition from research to marketing--?
Speaker 2: Want to give me back my--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can give it back, sure.  When you made the transition from research to marketing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was that upsetting to you at all cause you had been a chemist, right?
Speaker 2: What, said what?
Speaker 1: Was it upsetting or did it--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --bother you to make a transition from research to--?
Speaker 2: It didn't because I had been explaining to customers what the research was like anyway.  And I felt it was time that I made a switch to do something else.  But no problem at all.
Speaker 1: Well what--
Speaker 2: And when I would--and particular when I had an opportunity to go overseas and examine and explain to people over there trying to use our products what they were, what they were like and how to use them and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the job required a knowledge of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a keen knowledge of what the product was?
Speaker 2: That's right.  It was my knowledge I was transferring to customers so that they--we could sell them the products because they could use them for various things.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So now did you do any teaching during this time period?
Speaker 2: When I was doing overseas work I didn't, I wasn't around long enough.  Although Fordham wanted me to teach in mid-town near where I lived but I just couldn't find the space for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well tell us some of the highlights of your management activities at--?
Speaker 2: My management activities?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Well this transition to have blacks take any position was and is still difficult.  And my emphasis was on trying to have equal opportunity and I did it wholeheartedly and tried to get it done in the society.  And even in my, pardon me [blowing nose], personal work I tried to get at when I was on the boards of things like the Philharmonic and the Museum of Modern Art.  And so I was always trying to promote the idea that skin color was not the deciding factor for competence.  Still don't think it is.  And they've got big problems here still just with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's a problem--
Speaker 2: But that, that was, I never divorced myself from the general idea that the brain didn't recognize color as an intelligent factor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any other African American employees at Union Carbide when you were there, I mean at the same level?
Speaker 2: Were there any other African Americans in--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, on the management, at the management level?
Speaker 2: No, I never--that's interesting.  I never had much association with other blacks in Carbide at all.  I was--I have this, I brought this one.
Speaker 1: Oh, we can show that.  We're going to shoot those later.  But just, it's a picture of--you can tell us what it is.  What is it?  It's a--?
Speaker 2: There's a picture here of my office in New York City with big buildings and so forth behind me.  But no there just weren't other blacks in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did like ravel around the world, you know you got an office in Manhattan, you know this is a--
Speaker 2: Well I traveled around the world well.  One--I was talking to the Department of Commerce and they had, they talked about the newly independent black nations in Africa.  And that's when I took off and went through all of these African countries explaining what science was like in the United States and the kind of products that we made and so forth and so on.
Story_ID: 26755
Speaker 1: You were National Sales Manager for Union Carbide in 1980?
Speaker 2: Oh, in 1980, yeah for chemicals, doing chemicals and plastics, yes.  Because again I felt that our salesmen just didn't do enough to explain how the custom could take advantage of our products as opposed to other products and I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the major product you were selling in those days?  Were these batteries or--?
Speaker 2: The major products?  Well, mostly they were plastics that--Glad Wrap and that line of products that came from Glad Wrap and multi-wrapping and storage problems.  And they still sell--oh, I just was seeing some the other day, Ziploc, Ziploc packages and the like.  And we would make special chemical products, plastic products for customers who had ideas of what they would like.  But that was a major, my major focus was on plastics.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now you were director of University Relations at Union Carbide, right in 1982?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well that's how I got hooked up with Westcon.  I had as Director of University Relations, I had salesmen or other participants who talked to the Universities in our region about the, about availability of scientists and others for us and availability of our products and then decided how much money we would allocate to these people.  Well the key--the people who were talking to--the Carbide people were talking to Westcon, got to talking to the business manager of the business school.  And I met him and we decided that since I played four wall handball and since he played tennis, we'd exchange these two gifts.  Well I was now nearly 65, but I beat him like nothing at four wall handball and he gave a hard time at tennis.  I had a hard time beating him at tennis even though I could beat my wife at tennis.  But at any rate, he was saying that here I was going to be retired at 65, and you--I could do all this extra energy work at playing handball and tennis, why didn't I keep working?  So I decided I'd go back to teaching and that was what--in my last year at Carbide, school started before my 65th birthday.  So Carbide was gracious enough to keep me on their payroll but let me work at Westcon.  So that's what I did and then I worked from 65 till I was 19--till I was 80 years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started working at Westcon, Western Connecticut University--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, in 1984, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well see, and I'd be, in 1884 [1994], I was 65 and I worked until I was 90--until I was 80.
Story_ID: 26756
Speaker 1: So you taught until you were 80?
Speaker 2: Until I was 80, yes and then they still wanted me to keep teaching and these--I decided well that was far enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you retired in 1999--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from--okay, you're 80 years old and now you're a professor emeritus, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well they still contact me and one of my, one of the profs [professors] at the business school who has been named the University Professor for all of the Wisconsin universities, she still comes and takes me out to lunch you know.
Speaker 1: So what did you like better, working for Union Carbide or working as a professor at Western Connecticut?
Speaker 2: I liked both of them.  I had no choice.  I like working with people from high school students to--when I was in Cleveland I was given an award because, by the Chemical Society.  What I did, I moved from Oak Ridge to Cleveland at a time when there was not much known about nuclear science and it wasn't taught in the schools because there hadn't been a spread of people.  So what I did was on Saturday morning I would teach a group of high school students selected by the Board of Education from all of the high schools in Cleveland.  I would teach a course in nuclear science on a, say on Saturday morning in a facility provided by the school board.  And they gave kids credit for taking that course.  And I say it was nuclear science and it wasn't being taught in a university.  I mean in the public education system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't think it's being taught--I don't know if it's being taught now to tell the truth.  I don't know if they're teaching it now, today.  I guess they are on some level but--so when you look back on your career at Western Connecticut University, what are the highlights of--?
Speaker 2: What was--?
Speaker 1: What are the highlights of your career at Western Connecticut?
Speaker 2: Western Connecticut University?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That this is a parochial town, I mean a parochial society and we aren't as people, we tend to cling to small groups and not to spread our knowledge of one another and our societies broadly.  And it's hard for the young people to understand the breadth of information that's available worldwide.  It's surprising to me the number of people who were born in Chicago, lived in Chicago, never left Chicago and will, would not think of leaving Chicago.  And I still think we're still parochial in math.  There are many people who just don't understand the systems in Europe and Asia and oh, the Middle East in fact.  And they tell me it's changing a bit because of the websites and what is it, that sort of information.  I don't have any of the personal communication things.  I should have but I don't know any people now-a-days outside of this community.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's no use of having it I guess on some level.
Story_ID: 26757
Speaker 1: Now at Western Connecticut University you were Vice President of the Foundation for Social Justice in South Africa.
Speaker 2: Yes.  [Union] Carbide asked me to do that, yes. And I went to South Africa before the end of apartheid and they named me an honorary white, that's what they did, the Japanese and others that were there before the end of apartheid.  And it was an interesting place to go.  And I met some of the top Africans but it was sad, sad experience.
Speaker 1: Did you meet Bishop [Desmond Mpilo] Tutu [South African social rights activist and retired Anglican Bishop] or--
Speaker 2: I met--
Speaker 1: Allan--?
Speaker 2: --Tutu and--
Speaker 1: Allan [Aubrey] Boesak [a South African Dutch Reformed Church cleric and politician and anti-apartheid activist] maybe, Boesak, Allan Boesak?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't have that much time.  I, pardon me.  Well I remember walking, starting to walk across the street and I almost got hit by an automobile because they were driving on the, you know they drive English style and I stepped off the curb and--but I met a lot of interesting people in South Africa.  Around the world I met interesting--I went to--I felt equally interested.  I was on the board of the YMCA in New York and I went to Poland and they let me take my wife to Poland and we enjoyed that very much because we would go out to dinner and they would always have a band playing and we danced.  We've been dancing a long time together. We started in Chicago and that Polish experience was an interesting one too because they had been behind the iron curtain and we talked about the opportunities for commerce other than in the, behind the iron curtain.
Story_ID: 26758
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: What are my concerns?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well I hope that the desire to expose themselves to different cultures, different communities grows.  And I hope that the interaction with different people will be broader in the African American community because we have such talented African Americans that whites could use their intelligence and they could use the whites' intelligence.  And I just feel that, I'm just hopeful that things will open up.  Remember I was the second tenured person hired by Western Connecticut when I went there.  The first guy they hired stayed one semester and then left and they haven't hired anymore.  I was the first person to get a Ph.D. in the State of Missouri because the guy that, the second guy was in the sociology department and I was in chemistry and they aren't the same thing.  But I just feel that we are still too local without understanding the various cultures and I don't know how that's going to change but I sure hope that with all the talent that we have in the African American community that we will end up with more interaction than we have today.
Story_ID: 26759
Speaker 1: When you look back at your career in science, what would you consider to be your legacy as a scientist?
Speaker 2: Well again the general idea that working in unfamiliar sciences like the vacuum thing.  I think that that, things that we did there are important and still need to be continued.  I just wish that we could somehow convince people that they didn't have to have some special, really special knowledge to participate in science.  They had a hard time convincing me that I should listen to an artist and journalists and the like.  In fact I had to take some courses on my own in Cleveland in art and so forth to see what other fields were like.  And I just hope for a broader gauge education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 26760
Speaker 1: Your wife passed a few years ago?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She had diabetes she inherited from her father and it just came to a conclusion.  Her father died of diabetes and her sisters, one who is older than she was and one younger, both died from the effects of the diabetic experience.  And I just feel 55 years wasn't enough.  We'd still be going if--
Speaker 1: Okay, that, that's great to hear somebody say that these days, you know.  It's great that you feel like that these days you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So many people don't stay married long enough, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well she was brilliant.  As I say she ended up getting her doctorate in education because she thought it was the thing to do.  And she said that the problem with so many educators in and I'm reflecting that is self image.  We just--our self image says that we can't try this that we aren't used to.  So--
Speaker 1: So did she teach in New York City and in Connecticut too?
Speaker 2: She did and again, prejudice caught up with her, prejudice against a woman teaching whose husband was in a high position in the school.  So that's--they lost out on it I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26761
Speaker 1: Sir, my last question is similar to legacy but it's a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be--?
Speaker 1: Remembered.
Speaker 2: Presented or--?
Speaker 1: No, remembered.
Speaker 2: Remembered?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's good.  I think I tried to be helpful and I'd like to, that to be, to--helpful to all people.  As I say my--I believe in education and I believe that there's a need for educating poor people.  Not poor black people, poor Asian people or poor white people, poor people.  And that's what I'm going to leave whatever I have to the universities with an express desire that they try and help the poor in their communities.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 26762
Speaker 1: Okay, can you see that sir?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us about it?
Speaker 2: Well that's a part of the crew that I had because they--that's morning quarters.  And some of the people (unclear) sides were on duty and others were sleeping from having dinner on duty.  And that was on the morning quarters on the Sabine.  And as they say I was the first black officer on the--and those guys would, they'd call my wife, my mother when they got out of the service those that went through so the camp up there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is about 1946?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the same one when we're at sea.  And what we were looking for all over--the Japanese had put mines out and we were looking to see all the time if there were any out there.
Speaker 1: They're still clearing them now.
Speaker 2: Oh that's Westcon after--silly Vet just showing off with academic paraphernalia.
Speaker 1: That's what, graduation?
Speaker 2: Well that's again at an office.  They took pictures of me in my office in Manhattan for some publication or other.
Speaker 1: This would have been in the Seventies or--?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Would this have been in the '70s [1970s]? Was it in the '70s?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Oh that was Westcon had a jazz celebration and I was listening to them play.  It was great fun.  Well this was posted in the lobby of the Union Carbide building when I got some promotion or other.  They used to put, in their lobby they would put people who had done something and that was a promotion.  And that was Americans who--I think in that book where they were trying to say Americans' intelligence and see the office buildings in Manhattan behind my office--
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: --there.  That was all.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well in 1993, somebody decided that they had to talk about what blacks did during Black History Month.  And I don't know why they picked me to be the guy they examined.
