Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Arlene Langford Liggins.  A-R-L-E-N-E, Langford, L-A-N-G-F-O-R-D, Liggins, L-I-G-G-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born, June 6, 1923 in Phoebus, Virginia, which is a little suburb of Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 1: How--how do you spell Phoebus?
Speaker 2: I believe it's P-H-O-E-B-U-S.  I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now what--what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you go on that side?
Speaker 2: I--I didn't know her mother and father.  I stayed with them down in Phoebus when I was like three years old, but only for less than a year, and after that I didn't have much contact with them at all.  I do know more about her brothers and sisters--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are there're any--are there any stories passed down through the family about--about reconstruction or slavery or any--or--or going--or--or Africa even or going back--any stories at all?
Speaker 2: No.  Nothing so--none of our--my family--her side of the family was pretty rowdy.  So all of our stories about her family had to do with family fights and, you know, who is slickin' who and--cause it was about--I think maybe twelve brothers and sisters and those twelve brothers and sisters had many any children, you know so, not too much about history pre their life in Phoebus.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was a family originally from Virginia--I mean, you know, had they been in Virginia a long time?
Speaker 2: They had been in Virginia a long time but my mother's youngest brother recently started working on a family tree and I, I discovered that they had originally come from North Carolina and he was able--now this part is kind of going back to the enslavement--time of enslavement.  We found out that they lived on a plantation in North Carolina and they were able to trace the owner of the plantation's name-trace him back to Sussex [England] or Middlesex [England]--I can't remember what--maybe Sussex, England, but I don't have any more details on that.  It's kind of a work in progress right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they were on a--they started off in North Carolina--well--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) North Carolina.
Speaker 1: --as far they can go back is North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Right, as far--that we know so far.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, well you say your grandparents died when you were very young?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They died when I was young.
Speaker 1: So you didn't know them but--did your mother talk about them and how they got to Phoebus?
Speaker 2: All the time.  Yeah.  I got to know them, I think, through the stories that she told and that her, her brothers and sisters told and, they were very Christian,  Father was definitely the ruler of the household. What he said goes but the mother was also you know, the type of woman who I think my mother was a little bit like this--knew how to manipulate her environment so that she could get what she wanted as well, but I didn't know them all.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well do you have any stories about your uncles and aunts?
Speaker 2: I was instructed not to tell any of them when they found out I was coming here today, but I have a whole lot of stories about all of my uncles and aunts.  A particular one is, my Uncle Rudy who is the youngest and he is--my--all of my mother's brothers and sisters were very entrepreneurial, you know.  They worked jobs but they also hustled in a sense, so he was, I guess the consummate manipulator of the family and was always talking about how he walked with Malcolm X and how he knew [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  He was very much into talking about the movement and involved in it down in Hampton and--just always had all kinds of stories.  I know--the last family reunion he had he invited everybody to come to Hampton and said, "Everything's on me" and you, know.  "Wait right there, I'll be right back," and then they didn't see him anymore for the rest of the weekend and they all had to end up paying their own bills (laughs). But you know, he surfaced a few days later and he gave everybody their money back but who knows where he was and what he had been doing, but there's all kinds of stories about my mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were party girls and party guys.  They liked to have a good time.
Speaker 1: They were kind of slick as you said?
Speaker 2: They were slick, but they were all, you know not slick in--in a negative kind of way, they were just all very good at making the best out of, you know, an oppressive situation.  You know they lived in Harlem [New York, New York]--most of them now are either on the East Coast or the West Coast so--.
Speaker 1: So they came along during the [Great] Depression?
Speaker 2: Mh-hmm.
Speaker 1: Things were pretty rough--.
Speaker 2: I have a video of my mother and her sisters when they were in  Harlem--some of her brothers lived there as well, and it's really a gas to look at it, to see them, you know, being sexy and flirty coming down the street you know, and the style of the clothes then and my uncles who were very debonair and good looking men leaning on the cars and talking to the women as they went by--very colorful people.
Story_ID: 7782
Speaker 1: Now tell us about you're, you're mother [Arlene Langford Liggins].  What, what is she like and what, what does she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, she passed in '91 [1991] and she was a housewife basically, you know, from the time that, you know I really was aware of people working or doing things.  She was a housewife.  She was the matriarch of the family, and everybody in the neighborhood would come to her for help, she was that kind of person. She was a Jehovah's Witness. I was raised really by my grandparents [Marian Warner and Alice Marie Warner] after I came back from Phoebus [Virginia].  My grandmother on my father's [William Gray] side raised me.  So I wasn't raised with my mother.  We saw each other and we got together, but I didn't really get to know her as a woman until after my grandmother had died and I was living in the building that my grandmother owned and my mother--my father [William Gray] had died by then--my mother and her husband--my stepfather [Nathaniel Liggins] moved in across the hall and we got to be friends--as in addition to the mother-daughter relationship we had and that's when I realized that she was just like how they described her mother. Very domineering but would give you anything if you--you know could stand the tongue lashing first.  You know, she would always break down and go one and give it to you.  But you had to hear about it first, and if you pissed her off everybody in the family had to hear about it if you were a day late, you know paying her back or doing whatever, but very wise woman, very caring and very giving.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story about how, she got to Chicago [Illinois] from Phoebus?
Speaker 2: I think she got to Chicago via the East Coast, cause they went to--she went to, New York first and other places.  I think and I'm not real sure about this, but I think she met my father who was from Chicago and that's how she ended up here.  I'm not sure where they met.  I wanna say Detroit [Michigan] but I don't know why that's sticking in my head. But anyway, she out of all of the brothers and sisters--she was the only one that moved to the Midwest.  Everybody else went East or South--or West Coast, so that's how she got here.
Speaker 1: Now, had she been a Jehovah's Witness for a long time or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no. This was after my father died.  My father died when I was ten.  So that would have been somewhere around 1959, 1960 when he died and it was maybe two years after that, she had met Nathaniel Liggins who was my stepfather, although he wasn't a Jehovah's Witness.  I am not sure how she got into that, but she became a Jehovah's Witness shortly after that.  Before that she was, you know--I remember they all lived in the Sutherland Hotel on 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois], and when I would go over there, you know, they--they were the card playing and the Rudy Rae Moore [comedian, singer] records on the machine and "Okay, girl, come on out here and dance for me," you know, "our little girl can dance," you know, that kind of real you know--like to have a good time.
Story_ID: 7783
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father, what--what is his--can you give us his name and his full--full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was William Gray, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, G-R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I know he was born in Chicago, Illinois and he was in his fifties when he passed, but I don't know, 'cause my mother [Arlene Langford Liggins] and father were separated when I got old enough to you know, really start having knowledge about what things were going on and I didn't interact with him as much.
Speaker 1: So he died--, he was in his fifties and he was--?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah and I think he cause--well maybe late forties cause he was older than my other.  I remember being around ten or eleven when he died and so that was '59 [1959] so--that doesn't sound right, but anyway I don't remember.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe 1910 or so?
Speaker 2: That doesn't seem right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) 1915--well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe around fifteen--1915, maybe around then, cause my memory of him--I don't remember him looking that old.  You know what I mean, so--I don't really remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, now well what do you know about his side of the family?  Now, he was--he was born in Chicago, and you--you were raised by his mother right?
Speaker 2: I was raised by his mother and his stepfather, there were two of them, his brother's name was Lincoln and they were the only children of Alice Marie LeBoeuf (ph.) Warner, was her name.  Her maiden name was LeBoeuf. She was Creole from Louisiana, who was a--raised me and was a very strict, very firm unbending kind of woman.  Very pretty woman, she had two sons.  One was my father who was William Gray, who was my color--a little bit darker and her other son Lincoln who was much lighter, their father, and I didn't read--(really)--know this until after my grandmother had died and I just started going through her boxes and things.  Their father was Professor [William] Gray who was a--one of the first black professors at a college down in Louisiana.  I wanna say Leland University [sic, Leland College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] but I am not sure.  I have to go back and look that up, but he died--he--he was much older than my grandmother and he died, she left Louisiana, you know, which is where she was from and came to Chicago and met Marian Warner, who was my stepfather--my step-grandfather, and he helped--married her and helped her to raise her two boys right here on the South Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now did they have any stories that they passed down from the nineteenth century or--or?
Speaker 2: They--my grandmother never shared much about anything in terms of her life.  Stuff that I figured out about her and her family came from other relatives and people who knew her, my grandmother was very--you know how we talk about being color struck?  She was extremely color struck.  The relationship that she had with my father was very different than the relationship she had with her other son, Lincoln, my uncle who died in New York before I was even born--I think--.
Speaker 1: Do you think this is due to their--due--due to the color of--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah, I remember vividly--my sister--I have a twin sister [Judi Waller] whose lighter than I am, and she use to always tell me, you know, make sure you marry a light-skinned man so you can have pretty kids, you know and--I mean she was very--and I--I resented her a lot.  In fact my sister and I used to--it was--she and I were very close because my grandmother on top of being color struck was also very rigid and--and my sister and I use to make up stories to tell the other kids in the neighborhood about why we could never come outside and play, you know, you know, we had invented parents who were in the military and--this mean ole' lady was keeping us until our real parents came back and all kinds of crazy stuff. But then I started talking to an aunt who was also from the same area who told me about my grandmother's life prior to her coming to Chicago and meeting her husband, and she had had a very hard and painful life and I think that she was probably the darker sister or you know sibling in her family and differences had been made toward her, I don't know if all of this is true but one of my relatives said that she had been lost in a card game--her first husband, prior to Professor Gray was a older white man who won her basically in a card game and he was abusive and I don't know if he was verbally abusive, physically abusive or whatever, but she had a very hard life with him and--you know, somehow got away from him and married Professor Gray, who was very, very dark, you know, very, very dark and I guess he was never really accepted by her family but then again he had status because he was an educated man. He worked, you know, he had--he--I--got some of his books that he collected.  So after I started hearing stories about her, then I got a different appreciation for her life and what she had gone through and it helped me to deal with some of the things and--that she put on my head about color and race.  I remember she was a fur finisher at a furrier here in Chicago and a very creative woman--could design and sew anything, and she would never talk about white people 'cause I was militant from a very early age you know, and she was like, (whispers) "The other race," you know, she would never say, "White people."  She was like, "The other race--You have to be very careful around the other race."  And her voice would always drop you know, it's like somebody's listening you know, you'll get in trouble if you say it.  So I was defiant from day one with her.
Story_ID: 7784
Speaker 1: You were raised by her [grandmother, Alice Marie Warner] from age three on or--?
Speaker 2: From age three 'til until I went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  That's really a complicated--.
Speaker 2: I knew that she loved us but she was you know, she was very conscious and I knew she loved me that's, you know, in her way she--did--was--you know her thing about you know, "Go get you a light-skinned man--," she thought she was get--doing me a favor by telling me that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is something that--that is common, you know--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for people to do but it's--it rare that people--people actually talk about for some reason. I don't know why--in these interviews that we--we conduct hardly anybody talks about this, but it's something that's common and you would think they would be discussed more.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's very prevalent, you know and I'm sure you've probably had the same experiences, going to school, you know. The darker kids unless they had long hair and were you know super smart, tended to not get as much attention or be noticed as much, you know, and when we would be arguing in the street, the thing--the worst thing we could say about somebody was you "Black so-and-so" you know, and thank God we are getting past that.
Speaker 1: Let's hope so (laughs).
Speaker 2: Well, we--it--I remember my youngest brother [Michael Gray] is fairer skinned than I am and this was during the militant--you know when people were starting to get more conscious about Africa and about their heritage and stuff and--four of--my--my mother [Arlene Langford Liggins] and father [William Gray] had eight children and four of us were kind of brown skinned and the other four were a little lighter skinned and the brown skinned went, "You ole' mariny so-and-so," and he would just cry you know--we would pick on our lighter brothers and sisters because they were as dark you know, so they wasn't as black.  You--you know how we did each other in those days.
Speaker 1: Now, what does that term mean?  I've heard that before, and I don't--?
Speaker 2: Mariny?  I don't know where it came from. I think it's a Southern term cause my mother use to say, "You little ole' mariny bastard you," you know.  I think it means yellow.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, if--if--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) It's some kind of classification--.
Speaker 2: --morino might be a word--morino, I think, I don't remember my high school Spanish, but I it might mean yellow maybe in some language. That sounds--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, but I know I've heard it before and I never knew exactly what it was, but it's not the first time I've heard it. We hear all those things(unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you don't hear it much any--that was a old school thing, you know.
Story_ID: 7785
Speaker 1: Now what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory?  I'm trying to think.  How far back do I remember? This is silly, but I remember I was in grammar school at Willard Elementary [Chicago, Illinois] and I must have been in the first grade and we were having a spelling con----a spelling contest and I thought I was the best speller in the room and the teacher said, "Spell 'eye" and I said, "I".  (Laughs)  She said, spell--you know she thought I was being flip or something.  She said, "No.  I want you to spell 'I'," and I was like, "I!  Dummy!  I" cause I'm thinking I--me--the person, and she said, "Wrong--you know, you are out of the contest."  I was like, "But you do spell it 'I', see?" And I wrote it on the paper.  She said, "No dear.  I mean eye, E-Y-E." And I was like, "Oh, how dumb am I?"  That's--that's--(unclear) I don't know why I remember that, but--. (Laughs)
Speaker 1: That's you're--you think that's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: I remember a birth--the first--the only birthday party that I can ever remember having 'cause I had pictures of it of me and my sister and some of the friends of my mother's [Arlene Langford Liggins] from the church--my grandmother's [Alice Marie Warner] rather--from her church and I guess we were about three years old, and I don't remember having a real good time at that party.  That's about it.  That's about as young as I can go back.  I think I've repressed a lot of stuff from living with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Let's see,--well--.
Speaker 2: Well--well, I will say--but this is older.  My grandfather [Marian Warner] who loved my--my step-grandfather who loved my grandmother dearly--he was a--more like my mother's side of the family was.  He liked to have a good time too and whatever salvation my sister and I got, came through him because he would always--like on the weekends--"Get dressed you gonna hang with me today."  And we'd go out and we go all up and down 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois] and go visit places--and I knew my grandmother who was very religious--would never approve of us going.  So I got to learn about, you know, life in the city more through him and from my earliest memory of him--every night at 8:30 he would make a snack, you know, and it would be tripe or cold roast beef or whatever it was that he felt like eating and I would sit there--my sister would be going to bed.  I would sit there with him and we would talk at the table and he'd make me a sandwich and we'd just, you know, kind of be together, so, but that's the only memory I guess I have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Going--I mean as far back--that far back.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well,--.
Speaker 2: You all stop me cause I will ramble (laughs).
Speaker 1: All right, okay. What--tell us about the neighborhood and--and the environment around there.  What--what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: We lived at 706 East 51st Street when I was growing up.  My grandmother and grandfather, were one of the first black people to buy a six-flat over in that area, and I remember when I was little--it was right across the street from Washington Park.  They had gardens in the park then and there were ducks in the pond then, and I remember my grandmother--cause she use to always talk about Negroes, you know, how the--during the depression or when it----or during hard times rather--black people would go over there and get the ducks and shoot 'em and eat 'em.  That's what she said, I don't--I don't know if that was true, but I loved growing up (laughs)--it was huh (laughs)?  But she owned this--you know--owned this--her and my stepfather owned--step- grandfather owned this six-flat building and I loved growing up over there.  It was a really nice, stable, black community.  I don't remember--I guess--after they got there--well--by the time I was three--is when I moved there--I remember being able to play outside on the front, you know, my grandfather would take us across the street, you know, to play in the park, on the corner there were a--was a--drug store that was owned by a Jewish couple and it was like the hub of the neighborhood. Everybody went there to get everything and right across from that was a newspaper stand and the park benches and all the bums of the area use to be out on this park bench. And every morning when I would go up to the corner to get the newspaper, you know I'd sit and stop and talk with the--you know, the guys and they'd be drinking, but it was like they were the neighborhood--to me they were the neighborhood watchdogs.  You know, they knew everything that was going on.  They knew everybody who was coming in the neighborhood.  They saw everything that was going on and they were almost like the sentry--guarding--you know--guarding away, and I had a real positive feeling about them, 'cause they weren't mean or anything like that.
Speaker 1: They would sort of look out for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were looking out for you, and they would tell you everything that was going on, you know.  Passing the bottle back and forth, and I remember that's when I really started getting into, you know, being more conscious about black people in our position--in, you know in the United States in America, 'cause they would be arguing about whatever was the current news of the day.  You know, they had an opinion about it and I remember sitting there and listening to the arguments that they would have about you know, what Jesse Jackson was doing as I got older, or whatever, you know.  They had very strong opinions about it, especially after they had had a few drinks.
Story_ID: 7786
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever attend the Washington Park forum, you know in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] where the people--?
Speaker 2: Oh, on 55th [Street, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, where they--.
Speaker 2: Were they had the circular park benches?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Marian Warner] would go over there and every now and then I would go with him and just sit and listen.  Duke Jenkins, Ulysses 'Duke' Jenkins use to go over there all the time and he would go by my house and sometime I'd be out on the front and he would stop and talk to me about things that they were discussing over there.  That's a really missed tradition now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We don't have that, but it would always be a gathering of old men--but basic--to me they looked old, they probably weren't that old then, but you know, being young--they looked old.  Who every Sunday, every Saturday, you know they would be out there talking and discussing things and planning strategy.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you first--when you started developing this political kind of consciousness?
Speaker 2: I was in grammar school and I--I don't know where it came from, but we would be watching television--my sister and my brothers--we'd be watching television.  This is when they would come over--'cause they didn't live there.  Only my--my twin sister [Judi Waller] and I lived with my grandmother [Alice Marie  Warner], but my brothers, and my other sister would come over, you know from time to time, and I remember we were watching some cowboy and Indians movie, and the Indians were being slaughtered and I started crying.  I was really--you know not out of sadness, out of anger.  It just didn't seem right to me, and  when we would play cowboys and Indians, I would always volunteer to be the Indians and then I would try to beat my brothers' butts (laughs), so the Indians could win sometimes.  So that was kind of like--I thought of it then as always wanting to be for the underdog, 'cause--maybe cause of the way my grandmother dealt with me, I saw myself as an underdog.  So, you know, that's my little dime store psychology about it.  But as early as then, I remembered going to Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church and I was not in high school yet and the minister had taken a trip to Europe and one Sunday in the pulpit he was showing pictures of his trip to Europe and pointing out all these--and I was like, well what's the big deal about that?  You should have went to Africa.  And where Hales Franciscan [High School, Chicago, Illinois] is now, there use to be a building there, and I remember we use to ride our bikes up and down Cottage Grove and on the side of this building that was there, it said, "Black Mary, black Jesus, black Holy--Ghost." And I almost fell off my bike 'cause when I saw it, it was like what?  'Cause I had never heard the concept of--'cause in this church I went to, of course, blue eyes and long, long blonde hair for Jesus, and when I sat that, it was like--almost like an epiphany for me and I started reading and trying to go through the Bible. I came upon this passage where they described Jesus as having hair like lambs wool and you know, the lips and all this, and I was at Sunday School and I remember, "Excuse me--I got a question--you know, excuse me--you know, is it true that Jesus--I think Jesus was a black man?" And--she took me to the preacher and he told me I have blasphemed for saying that Jesus was a black man.  I said, "Well it say right here," and he was like, "You're--you know black--." I don't even know what excuse he gave me, but then after that I was like, well, I'm black, so why is it a sin--why is it a blaspheme to say that Jesus was black.  Why couldn't he be black?  And I had no, you know, I wasn't conscious of anything in terms of a movement at that time.  It just didn't make sense to me, you know, so.
Speaker 1: About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was still in grammar school.  I might have been like twelve by then, you know, and--and from after that it was no holds barred for religion.
Story_ID: 7787
Speaker 1: You were at--at Ebenezer [Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and you pretty much at age twelve it kind of falsified Christianity--?
Speaker 2: I had started rejecting a lot of stuff that I was being taught in Sunday School or in church, you know and I think it was primarily because of the response I had, you know, I was mentioning to you about raising the issue and--you know an earlier age about Jesus being black because of the way that he was described in the Bible and the reaction that the preacher had.  So that kind of set me into well, if I can't believe this in the Bible, then what else can't I believe? You know, what else is made up, you know, or what are we not misinterpreting, you know. What are we misinterpreting rather and it just set me on a path of questioning, you know, a lot of stuff.
Speaker 1: Did--so--so you--you were like--did you go to church a lot?  I mean you--you were--?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Alice Marie Warner] was very religious, so we spent a lot of time in church.  All day on Sunday, you know BTU [Baptist Training Union] on Monday or whatever day of the week--I--you know, at least two, three nights out of the week, other than Sunday, we were going to the church for something. She was involved in a lot of committees, she was on the building fund, she was, you know, on the Mississippi Club, which was funny cause she was from Louisiana, but we spent a lot of time there and I made some really fast and good friends while I was in church there and, you know, compatriots, who we would do all kinds of things together in church.  We got to be kind of a little bunch of people in church and I remember us saying, you know, maybe we ought to try to convince the church to let us have a junior church so we don't have to stay in the main church, hot and sweaty and long--falling to sleep--so, and the church said, okay, that was a good idea.  So we had our own little junior church that happened like during--right before and into the time of the main service, but it ended before--and the idea was when ours ended, we were to then join the main congregation for the regular church, which I think we probably did once or twice and then after that, it was like hey, we're out, our parents are in there, let's hit the street. And we would just go outside and you know, hang around (laughs).  My grandmother's not living anymore so she can't spank me for that now.  I don't think she ever really knew--and one thing about my grandmother--this just occurred to me, she would always believe anything I said.  I mean she always thought that I was very honest and told the truth about everything, and whenever anybody told her any different, like if I got busted by somebody else and they told on me, she would just, oh, no, no, that couldn't possibly be true, you know.  So she believed us a lot and I know one Sunday, we went to a--we use to call it a holy roller church that was down the street from Ebenezer and we went in and they were playing the tambourines and dancing and jumping and--and we were sitting in the back snickering and laughing and poking fun at it cause we didn't know what was going on and we got ready to leave and they had locked the door.  You couldn't leave during whatever this ceremony was and I said, "Oh, hell, we gonna get it now," because their service lasted--whatever it was that was happening--lasted past the time that Ebenezer was out.  So my grandmother would--and my grandfather and everybody else's parents were standing out in front of the church hot and pissed because they didn't know where we were, and so we got out of the church finally and ran down to the street, you know ran down the street to Ebenezer and took our punishment.  You know, after that my grandmother made me come and sit next to her after the junior church was over.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your church invest you with responsibilities or so--you know as a youth, I mean did you have--have duties and things--?
Speaker 2: I had, yeah, I got involved with a lot of things in church.  I always liked to read so--and you know, as you can tell, run my mouth, so on occasion I would--I had responsibilities inside of the junior church cause myself, my sister and some of the others of us were kind of like the organizers of it.  My sister was on the junior usher board.  I was involved in the young peoples' Baptist training BTU Group, Baptist Training Union group.  I remember going on--I was in the choir.  I did little piano recitals there, so I was actively involved.

Speaker 1: Was music a big part of your life growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was and I hated it, because my grandmother [Alice Marie Warner] at age five made me start taking piano lessons with Professor Frederick, who was member of our church and he and his wife were the meanest people I had ever met in my life and I would sit down at the piano and he was--he was kind of nice, but his wife was kind of crazy, and so if I made a mistake.  She would say "Move your hands!" And she would slam the, you know, the piano top down.  I was like, "Okay (laughs)--this is not--this is not too good."  But I stuck with it, and you know, I guess I had a kind of a talent for it, and then my mother--when I--my grandmother  [Alice Marie Warner] when I got to be about twelve or thirteen--around up in that age, sent me to Lyon and Healy [music company] so I was taking piano lessons down in Lyon & Healy on Saturdays.  Hated it because everybody else was going to the show on Saturdays.  So I felt like I'm being punished again.  I can't go hang with my friends.  I gotta always--and I had this little white lady.  She was a little Jewish woman, who was very nice who taught me the scales and the fundamentals, but I couldn't relate to her because she was to--she was teaching me as if I were a younger person--she was sweet as she could be--she always had little treats for you when you came to class, but it was like every good boy does fine to learn the scales, and I wanted to get into improv and just--you know--seeing what I could do and--"Oh, no, no, no, no--you know, you have to play this--you have to play it this way," and so I think any kind of desire to go down that path was kind of pushed out of me between Professor Frederick and Lyon & Healy.
Story_ID: 7789
Speaker 1: Now tell me about school.  What--what--what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to Williard School [Chicago, Illinois] up until--I think, seventh grade and then the old Provident Hospital, they changed to Vincennes Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois], and I went there for seventh and eighth grade and that's where I graduated from.  Our class in seventh grade--we were the first class in the Vincennes Upper Grade Center, so we were kind of you know, trailblazers even then it was kind of an experiment, I guess that the city had with that area, cause It think Williard was having a lot of--maybe infrastructure problems and they got eventually closed down, but I think at that point too it was over crowded so they took the seventh and eighth grades and moved them to Vincennes.  The ones that lived on--in a certain side of the area went to Vincennes and then others went to, I think, Burke to finish out.  So of course we had a rivalry with [Edmund] Burke [Chicago, Illinois] which was down the street on King Drive at 55th [Street].  But I had a--a good time at school.  My sister--my twin sister [Judi Waller] and I were there and, I had good teachers, you know.  I remember, Clarence--what was Clarence--you know who I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Clarence Taylor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mr. Taylor, and was my art--division teacher for a while and my art teacher that's when I first started learning about Africa, because he would always talk to us about African culture, all of the art projects that he had us do--I remember we would--made African masks and he would bring in these books and start showing us things and then, Mr. Williams who you see all the time now passing out pluggers, he is always doing conscious-raising things at Capitan Hard Times--.
Speaker 1: Right--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't remember his first name.
Speaker 1: He calls himself Professor Williams.
Speaker 2: Professor Williams, he was--a substitute teacher of mine when I was at Vincennes, so I've been knowing them both a long time, but Mr. Taylor who found--was one of the founders of XBAG [Experimental Black Actors' Guild] was a very influential--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, XBAG was a theater group--a black theater group.
Speaker 2: Yes, XBAG the theater group.
Speaker 1: Experimental black theater.
Speaker 2: Right, experimental black theater.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, it is was an experimental black actors' guild--I think is where XBAG came along.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then I went to Hyde Park High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, so any--any other teachers at Williard or--or Vincennes?
Speaker 2: At--I think--I don't remember too many of the teachers at Willard, but at Vincennes Upper Grade Center, there was Mr. Pendleton (ph.) who was my math teacher.  I'm very bad at math but he was very nice and very patient--didn't make me feel stupid about it, but I think those are the ones that I remember the most.  I remember Mr. Williams because when he first came to sub, we were so horrible to him--my class was so horrible to him and (laughs) he was sitting at the desk and I remember one of the guys was doing spitballs or something and--or wads of tissue that he had spit on and threw up there then one of them hit Mr. Williams on top of the head and he looked up to the ceiling to see if the roof was leaking, then you know, of course the whole class fell out laughing, but I think our regular teacher must have gotten sick because we ended up having him a lot more and he ended up being another one who came with a different perspective you know, than the other teachers were and he really challenged us to think differently about things even at that early age.
Speaker 1: I think he name was DeWitt--.
Speaker 2: DeWitt, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, DeWitt Williams, right, right.
Story_ID: 7790
Speaker 1: Were you keenly aware of what was going on in the--or did your parents--your grandmother [Alice Marie Warner] talk about the Civil Rights Movement when you were in grade school like Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Montgomery [Alabama bus boycott] or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  I remember Martin Luther King came to Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois] where I was a member and he spoke and that was, a wonderful experience.  The whole church was packed and my grandmother--.
Speaker 1: When was that?  I'm sorry, when--.
Speaker 2: Ooh, I don't even remember.
Speaker 1: When you were in grade school still or were you in high school [Hyde Park High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember.  I might have been in high school by then, but I'm not sure, but I remember my grandfather [Marian Warner] and my--insisted that we go and my grandmother said, okay and we went and I think she--what she heard from him scared her because she thought about okay, if we go up against--she saw white people as really being all powerful and I don't think she had no great love for them but she saw them as being the master race.  Like I said it was almost eerie how she would always say the other race when she was talking about them--and she worked for them--worked downtown for you know, good white people, as she would say.
Speaker 1: Well--well she was--when you described earlier, I mean she was really in a--in a powerless position I guess, she was--.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: She was won within a card game or something--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--and that's what I'm saying that after I got to know more of her story then I understood her--her views on things a little bit better, and then on the flip side with my grandmother she would always say, "If you want something done right, you have to get the other race to do it."  So she had a--she had a lot of issues that were unresolved, I think for her as--as a person--as a black woman.  What did you ask me?
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking about her reaction to Dr. King.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--I think it was--I think that she probably understood and maybe even agreed with the whole right for equality cause she always use to talk about what it would take for us to be equal and her think was, you need to get an education, you need to know as much as you can, she really encouraged me to read as much as possible, but her whole thing was so you can get outta here.  So you can get out of the ghetto, so you can escape, you know, what black people have to go through and I never did, you know, go--put--buy into that.  But I think her--her--her thing like I said was fear that if black people were to rise up against the other race, that it would be dangerous, you know and that we would be harmed.  She really lost it when she found out that I had gotten involved with the Black Panther Party.  She--.
Speaker 1: Whoa--whoa, now wait--wait let's--.
Speaker 2: "Whoa, you gonna be killed," (laughs) but you know.
Story_ID: 7791
Speaker 1: Tell us about high school.  Now you went to Hyde Park?
Speaker 2: I went to Hyde Park [High] School [Chicago, Illinois] and had a good time--that was my coming out, you know, as far as you know having fun and doing things--made friendships there that most of my good friends--we're still friends today.  One of the most influential--I had several influential teachers there.  Professor Black--Timuel Black, was my teacher at Hyde Park, who is a noted historian today.
Speaker 1: He's on the board of this organization.
Speaker 2: Oh is he really!  Okay.  Peb Ali (ph.)--he calls himself Peb Ali now--he was Mr. Boykin then.  He was a teacher there, Marva Lee (ph.) who is very active in supporting a lot of causes and groups now--was my gym teacher.  I remember Emma Stacker (ph.).  I have to talk about Miss Stacker and I'm not sure if Miss Stacker is still living, but she was like a little bitty black woman who was the--didn't take no mess from nobody.  She was the kind of person who--it was a---by the time I got there the Blackstone Rangers [gang] were you know all through the school and everything, but she did not give a doggone who you were or who you called yourself--whether you were a gouster or an ivy leaguer.  If you were somewhere that you didn't belong, where is your hall pass--you coming with me and she didn't have no problem pulling you by the ear.  She didn't take no stuff, but she was always a person who you could go to and be--you know she would help you find out about things--if you were having problems she was the person who was there for you, so she got much respect from people--from the kids in the school.  They didn't mess with her, she was you know--the principal would go and get Ms. Stacker if he needed an issue resolved cause she didn't play, you know. She was the kind of person who commanded respect.  You know, who gave it as well.  Another teacher who had an impact there was Jerome Ramsfield who was head of the choir.  My good friends and I, you know, we always were looking for ways to get out of class right, so we said oh, okay, one way is to get involved in school activities.  So we would go and we all went and signed up for the girls chorus, you know, Mr. Ramsfield and another lady--I can't remember her name.  I think her name was Miss Spurlock, were head of the choir and my love for music, you know, kind of started coming back then.  And he was probably one of the--he was a gay man--who at that time we didn't really you know--I didn't really know what gay was.  I guess other people did--but I knew that he was different, but he was also the kind of teacher, kind of like Ms. Stacker--he wasn't the disciplinarian she was, but he was the one who always, you know talked about believing in yourself and just being able to have freedom of thought, so he was a very--he was the kind of--kind of person who got me to broadening my thinking about things and how I saw things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you started Hyde Park in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Was it a--now do you remember--I'm just gonna ask you.  Do--do--do you remember Dr. King's speech in '63 [1963]?  Were you--were you--did you remember hearing that?
Speaker 2: I don't--I didn't hear it then--.
Speaker 1: Well, it would have been I guess just when--before you started school or something--.
Speaker 2: Right, I don't remember--I don't remember hearing it at that point--.
Speaker 1: He had a march on Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right--the whole march on Washington.  I remember that because my father--my mother's [Arlene Langford Liggins] brothers and their families all went to the march on Washington and they have a video of them there and you know we got a chance to see that video, so.  I was just starting to get politicized--.
Speaker 1: Was that--what is that--an eight millimeter movie?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I always ask--where did they get that from because it's on a cassette so I'm not sure how they--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe it's transferred from an eight--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it must be transferred--especially the one that I was mentioning earlier with my mother on it cause I don't think they even had video cameras back then.  And it's a--a great quality but it's surprisingly you know, very clear as far as being able to see what's--the action and stuff on it.  So, when I start--went to Hyde Park too, also was I think, if I'm not mistaken, the year that [U.S. President John F.] Kennedy was assassinated.  Wasn't that November of '63 [1963]?  'Cause I remember there being you know, kids were crying and fighting and just all kinds of pandemonium at Hyde Park High School on that day.  You know, we were all out--outside--the school was let out you know, so I was just starting to get politicized, if you will in Hyde Park, and more, you know, rebellious, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Yeah, these--these teachers who were on the cutting edge too, you know Peb Ali--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, Tim Black--.
Speaker 1: You know, Tim Black, you know--they're--they're--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And others whose names you know I'm sure--I'll--at 3:00 this morning their names will come to me, but, yeah--.
Speaker 1: You know Peb Ali was in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] at one time, and now he--.
Speaker 2: And they always, you know, they were--I--I've really, you know in retrospect see how a long the way these different educators and mentors came through my life and gave me you know different ideas and perspectives, some of which I'm just now starting to make connections about, you know, the--the journey--you know, so it's interesting.
Story_ID: 7792
Speaker 1: What were you favorite subjects in Hyde Park [High School, Chicago, Illinois] when you--?
Speaker 2: English was my favorite subject at Hyde Park.  English and history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so how'd--how'd you do grade wise?  Did you make good grades?
Speaker 2: I did pretty good.  I--I made good grades.  I also--you know like I said--I made good grades cause you know it wasn't tolerated by my grandmother [Alice Marie Warner] not to make good grades, but I was also, you know--high school was freedom for me because my grandmother was very strict.  So when I went--I loved going to school 'cause it got me out of the house and, you know we had all kinds of schemes we use to cook up--like I--my grandmother, I told you she was--you know--always believed me cause I was you know the good girl.  I was the dark-skinned one so, of course, you know, I was the good girl and I remember we use to cut school a lot and I didn't just want to cut school, so I would call--I would go to the matron's office, "I'm sick, I don't feel good, you know."  So I was her honor student in honor classes, so you know, of course, I wasn't lying and they would call my grandmother--you see at that time they would call to see if it was okay for them to give you an early dismissal and my grandmother said, "If she doesn't feel good, yes, let her come on home, you know that's fine," 'cause my grandmother didn't--was by this time not working and then I would wait a few minutes and then I'd call my grandmother sounding all pitiful and say, "Well, you know I--I--we got a test this afternoon, and I--I really don't feel bad, but I'm--you know I really don't feel good but I'm gonna tough it out and just go ahead and stay in school."  She'd say, "Well if you want to, okay," and then I'd say yes!, freedom. I'm gonna escape--I got an early dismissal form, my grandmother's not expecting me--party (laughs), you know, so we had all kinds of little gimmicks like that to get out of school, but I kept my grades up pretty good.
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in activities around the school like student council or did you get involved in cheerleading or one of those marching groups or anything?
Speaker 2: I had my picture taken with a lot of things, 'cause when they--you know (laughs)--we ran, you know whenever we found out different clubs were getting their pictures taken, we'd go and sit there and smile so we'd get our name in the yearbook a lot of times. (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Now--now wait a minute, you--your picture is in these clubs and--that you really didn't--?
Speaker 2: A couple, maybe one or two, you know.
Speaker 1: That's--that's--you know--.
Speaker 2: But I was in girls' chorus, I was in the a cappella choir, so those parts were true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was about it, and--.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in dance in any way?
Speaker 2: Not a drop.  There was no dance really.
Speaker 1: Any athletic kind of activity?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't very coordinated back then.  I didn't think I was very coordinated back then cause we--you know we talking about my grandmother who--by--to her it was a sin to dance.  You know, we couldn't--with my grandmother we couldn't listen to a certain kind of music.  I remember my grandfather [Marian Warner] brought me a record--what you call phonograph that played seventy-eights [78 RPM records] and the he got me a little adapter so I could play the forty-fives [45 RPM records], but my grandmother would monitor the kind of music we listened to, you know.  I remember Johnny Mathis had a song that she didn't want us listening to, if you can believe that, and I don't remember which one it was.  So, I wasn't allowed to dance.  I wasn't allowed to finger pop, you know, or anything.  So I didn't realize that I could dance until I went to high school and I just kind of started figuring out how I could lie my way out of the house and go to the parties at night.  You know at Hales Franciscan [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and at St. Columnbanus--use to have parties and stuff that the high school kids would go to and the Hyde Park Neighborhood Club, so, I didn't really know that I could dance to--really until then.  My mother [Arlene Langford Liggins], when I would be with her when I was really little would have me finger popping, but it was not allowed in my household.
Story_ID: 7793
Speaker 1: So did you get involved with the Black Panthers [political party] in high school [Hyde Park High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Where was it?
Speaker 2: Nope, I didn't get involved with the Panthers until--I didn't get really started you know going in that direction 'til I went to college and I went to North Central College which was in Naperville [Illinois], and that--.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you decide--now what was graduation like first of all, then how--how did you decide to go to North Central?
Speaker 2: Well graduation was another one of our--you know--militant things--I guess 'cause of the type of teachers we had.  There was this guy in our graduating class--McDonnelly Miles--were graduating from Medina Temple and we were all down at Medina Temple, you know the place was full with our parents and stuff.  It was like a big graduating class that year and Donnelly came and said, you know he was crying, you know, his family was all out in the audience. They weren't going to let him march, because they realized that he had had--he was short of credits, but he came anyway thinking that, you know, they would let him march, and they said, "No you can't march."  So we staged a protest, you know, we sat down, took the robes off and sat in--you know sat down in the back and said, "He don't march, we don't march."  Hey, that's just the way it is, and--.
Speaker 1: Did they give in?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  They gave in--they gave in.  Everybody was like, "Yes, hey."  So, he marched, you know.  We said that just wasn't right and our whole sense of--you know back in that day and I'm sure you--you were in a similar way--it wasn't so much about, its just what seemed right and wrong.  It was like our sense of right was offended and we just weren't gonna let that happened like that.  So we sat down and we were singing 'We Shall Overcome' and acting like--having a good old time, and I remember a good friend of mine, her mother got wind of it.  She said, "Your behind is gonna march across that stage," and she said, "Okay mom, okay mom." But you know, luckily you know this school said, "Okay" and we all marched across the stage, but then I was going out with the basketball--one of the basketball stars at the time and he was going to--he had got a scholarship--a basketball scholarship to Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas]--I think it was, and I was gonna go there and I really wasn't even interested that much in going to college, I was just gonna--you know we were gonna get married and I was gonna move to Texas and be with him, and then we broke up.  So, I said oh, okay, so now what'll I do?  So, I'd heard that North Central had a music program and they were looking for black students.  So I applied and got accepted into the music program as a music major.  Can you--you know--hated it--piano, but--but I had a perfect pitch.  I could read music and a good ear and so--you know--okay--I--I thought it would be something easy for me to do you know, not really having an inclination to go to college, and that's how I ended up at North Central, and it was a horrible experience for me.
Speaker 1: That's up in Lake--Forest--or--or?
Speaker 2: Naperville.
Speaker 1: Naperville?  Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in Naperville and while I was there is when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated and I remember the school calling me--'cause he got assassinated--wasn't that in--in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Right, I was at--.
Speaker 1: April 4th.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in Naperville and I remember there were maybe--maybe fifty if that many black kids at the college throughout the whole four--you know four grades at that time and I remember it was a beautiful campus and I had phys ed [physical education], kinesthiology or whatever it was, and I had to walk across this field like--this big open area to get to the phys ed  building and I had gym early in the morning and you know white folks would be out throwing stuff at us and hollering stuff at us so we started walking to class in groups and--or just refusing to go until the college did something about it.
Speaker 1: Now, they would actually throw things at you and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a tense area.  It didn't happen in the you know, college itself, but going anyplace else in Naperville at that time--we found out that there was a law still on the books--at least it's what we were told.  It said, blacks couldn't be on Main Street unless they were domestics.  You know so that was when we really, you know, said, aw, hell no, and I remember--.
Speaker 1: This is supposed to be Illinois right?  This is--you know I'm from Chicago right?
Speaker 2: There--we all--well, but then--I can't think of the name of the college that was near Naperville, but there we found in a--a--city there--there was a local branch of the of the Ku Klux Klan, you know in Illinois, and it was in this place.  I can't think of the name of the city.  It will come to me, but when King died, the college called all of us together, and you know was counseling and blah, blah, and blah and what we realized--they were afraid that you know we would go and get these black folks from the--from Chicago to come up and torch Naperville.  It was like, "Please, nobody is even thinking about you people here."  But they weren't--you know, that's what they were concerned about that--cause they had these black students from you know the South Side of Chicago and the West Side of Chicago and I think a couple from Detroit [Michigan] that we would bring our gangs up there to destroy Naperville, you know, so they were making sure that that didn't happen.  But, I only stayed there a year and then I went to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where I, you know, really got into the Black Power Movement--as it was called then.
Story_ID: 7794
Speaker 1: Well, so you were at North Central [College, Naperville, Illinois] for a year, so then you transferred to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: I transferred to Roosevelt.  Actually, my step-grandfather [Marian Warner] passed and I came back to help my grandmother [Alice Marie Warner] and enrolled in Roosevelt and it was at Roosevelt--I was a music major at North Central, of course I knew I didn't really want to do that, so I think I was a psychology major at the time and--ooh, what is his name?  His son--his--he was a professor there--age is a terrible thing.  Anyway, at North--at Roosevelt is when I really started getting more actively involved in the movement.  I knew I joined the black student union there and--what is his name?  A famous black--.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: I think it was history.  I can't remember now but anyway--it will come to me at three in the morning and I will call you, but--that's why-I, I, I got involved in the black student union and we did a takeover of the school at Roosevelt and we went to my psych class and several of the other classes and we got there early--we had it all orchestrated and we went into the room and wrote on the blackboard, "This class is now black psychology 101" so anybody that won't--that don't want to take black psychology you may leave and when the professor came--you know he was like "Okay, this is now black psychology 101."  It was happening all over the school, you know it's like, what?  You know, we were doing our thing--there, there were other types of things taking place at other colleges.  I think Northern [Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] was you know--there was one going on at Northern.  Of course, it was immediately squashed by the administration and we couldn't do it and I met--Fred Hampton [deputy chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party] and others came and did--I'm not sure how I got introduced to them, but they came and did something at the campus at North--at Roosevelt.  And then I started going over to the you know the office that they had and what they were saying was making sense to me and I started investigating and reading more about, you know, you know, the political side of things.
Speaker 1: Now, where was the office located in those days?
Speaker 2: I think it was on, 2350 West Madison [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's on the West Side of Chicago which is--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: So after we did the, you know, takeover and declared the classes as now black psychology, black math, black whatever, after that I got really disengaged from school and I eventually dropped out which I regret to this day and you know, moved on the West Side and all power to the people, you know for the next couple of years.
Speaker 1: So what did you do at--what--what kind of work did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I was involved in the [Free] Breakfast for Children program, we had the free legal clinic and health clinic on the West Side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you worked full-time in the Black Panthers?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was--.
Speaker 1: So, you--you didn't have to a job and then do something else.
Speaker 2: I can't even remember--what did we--you know I wouldn't--type--I could type real good so I would do temp jobs every now and then, but and you know I'd go see my grandmother [Alice Marie Warner]--I need some money, but pretty much you know, we were into the communal living, a girlfriend of mine and I--in fact two or three of us we had an apartment together and sometimes we would stay at my girlfriend's mother's house, and you know so we were in the life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Fred Hampton was the--the--the head of the Illinois Chapter--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, Fred Hampton, right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Illinois Chapter--Black Panthers.
Speaker 2: Chairman Fred, he was the Chairman.  Mm-hmm and yeah.
Speaker 1: He was extremely young too.
Speaker 2: All of us were young, you know, we were what, nineteen, twenty.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, go head.
Speaker 2: Go head.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the point I was making about the ages is that the West Coast group was much older than--well not much older but at least five or six years older--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were older yeah.
Speaker 1: --than this group in Chicago.
Speaker 2: We were young.  We were young and you know idealistic, and that was you know another major turning point, cause up to that--when I first started going to the Party, you know around the Black Panther Party, I was leaning more to what they were calling cultural nationalism at the time you know--I had just started wearing--.
Speaker 1: You know, yeah, so you know--it's the deep elaborate fabricating or--.
Story_ID: 7795
Speaker 1: We are talking about the [Black] Panther Party and the Illinois Chapter here and--how many chapters of the Panther Party existed in the country in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember but I know, you know, all through in California they were in Oakland [California] and in San Francisco [California] and there was a chapter in the Southwest.  I wanna say Colorado but I can't really remember now, and then in Peoria [Illinois] there was a chapter, I think there a--a--trying to be a chapter in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], of course us in Chicago [Illinois], I think in Louisville, Kentucky, in New York, in Detroit [Michigan]--I think there was a chapter--'cause I remember going to different places and traveling around.
Speaker 1: Now, some were official and some were not and--.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: They were, you know another--I know in some places they'd have a Panther group--when it was not an official group, and but--
Speaker 2: Right.  You had to be sanctioned by the West Coast Party in order to be an official, you know, party.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so--so, now why did you choose the Panthers?  You said you were involved in--in what--you were--people would call cultural nationalism--?
Speaker 2: Right, I was getting--yeah, I was getting more into that, you know wearing garb and wrapping my hair and when I would go over to the Panther office, they would say, "Sister, why you coming in here--you know with that?  And I remember you know when the [Free] Breakfast for Children program--you know I was saying, you know, "Don't get any pork sausage, blah, blah," and they was like, "Look hungry kids--." They weren't on that tip at all and, and they would say just like, "We gonna eat you know," this wasn't about healthy eating.  It was about feeding kids, "So we gonna eat whatever--" 'cause I think Parker House Sausage was--use--was one of the contributors to the Breakfast for Children program.  We would go and get donations of eggs and stuff and we would cook breakfast.  And, you know I was trying to steer them into let's give them something healthy, and they were like no Parker House Sausage, that's what they gonna eat you know so.  But I got out of that, you know, I, you know that was--you know--I guess to fit in more or--I stopped wearing the garb and started wearing the you know, big natural and combat boots.  I didn't smoke any cigars though.  Now, that's where I drew line.
Speaker 1: Is that, is that a common practice in the Black Panther Party?
Speaker 2: Well, you would see a lot of the women, there's this one sister who I believe is a judge now--who--Cassandra.  Can't think of Cassandra's name but she was a short sister, real pretty, black girl and a real ump--tough, you know, and she'd always be walking around with a cigar in her month.  Now, I don't ever remember seeing it lit, but she would have her cigar in her mouth. But I--that was another pivotal you know point in my development I guess you could say.  The time that I spent in the Black Panther Party, just in terms of learning about community organizing, I got involved with the upper echelon I guess you could say of the Chapter here and really got gung ho in it.  I--I've always been like that--anything I'm--I'm slow to get into stuff, but once I get in and it's like, you know, full speed ahead.  So I would go out with the--with [Deputy Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party] Fred [Hampton] and [Illinois Black Panther Party co-founder] Bobbie Rush and others on the speaking engagements sometime you know I would say, "Y'all never have no woman saying nothing," you know. So then--"Okay you a woman, you talk."  So I would get to do some of the speeches.  I would go out--I know--one of my assignments was to start interacting with the Disciples [gang] on the South Side.  So you know, we would meet--we met with the leadership of the Disciples--.
Speaker 1: Now--now--these are the--the Gangster Disciples--the Black Gangster Disciples of the South Side?
Speaker 2: These--they didn't have that distinguishing name.  This was the--.
Speaker 1: Oh, they--they just called--.
Speaker 2: They were the Disciples.  They were the main group of the Disciples back then.  I meant they probably had--.
Speaker 1: [Disciples] Some of them where called the Devil's Disciples too at one time--.
Speaker 2: They might have been called the Devil's Disciples but it was like the ones on the West Side had a different name, but the South Side was run--I think it was [David] Barksdale at the time--was one of them.  I can't think of his--the leader of the Disciples name, but and then Fred met with you know Jeff Fort and the Blackstone Rangers [gang] and his whole thing was "You guys are the warriors for our community and you need to take your strength and numbers and turn it towards good for the community instead of this nonsense you in."  You know he was ideal--we were all idealistic at the time.
Story_ID: 7796
Speaker 1: What was the reception you received from them?
Speaker 2: We got good reception.  They were like hey, you know--they would listen 'cause it was a mutual--it was a mutual respect thing, 'cause by then [Deputy Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party] Fred [Hampton], I think had been in jail.  You know when you walking around with sawed off shotguns talking about power to the people that's what was happening in California then.  You know we took stands here too, although you couldn't walk around in Chicago [Illinois] with any guns, but, you know so it was a mutual respect with Fred.  He was the consummate, you know--organizer.  He was the consummate organizer.  He understood how to make relationships, you know.  He formed relationships, not just with those groups but with the Young Lords--well, you know he sought out groups of all nationalities based on ideology.  So we had a--we met the--.
Speaker 1: The Young Lords were over in Humboldt Park [neighborhood in Chicago]--.
Speaker 2: The Young Lords, right. The Young Lords--.
Speaker 1: A Spanish group, yeah,
Speaker 2: Jimenez--I think his name was Jose ['Cha Cha' Jimenez]--.
Speaker 1: Puerto Ricans--.
Speaker 2: Right, basically and then the Young Patriots which was a white group that was up in Uptown [neighborhood in Chicago] at the time I think, SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], you know had a office not too far from where we were.  Now some of his thing was intimidation too, 'cause I remember they had a printing press and you know he would tell us, "Go down there and get this stuff printed off," and we would go in there and say, "Chairman Fred want such and such printed up."  "Ma'am, well we got our own thing to do."  We'd say, "Look, you all have to work for the people, you know, you on the West Side.  This comes first."  But he understood about putting, you know, coalitions of people together around a common--you know 'cause regardless of ethnicity.  He was definitely--and the [Black Panther] Party attracted all kinds of people--all kinds of people.  You know a lot of them were you know young idealistic people who really wanted to make a change and bought into you know being a part of that.  Then others were just punks who had never been anything, could never--hadn't gotten any respect in their own you know right and those were the ones who I think were the thugs in the Party.  They were thugs sometimes when they came or like I said they were people who really just wanted to be a part of something so they could look big.  So it attracted--I would imagine any kind of movement attracts all kinds of people.  You know,--but--it was a very fulfilling experience you know that I'm very glad--that I feel fortunate really to have had.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now Bob--Bobby Rush is now a [U.S.] Congressman in--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Illinois.  He--he was the--.
Speaker 2: He was the deputy chairman.  He was right under Fred.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  Now, now how long was it before--now--you--you joined in nineteen--what was it 1969 or--?
Speaker 2: '69 [1969] I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And it was about a year--I guess within that year that Fred Hampton was killed.
Speaker 2: He was killed in '70 [sic, 1969] December--might have been December 4th--well then I must have joined in '68 [1968] right when--after I left Naperville [Illinois].  Can't remember now.  My son was born in '70 [1970] and by then Fred had died.  Or had he?  I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he--he died in--he was dead by '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well then it was either--
Speaker 1: He was killed in December '69 [1969].
Story_ID: 7797
Speaker 1: It was December 4th '69 [1969] and--'cause I was pregnant at the time and my son was born that following August of '70 [1970] yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay, well, where were you when--when [Deputy chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party] Fred Hampton was killed.
Speaker 1: Actually, I was staying at that apartment his mother--wife [sic, girlfriend] Deborah [Johnson] and I were good friends and I had my grandmother's [Alice Marie  Warner] car, and I had given--we had left political education class at the church and one of them, I can't remember one of the guys asked to borrow my grandmother's car, and I was gonna south with--with some other friends of mine in the [Black Panther] Party and they were gonna come back and get me and they didn't come back and get me and I was pissed 'cause you know sometimes they would take my grandmother's car and they'd go off and do whatever they wanted to do with it and I'm without--excuse me that's my car. So that morning I was really pissed cause I had to take the bus to the [Free] Breakfast for Children's program.  We had it at the church on 51st [Street] and around State Street.  I can't think of the name of the church now.  But, I had to take the bus to the Breakfast for Children's program and when I got to the Breakfast for Children's Program--.
Speaker 2: Is that St. Charles Lwanga?
Speaker 1: Nope.  This was going toward--it was across the street from the projects up there by DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Can't think of the name of that church now.  But, I was bugged because I was over in South Shore and I had to take the bus over to the Breakfast for Children program early in the morning so we could get there before the kids got there and when we got there, we got a phone call saying you know, no Breakfast for Children today, closed down,  come to the office, you know--we knew--we were told what had happened to Fred.  In fact, it wasn't come to the office then because they said, stay as far away from the office as you could, because they thought that there were going to be retaliatory things going on so, we were kind of at a loss for a minute about what to do so I think we ultimately ended up staying there and then we you know met at somebody's house and to find out what was going on and to get the update.
Speaker 2: Now you may not have any thoughts about this--I mean--but--in--in retrospect when you look at--at what happened--I mean there--it was revealed later on that there several operatives from Chicago's Red Squad [a select group of police officers and FBI  agents whose sole purpose is to infiltrate alleged corrupt organizations]--not several but at least one or two in the Panther Party.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Speaker 2: The one that did--yeah.
Speaker 1: Always--always.
Speaker 2: Did you--did you have a sense that that was going on while you were in the Party or--or did you--did it just come to light after the--?
Speaker 1: We knew it was going on while I was in the Party because while Fred was locked up during one particular point in time, this guy, his name was Louis Truelock came and he was a skinner--you know I was Malcolm X's bodyguard and every time he talked--he was you know, skinnin' and rap--you know that whole East Coast New York thing--slick.  And people kind of openly accepted him because he had all these stories. "Oh, he must be okay, if he's Malcolm X's bodyguard," you know, and I remember Fred was out for a minute while the trial was going on and we were talking and he told me he said, "Louis Truelock don't run nothin' but his mouth," you know, so don't trust him in other words, and I think we got the word from Fred while he was in prison that Truelock had been in prison with someone that--I--it's kind of fuzzy now but someone who Fred connected with while he was in prison knew Truelock and said, nope, and so he--we didn't see him any more I guess he realized he--it was blown and that--he just disappeared, but there were others who came and went and actually a good friend of mine had a relationship with this guy William O'Neal who was head of security for the Black Panther Party and I was pregnant at the time and for some reason he took a liking to me cause I, I--there--his girlfriend and I were roommates, we shared an apartment together and he kind of took me under his wing and he recruited me to their security staff so I got to spend a lot of time on doing different kinds of things shall we just say, and I remember when Fred died.  He came to the apartment and he put his fist through the wall, you know, he was angry, he--you know, he was upset.  He put his fist through the wall.  We had moved over there by then and you know we--you know what, this was--yeah, he put his fist through the wall and then he left, you know and the attorneys who were working on the case by then started interviewing us about different ones and you know, information that they had about meetings and things that had taken place and questioning us about who was--who all was there--anyway it came around that O'Neal had been the informant in the Party all along, and he had been--wormed his self up into the upper echelon of the Party as well.  So.
Speaker 2: And he was killed mysteriously--?
Speaker 1: On the Eisenhower.
Speaker 2: Yeah, running down the Eisenhower Expressway.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, 'cause he was in the--they--they took him into the Witness Protection Program.  I remember one time, mm-hmm--.
Speaker 2: This is in '83 [1983] I think about '83.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was killed while he--.
Speaker 2: About '82 [1982] '83 [1983], I was doing the Harold Washington [mayoral] campaign, I remember.
Story_ID: 7798
Speaker 1: But I remember my girlfriend and I we were trying to get to the West Side [of Chicago, Illinois] and so you know we young, stupid, we didn't know any better, we decided to hitchhike and we hitched a ride with this guy who we told him where to take us and everything and when we got over there, you know, he said, that he was with the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] or the police department or something and he was a nice guy though and he said, "You women need to stop messing around with these Black Panthers and you need to go back to school blah, blah, blah, blah and watch who you get into cars with," you know--it's like-- you know, so--.
Speaker 2: So you were under surveillance without knowing it.
Speaker 1: Under surveillance--we were under surveillance--we were under surveillance.  I remember going to a good friend of mine who I had known through since we had all grown up in the church together and I went to visit her and her mother--cause we stayed good friends and about a week later her mother called me and she said that people had called her house asking her--or come to her house asking her did she know--did she know me, what did we talk about, when I came was she aware that I was with a subversive organization and all this kind of stuff.  They did the same thing to my grandmother [Alice Marie Warner].  That's how I knew my grandmother really had my back even though she didn't approve.  They called my grandmother--I had been arrested--busted on I think somewhere in K-Town [Korean neighborhood in Chicago] and I was pregnant at the time and I had these iron tablets.  These iron pills--well so of course they said, "Aw, she's got drugs."  So they took me to jail and they called my grandmother and told her that I had been arrested for prostitution, you know, and she didn't cuss but she told them, "I don't know who you are or what you're doing, but I know that my granddaughter was out--was not out there prostituting.  Y'all don't call here anymore," and hung up the phone.  And they kept me in jail overnight, you know, it was just harassment and they left me--let me out, but we were--you know that let me know that they were monitoring all of our movements, you know, all of our movements.  And I think at that time I don't think we took it as serious--some of us didn't take it as seriously.  It was exciting and it was you know that sense of danger and it was also that sense of--of justice again.  We were doing something for our people, but I think we underestimated how dangerous we were to the established order, you know?
Speaker 2: Did you have a sense that you were risking your life when you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --participated in the breakfast program and everything?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  'Cause sometimes the [Free] Breakfast for Children program would get raided and then  the office was raided a couple of times and--we had--we lost you know, a couple of people, not necessarily in the office raids, but through other things and you know sometimes it was--they were out doing things they didn't have no business doing and they got caught and they shot and they were killed.  Other times we thought it was more politically move--you know motivated, but it was always that sense.  It was always that sense.  I think after  [Deputy Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party] Fred [Hampton] died, I started questioning more what was going on in our particular branch of the [Black Panther] Party.  I know I was sent to Oakland [California] and San Francisco [California] for a while, you know this was before Fred had died.  Fred was in prison then and, you know San Francisco was very different and then when I went to Oakland we were supposed to be going out to sell papers and I remember I'm standing on the street in Oakland and the two chicks I was with they went into the dress shop.  You know, it's like, "Excuse me, hello, revolutionaries, you don't belong in there, you know," so I was like, "Okay," this is, you know--I, I--it demystified the whole thing for me, you know.  It's like, "Okay, they are not gods," you know and I saw that what we were doing in Chicago was really groundbreaking in terms of the Breakfast for Children Program, the Free Health Clinic, we were really serving people and that was you know a high for me being able to really be of service and the--the legal clinic--I was a people's advocate, which means you know, somebody from the community would come in and we would talk about their problems with them--we didn't try to solve the problems, but then we would go out and we would go to law--we had attorneys and different kinds of people who had expertise who would volunteer to come out on Thursday nights and you know, counsel these people and, and provide free services for them in terms of you know their legal issues and things.
Story_ID: 7799
Speaker 1: That when Jeffrey Haas (ph.) and them was--?
Speaker 2: Jeffrey Haas was one of them
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)--People's Law?
Speaker 2: The People's Law Office.  They would come down--Howard Alt, who was a filmmaker and ultimately did, you know that--that Black Panther Party story.  Yeah, so you know we got a chance to interact with all these people and--but after Fred [Hampton] died, like I said even when Fred was in prison, there was that faction of the Party that was to me very misogynistic and you know, male-dominated.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever meet Eldridge Cleaver [Black Panther Party founding member]?
Speaker 2: Never met Eldridge Cleaver, 'cause he was in jail by the time I went to California.
Speaker 1: David Hilliard?
Speaker 2: I met David Hilliard and I met the one that's now a preacher--(pauses) he was--he ran the Party after Cleaver was gone.
Speaker 1: Bobby Seale?
Speaker 2: Bobby Seale.  Yeah, Bobby Seale and his wife.  I stayed at their house, but it was very male dominated.  Some of them, and I remember when we--you know there was this thing that if a brother sold so many Panther newspapers ['The Black Panther'] a woman was obligated to have sex with him.  You know, it's like, "I don't think so!"  You know, "I won't be doing that."  That either if they were in good service to the Party then certain things had to be done for them whether it was sex or whether it was you know, you had to be subservient to them and I wasn't having that.  I wasn't--I wasn't going for that at all, you know?  And I remember when Fred came out yet one more time on bail, he you know went off--we had a big meeting and he's like, "Don't know woman have to do nothing she don't want to do.  You lazy ass punks, you couldn't get no pussy on your own so you gonna try to force somebody to have sex with you?"  Oh, he was like very, you know, "This is not gonna happen here."  So he came home, cleaned it all up.  You know, he was a--he was a good--you know I learned a lot about organization from him--.
Speaker 1: He really sounds like a fascinating person, you know to be that young and to be that deep at that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--he was.
Speaker 1: Because the whole of the--the black movement in terms of culture seemed to be in this crisis about what the relationship is between men and women and it didn't seem to be any better than the dominant society or, or in some cases worse.
Speaker 2: Worse and more--.
Speaker 1: The Nation of Islam in California at some level and then with the Panther Party, especially from what I read and heard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, but he--Fred [Hampton] again, he wasn't tolerating any kind of you know abuse, period inside of the Party.  You know he was very clear about that and anybody who you know, dealt with that like that was dealt with by Fred, you know and [Bobby] Rush and the others.
Speaker 1: You know in terms of--yeah--yeah, [Amiri] Baraka with the Congress of the African People 'cause I don't know what  would have done but I know that what Baraka did with that?  Kind of various stratifying--the women subservient you know?
Speaker 2: And then you know after Fred died--it--you know--it tried to stay together for a while--by then I was living um-hmm on the West Side.  We had our own--my own apartment by then and it started changing, you know, people's spirits were crushed somewhat.  You know, like I said we tried to hold it together but at that point I got kind of dis--disenfr--disengaged with the whole West Coast thing.  Cause I felt like you don't have the right in California to come here and tell us nothing.  Because you are in California doin' like you need to do it and we are in Chicago doin' it like we need to do it.  So.
Speaker 1: And so, is it a kind of vacuum of leadership here too?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, yeah, yeah, it was pretty much.
Speaker 1: So--so how long were you still--did you remain in the Party?
Speaker 2: Until about maybe throughout the end of 1970, early '70 [1970] maybe--half of the year of '71 [1971].  By then it was pretty much null and void for me.  You know I--I just stopped being involved.
Speaker 1: Are they still a viable organization?
Speaker 2: No, pretty much not.
Story_ID: 7800
Speaker 1: So in 1971 you--basically the [Black Panther] Party was over basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for me anyway, yeah.  I was on my way to other things.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now what did you do next?  What--what were you attracted to?
Speaker 2: What did I do?  I think I was kind of aimless for a while, you know, maybe in a kind of post partum depression because the cause was no longer a part of my life and I reconnected with my family more during that time.  Moved back to the South Side [of Chicago, Illinois].  My grandmother [Alice Marie Warner] died, and I moved into her building, into her apartment.  She had left it to me and, and my sister, but she had made me the executor of her estate.  So, that was a surprise you know, and not my sister, you know.  I would have thought she would have done my sister, but anyway I moved back and just reconnected like I said with my sister and the friends that I had known during high school [Hyde Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] and it was funny cause I ran into an old friend who said, "Oh I thought you know--we heard you had got killed on the West Side," you know so I was like, ah these people don't even know I existed.  You know, they had lost--I had just completely lost touch with the life that I had had before so for about two, three years that's what I did.  I got a job and you know started just hooking back up you know with people who I had known and hadn't seen in a while.  Then I started writing a little bit you know, poems and short stories, got into the--started looking more into the health food---became a vegetarian and got back into wearing garb and head wraps and all that stuff but not in the same way that I had you know had done before and--.
Speaker 1: Now, this is like the black cultural revolution period I guess in a way from '68 [1968] through I guess through the early '70s [1970s] and people were actually--a lot of institutions and organizations were being formed in Chicago--.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. Afro-Arts Theater was kickin'.
Speaker 1: Right.  I was going to ask you about that.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that now--now Afro-Arts Theater.  That was like Phil Cohran and--?
Speaker 2: That was Phil Cohran and Oscar Brown [Jr.] was there you know.  I went through there a few times.  I was still I think--I think I was out in Harvey [Illinois] then.  Cause I was teaching nursery school or doing something out in Harvey.  So I didn't go there as much, but that's where I met Darlene Blackburn--I'm trying to remember how I got back interested in dance or movement.  I've had--I'd seen Darlene Blackburn, I think at Afro-Arts Theater and I was like, wow! You know it's just having drums and that just really resonated with me, but I didn't perceive myself as being a dancer or anything like that so, I found Jewel McLauren (ph.).  Somebody told me that Jewel McLauren was teaching dance classes in her basement at her house.  So I started going there and taking classes and then I met Miss Ellis--came across--met Alyo actually.  Somebody told me about--.
Speaker 1: It was Alyo Tolbert?
Speaker 2: Alyo Tolbert [Muntu Dance Theatre's founder and first artistic director] who was teaching classes at the Washington Park Field House on 55th Street and I lived right at 51st [Street] so I decided to go up there and on Sundays I would go and sit and just you know it'd be twenty, thirty, forty, fifty people there and all kinds of community drummers and it was just--well, I was fascinated and I wanted to get involved but I didn't feel like--you know I was intimidated basically.  So, I took--started taking Jewel McLauren's class and them I found out that Darlene was teaching dance classes over at South Side Community Art Center--Darlene Blackburn.  So I went over there and she gave a really good--she welcomed me into her classes and after a while she invited me to dance with her troupe and I did that for a while and then I hooked back with Alyo and started classes over at Muntu [Dance Theatre of Chicago] as well.  It wasn't Muntu then it was UHCC and he invited me--.
Speaker 1: UACC?
Speaker 2: UH--Unifying Humanity Through Cultural Creativity--big name.  And Alyo said, "Why don't you come on and dance with us?  You don't even have to audition."  So I said, "Okay," and I've been there ever since at Muntu.
Story_ID: 7801
Speaker 1: Tell us about Alyo Tolbert.  I mean who was he and--he's the founder of Muntu [Dance Theatre of Chicago] right?
Speaker 2: He actually wasn't the founder.  The group had come together really with Babba Daniel (ph.) on 75th Street at the Pyramid--I think was the name of his thing. He was a Hebrew Israelite who use to have education classes and cultural classes over there and the--the Atiba, Babu Atiba and several others use to study with Babba Daniel and that's where UHCC [Unifying Humanity Through Cultural Creativity] was born, and they met Alyo because he at that time was working with Darlene Blackburn, but he would come over and start teaching the--the dance classes and thru conversations with Alyo they said okay, let's form a dance company, and they called it UHC--continued to call it UHCC, and I guess in '70 [1970]--that was in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Now they built the dance company around the drummers--'cause it--?
Speaker 2: Well the drummers--.
Speaker 1: I know a lot of them were associated with--Sun Drummers [African American drum society,] were associated with Babba Daniel too.  A lot of them were.
Speaker 2: Right, Sun Drummer and--shoot, his name is outta my head oh, that's terrible, who was the head drummer for Sun Drummer.
Speaker 1: Atu.
Speaker 2: 'Atu' Harold Murray.  I actually met Atu because he was the drummer for Jewel McLauren and I remember in the winter time he would be barefoot or have on sandals.  I would take--drive him sometimes--drop him off at the L [elevated train] or something and it'd be snow, 'cause I would see he had on the sandals in class but then when we got ready to go outside I said, "You not gonna put on your shoes?  What's up, it's snow on the ground, it's cold?"  And he said, "Oh, no, no, no--."  I never did understand what that was, but anyway that's how I got kind of introduced to you know Sun Drummer and Alyo and all those guys, and the Sun Drummer--it was always the Sun Drummer as part of--that was the drum core for UHCC or for Muntu and I don't wanna mis-talk in terms of how--cause they still see themselves as Sun Drummer but it is--we no longer say Sun Drummer as part of Muntu in acknowledging the name--we just say its Muntu Dance Theatre, you know, but they are still Sun Drummer.
Speaker 1: They were--these brothers started like making their own drums.
Speaker 2: Making their own drums.
Speaker 1: These were--I mean this is something that hadn't occurred since I guess since we came over from Africa, but at least in North America nobody--.
Speaker 2: Musa. (ph.)
Speaker 1: --made a drum.
Speaker 2: Musa made these log drums and--
Speaker 1: Musa Mosely (ph.).
Speaker 2: And mm-hmm
Speaker 1: Olu (ph.).
Speaker 2: Olu (ph.)--.
Speaker 1: And there may be some more I just can't think of them, but--.
Speaker 2: Well Atiba [Joli] was there Ellie Onai (ph.)--lots of guys you know.
Speaker 1: You know Musa tells a story that he went to the museum and was looking at the drums in the Field Museum--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And he said and he was reading that they were made by Africans and he thought well, I'm an African, I should--.
Speaker 2: I can make it.  Right.
Speaker 1: Right, so he starts making drums from scratch with no training, and starts doing it.
Speaker 2: And I guess in what--what was it '73 [1973] or '74 [1974] the name got changed to Muntu Dance Theatre and that was primarily Alyo's influence because he saw the impact that UHCC was having on people.  I mean there will always be you know we would--take twenty minutes for all the lines of people to go across the floor and, listen to Babba Daniel at the political education class or the cultural education classes.  So people were looking for something.  I think at this point in '72 [1972] '73 [1973] it was another emergence of the--of black cultural you know movement, it was--it was really gaining and people were looking for different ways to express their African heritage, you know that was the main impetus for the forerunner of Muntu.  It wasn't so much about being professional artists as it was expressing African culture, you know so, people dressed a certain way, they ate a certain way, so of course, the dance and music was representative of that and Alyo said that, this needs to be institutionalized.  We need to look at having a way that the culture--the traditional cultural heritage of African Americans can continue, because, you know, back then we were you know, looking at for me too, one of the reasons why I resonated so much toward it was coming out my Black Panther Party days and even you know my rebellious time before--how do we change things?  How do we impact people so that they take control and oh, okay, art and culture.  You know--art and culture, and I was beginning to realize um-hmm the power of music and the power of dance when black children and black people had an opportunity to see what was indigenous to us, you know, culturally as a people with the arts.  It hooked me, you know it appealed to my sensitivities immediately, you know in terms of, okay, this is black, I wanna to be a part of this.
Story_ID: 7802
Speaker 1: Much has been--I guess discussed in terms of black political challenges to the system and that sort of thing but this is a cultural kind of a change and--and it's not that the political wasn't--wasn't involved too but I mean what--what wasn't around and people weren't still doing it but this cultural change and I think that--I can't think of any other time in history where black people took upon--took this challenge up to change culture, to change our culture from the self-deprecating--I don't want to be black--to I am black and this is what I do, which is different from popular culture.
Speaker 2: One thing about you know that I--I became--I began to realize too in terms of the intersect between you know arts and culture and politics is that this is a multi-leveled struggle that we are involved in here and all of these different elements are necessary, because the one thing that art and culture does is that it can be introduced--you know the concept of self-determination and self-love can be introduced in a non-threatening and non-confrontational way.  Because you are not saying, you know, "Go out there and do this," you're saying, "Love yourself."  Who can--who can argue with that?  You know what I mean, so it wasn't about be against this.  It was about "be for yourself" and be for your self by seeing you know where--when we would go into school sometimes the kids would be snickering "Ha, ha, you know, look at that--they look like jungle boogies," and all that stuff, but the minute those drums start, and the dancers--I mean the kids--the teachers--they would be--it was so positive that they had to give it up.  They had to get into it.  I never had an experience where we were rejected by audiences that we were performing for.  You either had to be indifferent or you had to go--you--you either had to violently be opposed to it or you had to go with it and for the most part my experiences was that people went with it and it was--it was transforming for them and I realized that it was transforming for me because I didn't know anything about black people.  You know I--you know not in terms of the history and culture and Africa 'cause I--I thought back to even in high school but definitely in grammar school.  You know a half a page in a history book, Harriett Tubman, George Washington Carver, you know that was what I knew.  I didn't know anything in depth and so dance and music was a way for me to even start learning more about who we were you know and I heard--started hearing the term race memory and it made sense to me cause I would see--I began to just look and observe how black people walked down the street, you know not dancers and musicians, just black people walking down the street and the rhythm they had with whatever--they're going on.  Sometime I would, you know, just watch the guys hanging on the corner and then just to me, it seemed to be an insynctness you know with--you know time and space around them and I really got intrigued by the whole notion of arts and culture being integral to any kind of social political movement because that's how you begin to seek people--have people to grasp their own possibilities you know and I've had good mentors, um-hmm who helped me to you know--to find my own thinking about that--Abena Joan Brown and Ulysses Duke Jenkins and others, you know Haki Madhubuti who I would listen to and hear and learn from.
Speaker 1: Okay, so as you're--as you're growing in this cultural awareness and getting involved in dance and--I mean wha--how--how do you earn a living?
Speaker 2: Well, now I earn a--well--.
Speaker 1: I mean you didn't at that point.
Speaker 2: Now I work full-time for Muntu [Dance Theatre of Chicago], but prior to that temporary jobs.  You know 'cause that--you know thinking back to stuff I already said, I always was kind of you know, free spirited in a sense, so I never wanted to work a full-time job, you know I wanted to be able to have flexibility.  So I got hip to temp [temporary] agencies, you know I could type real good and computers wasn't the thing then--you know I could type like 120 words per minute, so I had never any problem getting a job.  So, I would go and sign on for a temp agency and work and when I didn't want--when I needed a day off cause Muntu was having a showing, then I just would say, I don't need an assignment this day or you know, so I kind of was able to set my own schedule and that's how I worked, and a couple of my temp jobs like I went on a temp job to Blue Cross Blue Shield and they asked me to stay 'cause I process you know, three times as many claims in a day as everybody else--'cause of the speed I had and same thing at Shore Bank, you know, went to South Shore Bank and they asked me to stay so I said--you know those were the, really the only two full-time jobs that I had you know during that period and it was because they were amenable to you know me adapting my schedule when I needed to.
Story_ID: 7803
Speaker 1: Tell us about Muntu's [Dance Theatre of Chicago] growth--I guess cause Alyo [Tolbert, Muntu Dance Theatre's founder and first artistic director]--I remember when--in the mid '70s [1970s] it was sort of a small group but it was intense and they doing , you know--but it began to kind of grow in the late '70s.
Speaker 2: Alyo was a visionary and, I likened him in a way--his persona reminded me of Fred Hampton's [Black Panther Party leader] persona in a different way, but the same kind of strength and magnitude.  He again was another person who knew how to motivate people, who knew how to get people to--to give up the energy for him in a way.  People--anybody who met Alyo immediately loved him, cause you knew that he saw the good things in you.  He encouraged you to do the best that you could do and I know it was his vision primarily that propelled Muntu to begin looking at institutional status.  You know, in '76 [1976] we did the company, I wasn't with them then, I didn't come until '77 [1977] but they did their first full concert the first annual fall concert was done at Francis Parker High School on the North Side [of Chicago, Illinois] and Alyo--we didn't get grants or anything like that--he would go to people, you know different business people or people in his family.  He would borrow money, you know, and say, you know, "I'll pay you back after the show," and some kind of way he would you know, find a way to pay people back but he was a--he was a magnetic person, you know, and just a blessed spirit.  Peaceful spirit and people radiated to him, you know.  So when he got involved on that level that's when the company really began to perceive itself as yes--holding to that cultural heritage root, but envisioning themselves now as a professional dance company, professional dancers and musicians, you know so it went more in that direction, under his guidance and leadership, and Babu Atiba and--the musical director at the time--shoot, with the long dreads, oh, this is terrible.  Moshe. (ph.)
Speaker 1: Moshe Mallen (ph.).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Moshe Mallen and all of us.  I as the--we had this thing called you know the council that was a different one from the company we'd get elected to and the whole point--purpose of the council was to you know the--to help set policy and stuff for the--for the company.
Speaker 1: Now here we have like a new kind of governance for a dance company.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is you know, as we look back--I mean t the Institute for Positive Education had a council, you know, and these are--so--.
Speaker 2: And Babba Daniel (ph.) was our advisor and I think the whole idea for a council came from him.  I could be wrong about that, but that's kind of my memory of it, and different ones from the company would get elected and you'd serve for a year, you know and I remember when it was--we were on the council.  It was myself and Atiba, Alyo, Minyamin (ph.) and some--a couple of others, you know and Alyo was saying, you know, "We need to have our own building."  You know, "We need to have the artists on full time.  We need to be able to pay salaries," you know, and that kind of thing.  As early as you know like 1978, 1979 that was his vision.  That's where his mind was going to and he started looking around for gigs for us out of town 'cause we had really taken off in the Chicagoland area.  We were doing block parties, and funerals and weddings and naming ceremonies and Gwendolyn Brooks [poet laureate of Illinois] use to refer to us and it was such an honor as the community professionals in residence, you know because we would--that's how the company was building up it's loyal following by doing all of these grass roots neighborhood events and it was really an honor--I didn't realize it as much then but what--what a statement that was making that people thought it was appropriate to have African dancing and drumming to commemorate an important event in their life, you know, so it was a block club, yeah, but we--I--you know it was an honor to me that people wanted us to come and be a part of their celebrations in that way, and Alyo said, "Hey, this can go on the road, you know."  So we started contacting and we--you know different people we knew in Detroit [Michigan] and St. Louis [Missouri] and different places and getting booked and the word started spreading and then next thing you know we were going to New York to the Brooklyn Academy of Music and down to Louisville [Kentucky] and just different other places you know, doing stuff.
Story_ID: 7804
Speaker 1: It [Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago] was really starting to get big and I remember in the '79 [1979] there was this concert.  I'll never forget it--it was at Corliss High School [Chicago, Illinois]--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Went, went, went to all the concerts always packed but on this occasion--you started off--I think you all started off with an ancient Egyptian suite.
Speaker 2: I was pregnant that year--I think.  Was that--that was '78 [1978]--.
Speaker 1: '78 or '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: It was '78. We did 'Natural Mystic'.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alyo [Tolbert] had the dreadlocks--the different color dreadlocks on and--that was--you know--.
Speaker 2: We had--
Speaker 1: Spanned the whole Pan African--yeah the--
Speaker 2: Yeah--.
Speaker 1: "Do you remember the days of slavery?"
Speaker 2: Right, and I played this pregnant woman who they had to--you know 'cause I was like I wanna be in the show.  He said, "You're pregnant," and I said, "Find me a part."  So he created this part for me, where I played a pregnant woman that you know--gotten led off the stage or something.  I remember going out in the lobby and people said, "Oh, you're pregnant for real?  We thought that was just part of the show."  But, yeah, that was a wonderful concert, 'Natural Mystic'.  I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: So many in the--the musicians, the--the drummers jumped off the stage went down in the pit and played reggae--,
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then came right back up on their drums.  It was a--
Speaker 2: Multi-talented.
Speaker 1: --it was a tour de force--'cause I mean it just speaks to the type of talent--and--and still is in the Muntu Dance Theatre and now the name--what does Muntu mean?
Speaker 2: Loosely translated it means the essences--essence of humanity. This is my understanding of it and it comes from the Bantu dialect.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know why that name was chosen, cause that was before I got there--I have to ask [Babu] Atiba about that.
Story_ID: 7805
Speaker 1: Actually [Babu] Atiba and I are now working on compiling an archival history of Muntu [Dance Theatre of Chicago].  We've gotten some interest from a couple of people about putting together this story in a formalized way.  So we are looking and finding all of the old video tapes and program books and going back and finding old photos and starting to compile stuff--'cause you know, depending on who you talk to--everybody's got a different understanding.  I know Atiba a couple of times when I've done talks, he said, "No, Joan, that wasn't right.  Such and such came first," and then you know so we kind of disagree a little bit on stuff but I, I acknowledge that whatever he says is probably right cause I know my memory is horrible, but we are just now starting to really do that in a serious way--to tell the story about Muntu because I guess the next shift was from--was the whole understanding of what we meant by institutionalization and I credit Abena Joan Brown with that, because after Alyo [Tolbert] died--Alyo went to Africa--.
Speaker 2: You know, tell us about that too--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I was--
Speaker 2: Now he went to Africa--
Speaker 1: He went to Africa--
Speaker 2: In '77 [1977]--was that--was it after that?
Speaker 1: He went in '77 but he went again in like maybe '80 [1980] somewhere around up in there, and he went to Senegal and he met Abdula Kamera (ph.) and he came back and he was telling us about Abdula Kameron and he said, we're gonna bring Kameron here to do this ballet, you know for Muntu, the first full length African American--African Ballet, (unclear) and we were in--this was in--he died in '83 [1983]--this was maybe '81 [1981], '82 [1982]. We were in Detroit [Michigan], we were performing in Detroit and he called a meeting of certain ones of us--we were at Quaba Nashabu's (ph.) house.  Quaba Nashabu is our photographer.  We were sitting around his mother's dining room table and he said ok.  He told me you gonna be administrative director.  You gonna be assistant artistic director and Moshe [Mallen] you gonna be musical director, and I'm not--and I was like, "'Excuse me, no, I'm not doing it.  I don't wanna--I'm here to dance that's it," and he said "Either you do it or you get out the company."  I said, "Okay.  I'll do it until you find somebody else."  You know. (Laughs) So, that's how the kind of new leadership thing--but the man was a visionary because right after that, what we didn't know was that Alyo knew he had cancer. So, in his mind--this is my, you know, interpretation of it, he was putting in place kind of like a structure that he thought would move things forward.  He was preparing in a way, and I remember when we were doing a December concert and Kameron came and he introduced me to Kameron, and he said this is gonna be the next artistic director of Muntu. I looked at him, I said, "How you doin' papa Kameron?"  I looked at Alyo, I said, you know, 'cause he use to always tease me about, "I'm, I'm gonna leave here, y'all getting on my nerves, you running me raggedy--you--you drivin' me crazy," and I'd say, "Yeah, okay, right, he's nice and everything, but you ain't goin' nowhere," and I didn't realize really what he was saying to me, and Kameron had come to do Wolobua (ph.) and I remember working on that piece and then Alyo got sick, you know, we thought--you know he told me it was pneumonia, and I didn't realize at the time what it was and I guess I was in a state of denial too along with a lot of the other company members and I remember, we had a show--at--he had moved out--we were living in the same building then, he lived on the third floor and I lived on the first floor, and he got so sick that he moved to his mother's house so that she--they could take care of him more full time, and then he went into the hospital and I remember a grant came due while he was in the hospital and I said we gotta do this grant--'cause I think I was into--it's gotta be business as usual, you know.  So, I didn't have a car then, I took a cab all the way to Cook County [Illinois] Hospital to tell him, "Okay, we gotta write this grant."  He said, "I can't do it."  I said, "Well you got to do it, you know.  How we gonna keep the company going?  You ain't gonna be sick forever, then we won't have no money, then whatcha' gonna do?"  You know, just not wanting to accept it, and got somebody to help me write it and you know send it in--I don't even remember what the thing was but I know we were not ready to accept that he was not going to be a part of Muntu or a part of our lives, 'cause it was a family, you know. It was a family, it really was.  We had raised our--had our kids together--raised our kids and then we were on stage at the public--what's now the Cultural Center at 78 East Washington [Street] performing and we had all agreed that after the concert we were going to go over to Cook County and see him, and I remember it was about--Nululoo (ph.)--one of the dancers--and you know Nululoo with the dreads.  He was doing a piece and there was point in the performance when the energy just went (sound) schwoo---I mean it was magical.  Everybody was hollering and screaming and crying and just dancing their hearts out and, you know I get a little emotional now when I think about it--hold on for a second, but anyway, we got through, we went to the hospital and we walked in and I asked--we were you know together, we asked for Alyo Tolbert--we wanted a visitor's pass and a lady said, hold on a minute, and she was going through and she said, what's the name.  We said, "Alyo Tolbert," and at that point I said, bump this.  I knew where his room was, so I started running through the hospital to his room and when I got to the room, you know other people you know came with me, 'cause the lady--there was not visitor's pass 'cause he had died.  We didn't know that, and, I guess this is like one thirty, two o'clock in the afternoon.  We had went there after the performance and when we got to the room where he was--he had died, and I think his mother was there and she told us that he had died around noon, right at the point that you know where we felt that energy.  So I really fell like we felt his spirit release then, you know, but, he was a visionary.  He as a visionary.  He was the moving force that really propelled--and he also had one of the lead parts in Wolobua (ph.), so it was like oh, oh, now we gotta replace him and I remember the outpouring of love and support from the community, but then there was also this underlying thing about what's gonna happen to Muntu now that Alyo was gone?  Speculation--.
Speaker 2: I remember the funeral was packed.  You couldn't get any more people in, and--.
Speaker 1: And I was so disappointed because the church wouldn't let us dance in the church, but they did let us play the drums, you know, but that was you know, everybody was like, "What's gonna happen?  What's gonna happen?  How are they gonna continue?" 'cause he was the, he was the public person.  It was funny cause he really was a shy kind of person--did not like to be out front, but he you know, he had that charisma, that personality and that vision.  But, the company rallied, you know we had really good strong people in the community who were stepping up to the plate and helping us.  I think we had gotten a grant from the Department of Cultural Affairs, so we said, "We gonna do this concert," and, Kameron, Abdula Kameron said, "I'll do Alyo's parts, you know."  'Cause he was just supposed to be here to set this piece and then go on back home.
Story_ID: 7806
Speaker 1: How were those earlier days for you to, you know to have this tremendous cultural organization [Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago] with all this huge following and all of a sudden it's in your lap?  The vision, the visionary and the person [Alyo Tolbert] that got it to that point is now dead.
Speaker 2: Well I didn't see it as really being all in my lap first of all because the council that I mentioned before we still had the council and the council was the leadership body that you know decided to keep things going.  And being the administrative director I took it upon myself to start investigating okay--we would talk, we would have meetings you know into the night about, "What do we need to do now to make sure that the company goes forward?" you know.  We had established little you know, Alyo--we had established a little payroll system where everybody, every time we did a show, let's say ten people did the show.  If we got paid we would divide it by eleven so the company itself would be the eleventh person.  So we began to put away a little money from every performance so that we could start building up a bank account at Shore Bank, South Shore Bank then.  Then we started applying for you know mostly city [of Chicago] grants and sometimes Alyo would get, he would never say where he would get some of his borrowings from.  You know I'm thinking it was mostly his family.  But he would get, sometimes get individual grants to do things and all of this was going in to helping us put on the concerts and doing whatever, do whatever little marketing we could.  And so we got to the point where he said, "Okay we're going to establish a payroll.  Everybody is going to get thirty-five dollars a week," you know or--and it was like thirty-five dollars a week?  But we weren't getting paid for the shows anymore.  You were just going to--"No matter what you do, you're going to get thirty-five dollars a week just as a base."  And so it was like, "Okay."  But people understood that this was about starting to put away money to build for the future.  So after he died you know [Babu] Atiba and I, and others, we were sitting around, we were talking about what do we need to do to make this go forward?  So I said well one, we need to get a board of directors 'cause we had a board of directors but it had kind of fizzled out you know wasn't really functioning.  And we need to figure out how we can get grants.  And so being the administrative director I guess you know I saw that as being what I was supposed to be doing.  So I remember going to Abena [Joan Brown] and telling her to review this little proposal I had written.  And, and the proposal was to somebody, I think it was MacArthur Foundation to get money to hire an executive director and find the executive director.  She said, "Why are you looking for an Executive Director?"  I said, "Because Muntu needs an Executive Director."  She said, "You do it."  I said, "Oh no, not me.  I'm not doing it."  You know so resisting and she says, "No you need to do it because you know--."  I said, told her the same thing I told Alyo, "Okay well I'll do it 'til I find somebody."  And I asked her and Leana [Flowers] to help us put together a board.
Story_ID: 7807
Speaker 1: So Leana hosted--.
Speaker 2: Leana--?
Speaker 1: Leana Flowers who at that time was personnel director at South Shore Bank [Chicago, Illinois] and my boss.  She and Abena [Joan Brown] agreed to help us build a board of directors.  So she hosted a reception for us at the bank and people came and we you know talked about the vision and we recruited people to join the board.  So you know we kind of started building and I wrote a grant to MacArthur Foundation and we got five thousand dollars.  That was the first you know little foundation grant that we had gotten.  So pretty much that was the impetus and we just started pursuing grants and then I started you know looking at you know the booking.  I was handling the booking and trying to find gigs and you know we had this little system where everybody would vote on a contract.  Should we take it, yes or no?  We figured how much money you know.  So that was kind of how we functioned really collaboratively and collectively.  There were tensions you know of course sometimes 'cause being the, the administrative director I might want to go more in a business way and other people might say well no let's put the money over here into new costumes or whatever.  But it was--I never had the sense that it was something that I had to do by myself.  We always saw it as a collective whole because I understood real--coming from the company first into the administration that the role of the administration or the management was to support the artistic vision, you know.  But I didn't, the company didn't exist just to give me a job or to give the staff a job, it was the other way around.  It was our role and our duty and our responsibility to make sure that the company had the resources it needed you know to continue to grow.  And that's how we you know continue to look at it today.  My--when we got the new board you know we started then talking about well this is not going to go anywhere until we get full time staff, you know.  And we started fundraising and got a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to, which allowed me to quit my job at Shore Bank and become--well actually I quit my, I went part-time in '86 [1986] and I said, "I'm just going to do this."  I didn't know if we were getting a grant or not but I knew that I had to stop working at the bank if I was going to be able to devote time to helping Muntu [Dance Theatre of Chicago] grow.  So I you know went to Leana said I'm, I'm going to go part time.  She agreed to let me do that.  And I set up an office in my home, you know got a typewriter, got a separate phone system, set up the office and started you know working half a day for Muntu.  And then at the end of '86 [1986] you know I was working full time out of my house.  And we had approached Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois] about setting up our cultural residency there through Carol Adams.  Had--we had approached Carol and she liked the idea.  In fact she, we had talked to her about helping us find space and she said what about Kennedy-King?  Cause she was on staff there at the time.  And she went to Dr. Harold Pates who was the president and he thought it was a wonderful idea and we moved in there in '87 [1987].  And that was the year, in '86 [1986] Cameron (ph.) said I got to go back to Africa cause he had been with us since '83 [1983], he hadn't been back.  And he said, "I need to go home."  So, and then he wanted to move on and do some other things.  So we said well you can't go until we find another artistic director and so we thought about Imaniay Payne (ph.) who had had a long relationship with the company, was, had been good friends with Alyo [Tolbert] and who was really a kindred spirit and I knew shared the same artistic vision that we did.  And she came and agreed to be the artistic director.
Speaker 2: Now Imaniay was she, she was in, on the East Coast, right?
Speaker 1: Right, she was in New York [New York] dancing with International African American Ballet which was like one of the forerunner black dance companies--unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Just like Melvin (Deal's?) group?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Melvin was in D.C.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: She used to dance with Melvin as well.  Yeah, Melvin Deal.  Originally she was from Baltimore [Maryland] and then went to [Washington] D.C. and then went to New York and started dancing there.  So you know that was kind of--Kennedy-King was really where the company could take root cause up to that point we had been vagabonds, you know.  We would go into a place, we would build it up, people would come, whoever the landlord was and say oh, this is a gold mine.  Now you got to pay X, Y, Z dollars so of course we had to move on.  You know what gentrification is like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then we were at different park districts, but every time you know depending on how tolerant they were of us taking over the place you know sooner or later we would wear out our welcome and they would go, you know we'd have to move on cause they would want to do other things with the space.  That's why we understood you got to have your place.
Speaker 2: Yeah this is a community success story in a sense that--.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you got Aubana you know, you got South Shore Bank involved--.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know and got Milton Davis--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and Harold over--and Carol Adams's help and you know people--.
Speaker 1: Lot of people were involved in that whole stabilization effort.  You know Carol, Dr. Pates.  And you know that's why you know as, as we look back sometimes we always talk about you know this was meant to be, you know cause even at its lowest points there always seemed to be something that would happen that would you know reassure us to keep, keep going.  So now we're getting ready to build our own performing arts center at 47th [Street] and Greenwood [Avenue].

Speaker 1: Now how many people are on staff now [at Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago]?
Speaker 2: We have ten full-time artists and five full-time staff.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--.
Speaker 2: And about eight part time artists.  Actually we have nine full time artists cause one just left.  She got married and moved down south back to Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And throughout all of this you've continued to dance as well, right?
Speaker 2: I, I danced with the company up until about 1990 and then I, I just couldn't continue to do it, you know to do that, you know be at the office all day you know run home, throw food at the kids you know and then run to rehearsal cause at that point we were you know, and still are, we were rehearsing in the evening and it started to be too much.  So I had to painfully make the decision that I need to stop dancing and devote one hundred percent of my time to management.  So that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've been basically a manager since 1990?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually I've been managing the company since Alyo [Tolbert] died but I continued to dance.  But I, I went for it you know just strictly into the management part, I would say '91 [1991].  Where, when I stopped--'90 [1990] when I stopped dancing.  I think that was the last concert I did.
Speaker 1: Now the scope of what you do though is not just Chicago [Illinois] but I mean you're involved in a lot of different--by, by being director of Muntu Dance Theatre, I mean it, you're drawn into a lot of other formations and stuff.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You mentioned African American Arts Alliance is one.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: I think you're on the board of ETA [Creative Arts Foundation, Inc.].  Or you were on (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No I'm not on the board but we do a lot of collaborations with ETA.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Some NEA stuff, National Endowment for the Arts.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, done a lot of panels.  A lot of those things I started seeking out just so I could see what other people were doing.  You know whenever there was a contact, you know Association of American Cultures, got involved with that and started finding out what was going on, on a national scope.  But--and then started getting asked because as people heard about Muntu you know either myself or Imaniay Payne, the artistic director, we would be asked to come and represent African dance or talk about black experiences you know in, in managing arts organizations and things like that.  And then you know just through the relationships and friendships that I formed in the field you know as we come together and talk about things like when the Black Theater Alliance first started you know.  I remember when the Black Theater Alliance first started you know Alyo and I were saying well you know we were thinking then maybe we ought to start a Black Dance Alliance because we didn't think that the theater alliance was going to address the needs of you know other black artists in the field.  But then the Black Theater Alliance said we're going to embrace all of the disciplines.  So we said, "Okay, cool, you know."  But I think it's part of our responsibility, you know part of my responsibility and others in the company.  You know now I'm, I encourage other people in the company get involved, do things, serve on panels, get to be known so that you can see what's happening.  But I think it's part of our responsibility to be at the table, you know, of things that are happening progressively in the arts, especially in the black arts community.
Speaker 1: In terms of the black dance community here, what are some of the other black dance organizations in the city of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Najwa Dance Corps, which is a long, another long standing dance company, African dance company, our sister company actually, Deeply Rooted [Dance Theater] which is evolved out of the Joseph Holmes Dance Company that went defunct and then was revitalized as Deeply Rooted, Minianca (ph.) Dance Company with Nigiri and Sutton and Meshach Silas who were both members of Muntu, West Indian Folk Dance Company.  There are quite a few companies that, of artists who have been working continuously over the years not organized in the same way that Muntu is organized but very much out there and still doing things.
Speaker 1: You had---
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--is another one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did you have a sense of, I mean when you were growing up and there, were there any African dance companies at all?
Speaker 2: There were but I didn't know about them because remember my grandmother [Alice Marie Warner] thought that dancing was a sin you know.  So I didn't get any kind of cultural anything during that time.  If I went to a museum or--I don't remember ever seeing a play as a child you know so my, my whole cultural awareness thing was not happening unless it was a school field trip or something like that.  So I was at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] I think when I first saw Darlene Blackburn dancing.  I was blown away, you know.  I was blown away that people were out here doing this, you know.  It was like, "Wow!"
Story_ID: 7809
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: My hope--well my hope is that we will realize that inside of all of us is a power to effect change if we understand how to come together and form not a united front across all issues but a united front against those core issues that effect all of us regardless of our economic, socio-economic status.  Sometimes--I have a, a friend who says, "You know sometimes we make it too hard to be black," you know.  And I think it's because we African Americans, our culture was taken from us you know.  So we had to be reborn back into loving ourselves first as African descendants, you know what I mean?  And there are still a lot of issues.  We talked about that whole you know color issues.  There are still a lot of issues that stop us from embracing our ethnicity you know totally and spiritually.  And I think that, that same kind of mentality kind of permeates how we relate to each other even today because I remember when I first became a vegetarian and first came on the so-called cultural set in Chicago [Illinois].  If you didn't have, if you didn't change your name and wear long skirts and wrap your head to the sky and you know if you, and were a vegetarian then you weren't accepted, you know.  If you didn't agree with everything coming out of the, you know the political education classes then you know obviously you weren't, you know--we cut ourselves off from each other sometimes.  When I was in the [Black Panther] Party you know I divorced myself almost from the religion that I had grown up with and the people that I had grown up with because now they weren't revolutionary enough for me.  So we create these barriers that separate us from each other and when I go back and think about those old guys that used to sit on the porch and those old guys that went in, were in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] you know I go back to race memory again.  If we would only remember you know who we are and the potential we have as a people and what we, what we had and what we have the capacity to do, then we can stop worrying so much about white folks, what white folks in this--Abena Joan Brown used to drop--still to this day every time we get together we're always talking about what white folks do and don't do.  We need to not talk about anymore.  I don't think there's anybody that's not clear.  We need to talk about what do we do and it's not about not liking anybody else or you know downing somebody else's culture it's about celebrating your own.  And when we start doing that then we will have control over our destiny.  That's what I want us to be able to do is to have control over our communities and our destinies so we don't get, have a situation like what's happening now all over the South Side you know all over the west side where you know communities are allowed to deteriorate.  And now because they're geographically desirable the projects are all being torn down and not that they shouldn't be.  But these people are being moved out and the communities are changing and, and, "Where are we in that picture?  What chapter are we calling and what are we determining in terms of what that culture and that community is going to look like?"  So, that's my hope for the community, that we would come to a, a conscious awareness around our common interests, and start to advocate for ourselves and build things for ourselves.  That's why I'm so excited about the whole institution-building that's happening on a cultural front.  We got DuSable [Museum of African American History] you know what, forty-some odd year plus, ETA [Creative Arts Foundation, Inc.], thirty-five years, Muntu [Dance Theatre of Chicago], thirty-one years, AACM [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, Inc.], thirty-five years.  You know we have long standing cultural institutions that need to understand not just the art part of it but the community development, the social and human development part of what we do.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back over--you're still fairly young.
Speaker 2: Fifty-four.
Speaker 1: When you look back over what you've done, what would you consider at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think being a catalyst for the type of institution that will survive all of the lifetimes of the founding people of the Muntu Dance Theater that would be a--that, that's what I see as my legacy being the, being the person to shepherd that in.  You know it, it, it, it, I want it to happen under my watch so to speak.  That's about it.  That's pitiful isn't it?  I don't have another one but that's it you know.  I think that a cultural connector you know.  I'm not the smartest person but I, I think I'm very intuitive and I, I have been able to bring things together and to connect things and to kind of be a glue that allows you know these really talented artists and smart, and smarter (unclear) individuals to springboard off of that.  I am, I see myself sometimes as part of the rock you know that things are built on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well this is slightly different from legacy but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  I think about that every time I go to a funeral.  You know it's like what would people say about me?  I'd like for people to remember me as a good dancer you know and a cultural messenger, as a person who fiercely loved her, you know her people you know and fiercely loved her family.  I'm very family oriented now.  I wasn't always but now I'm very family oriented.  You know I like having my family around me.  I like my, you know I'm the one that whenever anybody in the family falls out they all call me to talk about the other so you know I like that.  I like--I see a lot of the things that my mother was and that my grandmother was kind of have been passed on to me in terms of being again the rock in the family, you know.  When they have problems or you know they just want to bitch or whatever, I'm the one most people call.  I get along real well.  I don't pass judgment you know.  I tend to accept people for who and what they are, you know.  And I think that I have a knack for seeing to the potential in people.  Doesn't always play out but I, I, I can get along with anyone.  I can work with anyone 'cause I get past sometimes the surface and you know resonate to what we both have in common.  I think I have a knack at that.
