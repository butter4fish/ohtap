Other than going to visit Chicago [Illinois] (laughter), I like the islands and I went to a place called (Unclear) in Jamaica a few--my family went there as a gathering.  We do things like that, our family reunions.  We took a cruise at one time and this time we decided we were all gonna go to this spot in Jamaica because my cousin and his wife had honeymooned there and it's really a honeymoon spot (laughter).  We all went my aunts and everything and it was really, really lovely. I, I would love to go back, you know.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Of the year?  I suppose it used to be spring but we don't have spring that much anymore so I guess it's fall, just coming out of summer you know.  I, I'm a walker and it's--that's good walking weather you know, spring and fall is good walking weather.
Speaker 1: And then the last one is your favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase?  I hadn't thought about it, I probably use it a lot but I (laughter)--
Speaker 1: What do you, what do you use a lot?  What phrase do you think you use a lot? We'll come back to it?
Speaker 2: Yeah okay good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I thought you were gonna say my, your arms are too short to box with god, (laughter) that's one of my favorites.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 357434
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So we will start with your family tree and you seem to know a lot about your, your background, but we'll start with your mother's side of the family first.  So can you give me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Gussie Odessa Perkins, well who--she was Cobbins, you know, her maiden name is Cobbins, C-O-B-B-I-N-S [Gussie Cobbins Perkins].
Speaker 1: And how did she spell Gussie?
Speaker 2: G-U-S-S-I-E, and she was the oldest of nine, eight girls, one boy.  My grandmother [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins] always said she had a boy sandwich (laughter) 'cause he came right in the middle.  She had four girls and a boy and then four more girls (laughter).
Speaker 1: So your mother was born--her place of birth?
Speaker 2: Georgia--Athens, Georgia.  I think I'm getting teary.
Speaker 1: Okay, well do we have some tissues?
Speaker 2: I start telling stories all over the place (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay and so we're continuing, you were telling me your mother was born?
Speaker 2: In Athens--actually I guess it was called Oglethorpe County [Georgia], but I mean that to give it a--she always said Athens, and--
Speaker 1: And let's talk about your mother for a little while.  So how did she get Gussie? Do you know where the name Gussie came from?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I don't but that's it was quite a combination, Gussie Odessa (laughter), Odessa, Russia [Odessa, Ukraine] I mean, you know, but anyway, course I wasn't born with the name Micki [HistoryMaker Micki Grant].  I'll tell you where that came from my--from my--from her mother, you know.
Speaker 1: So your mother--what I read that she was a sales woman for Stanley Products [Stanley Home Products].
Speaker 2: Yeah she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But before we get to her life in sales--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk to you about her childhood?  What was her childhood like growing up in Athens?
Speaker 2: Yeah, by her being the oldest and, and the kids were coming so fast and she had poor eyesight, too, you know and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy]--if you started wearing glasses at a very, very young age and my mother always wore glasses from the time that I knew her from a very young age and she was always sort of like a fragile and bashful type but, but she had the experience of having to take care of children, you know.  When you're the eldest of nine siblings and by the time she left, I guess the, the two or three youngest were like teenagers, my mother was like maybe twenty when she left.  They had moved to Birmingham [Alabama] by that time.
Speaker 1: What year was she born, do you know about--
Speaker 2: Early 1900s, you know.
Speaker 1: In early 1900s--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she came to, she and my dad [Oscar Perkins] met in Chicago [Illinois] and they met in the '20s [1920s] in the late '20s [1920s], yeah.
Speaker 1: So before she gets to Chicago she--in Athens, she'd spent her entire (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, she--they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my grandfather [John Cobbins] moved the family to Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: And why did he move the family to Birmingham?
Speaker 2: I guess he thought he could make it better there and he did, he got a job in the--you know they had steel mills there, Vulcan steels or something, and he worked there at the steel--I guess they call it steel mills.
Speaker 1: Steel mill.
Speaker 2: I know they smelted steel there in Birmingham and he worked for them.
Speaker 1: So having nine siblings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they had a big house they bought at (unclear), the children were increasing and all of that, so.
Story_ID: 357435
Speaker 1: So back in Athens [Georgia] your--I'm, I'm assuming your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] being the, the oldest of the children that she had a lot of the domestic responsibilities?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did she--was she allowed to go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to school, I don't know that she--she didn't graduate from high school, you know.  All the other kids were graduating from high school, but part of it had to do with the responsibility and part with the sight, too.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about what her responsibilities were like?  I mean I know I'm from the South and we--you know my mom had to go to the fields, you know the cotton fields, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She, she was not good; she was not good at that.  Her sister next to her, who actually was my godmother, and her name was Hattie and there were a lot of Hatties in there, a lot of Matties in our family, a lot of Hatties.  In fact my sister's name is Hattie [Hattie Perkins Murphy], but they--she--my mother--she would go to, she would go if they had a mule she told me that, and they would (laughter) plow at night and my mother was never, she was never good at that and so they never really had her do that kind of outside work.  She, she was sort of fragile in that way you know and so I guess she helped my [maternal] grandmother [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins] more in the house.  My mother's an excellent cook and loved to entertain and loved to cook and loved to you know, so that's probably what she, she grew up doing.
Story_ID: 357436
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] talk about her mother ever?  What was her mother's name?
Speaker 2: I, I, I knew my [maternal] grandmother [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins] that's--we, we have stories about that. She used to send us in the summer to Birmingham [Alabama] and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] and I would go on the train in the summer.  Someone would take us and one of the stories we'd tell my mother's family is you know how we run the gamut of complexions in, in our race (unclear) (laughter), and in my family in particular we run the gamut and my grandmother's first cousin, who lived in Chicago [Illinois], was taking the two of us south on the train and at that time it was a segregated car and the conductor came through and wanted to know what she was doing sitting in the segregated car with us (laughter), which is my grandmother's first cousin now, and she says, "This is where I'm supposed to be," but anyway we were gone the way down to visit my grandmother, and one of the experiences that I had that I've never forgotten that had to do with segregation was when, oh, I guess I was about nine.  I think the last time we visited there I was about twelve so this is when I was about nine or so, and one of my grandmother's friends had come to get my sister and to take the two of us and my cousin and her grandchild to some place--I, I can't even remember where it was, maybe to see a zoo or something, I don't know, but we were on the bus, and I'm from Chicago, and so we got on the bus.  I see this empty seat by a window and, and I, I head for it, it's right at the back of the car, but I see an empty seat and I run and I jump in the seat so I can look out of the window, and the bus driver stops the bus and everybody they turn around and they're looking at me and, and some of them start to laugh and I don't, I don't know what's going on and the woman who's taking us gets so frightened and she comes and she yanks me out of the seat and then I look up and right above my head it says white only, and I'm sitting in this seat (laughter) and right over my head it says white only, and the driver I guess 'cause I was just a little kid, but he wasn't gonna move the bus until I got out of that, that seat and I'll never forget the look on this woman's face when she pulled me out of that seat and I just, I've just never forgotten that and I think what I remember most about it is, is the laughter, people laughing and everything.  Look at that little kid up there sitting in that seat that says white only (laughter), you know, but I guess other people have been treated much worse.  I mean I was nine years old so it was a laughing matter, but you know and I've ne-, never forgotten that moment.
Story_ID: 357437
Speaker 1: That's when I learned about gardening.  My [maternal] grandmother had a marvelous garden and she had chickens and that was just fun for us city kids, you know, and you could eat out of the garden every day and you'd, you'd talk about fried green tomatoes that you hear now--that was something we had as kids, biscuits all the time and great food you know.
Speaker 2: When was your grandmother--what was your grandmother's name?  We should get her name.  Your grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: Her maiden name was Eberhardt, yeah, Minnie Lorene Eberhardt [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins].
Speaker 2: Oh, you're gonna have to spell that for us.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) with a D: E-B-E-R-H-A-R-D-T, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And her first name again was?
Speaker 1: Minnie.
Speaker 2: Minnie, okay.  Now do you know perhaps about her date of birth?  When do you think your grandmother was born?
Speaker 1: I have her date of birth; I have all that information.  I just can't--
Speaker 2: Recall it, and okay but you have it written down?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So we could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Both, both--
Speaker 2: --get that information
Speaker 1: On both my grandmothers, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, but tell me then of your grandmother, what did she look like?  Was she mixed, was she all black, was she mixed with Indian [Native American] or white?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well I just told you about her first cousin right?  Well I wouldn't say that I consider her a black, but if you go back into my background we come from a family of Goolsby, those are the two names in my grandmother's family.  G-O-O-L-S-B-Y and some people leave the L out, but it's G-O-L-L--G-O-O-L-S-B-Y, Goolsby, and he had a cook named Tyre, who was from Africa and they had many, many children and so as I say in our family if you were to see our family it runs the gamut of shades.
Speaker 2: So Goolsby, do you know what that family did for a living?  The--
Speaker 1: Well, I know that left to our family and some of them who are still there in Georgia still own some of that they had a lot of timber, they had a sawmill and a rock quarry.  I saw all of that my first trip (unclear).  I was an adult we had my first reunion in Georgia, we didn't have the reunions there, but then when they wanted the big entire family reunion, they had it in Lexington, Georgia, and that's when I saw all of these things that were in my family including the sawmill.  They had--was it pine, pine tree, yeah a lot of pine and consequently the, the people in my--in fact my grandmother inherited a lot of land but they sold it because none of the kids wanted to keep it.  They were all in the North and they said who's, you know--when I heard about it I was old enough to understand, I was very upset, you know, 'cause land and property it's, it's--especially when it's been passed on to you like that.  It--I just think it's so precious, so it's a part of your heritage.
Speaker 2: What was the the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But fortunately some of, you know, some of the people in the family, my grandmother had several sisters and they, they held on their part.  We still have a family home there, 390 Chase Street [Athens, Georgia] (laughter).
Speaker 2: What was the cook's name?
Speaker 1: Tyre.
Speaker 2: Tyre, Tyre.
Speaker 1: It's like a--like the plantation in, in 'Gone with the Wind,' Tyre, T-A-R-A [sic.], I think that's the spelling, but that's the spelling that we got that I have on my--
Speaker 2: Now had she come from Africa, the cook, and they met in Georgia (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I--she, well if she wasn't just to--first off the boat she, she was pure African at the time, you know.
Speaker 2: Now how many children did they have together?
Speaker 1: I think about thirteen [sic.] (laughter).
Speaker 2: So they were in love?
Speaker 1: I think it was not a passing thing, you know.
Story_ID: 357438
Speaker 1: Did he have a second family as well, Goolsby [William Goolsby (ph.)] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how many children did he have with this other family?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, did the two sides ever meet (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I have a great story about my other side of the family, too (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, did they--did the two Goolsbys ever meet, his wife in that family and your side of the family?  Did you ever and even, at any, at any point in your life have you ever had contact with them?
Speaker 2: No, but there was something--God, in my life--there was a moment in my life where two families came together but it was in the--it was north.  It was in Chicago [Illinois], like in Indiana or someplace away from, from the South where the two families sort of met.  I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just let me put it in perspective.  Goolsby was then your great-great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you have a picture of him?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do we have a picture of her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have a picture of--
Speaker 1: Tyre?
Speaker 2: Not the, not these--owner, I have a picture of his son, who became my, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, his son?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it's his son then that was in love with the cook?
Speaker 2: No, it, it--
Speaker 1: It was him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but by the grandfather that I know, that I would have a picture of, was an offspring of those two.
Speaker 1: Gotcha, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and then from them came my [maternal] grandmother [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins], you know.
Speaker 1: And then the whole thirteen?
Speaker 2: Right, right yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so that's an interesting history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah and (unclear).  Then let's--any other stories you can think--I mean you have such great ones, I mean with your grandmother, anything else comes to mind about her life? Having had Goolsby--having had a white father and, and a black mother?
Speaker 2: Hers was not, but this was her--
Speaker 1: Her parents, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, fore parents, yeah, no, but she always would always was a house person, you know what you call a homemaker.
Speaker 1: I'm talking about your grandmother now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she made all the clothes and she made--my grandmother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --made all the kids the clothes and, and all of that and she had a sewing machine and then she'd sew, and one of the, one of my aunts became one of the finest tailors you'd ever want to see.  Her two boys were the sharpest things you'd ever seen, you know (laughter), but my grandmother was the, the cause of our having a regular family reunions because as the children scattered neighbors sent for her to come here and I remember she came to live with us in Chicago for to visit us and, and there was another daughter who married and went to Tennessee and she'd go visit them.  About several of the children moved to California and she'd go visit them and, and she said, "I just one day want to see all of my children together at one time," and in 1955 we had the very first family reunion of the Cobbins side and you'll see a picture of that with all of us and then, but from then on not starting in '55 [1955] but starting in 19--after she passed, we wanted to start those reunions and every two years we had a family reunion and we don't--when my uncle retired to Phoenix [Arizona] that was another city added to what, he retired to Mesa, Arizona so we go to San Diego [California], we'd go to Los Angeles [California], we'd go to Chicago, we'd go to Arizona and we'd go to Tennessee every two years and then one year we all took a cruise to the islands and there were about sixty of us on that, on that cruise and, but my grandmother was the, the beginning of that 'cause she just wanted to see all of her children together in one spot again (laughter).
Story_ID: 357439
Speaker 1: How would you describe the fam-, that the, the Cobbins, working class, middle class?  I mean they owned land, they were land owners (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.  And they--I guess it was inbred in them because they all, I think probably we're the only ones my family that really never bought a house.  I think all have gone to California you know eventually bought homes, in Tennessee they bought homes and, and also the other thing that was ingrained was education, land and education, land and education.  A lot of my relatives who are still there in Georgia one was a superintendent of schools, we had principals, teachers, you know, just that, that was another thing that was emphasized, you know.
Speaker 1: So were, are there any family heirlooms that have been passed on to you?
Speaker 2: I have that--my aunt who passed about five years ago she knew that I loved antiques and, and she passed on to me some of crystal cut ware that's a hundred years old that have been in her family and it's sitting over there.  I--it's beautiful but she left that specifically that Micki [HistoryMaker Micki Grant] should get this you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now do you know where she got it from?
Speaker 2: She got it when one of her other sisters passed who had gotten it from her mother, from my [maternal] grandmother [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins], and then it had just been passed along.
Speaker 1: Now.
Speaker 2: I don't how they acquired this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Wonderful, beautiful, you know.
Speaker 1: Because the--what I'm thinking of also, I don't even know why this came up but remember in [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou's film 'Down in the Delta' it's the candelabra that had been passed on and on and it turns out that they had, you know, had been traded for them, you know they wanted the slave, they didn't have the money so they gave them--
Speaker 2: Oh, they used the candle--
Speaker 1: --so they gave them the candelabra so when the, you know when, when--during the--you know, after emancipation when they were burning everything down, the, the son grabbed it and took it and said--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --because this had been traded for my father and he didn't have his father so he took that candelabra and then he took it and passed it along with his family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I, I'm sure there's something (laughter) that's still (unclear), no it's, its beautiful crystal, you know.
Story_ID: 357440
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little about your father's [Oscar Perkins] side of the--I mean then your [maternal] grandfather.
Speaker 2: Well let me tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my right the Cobbins (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Grandfather--the Cobbins.
Speaker 2: --'cause my [maternal] grandmother [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins] was an Eberhardt, married John Cobbins.  He, too, they had his side of the family the--they--the slave owner had twin boys and they ran away during the Civil War, I understand, and this is the way the story was told to me by my aunt, and one of them was caught, the other one they never found again.  The other one was caught and brought back became my great-great-grandpa Jerry [ph.].  Now we don't know what ever happened to his twin brother, he's out there somewhere (laughter), I don't know he might be a--you know (laughter) and I've always wanted to say, I wanted to write this story and put my own ending to it you know what was this brother doing 'cause I don't even know his name, but I know the one that they caught and brought back became my great-great-grandpa Jerry (laughter).  So that's life you know and, but they didn't have a child--many children.  I got to meet more of my grandfather's people when I went to the reunion in Georgia.  I didn't know that many of his people before that.  I knew mostly my grandmother's people, you know.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he and my grandmother when all the kids were left and gone and you know separated, she separated, they finally they moved my grandmother out to California and my, my granddad stayed there in Birmingham [Alabama] and that's where he died and she died in San Diego [California] so that's the way that goes.
Speaker 1: So your grand--Mr. Cobbins and your mother [sic.], how many children--how many siblings were of that marriage, how many brothers and sisters do you [sic.] have?  Or did they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They had nine.
Speaker 1: Nine--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay and then so your mother was the eldest of the nine children?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you--can you know the other siblings, their names or just--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a very, very close family, very tight-knit family and--
Speaker 1: Can you just give me your mother's siblings in order starting with your mother, the oldest?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact the one next to her, my Aunt Hattie [Hattie Cobbins Gray] just died a couple of years ago.  She was living with my sister [Hattie Jenkins Murphy] in Chicago [Illinois].  So there was Gussie [Gussie Cobbins Perkins], Hattie, Inez [Inez Cobbins Ervin], she's the one who told me the story about Grandpa Jerry (laughter), you know, Johnnie and her name is Johnnie, and everyone called her Johnnie B., and I understand her name was Johnnie Benjamin [Johnnie Cobbins Owens], but by the time they got to number four my granddad had decided he wasn't gonna have a boy and his name was John, so (laughter) he, they named the fourth girl Johnnie and after Johnnie came Annie Laura [Annie Cobbins Hodges], and then Mattie and understand her middle name is Mattie William [ph.], and everybody called her Bill.  We--everybody in the family calls her Bill (laughter) and after Mattie, Lurean [Lurean Cobbins Taylor], which was my grandmother's middle name, and I left out the boy didn't I.   There was Louis [ph.] and then the youngest was Zenola, she has no middle name, just Z-E-N-O-L-A [Zenola Cobbins Maxie], but after Annie Laura which was the--wait a minute no, after Johnnie was the fourth, after Johnnie came James, James Nathaniel [James N. Cobbins] that's my uncle.
Speaker 1: And who did they name him after because he had already used the name John or--
Speaker 2: I, I, I know after, after his brother, his brother's name was James, but it's James C. Cobbins, so I don't know where the Nathan--maybe from the Bible, probably the Bible, Nathaniel, yeah.  Maybe both came from the Bible (laughter).
Story_ID: 357441
Speaker 1: So let's go back to your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] and let's get her life, at what point did she--did she move with the family to Birmingham [Alabama] also?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, my mother was--moved, they were all children when my [maternal] grandpa [John Cobbins] moved the family to Birmingham my--then my mother left Birmingham as a young woman like about twenty.
Speaker 1: Where did she go?
Speaker 2: She came to Chicago [Illinois], we had cousins and then she came and she stayed with cousins there.
Speaker 1: Did she have a time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's where she--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --eventually met my dad [Oscar Perkins].
Speaker 1: But did she ever talk about why she was going to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because when--she had young cousins there and they were doing things I guess she just thought she could make and she became really a domestic, you know, a co-, she knew how to cook, she knew how to do anything in a house and it was just you know the Great Migration, everybody was--thought Chicago was gonna be the place (laughter), you know.  You find more people there from Mississippi and Tennessee, and you know except my dad had come from Memphis [Tennessee] and not as many Georgians, but actually by that time she was in Alabama I guess.
Story_ID: 357442
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your father, before we talk about their meeting, your father's name?
Speaker 2: Oscar William Perkins [Oscar Perkins].
Speaker 1: And his date of birth, do you know thereabouts the same as your mom's [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] in the early 1900s basically?
Speaker 2: He was like seventy-one when he died in 1972, seventy.
Speaker 1: And he was born in Memphis [Tennessee] though?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I really should've gotten all these dates together 'cause.
Speaker 1: Oh, well that's okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I have them all you know.
Speaker 1: So your father was born in Mem-, he was--did he ever talk about his life in Memphis?  Memphis, the Deep South is a pretty tough place I would imagine?
Speaker 2: He grew up with mostly with his cousins and, and his grandfather and because my [paternal] grandmother [Hattie Griffen Watkins] was like a practical nurse and since she and my [paternal] granddad [Arthur Perkins] didn't stay together very long, and they--my grand--my father was the youngest of her two children, he had an older sister, my Aunt Georgia [ph.], died recently at 108 and anyway (laughter) and he had asthma from a kid when and, and I remember my grandmother always called him son, son, then she always just like he was he was her baby boy, which was kind of nice to see, you know, my dad being treated like you know, and so my, my grandmother being away doing practical nursing jobs all the time he, and then also--
Story_ID: 358028
Speaker 1: And we were speaking about your father [Oscar Perkins].  You were telling--you were gonna tell me the story about how dark he was versus how light some of his other siblings were (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, some of the family, in fact one of--my [paternal] grandmother's [Hattie Griffen Watkins] father became a Methodist bishop and then there was her brother, Joe, Joseph [ph.], and I think that's who my dad spent a lot of time with her brother and his kids when she was away because she married, his name is William Perkins [Arthur Perkins], my dad's father, but he moved away.  I guess he was one of the first ones who--'cause the only time I ever saw him, I saw him once in my life, he came by our house in Chicago [Illinois], said he was looking for his son.  "Daddy, daddy your daddy is here," but I knew--my grand-, the person that I knew was--his name was Watkins, and he was the one that I always knew as my grandmother's husband in Chicago 'cause she had remarried when she came to Chicago but my dad--well here comes a little story, little secret.  My dad became a dad as a teenager in Memphis [Tennessee], and he left shortly after that coming to Chicago.  He married the young lady and she, she had a little boy named Erskine Ray Perkins [Erskine Perkins].  And my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] and I met him years later when we were adults and we had always been told that we had a brother somewhere and my sister was, "I don't have any brother, I don't have any brother," and I was always fascinated by this story and she showed--my grandmother showed us a picture one day of this boy on a horse and--anyway, that's, that's how my father came to Chicago after this had occurred.  I don't know that why--that's why he came.  Everybody was sort of like migrating then, and he was a young man. He came and he got work in a barbershop I guess shining shoes and that's when he decided he was going to learn to be a barber and he went to Miller Barber College [Chicago, Illinois] and got his license and became a master barber, eventually he owned his own shop.  In the meantime he, he was just very versatile and, and very personable and, and very gregarious and, and he was a self-taught tap dancer.  He was an amateur boxer and he played blues piano and sang and that's--I use to sit beside him on the piano you know and, and he would sing, (singing) trouble in mine, I'm blue, du, du, du, du, you know (laughter), but I, I as the story goes it, you know you see all those house parties and house rent parties and all that they tell you and they say my dad use to play for some of those parties and I understand that's how he and mom [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] met.  Now that's the story I heard, that she met this guy playing the piano at this house party and he met this young girl right off the boat from (laughter) Alabama, but anyway they met.
Story_ID: 358029
Speaker 1: Now you said he had married in Memphis [Tennessee], did he divorce first (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then--
Speaker 2: It was one, you know, in those days you did not get--the family--you know--the way you know--you just--if, if the girl's father didn't (laughter), then the boy's father wo-, you know.  You just didn't do that, so oh no, and his--the, the offspring of--my brother, we're very, very close now you know, and oh yeah my nieces and my nephews we're, we're--it just took us all of those years that we to me you know 'cause my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] never mentioned the fact that my father [Oscar Perkins] had been married and had a son and I only knew about it through my [paternal] grandmother [Hattie Griffen Watkins] and that story is--see I go off on other stories.  When his mother died, Erskine's [Erskine Perkins] mother died, one day my aunt [Georgia Perkins (ph.)], my father's sister comes over to the house in Chicago [Illinois] and she has this tall young man with her and she brings him by my place and, and she said, "Do you know who this is?"  And the minute I looked at him, I ran and I leaned up to him and I said, "Erskine," and I ran I leaped into his arms, you know.  I knew immediately that this was my brother, there was something about him that reminded me of my dad and I just, I just knew that this was--and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy], who had denied him all this time when she--she became so possessive and so f-, (laughter) you know and so we just became very, very close.  He would come to visit and the whole family, including my father, went to Memphis and visited and stayed with him and his stepdad.  You know, it was all very nice and, and he welcomed us and he welcomed my dad.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living, Erskine?  What was he doing?
Speaker 2: He was like a--he traveled all over like an interior decorator, like draperies and things if you ordered drapes or this from a company, and he would come and put them up and I, I guess you'd say an interior--
Speaker 1: Decorator or designer, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Story_ID: 358030
Speaker 1: He and your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] met at a house party, they married.  I kind of want to talk about their lives before you came along, did they talk about that with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well actually they married during the Depression [Great Depression] so you know, and, and my grandmother [Hattie Griffen Watkins] had come to Chicago [Illinois] by then and married--
Speaker 1: Which grandmother?
Speaker 2: --(unclear) my father's [Oscar Perkins] mother, yeah had left Memphis [Tennessee] and, and they had opened a restaurant.
Speaker 1: In Chicago?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] always likes to talk about it 'cause she said when we'd go over there they need us to babysit on weekends and, and then we could have barbecue and we can have this and we can have (laughter), she remembers--that's a fond memory (laughter) for her, you know, but they used to, to take us like for weekends to stay with my [maternal] grandmother [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins] after they were married and we had come along, but I was always like a home person.  I would have a great time right up until time to go to bed and then I'd start screaming to go home.  I always wanted to be at home when it was time to go to bed and my sister would just be having a great time, you know, and it's the same way when we went to Birmingham [Alabama].  We traveled all that way on the train and I'd get there and have a happy time.  As the sun started to go down when people started talking about going to bed I'd start screaming, "I wanna go home," and you--how do you think you're going home?  (Laughter) I don't know why that was but it, it just, it was just al-, I just always was a homebody that way.
Story_ID: 358031
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] get into selling Stanley Products [Stanley Home Products]?
Speaker 2: Yeah 'cause my mother did do--during that Depression [Great Depression] time, you know, you just did whatever you could, and even when my father [Oscar Perkins] was a barber, a lot of times (laughter) people couldn't afford to get their hair cut you know and then he would moonlight in the house or, but then he would get--maybe go out to the market and buy vegetables and, and he'd made himself a little cart.  He'd go up and down the alley selling string beans or whatever, you know, you did whatever you could to, to make it at the time.  I remember people coming to our door asking for, for something to eat.  Yeah so, I don't know really how it started whether she went to a Stanley party, demonstration or what, but anyway she got fascinated by that and she became this terrific--she--we still at home have all these different medal, prizes that she won and she became the first African American to become the national champion and they convened in Boston [Massachusetts] and I have this picture of my mother standing there--this little lady with all--surrounded by all these people from all over the country and where she had become the champion sales lady of the entire country.  It was, just, just amazing, but she, she just loved it, it was, it was you know--she was a good persuader and I guess she also--you have to--care about the product, have interest in the product because since my mother has, has passed, people still call my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] in Chicago [Illinois], you know, for products and she'll order it from somebody--from other salesperson for them so.  My--built--'cause my mother stayed with my--once my father died my, my mother was staying with my sister and brother-in-law and they made an office for her in, in the place.  She had her own office there with all her goods and shelves and things and she, she--it was really nice she enjoyed it, yeah. She became a member of the federated club and she just and of course once the things started to happen to me once--well we'll we get to that you know.  'Cause my dad died the day of my first preview of 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.'  My father had a heart attack that morning and passed, so I had to go on stage that night because the understudy had not, you know, been prepared, but after that and when my mother being widowed she came here [New York, New York], stayed a while and she would travel with me and she loved to go to the openings.  The first time she ever flew was when we opened in Toronto [Canada] and she--'cause she had never been on a plane and my sister said, "Well I don't know how you're going," you know, (laughter), it's not like taking a train to Canada, and she, she took a flight with my sister to Toronto for the opening and she fell in love with flying, and she just flew back and forth to California to see her sisters and all that after everything, then I just, and I loved sending her places first class and all that and she just felt like a queen, you know (laughter).

Speaker 1: What are you earliest memories of growing up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It was--I grew up like in, in one house practically my whole--from the time I was about five or so because I remember my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] was looking for an apartment.  I was still not going to school all day.  My sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] would be in school, I remember my mother taking me when she was looking for apartments and we found this apartment on 64th [Street] and Evans [Avenue] in a building, a three-story building, stone, white stone building and everybody called it the big building because most of the houses on the block were like two-story and family homes like that and that's what I remember mainly is that everybody knew everybody.  Your kids--all the kids came out to play together and everyone would run to the big building and: "Let's go to the big building," and we'd sit on the steps and play all that kind of stuff but, and schools within walking distance and it was just a very neighborly--there was--that's something I had to get use to when I came to New York [New York].  You didn't walk down the street and just walk past a person and not acknowledge that you were (laughter) walking, you know a hi, good morning, or something and when I first came here you could ride up and down the elevator with people day in and day out (laughter) and they'd never speak to you.  I wrote a song about that actually called 'Chicago,' (singing), "It's just a big ole' country town, Chicago," you know so (singing), "if I, if I slip and say good morning, it's not rude I mean to be, you can get me out of Chicago, but you can't get Chicago out of me."  You know 'cause and it's, it's a funny song, but--my impressions of coming here.

Speaker 1: What else do you remember about s-, the neighborhood [in Chicago, Illinois].  Can you describe the street for me?  You said there--just in more details.  The games you may have played on the streets with the children?
Speaker 2: Hide and seek, of course that was, that was the big thing.  I always trying to keep up, my, my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] claimed I was always trying to keep up with the guys 'cause they were climbing fences and trees and stuff and that seemed to be more fun to me, and they had things like wagons and sleds and stuff (laughter), you know, but some of them were made out of--you know how you made scooters and, and they'd take wheels from skates and make their own scooters and stuff, and we had skates.  I remember having ice skates and they flooded the pond at that, the schoolyard and my sister and I were--where I'd have to take them off so she could skate a while, then she'd have to take 'em off so I could skate you know, but we had roller skates and we played hide and seek and you, and Simon Says, you know, oh we just, well we just--the kids all played together.

Speaker 1: Did you get the sense that there were leaders in the community [in Chicago, Illinois], like s-, I mean it's too early for civil rights, but were there black leaders in--who were the leaders in your community?
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you, number one, there weren't leaders but the people that you considered middle class were, were liked postal workers or s-, I mean if you had a civil service job you were something, you know.  The teachers were, though, highly, highly respected, you know. You never--the teacher, the teacher, the doctor, any of those, those professions were, you know, highly, highly respected, but I suppose you would say even then before the, the ministers were, were leaders.  I remember on our block it wasn't our church, but there was a Reverend Carey [Archibald Carey, Jr.] and his was a Methodist [African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.)] church [Woodlawn A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois]; my church was a Baptist church [Woodlawn Union Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], they were both called Woodlawn and, and but I remember Reverend Carey being a very fiery person.  I think he eventually ran for office [Chicago City Council] if I'm not mistaken, and, and my pastor was, under whom I grew up, was pastor there for thirty something years and--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: He had a lot to do with bringing the money in the for summer projects for children you know and he was head of the ministers alliance for a long time and I, I--those were mainly the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was his name, the pastor of the Woodlawn--
Speaker 2: Alvin, well he always used the initials A.E. Williams, but it was Alvin E. Williams.
Story_ID: 358035
Speaker 1: So did the family attend a church s-, regularly?  Was it some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins]--
Speaker 1: --every Sunday?
Speaker 2: --my mother was president of the usher board for like thirty years then she became president emeritus, you know, and I remember as a kid--I say that all the time, my mother walked very fast, she was very brisk.  She was--she was always, always busy, always busy and I remember when she would come down the aisle she had this wonderful strut with the hand and I would look and I would be (laughter), watching my mom walk down the aisle, but we always and I, I was teaching Sunday school by the time I was thirteen and then I was conducting the junior choir at sixteen or seventeen, and so, you know, my father [Oscar Perkins] went when he well felt like it, you know (laughter) if it's--but--
Speaker 1: Do you remember being on the mourners' bench?
Speaker 2: No, no, nobody was, was trying to get me--when I did it I did it on my own (laughter) as a--you know.
Speaker 1: How did you do it?
Speaker 2: I just--in fact I, I went and joined church it was happened to be on a revival and my mother was not there, my parents weren't there and I was very young.  I was like about six, so they had to get permission, and they said, you know and my mother said yeah, if she says she wants to, she knows what she wants to do.
Speaker 1: How could you know that at age six?
Speaker 2: I didn't--I never found--to this day I remember it.  I remember it that when I was baptized, I remember that whole moment of coming out of the water like it was yesterday, so I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: What led up to you being six years old and being able to say I'm ready to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess my mother took us, see--my mother took both my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] and I in her arms, you know, so it's (unclear) it's something that--and maybe I, you know, I--it just seemed like a natural place to be so, so if they were saying, do you love God, do you love Jesus, and all that, you know, oh yes, (laughter) you know, and it just seemed like the natural thing to do and we always had our little Easter and our little poems to say and of course my sister would never say hers.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of yours?
Speaker 2: What are you looking at me so hard for?  I didn't come to stay, I just came to tell you that this is Easter Day, (laughter).
Speaker 1: We call those Easter speeches.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: There's an Easter speech (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: And, and my sister would--but she would never do hers, she would get up and she would take her, her pretty little new dress and she'd twist it and (laughter) everything.  We talk about that now that she, she is a very gregarious person now.  I said now you tell everything, before you wouldn't even say hello to people.  I use to say, "Hello, hello I'm talk--I speak much for my sister," and now I'm the youngest so I said, "Hello, hello," (laughter).
Speaker 1: So at age six you were baptized?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In Woodlawn Church [Woodlawn Union Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --by Minister A.W. [sic.] (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, no but that, that he was not the one who baptized me, but he came shortly after that.  In order words it was really during my growing up years.  I was really baptized by H.D. Martin, M-A-R, he was the one--my mother was the founder, in fact she was the last living founder when she died a few years ago and when they moved into this church on Eberhart [Avenue] I was telling you Reverend Carey [Archibald Carey, Jr.] at Woodlawn [Woodlawn A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois] was on Evans [Avenue] and our Woodlawn was on Eberhart.  My [maternal] grandmother's [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins] maiden name (laughter), but when they went into that church it was under the aegis of H.D. Martin [Hamilton D. Martin] and then shortly after that--I guess maybe th-, two years, three years maybe because I, I was quite young.  I remember when A.E. Williams [Alvin E. Williams] came I was still quite young.
Story_ID: 358036
Speaker 1: Do you remember going to first grade--school [McCosh Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] for the first time?
Speaker 2: No, I remember kindergarten for the first time and my (unclear) I remembered her name for the longest, I remember her name for the longest, yeah, but I don't have a lot of memories of that playing and doing things in kindergarten, but I remember in first grade--the silliest things that you remember, I was trying to make people think I was writing.  I'd take the pencil and I'd--, "Yes, I know how to write," and (laughter) I'd be scribbling all (laughter) over the paper 'cause it looked writing to me and they didn't know the difference (laughter).
Speaker 1: So had you been introduced to music prior to starting kindergarten?
Speaker 2: I was--that-- when I sat on the bench with beside my dad [Oscar Perkins] see--
Speaker 1: What type of music would he play?
Speaker 2: My dad?
Speaker 1: You said blues (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's, that was it I mean 'cause and he didn't read, you know, but he would go and I guess he'd from what he had heard and I--now I hear--oh, I was listening the other night to Amy Campen [ph.], she was signing this song, 'Trouble in Mind.'  I said, "That's the song I use to hear my dad play on the piano."  She was talking about blues, she was talking about the blues and this and that, and that was just a couple of nights ago as a matter of fact and I turned to someone I said, "That's the song I used to hear my dad play on the piano all the time," and all those old blues standards and I remember watching him and his hand would go (making sounds), you know, and I'd get there afterwards and go--try to go (making sounds), so it, it, the I guess when my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] wanted to give us music lessons everybody it was just standard in that day, you needed to take something, art was, you know, you took music lessons or dancing lessons or something like that and we had a community center that you'd go to for free but don't ask me who paid for it, but they had people there to give you exercises, dance instructions and that's when I first started to take what they call dramatic lessons and my dramatic teacher was so dramatic.  Susan Porche [Susan Porche Lawson], and she taught me, "Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll."  I was eight years old and I'm doing this roll on thou deep and dar-, (laughter).  Yeah but that's when I knew I wanted to be in the theater though because that was my first.
Story_ID: 358037
Speaker 1: Who do you think taught your fa-, who do you think your father [Oscar Perkins] picked up music from, although he was--played by ear, he was self-taught, who do you think introduced music to him?
Speaker 2: Well you know in, in Memphis [Tennessee] I'm sure they must've had all those--
Speaker 1: Sun Records [Sun Record Company, Memphis, Tennessee] is right there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah you know, it--I'm sure he must've just grown up hearing that, he just seemed to be so familiar with it, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Then who bought the piano because I read that there was, yeah--
Speaker 2: Someone was, was moving and getting rid of a piano because that--and they managed to what I don't know how much it cost but somehow my mom [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] and dad made this bargain and got this piano in the house and we had a piano in the house.  It wasn't the same one but I grew up there was always a piano in the house from that time on and I guess that's when my mother decided to give us piano lessons.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: 'Cause once there was piano in the house and I'll never forget when my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] sold the piano.  I went home a few years ago and there was no piano in the house.  I said, "You don't expect me to--," as if I played, "you don't expect me to keep coming here visiting and there's no piano here," (laughter), but my sister took piano lessons, you know, and I ended up taking violin lessons, so we would have recitals and she would play and I'd play the violin and later on I moved into the double bass.
Speaker 1: So I guess there is some truth in--I mean there was always truth in August Wilson's plays, but I never thought about the piano lessons really being as truthful as talking to you about your experiences with the piano in your home.  So you grew up wanting to play because your father played but you just--when you got into lessons you decided that the teacher said, oh, she's not gonna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah because well (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --the repetition's no good?
Speaker 2: (Making sounds) I'll go (making sounds), you know, I'm hearing these things (laughter) that I wanna do and I didn't know how to do, and I guess that it was it and I suppose if it, if he had stuck with me long enough I would have--to this day I regret.  I said one of these days before I pass on I'm gonna sit at the piano and just play my stuff as well as everybody else plays it.  You know what I mean?  But once I started with the violin there was another kind of discipline and, and then my having a string ensemble and other people involved then you were playing with other people.  You know, she had an orchestra (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the piano teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Lucille Davis, oh the piano teacher's name, her name was Polk [Lillie B. Polk].  In fact her son, there actually was a relative, I don't know if you know the name Robert L. Polk, well it was his mother (laughter).  It--we're cousins and so she was a pianist for the church [Woodlawn Union Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], and so she was one who was giving us piano lessons and my sister went on.  She played very well, but Mrs. Davis, Lucille Davis, was a violin teacher and she formed an orchestra at our elementary school, which was McCosh Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], and that's when I started taking--and at that time you--they furnished you violins and then my mother found someone you know who had two or three violins, her son was--played, and she got a second-hand violin for me.
Speaker 1: And did you continue the violin lessons for any length of time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then my.
Speaker 1: You struck a deal with the teacher, they asked you to volunteer and you went to bass (laughter).  So tell me about the violin and then that story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I have, I still have my bass (laughter).
Story_ID: 358038
Speaker 1: Tell me the story of how all of that happened from the violin to the bass?
Speaker 2: Well, when she [Lucille Davis] was going to form a string ensemble, and she had a cello, she had violins and everything and no bass, no double bass player and she had purchased a double bass on her own and she said, you know, I will give lessons to whoever will--wants to play the double bass, and I volunteered, you know.  You know 'cause it was fascinating, I always like something different (laughter), you know, and I started to study double bass with her, and by the time--when I got to high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois]--I was still in elementary school [McCosh Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] at the time.  When I got to high school, Peter Chikowski [ph.] was the bandmaster at the time, and he had me go down to the Chicago School of Music [Chicago, Illinois] where he was teaching, and he put me in touch with Nathan Zimberoff, who was with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and I started studying with Nathan Zimberoff, and I played there with the Chicago School of Music concert orchestra and, and then with the high school I played all through high school and then they put me on the e-flat tuba, and people said, "You know that little girl that plays that great big thing," (laughter).

Speaker 1: You're talking about Chicago School of Music [Chicago, Illinois].  What I'd like to know is if you--what were the percentage of black students at the Chicago School of Music?
Speaker 2: There were about fifty or sixty of us in the orchestra and I was the only black.  In fact I don't remember seeing another one while I was there, yeah I mean even as a student so I don't know maybe they were coming but did come in my time but I know there were no more in the orchestra.
Speaker 1: Now what about the, the elementary school you've gone to was it mixed?
Speaker 2: No that was, that black, the teacher was--I think it was only one white student when I started there, and I don't know how long he was there.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of that elementary school again?
Speaker 2: McCosh, M-C-C-O-S-H [McCosh Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], yeah.

Speaker 2: Lorraine Hansberry (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Lorraine Hansberry, who else?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, I'm not sure that he was at McCosh, but I know he's from Chicago, "But I was cool--," what's the guy, what's--oh, gads.  I, I'll--
Speaker 1: But Lorraine Hansberry was actually out of McCosh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she--yeah, she was at McCosh.
Speaker 1: Did you know her?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Did you know her as a writer?
Speaker 2: I met, when we--when I came to New York [New York] she was here and she--they had already done 'Raisin' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry], and she was working on 'The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window' [Lorraine Hansberry], I believe, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's where that was a play and somehow or other I had been invited some place and she was there and I went over and I told her you know, to introduce myself, and she was smiling and very graceful.  I could tell she was not well at the time, you know, 'cause shortly after that she passed, you know.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But she went--I thought she went to the same high school, but I just understand the other day that she, she went to an all-girls high school [sic.], Betsy Ross [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and I don't--and now that I think of it I don't, you know--(unclear) for some reason I thought she went to McCosh, I mean to Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] because so many of us from McCosh went to Englewood, you know.
Speaker 1: So at McCosh this--how did this gentleman actually see you playing in order to invite you to the Chicago School of Music?
Speaker 2: Oh, no that's--by the time I had gone to Englewood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I, I joined as my extracurricular you know--no it wasn't at extracurricular it was one of my electives, a minor, band ,and so I told 'em I'd play again double bass and there was only double bass there and I became a double bass player and he, he was an instructor at the Chicago School of Music I was at the time and he had an orchestra there that he conducted the orchestra and he invited me, well number one he wanted me to become a member of the orchestra and at the same time to continue my studies and that's when he introduced me to Nathan Zimberoff and--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: In fact they're bringing back 'A Chorus Line,' did you see that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're the only black student in the Chicago School of Music--
Speaker 2: No, I'm not saying I was the only black student; I was the only one I saw (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the orchestra.  The only one you saw?
Speaker 2: But I know I was the only one in the orchestra, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did that ex-, did, were there--how--
Speaker 2: And I don't remember there being another when I played at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I was in the concert band there.  In fact I, I saw that picture.  The other day I was trying to find it and you could see me, that little spot back there who had been--there were like two of us, two or three bass fiddles.  When I went to Chicago School of Music there was one other double bass player.

Speaker 1: Well what did your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] and father [Oscar Perkins] think about what was going on?
Speaker 2: They were always very encouraging, of course my mother wished I had stuck with the violin (laughter), she didn't want me going (unclear).  Fortunately during the period of time when I was going down at, at least once a week with the orchestra, one of my mother's sisters had moved to Chicago [Illinois], and she had two boys and that, that--I would take one them with me each night and of course the youngest, but pretty soon James [ph.] said, "I don't wanna go," and my--the older one, Bob [ph.], he loved it.  He would come back and I'd hear him singing all these (singing), and he would just be conducting, and on his way to school and he was in elementary school, and he'd, he would have on his little Superman cape, and he's going down the street conducting this orchestra.  So it was a wonder he became a great jazz fan as the years went by, you know, but he, he was in his mind all these complica-, you know, orchestra.  He would sit there and just listen all evening.  It just tells you, shows you the difference in, you know, how people appreciate music.  For, for James he, he did not (laughter)--now his name was James Bartholomew [ph.] (laughter), that's Bible.

Speaker 1: How were you treated at the school [Chicago School of Music, Chicago, Illinois] being the only black student in the orchestra?
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: So how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember having any kind of, you know, and, and Nathan Zimberoff was wonderful, you know.  The only thing I never got to do my solo on the--I had prepared this wonderful solo.  I don't know what happened that I--and (singing) and oh, I was gonna play this great (laughter) double bass solo on the program, but no, I, I just lived on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], way on the South Side and had to go down to the Fisher Building [Chicago, Illinois] downtown.

Speaker 1: Well before we get into your adult life, your experience with segregation only came when you went to the South for the summer?
Speaker 2: That's, that's my first memory, yeah and, and yeah 'cause I had great times and when I was at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I was in the--as I said in the or-, I was also in the jazz band as well as the concert orchestra and I was in the--after school we studied radio and, and on the--I was studying for theater, not just--I had problems in, in California when I went to the Geller school of theatre arts [Geller Theatre Workshop, Los Angeles, California], not that it was a problem, it's just that there was nothing for me to do and they were doing--well at one point they were gonna do 'Pygmalion' [George Bernard Shaw] and though I was teaching everyone the cockney accent balmy (unclear), you know and, but I couldn't play Eliza Doolittle and then they'd--and, and of course there was the Irish brogue, and they were doing an Irish--and I was helping people get their brogue correct, but I couldn't be in the performance, and I remember one of the reasons I took the radio workshop when I was at Illinois was the very fact that I said--and they were giving you accents, and you said, well I just (unclear) wants to study all these accents, because my reasoning was, well if I don't get on television or movies they won't be able to see me on radio so you know I will practice all these accents and then you know but as things happened, they happened you know.
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna jump forward, but then I'm gonna jump way back.  I'm gonna jump forward to make this connection.  Do you think that's why you were so successful in crossing over and the first African American woman to do a crossover voiceover because you studied all of these accents and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then that your voice had no black dialect?
Speaker 2: I had, I had in fact I went--well one of the jobs I got when I was in, in--I got a job as a receptionist at the Internal Revenue [Internal Revenue Service] when I was still in Chicago [Illinois], when I was, you know, going to school and people use to come in after they had spoken to me on the phone and they'd be in shock 'cause they sent me way on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I was the only black person in the entire office.  It's a big Internal Revenue office and I was the one who was on the phone answering the phone, and when people would come in they'd say, "No, no you're not the person I spoke to."  I'd say, "Yes, you spoke to me," and, and that's and somebody else told me once, "Well you don't, you don't sound black."  I said, "I sound like I sound, and I am so I must sound bla-," you know what I mean?
Story_ID: 357458
Speaker 1: I wanna just talk about that briefly for a moment, then we're gonna go back in history--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but--people saying that to you--okay, we'll just go back to age nine.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In your drama--you started to take drama lessons.  I won't even probe that sounding white thing I mean it's neither here nor there.  You gave a sufficient answer saying that you sound the way you sound and that's the end of it.
Speaker 2: And if you look like somebody says well that's not--said something about my--when I went on 'Another World' that it was not a black story li-, a black story line, I had a story line.  I said when I walk on the screen that's automatically a black story line, (laughter), you know what I mean?  It's our story and, and I was married to a police detective who got shot, well, well you didn't have to make a--the black police detectives all over--you know what I mean?  That, that--we did a whole article on that in one of the union magazines so many, many years ago a young woman from Chicago [Illinois] had said that she went for a commercial and they said, "But you don't sound black," and I have another wonderful story again (laughter), that--I won't name the, the person but I was with the Young Playwrights [Young Playwrights Festival] committee at the Dramatists Guild [Dramatists Guild of America] where the young playwrights up to nineteen years old can send in their plays and get critiqued and if they win, they get really professional productions with the Equity Actors [Actors' Equity Association] (unclear), and from wherever they live we bring them in so they can see a professional production done (unclear) and this one woman lived somewhere in the Midwest, Minnesota or some place, and that she sent in this play and apparently they liked it and she was talking about Haleians [ph.], and they had invited her to be one of the people to come and they discovered when she came that she was African American, and this person, who you would know if I named said, "Yeah but she, she didn't sound--we didn't know that you know--," I'm, I'm the only black on the committee now and I started laughing.  I just started laughing, and she said, "Did I say something foolish?"  I said, "She sounded from someone from Minnesota I guess," you know, "if she grew up there, went to school there, that's what she--," you know (laughter), "that's what she sounded like," (laughter).  It's, it's you know so anyway, but I'm, I'm sure my roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll got me started in something--but, but my aunts told me that I, I always had very good speech she said.  My, my Aunt Hattie [Hattie Cobbins Gray] told me that.

Speaker 1: So at age nine, who introduced you to theater or to a-, to drama, to acting?
Speaker 2: That was Susan Porche [Susan Porche Lawson].
Speaker 1: How did it happen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She did, she did a play and I, I forgot the name of the play, but I was the Spirit of Spring, and I went around and I touched all the little flowers and they bloomed and I touched the crocuses and they bloomed, and then I, I started writing poetry about that time and you know in those days they had programs every Sunday some church or they have a tea or this or that and I became a sort of a (laughter) sought after little nine or ten year old and especially when I started doing my own poetry because you know it was getting rights to stuff and she has this dramatic flair and my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] was always taking me off to some place where I'd been invited to speak and I use to ask my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy], "Didn't it bother you," you know and sometimes she would buy--I'd get an extra dress or something and I said, "Did, did it ever bother you, you know that I was going and doing these things, or I got an extra dress or something when you didn't?"  She said, "No, I was just so happy it wasn't me," (laughter), so we, you know we're, but we're the best of pals right now, I and--
Speaker 1: So do you remember any of those poems you--can you recite anything you wrote when you--back then?
Speaker 2: I have a book, you know, I have--my first book was twenty-six poems called 'A String of Pearls' [ph.].  I was about twelve at the time.  The Reverend A.E. Williams [Alvin E. Williams], the one who I told you came to the church [Woodlawn Union Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], he was responsible for that book--the collection of poems being published.
Speaker 1: Your favorite of the twenty-six?
Speaker 2: Gads, it's been so long.
Speaker 1: Well when we come back you can read from the book.  So when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember putting one when my mother passed in the, in, in her obit [obituary].  There's a poem in one--the poems in the book was, my mother to me is the whole wide world you know, more (making sounds), more precious and for whatever, and I put this in her in the obit, you know.  It's all kinds of stuff in there; I even invented a brother (laughter).
Story_ID: 357460
Speaker 1: Why do you think you were--or what made you think you could become an actress or to pursue acting and music and poetry?  Who else were you seeing do the same things?
Speaker 2: Well the people I was seeing doing it were not necessarily people that I wanted to emulate, but I found later that I ha-, there's a cousin in our family.  I don't know if you know the name [HistoryMaker] Jeni LeGon?  She actually was the first person around to contract MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc., Los Angeles, California].  She's the only woman ever to dance with Bojangles [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson] on screen.  In fact they just, she lives in Canada now and she was inducted into the Tap Dance Hall of Fame [International Tap Dance Hall of Fame] about two years ago along with Fred Astaire and other people and they did a documentary ['Jeni LeGon: Living in a Great Big Way'] on her, a prize-winning documentary.  I'll show it to you next time you come, and so I heard about this cousin who was out in Hollywood and doing things and I remember she came, she was married to Phil Moore at the time.  She came to visit in Chicago [Illinois], she was from Chicago, but they had moved I guess to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] or New York [New York] or some place, and they were giving a party for her at the Polks' and I remember that they--my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] didn't go but they let me stay up late, and I was sitting in a room by myself, but they let me stay up because I wanted to meet this movie star, you know, and they told her about my being in there and she, she said she's waiting up 'cause she wants to meet you and (unclear) and I remember her coming in there and sitting and just taking some time to talk to me and all of that, and here all of a sudden she's like big news again.  She's been here and stayed a couple of times.  Teddy [Teddy Williams] has met her and you know we talk it's like all of a sudden she's--people are talking about Jeni LeGon again, it's, it's wonderful.  She's been here two or three times in the last two or three years and so the story when I went to California she sort of took me under her wing.
Speaker 1: Right, and she was the one who helped you get into a play there I think, or two?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met Nick Stewart--
Speaker 1: Nick Stewart.
Speaker 2: --through her.  I met (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well we're gonna, that's jumping ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll go back, I wanna go back to when you met her that night and she stays up and talks to you.  Did that in-, did you go to sleep thinking, okay, I'm gonna move to Hollywood?
Speaker 2: No, no, she gave me this autographed picture, which I carried in my notebook and sh-, opened it and was showing it to everybody and my teacher, "This is my cousin," you know (laughter), oh yeah.  So that, and I think that it spurred me on but I knew then, I, I always knew but that was helpful for me to know that this was a possibility.

Speaker 1: Did you know that, that, that minstrel shows had existed, like that they had toured, like Rabbit Foot Minstrel [Rabbit's Foot Minstrels], or Ma Rainey or Bessie Smith (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know that, about them but I, I did recall as I said in an interview some years ago I remember as a kid seeing the 'Our Gang,' or whomever it was and I just remember one specific thing and I think they had shown it on TV when they went back and were showing these clips and I said, they had a clip on there where that everyone's trying to get away running from somebody.  They've done some mischief and there's one, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Buckwheat.
Speaker 2: Buckwheat and everybody's running away and there's some wet cement there and Buckwheat gets stuck in the cement.  Everybody manages had to extricate themselves, they all get stuck.  Even the little dog gets stuck and the dog ex-, somebody had to come and get Buckwheat.  (Laughter) I said now kids, you know, you ask yourself why Buckwheat, why couldn't he get out of there, you know.  It's (laughter) well what can I say, but my focus was always on the person doing something that I wanted, you know, to emulate, if, if I was looking at a--I need to get something different than this.  I had my handkerchief earlier I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Continue on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh you know everybody was into I guess you'd call it culture at that time so even though we didn't always get to see them we always knew when people came to town, like see Dorothy Maynor or of course Marian Anderson, and the Dark Angel of the Violin.  Oh, I remember that--that's what they called him [Eddie South], Dark Angel of the Violin, and those were the, the people that, you even if you just heard the recordings or something, you know.
Story_ID: 357462
Speaker 1: I remember the first time I saw Lena Horne, but by that time I knew what I wanted to do or anything, but it was such an inspiration, you know.
Speaker 2: Where were you?  Where did it happen?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: Where were you and how did it happen?
Speaker 1: It--I was in Chicago [Illinois] when she came and she was doing--it was during the war I think and it was--I remember at a place around the corner not too far from us and, and I remember being in there and standing, but she was on the stage.  I wish I could remember what it was for, but that was the first I got to see her so, and many times I saw her in club settings after that, but this was not a club setting, but I do, or I did, a great takeoff on Lena Horne because--and they say, you know, that's the sincerest form of flattery.  I did a show called the 'Leonard Bernstein Theatre Songs' ['Leonard Bernstein's Theatre Songs'] where I did a takeoff on her and the critics said, "It's a shame that the best number in the show was a takeoff of somebody else," (laughter).  I, I guess I just loved all those movements that she had, the little foot, and the way she enunciated words and the same thing with Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett].  I always--the first time I heard Della Reese sing she sang 'In The Still Of the Night,' and I had never heard a pop singer enunciate so clearly, (singing) in the still of the night while the world is in slumber, and I used to play it over and over, and over you know and everybody else was playing maybe Billy Eckstine.  I was playing Della Reese over and over (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well did you look up to people like [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt?  Did you know who she was, was her music popular at the time?
Speaker 1: (Singing in Turkish); (singing), "Santa baby, hurry down the chimney tonight."  Yes, now that tell you something (laughter)?
Speaker 2: So how did you get--
Speaker 1: I would play her over when she came out I was just wiped out the first time I heard her on the radio.  I couldn't wait to get out and get it, and that's where I would spend my money on records like that if I wasn't spending it on, on West Indian music, the Mighty Sparrow or somebody.  I was spen-, you know and then I'd play it over and over, and when I first heard Eartha Kitt that she was doing this Turkish song, and I was going to be determined to learn this song, oh yeah, and then I went out and bought the record of her--I think it was the first, they did a series after that where she did this song 'Monotonous.'  I probably still have it up here on the shelf some place but I had went out and got that.  No when I, I fall in love with, with a talent, I, I (laughter)--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So all those inf-, it's all influences for me, including my cousin Jeni [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon], you know, not that I ever became the kind of-- a dancer, I became a singer who could move well (laughter).

Speaker 1: You're at the Chicago School of Music [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and they're training you.  What happens after that, do you get a scholarship to Illinois State University [Normal, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact that's one of the reasons I never went downstate.  That's--now speaking of experiencing the prejudice.  I didn't know it at the time but then when you look back on it you understand that, that's what was going on because I was an exceptional student and I came out in the upper--I came out ahead of my class actually.  I came out a half year ahead and, in the upper tenth of my class, and one day, one of the young men, in fact he played oboe in the orchestra and I've never, I said--he comes in later in the day, and so, "Where were you, where've you been?"  He's been off taking a test for a scholarship, and then I found out that different ones were getting out at least--'cause high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] was very mixed.  There were about as many white as there were black if not more, and the white kids were all going off taking these exams for scholarships and we weren't even being told about them, and I regretted it.  You know, I've thought about it many, many times since, you know, that I wasn't, I wasn't even and my parents [Gussie Cobbins Perkins and Oscar Perkins] didn't know, you know, where or how.  Today parents know all--these things but they had never been coun-, they were just so happy I was go- you know, going to college, but they didn't know how to get a scholarship for me.  It was a matter of trying to save enough.  'Course today that would be impossible just to try to save enough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Save enough.
Speaker 2: --(unclear) you know.
Speaker 1: But--
Story_ID: 357464
Speaker 1: That brings up something because we talked about your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] working for Stanley [Stanley Home Products], but we didn't talk about your father's [Oscar Perkins] barbershop.  Now he was able to get enough money to buy one in Chicago [Illinois], and he had his own place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--the first--they along with my Uncle James [James C. Cobbins] that I told you that was my [maternal] grandfather's [John Cobbins] brother and he always lived in Chicago and he was a Pullman porter.  He owned a house and he was considered, he was a trustee of the church, he was big time, you know.  He and another couple from the church and my parents bought a laundromat first.  So they were always trying to, you know, and then it was later that my, my father acquired the shop.  He always worked in a shop or at home.  We had a back porch, many a haircut was done on our back porch, you know (laughter), but then he finally yeah he did acquire a shop and the day that he had the heart attack was he had decided to sell the shop, he was retiring.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go to the shop?
Speaker 2: Oh my dear when I came home, when I would come home when I was on the soap [soap opera] 'cause everything had to stop at three o'clock for 'Another World.'  If, whoever--you have to watch this soap and so I remember the first time I came home, I went around to the shop, and my dad was out in front of the shop.  "Hey Joe [ph.]," he's calling people and people are sticking their heads out the window and he's going, "Here she is, here she is," (laughter).  So he wanted to prove, this is my daughter.  My mother said she had the same thing sometime with Stanley and she'd be there at a certain time of day.  She said would you mind turning on--and she'd, "Yeah, Peggy [ph.], that's my daughter."  "Oh, you mean your play daughter?"  They--and you know, sh-, everybody has a mother, she--what do you mean you don't think she has a--I guess nobody wanted (laughter) to but I'll never forget my dad saying, "Here she is," (laughter), yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember the people that came to the house for haircuts on the back porch, the sorts of things that they would talk about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that most of the time they, after they got their hair cut, they'd say, "Could I pay you next week?" (Laughter) And my dad he would get so upset.  He said, "Now he knew he didn't have the money to pay.  Why didn't he tell me," (laughter).  Oh, poor thing I--you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: We're gonna change tapes.
Speaker 2: Egads, and they would wait 'til they had a head full of hair (laughter).
Story_ID: 357465
Speaker 1: My dad [Oscar Perkins] was the kind of barber who didn't--you know, he didn't put a saucer on your head.  Every haircut was for you. See I called him a hair designer and I--'cause he would spend the longest time and, and I use--that's another rock, I use to watch him on the piano.  I was fascinated with how he used the shears (making sounds), you know, and he, he took his time and no haircut was just alike.  Every hair-, and I think that's why people wanted to come to him. They would wait, they would wait until he was available because they knew that it was gonna be a special haircut just for them.
Speaker 2: What were your father's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was artistic, he could sit here and draw, draw your picture and it would look just like you know, that you see the guys out on the street, that's the way my dad could draw.
Story_ID: 357466
Speaker 1: Were your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] and father [Oscar Perkins] political people at all?  Were they involved in politics or community activities or--?
Speaker 2: My mother used to get up at five o'clock every election day and be at the polls.  She was a judge or clerk or poll watcher or something (laughter), always knew when it was some kind of political--my mother would be up and out of the house before dawn; had to get to the polls for her, her duty.
Speaker 1: Did they talk to you about voting at home, the, the--did they talk about voting?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Because we had two different parties in our house (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were you Communist (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We were always on my mom--my mother came from the South where there were people like Bill Beau [ph.] and, and you know they'd get up in [U.S.] Congress and call us animals and this--that's all she knew about the Democratic Party and she, she could just not bring herself, you know, and we never knew whether she ever switched.  We would tease her later--like when Kennedy [John Fitzgerald Kennedy] came and between him and Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon], we'd say, "How did you vote?"  She would never tell you, you know, but I know when we were growing up that, that was always--like I say we had a two-party house that--my mother would just say, she could not bring herself to vote for, you know--because what people don't realize today, all of those people there who are calling themselves Republicans now became Republicans when the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] was passed. That's when the Dixiecrats came along.  Strom Thurmond was a Democrat then he became a Dixiecrat, then he became a Republican because everybody was--when the Civil Rights Act was passed and the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] and everybody started switching from Democrat to Republican and, and these people have to know their political history, you know?

Speaker 1: What sorts of thing-, what sorts of reading materials were in the home and I'm talking about when you were from a kid to the point you were at Chicago, Chicago's School of Music [Chicago School of Music, Chicago, Illinois], what sort of reading materials were around?
Speaker 2: Oh, actually I had more than anybody in the house and I'll tell you why.  My mother's [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] sister worked as what they call on the place.  When you work on the place you stay there and then you're off one day and she and, and her husband were a team and then whenever they would discard books or this and that and the other she'd bring them over to the house and I had in, in our room, my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] and I always had our own room and the--my--the bookcases were lined up with these books and I started giving out library cards to my, my friends and my--I had this little desk somebody had brought that in.  I guess they brought that from over there, too.  I have this desk, and I had set up my library cards, and my friends from the, the school, the neighborhood and the block, mostly on the block would come and borrow a book and sometimes they would keep it overtime just so they could give me a penny, you know (laughter).  So I had a regular little thing going, and my sister use to complain that--we were supposed to be in bed, I'd be up with the door cracked where the light would come in so that I could keep reading or I could--I don't know where she sat, she said I had a flashlight that I had under the covers and I would read to--.  I remember baby, they called me baby sister, and: "Baby sister won't turn out," "Baby sister's reading," and I'd read, and sometimes they'd have to come and drag me into dinner.  I, I just was a voracious reader.

Speaker 2: As an entertainer?  We used to go to the Regal Theater on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], and I don't know how much of a child I was, I must've been old enough to go to the Regal, but the people that I remember just being absolutely awed by--Sammy Davis, Jr., you know, oh yes, I just thought he was incredible, and then you didn't know that many black people who could impersonations too, he was, he was, you know, I know he did great impersonations.
Speaker 1: Who did he impersonate?
Speaker 2: Oh he could Cary Grant, I mean all the movie he did, he was wonderful and besides you know the dancing and the singing but then he could do these impersonations, and Moms Mabley (laughter).
Speaker 1: Moms Mabley (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We weren't supposed to, people would sneak the records.  We weren't supposed to hear some of her stuff (laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause she was X-rated (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Moms Mabley.
Speaker 2: Yeah so they did--we'd have to sneak, we have some little parties and we'd sneak the records, "Come over here."
Speaker 1: Talk to me about the Regal Theater, was it a black theater in Chicago because it was on the South Side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that's where saw--it's like it's like the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] here for us for in Chicago it was the Regal.  All the great entertainers came to the Regal, yeah. The same thing, and sometime, and, and they would go to downtown where they had a movie, like I think it was the Oriental [Oriental Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], you know, but we didn't get there that much, the Regal was on the South Side, see.

Speaker 2: No, I can't remember the first black person, but I can remember the first black movie where the--all the black people were.  We went to see 'Gone with the Wind,' and I do a takeoff on that, I don't know nothing about raising no--birthing no baby, but there were, there was a--in the neighborhood, where we went there was double bills and every now and then you saw a black movie, and you could probably only see it at this theater.
Speaker 1: Can you remember some of those movies though like the titles of them?  I remember like, like 'Pork Chop Heaven' was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my cousin [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon] I was telling you about she was, she was in a couple of those movies.
Speaker 1: Because I remember one was 'Pork Chop Heaven' and I, I mean I'm just thinking a documentary that was done about--because at one time there were, there--I mean there were more black distribution companies then than there are now.  So far more black movies were being.
Speaker 2: Yeah 'cause black people were doing their own--yeah they had to.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're doing your own movies you were distributing to your own black theaters--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --so you had, you know, you, like almost like Tyler Perry, you know you had your network--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you were, you were out there doing your thing.  So I'm just wondering if you can remember any of those movies that came through town?
Speaker 2: No, I, I really don't and my father [Oscar Perkins] was a big movie buff.  We used to go to the movies, but went to see the regular movies, but every once and a while you'd see a movie that had a black cast, but (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have to sit in the balcony at this--when you went to the movie theater?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no--not, not in Chicago [Illinois] you didn't. Unh-uh.  If you--but some places you didn't go.  You know, it's like they say, de facto.  You just, you just and then you're not to go. Like we lived on, on Evans Avenue and then there was Cottage Grove [Avenue], which was a huge cross street, and on the other side of Cottage Grove you started going into Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  Well, you knew once you crossed Cottage Grove you were in some other territory, you know what I mean?  And there was a great Tivoli Theater [Chicago, Illinois] right across the street, and I think I was out of high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] before I went in the Tivoli Theater, it was just a block from me.  It's, you know, it's things like that.  The University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] is in Hyde Park, you know, on the Midway.  It's almost like crossing the tracks.  It wasn't the tracks just crossing a street and you're in another neighborhood (laughter), but we always went to that, we had that neighborhood theater.  It's called the Langley Theater [Chicago, Illinois]. And sometimes we'd go and--I remember the same little guy was there for years and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] and I would sit there and watch movies over and over and my dad would come get us and the guy would come down (laughter) and then drag us out.  My dad would be standing there (laughter).

Speaker 1: So after high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] you joined the Center Aisle Players of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you--can you talk to us about the group?
Speaker 2: They have all, all sorts of people: social workers, postal workers, teachers, you know I mean it's a hobby it's a thing of release for them.
Speaker 1: So it was community theatre?
Speaker 2: It was community theatre, and it was very good community theatre and, and it mainly did comedies and there was another group there called the Skyloft Players.  I know you know Lynn Hamilton, she was with the Skyloft Players. I remember first time I saw her I guess why she was a magnificent actress and, and I was with the Skyloft Players, and, and I did 'The Heiress' [Augustus Goetz and Ruth Goetz] there, I did 'Hay Fever' [Noel Coward].  I, I got to be kind of a leading lady and when I decided I was leaving town 'cause I was going to be in the theater and they said, "Somebody ought to talk to that girl," (laughter).  I mean (laughter) two or three of us came out and then we left (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Talk to her about what, what did that--
Speaker 2: About, tell her--give her sense, go get a job (laughter).  She says she's leaving town, she's going, she's going to Broadway (laughter) and those--some of those same people are there now.  My sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] goes to--they, they, they are still doing this.  The Center Aisle Players is still going on, you know, and my sister goes to see their shows and Lester Chung played opposite me in a show there and he but came over to co-director and he, he's there he came to see 'Having Our Say' ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann] when I was in Chicago, and it's just, it's just amazing to me that, that it's been going on for over forty years or fifty years, you know, it's just--I don't know that the Skyloft Players are still there, but Center Aisle Players are still there.
Speaker 1: Are they still doing good work?
Speaker 2: Yes, my sister says that they just--and of course now you had to leave.  I mean if you were serious when I left you had to leave because that's what it mostly was for a hobby.  Now they--I--you could perhaps stay there and make (unclear).  You have a--the eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], Abena Brown [HistoryMaker Abena Joan P. Brown] has a wonderful theater there they, they own a lot of big space and they're doing great work there and sometimes they have a collaboration with the New Federal Theatre [New York New York] here, [HistoryMaker] Woodie King, Jr., but at the time with Gloria Foster, they were at Goodman [Goodman Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] and Lynn Hamilton I believe she did the 'The Duchess of Malfi' [John Webster] in, in whiteface, and 'Malfi,' you know, it just was nothing--and if you went to Goodman once you left there, there was nothing for you to do.
Story_ID: 357471
Speaker 1: Were you aware of theater, like Paul Robeson doing, what was it?  'Caesar,' what was it, his great--'Emperor Jones' ['The Emperor Jones'].
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I, I didn't--I wasn't aware of him doing it at the time, but I did see him in a movie and I don't remember what the movie was but I remember seeing Paul Robeson in a movie, and of course we, we had records of Paul Robeson and he was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Singing?
Speaker 2: Yeah he was in another one who come through that, on that list of people that, that you were aware of, you know.  'Emperor Jones,' I wasn't aware of 'til later, later in life, but I was aware of Paul Robeson.  I remember seeing him in a movie but it--he--it was not an all-black movie, but he was one of the center pieces of it.  I'm gonna have to check that out, and I'd like to find out, go through the list of his movies.
Speaker 1: So we--
Speaker 2: Oh, and I did see my, my cousin Jeni [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon] did a show with Eddie Cantor and where she was dancing and carrying on and I saw her, and--oh, sh-, with--'Stormy Weather' with Bill Bojangles [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With Lena Horne?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she was in that.
Story_ID: 357472
Speaker 1: So this will be, will be a good place for us to stop with your younger years because now we're up to the point where you gonna move to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with cousin Jeni [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon] and that starts your professional career.  Would you--is that correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah well I joined--my first Equity [Actors' Equity Association] job really started there 'cause I came here [New York, New York] with 'Fly Blackbird.'  I met Nick Stewart there.  You know Nick Stewart?  I had known--now his man who played--this is I tell you I'll--see I start--
Speaker 1: Go ahead, go ahead.
Speaker 2: This man played lightning, remember on (unclear) ah (unclear), you know you would think he was--this was a brilliant, talented man.  He was a composer, he would--I was in a play of his.  That's one of the best things I ever did, beautiful music he wrote.  You would never know it, but that's what you had to do.  Like they tell me Stepin Fetchit was a brilliant man.  Hattie McDaniel laughed her way to the bank, you know what I mean so but you were fo-, and I guess that's the reason I said that.  I wasn't seeing people doing what I knew.  I knew in my--what I wanted to do with my head (unclear), but I was amazed when I met Nick Stewart and found out all that he was capable of 'cause that's all I knew about him was having seen him on 'Amos 'n' Andy.'
Story_ID: 357473
Speaker 1: When did you pick up the guitar then?  Was that after you had moved to Chic-, to Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I, and I was just playing it because you'd go down to Kawai [Kawai Musical Instruments Manufacturing Co., Ltd.], you'd pick up a cheap guitar (laughter).
Speaker 1: But that comes later in your life also?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then I got, I got serious about it when I came here [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you did a couple of folk songs?
Speaker 2: And I took--yeah, and I took lessons.
Speaker 1: But we'll talk about those later. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we--I think we've covered the earlier years, but one thing on--before we stop, I want you, you know of the thing--of those early years the things that--the years that sort of the clayma-, forming that's made you who you are who stands out as being some of the people that has had the most influence on you up to this point in your life, before you, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, to start with, my, my--see when I went to elementary school [McCosh Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], there were like three black teachers in, in the school.  They were tough, oh Ms. McNeil [ph.] was so tough. And half the people--you know half the people don't sing 'Star Spangled Banner' correctly?  She--there's one note that everybody and my sister [Hattie L. Murphy] and I sit and listen all that 'cause Mrs. McNeil made you learn that 'Star Spangled Banner' ['The Star Spangled Banner'] and, and there was Minnie Rose, she wasn't tough but she was wonderful.  She's the one who inspired me.  She wrote on my report card once and told my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins], "Your, your child excels in poetry writing," and blah, blah, blah.  She always told me I was a wonderful writer.  So she, you know I, I remember she wrote and she had great big writing (laughter) you know.  I never really had Ms. McNeil, my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] had her, but we always talk about that, that they were the toughest on us, you know, and as you can understand why, you know, because we were, we were always told that you gotta be twice if you--I don't know if you've heard that phrase before but that's what we kind of told it--
Speaker 1: What's the phrase?
Speaker 2: You have to be twice as good as anybody.  In other words, don't think you're gonna make it on a C.  If everybody else can make it on a C you gotta get an E and if that--because that's the way it was in this world, you know.  You had to be twice as good as a white person to be in the same spot, you know.  I remember Vinnette Carroll told me that her mother told her and then they were from, she was from Jamaica, her parents [Florence Morris Carroll and Edgar Edgerton] were.  She told--and I thought it was a wonderful thing and I've repeated it many times since to other people.  She said, "Be sure you are so prepared, and that you know everything that you're supposed to know and you know you're, you know, there's nothing impediment in your way until you come out if you don't get what you're after, you have to know what's your color," don't make it the first thing (unclear).  It, it--you have to say it's gotta be that.  Isn't that great (laughter)?  I love that (laughter).

Speaker 1: No, leaving Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --going to California, about what year?  Just an estimate of when that happened?
Speaker 2: Oh, around '58 [1958], '59 [1959], um-hm.
Speaker 1: So let's say in 1959 you arrive in California?
Speaker 2: No it's before '59 [1959] it had to before (unclear)--when I did my first big hit it was 1959 yeah so, it was right out of school, '57 [1957] or '58 [1958] (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you arrive in Los Angeles [California] to be with your Aunt Mattie [Mattie William (ph.)], who's known as Bill.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: And at this time you've done all of the school work, I mean that you, you're interest in theater and acting had already blossomed?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so talk to me about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I still had a year to go in school, but I was kind of anxious to get started, you know.
Speaker 1: So talk to me about the early days of your earl-, start--the early start to your career in California, what your cousin did for you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well and [HistoryMaker] Jeni LeGon had her own troupe of dancers of young people and she did clubs, clubs over in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], et cetera and so when I came she took me under her wing and she wanted to make me part of her troupe, but I was not a dancer, and so I became the singer of, of the group, and it was fun, it was really fun, it was like a new kind of thing for me where I was in the community theatre [in Chicago, Illinois] and doing all the dramatic stuff, and here I was doing musicals and singing and all of that and so anyway she introduced me to, she knew most of the people, especially people of color, in the business she introduced me to Nick Stewart.  Well she had done some 'Amos 'n' Andy' segments herself and, and of course she knew Nick Stewart.  Nick Stewart had a place called the Ebony Showcase Theater [Los Angeles, California], and they did wonderful things there and very fine actors worked there, Equity Actors' [Actors' Equity Association] and--anyway Nick wrote a musical called 'Carnival Island,' Nick was a wonderful composer.  I just discovered all kinds of surprises when I met him, having only seen him on 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  He's a wonderful composer and there was just that he had written a musical called 'Carnival Island,' and I was cast in the musical and was even choreographed for the dance as well as my singing and later on as the musical be-, grew Georgia Carr, who was at that time a very noted singer, she was in the show, but I later on took over the lead in the show when the lead left and so that was, that was a wonderful beginning, and then later at the same Ebony Showcase I did a, I did a play called 'Paper on the Wind' and in that show as Bernie Hamilton [Bernard Hamilton], Juanita Moore, Joel Llewellyn [ph.], these were all marvelous, fine actors, and that time Juanita Moore was nominated for an Oscar [Academy Award], and here I am working with these people.
Story_ID: 358041
Speaker 1: You know, it was just a wonderful time for me.  In the meantime I was working in the day at Golden State Insurance Company [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company].  I couldn't just come out there, you know, and do nothing. And fortunately you could do that because you could do these rehearsals at night and I--a lot of us had to have other jobs just as many people do right here in New York [New York] all the time, you know, and so that's, that's--I worked pretty steadily, and then I don't remember how I found out about it but these, these--it travels, it's like a network and C. Bernard Jackson and James V. Hatch, who has written several books on theater, wrote this play called 'Fly Blackbird,' which was one of the first protest shows that I had seen, where you talked about color problems and et cetera and they had really--both of them worked at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and so had really been cast for most of the people there and then when they brought it out the cast was filling out and I auditioned and I got the part of the young lead, you know, young fiery lead and it, it was a wonderful glorious and by that to my voice was really growing and I was studying, I was studying with Florence Russell out in Beverly Hills [California] who was an instructor for all the stars and what have you, and all these things sort of came together.  I can't even remember who sent me to who, but anyway I found myself studying with Florence Russell and my voice just really improved and--
Speaker 2: How was Los Angeles [California] as far as being an African American actor in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: You more or less had to--I don't know what we would have done if there hadn't been that Ebony Showcase Theater [Los Angeles, California], you know?  I'm telling you the caliber of person who was working there.  You didn't get that many movies, but the point is you wanted to keep working.  And though, if you have an affinity for the stage, you never lose that really, you know.
Story_ID: 358042
Speaker 1: When I got cast in 'Fly Blackbird,' which reviews were quite nice (laughter) and when the producer came out, Helen Jacobson came out from Chicago [Illinois], here I'm back in Chicago again, you can get the kid out of Chicago, but you can't Chicago out of the kid, you know.  (Laughter) Anyway when she came out to Los Angeles [California], and she wanted to bring the show back to New York [New York], and of course that was wonderful for Jim Hatch [James V. Hatch] and, and C. Bernard Jack-, Jackson [C. Bernard Jackson], we always called him Jack, and some of them came here with the show that they knew--well say, like Thelma Oliver [Krishna Kaur Khalsa] had already come here with [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr.'s ['Kicks and Company']--oh gads, anyway they had found her in, in, in Los Angeles and so she was no longer in the show there, she had already come here, and she was cast in the show, but I came on my own because I didn't know whether I'd be cast or not.  I knew that the writers wanted me, et cetera, so this was gonna be my big move.  Finally I was gonna get a chance to move to New York and I had a reason for coming, 'cause there was a show in the offing.  And so I, I, I made that, that step and followed the show to New York.  As it turned out I didn't get cast in the lead, but I got cast in the show. That was my first real awakening to show business (laughter), you know.  You would just think if you had created a role and gotten that kind of reviews that it would be the next step, moving on to the next step.
Speaker 2: What theater did 'Blackbird' play in here in New York?
Speaker 1: It played in a theater called the Mayfair [Mayfair Theatre, New York, New York], which was at the--in the Mayfair Hotel [New York, New York] at the time and I think it was 45th Street [sic. 46th Street], if I'm not mistaken, and it was considered off-Broadway because of the number of seats, but it was right there between 8th Avenue and Broadway, (laughter) so actually I was here on Broadway, lucked out it was actually an off-Broadway show, and it won the Obie [Off-Broadway Theater Awards], really, yeah, for best off-Broadway musical.
Story_ID: 358043
Speaker 1: Right after the--when I did my first Broadway show, which was 'Tambourines to Glory' [Langston Hughes], the director of 'Fly Blackbird,' Jerome Eskow, he came opening night and he said, "I guess we just missed it, what is it we didn't see about her?"  (Laughter) They didn't think I could, you know, hold the role here, but it, it's all good lessons, you know.
Speaker 2: So, when did you, how did the 'Tambourines' come about, that, that show?  How did you get the role, do you remember--?
Speaker 1: My darling Langston Hughes had seen us in Los Angeles [California], and at one point he told me later he, he enjoyed Thelma Oliver [Krishna Kaur Khalsa] and myself so much he says, "I'm gonna write a show for you guys."  He said he was gonna write a show for me--never got around to doing it, but anyway 'Tambourines' was one way of doing it because I had--right after I did 'Fly Blackbird' I got a temporary office job, which if I don't how many of us would make it (laughter) if that were not in the offing and then I was cast in 'Brecht on Brecht' ['Brecht on Brecht: An Improvisation,' Samuel French] which was going to Washington, D.C., and I was told that it would be there for about two weeks and we stayed eleven weeks and somehow or other I again--well (laughter) free to believe it, I have to show you the reviews myself, but anyway I, I came off very, very well in that show, and so when I had came back to New York [New York], the, the news was out and we opened again at Sheridan Square [Sheridan Square Playhouse, New York, New York], and right after that they were--started casting 'Tambourines to Glory,' and I was sent to audition, and that's when I, I--I had it backwards, I sang for--yeah, I sang for the composer [Jobe Huntley] 'cause he's never heard me sing and then when I went they were finding a script for me to read and the producer said, "What is she reading for us for? She doesn't have to read for us," you know, which is the greatest compliment anybody can pay you, you know, and of course with Langston it was just readymade (laughter), you know, the big smile on his face and that's how I got cast in that, my very first Broadway roll and that was another experience with actors that I just had admired and--well I had first worked with [HistoryMaker] Robert Guillaume in 'Fly Blackbird,'  and now here I was playing opposite him in 'Tambourines to Glory,' Louis Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] was in it Hilda Simms was in it, Rosetta LeNoire was playing my mother [Essie Belle Johnson] and she played my mother on television later.  Oh, it was just, just a marvelous cast and Clara Ward, the Clara Ward Singers [The Famous Ward Singers].  It was a wonderful cast and a wonderful time, you know.
Story_ID: 358044
Speaker 1: So, to just step back a little, the 'Brecht on Brecht' ['Brecht on Brecht: An Improvisation,' Samuel French], the play, 'Brecht on Brecht.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Wasn't that--[HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne was also in that show (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Roscoe Lee Browne--it was my first time working with Roscoe Lee Brown in which was quite, quite wonderful and he came back to New York [New York] with it, too, we both were, were in the New York production and later on I worked with Roscoe when he was directing 'A Hand Is on the Gate' when I was standing by after all the women in the show which is--they were all quite different.  So that was a challenge and that's, that's wonderful.
Story_ID: 358045
Speaker 1: So opening night on Broadway with 'Tambourines' ['Tambourines to Glory,' Langston Hughes], can you take me back to that evening and what it felt like for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's almost like a whirlwind, it's almost--I can't remember it, but I do remember this, the director [Jerome Eskow] of 'Fly Blackbird' coming and dancing with me and I'll never forget those--I think that's the most memorable part of that night to me (laughter), saying, "What--how did we miss it?" (Laughter) You know, but when something like--it's something that you have dreamt about that you read about in magazines, and I always say that I see myself in these places.  When I was a kid I would project myself in these places and here I was at opening night, a Broadway opening night, and, and so it did--it was quite exciting, quite exciting.
Speaker 1: At the time were there more black themed-plays on Broadway than there are today?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or about the same?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no there weren't many, no.
Speaker 1: There were not many?
Speaker 2: It was the '70s [1970s] when, when we really sort of had a darkening of Broadway, yeah.
Story_ID: 358046
Speaker 1: So after that, after 'Tambourines' ['Tambourines to Glory,' Langston Hughes] on Broadway, you are a bona fide Broadway actress now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you give up the day job [at Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company] and you become a full-time actress?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I had given that up when I went to Washington [D.C.] for those two weeks 'cause when I came back I went right into a show and the things--I have been extremely blessed that's all I can say because I went right--when 'Tambourines to Glory' closed, I was already booked to go out on tour with 'Brecht on Brecht' ['Brecht on Brecht: An Improvisation,' Samuel French] and Lotte Lenya, you know, and I had done really her part in the, the Washington production of 'Brecht on Brecht.'  Now she herself was going out on tour and I was booked to go out on tour with her and later I did the same show with Viveca Lindfors.  I worked with Adler, oh--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Lou?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Lou Adler?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, just, I, I just had good fortune in working with some wonderful people, you know, and learning from those people, you know.
Story_ID: 358047
Speaker 1: So let's talk about you shifting from, and we'll shift back and forth, but you also became a composer and a lyricist.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I had been writing of course poetry since I was like eight years old and I maybe will show you the book ['A String of Pearls' (ph.)] that was published when I was like twelve.  Anyway so I started--it was during that time when everybody was saying what they had to say with folk music and that was just right up my alley, you know, and I couldn't play the guitar that well but if you could get those three or four chords together (laughter), you know, and I just started writing things that I had to say, I started writing songs and then that was during the Vietnam [Vietnam War] era and a lot of people were protesting the war and actually I had--my first attempt at writing a musical was in California with Eddie Beal, and he was gonna be writing the music and I was writing the lyrics, but that never came to be, and that woman [Nora Ephron] who wrote the book has written a book called 'Take it from the Top' ['Revision and Life: Take It From the Top--Again,' Nora Ephron] and that was because of Jeni [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon] and Georgia Carr had put me in touch with them and I had written--oh, I had written this hit song, 'Pink Shoelaces' ['Tan Shoes and Pink Shoelaces'] you know, and I got to meet some wonderful people having written that including Jimmy McHugh, can you believe it.  I think about (singing) a million dollar baby if I--everybody wanted to know--this is a new era, this is a new time, you know, and maybe this young lady knows what it's about. He invited me to his marvelous house, it was (unclear), just to see if there was something we could do together.  I couldn't believe that, I couldn't believe it (laughter).  You know I was singing this man's songs when I was a kid back and here I am sitting with Jimmy McHugh.  It, it and so by the time I started working on actual shows after I got here [New York, New York], I suppose you could--well, I had written for 'Bon Voyage Titanic,' but I had just written some songs for the show, it was like a revue, and I had at least three songs in the show.  I was really cast as a performer, but once, once I was cast I started writing for it.
Story_ID: 358048
Speaker 1: Actually writing shows was when I started working with Vinnette Carroll (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did you meet Vinnette?
Speaker 1: The story I like to tell is I met Vinnette before she ever remembered that she ever met me (laughter) when she came--oh, 'Kicks and Company,' that's the name of the show that [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr. was casting for, and Vinnette Carroll was to be the director, and she came to California looking for actors and that's when she cast (unclear), and when I told her years later I said, "Remember my coming to audition for you?"  She had no recollection of me.  I was not the type she was looking for (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, so we will just pick it up with you meeting Vinnette and she, she didn't remember having--you having auditioned for her (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I di-, I really didn't bring that up to her for, for a while.  When I actually--she came to see me in 'Brecht on Brecht' ['Brecht on Brecht: An Improvisation,' Samuel French], course she really came to see Roscoe [HistoryMaker Roscoe Lee Browne] (laughter) and then she had her own little theater downtown called the Urban Arts Corps.  Lovely, charming, small theater on 20th Street [New York, New York], and [HistoryMaker] Glory Van Scott happened to tell her about my writing music because she did know that I was an actress at that time.
Speaker 1: And a singer?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Did she know you as a singer as well?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Only as an actress?
Speaker 2: Yes she did, yeah she knew me as a singer 'cause she saw a 'Tambourines,' 'Tambourines of Glory' [Langston Hughes] yeah, she saw 'Tambourines of Glory.'
Story_ID: 358049
Speaker 1: But anyway she was working on a show with Glory [HistoryMaker Glory Van Scott], and Glory was going to use some of my music 'cause she--we met e-, we met each other in 'Fly Blackbird' and we were both from Chicago [Illinois] and we sat next to one another in the dressing room and Glory told me later, she says, "I always felt so protective toward you" (laughter) (unclear) I guess 'cause I was just new and coming to New York [New York].  She'd been here, she'd been in a couple of shows and stuff so, but anyway she was working on a show and which Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] was directing, they were working on it at the Urban Arts Corps. In, in the meantime, Vinnette was planning for her next production to do a musical based on Irwin Shaw's 'Bury the Dead,' which was an anti-war piece, and she was looking for someone to do the score and Glory told her, "Well you should hear [HistoryMaker] Micki Grant's work, you should hear some of her songs."  It's at that time I was writing my protest songs and she, she said to Glory, Glory told me that she said, "Well I thought sh-, I know she's an actress," she said, "No, she's a composer, you should, you should really hear some of her music."  And, and Glory was gonna use at least two of my songs in the show that they were working on for her.  So I went down, took my guitar and I went down and I played a couple of songs for her, one of which was called 'Step Lively, Boy,' which was a kind of ironic, sort of protest song about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sing a little of it for me?
Speaker 1: Well, (singing), "Now war is just a way of life and someone's got to do it.  It's good to know a fine young man like you is seeing to it.  Step lively, boy, don't let yourself be cowed, die like a hero make your country proud," and it goes on and on and on about this and that and then it says, now, (singing), "If you ever get to thinking about the things in life you'll miss, maybe you can get a little comfort out of this.  You can't miss what you've never had or been or seen or done, like having kids or making love or turning twenty-one, so step lively, boy, step right up and get your shroud.  Die like a hero; make everybody proud," you know and then (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Great.
Story_ID: 358050
Speaker 1: And actually that became the title for the show ['Step Lively, Boy'] after 'cause once she heard that, and then I did one other number for her with my guitar--'Human Feeling' ['It Takes a Whole Lot of Human Feeling'], and once she heard that, that was it.  We started working together of course--course then I became involved with Glory's show ['Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope'] because then (unclear) she started putting more and more and more music in the show that she was working on with Alan Weeks was co-starring with [HistoryMaker] Glory Van Scott, and she started putting more and more and more of my material because she was using Alex Bradford and his sing-, the Alex Bradford Singers [Alex Bradford and The Bradford Singers] were part of that show, and so she started adding more and more as she heard numbers of mine. And one night I came into rehearsal and Danny Holgate who was musical director when I walked in said, "You wanna--you'd better have a seat."  I said, "What?" He said, "You'd better take a seat because, he said, "we wanna talk to you," and they came in and, and said that Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] had decided she wanted me in the show (laughter) and she said--I guess and she said to me later, she said, "Nobody sings your songs the way you do," (laughter) and so you, you really never know how things are going to take place because that was the last thing on my mind was being in the show and the--she almost staged it that night immediately because it was nothing to do.  I knew the material, and she just set the guitar on stage in back of me like a prop and then sat me on the edge of the stage and had me sing t-, you know, several of the songs and there, one of the reviewers from The Times [The New York Times] saw it, the show at the Urban Arts Corps.  Well we were moving it to the Library of Performing Arts [New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, New York, New York] just for a couple of performances and the day before, I think it was that Thursday, a review came out in The Times.  This rave, rave review and it was about this new composer and this fire and the blah, blah, blah, blah, and when I arrived at the theater the--for the first performance there was this line that had formed all around the corner and I'm saying to myself, what's going on?  I wonder where all these people are going, and it turned out that they were c-, they had read the review and they were coming there to see the show.  A lot of them couldn't even get in that night and then we did it, another performance and it was the weirdest thing because some people couldn't get in and I often wondered if it were these people.  I was--'cause I didn't come until the second act and I was saying, well, you know, "Let them in, why can't--." "No, no one can stand, no one can stand."  It was a young man and his girlfriend and they were a little late and they couldn't get in and right in the middle of performance, I think right in the middle of one of my songs they stopped the show and said there was a bomb threat, (laughter) they had to clear out the theater.  Everybody went out on the street and they stood out there for--the newspapers came down, all the reporters were down, you know, they heard about this bomb threat, and I was more--well, amused than anything.  You weren't getting that kind of (unclear), now today (laughter), you wouldn't, you know, be that surprised, but, anyway later on we went back into the theater and finished the show and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] and, and my brother-in-law happened, just happened to be in town at that particular time.
Story_ID: 358051
Speaker 1: Whose idea was 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope'?  Was that a combination of the two of you, or was that Vinnette's [Vinnette Carroll] or--?
Speaker 2: No, Vinnette's very good at titles, she, that's, she said that's one of the first things, main thing about a title 'cause that's what draws people's attention, but Glory [HistoryMaker Glory Van Scott] when we had this first meeting with the three of us, once I had gone up and sung for her and that then there was a meeting between the three of us when I was gonna get more involved in the show that they were doing.  I don't know what the working title for the show was at the time.  In fact I don't think they had a title and Glory Van Scott told us a joke and it was about this woman on the highway who got stopped and whatever and she flung her head over the steering wheel and said when the police walked up said, "Don't bother me, I can't cope, I can't cope," and so we were using it bantering it back and forth all afternoon as we talked, you know, and, and just using it you know how you do if you find a catch phrase like that and, and--oh, please I can't cope, you know.  And the next day Vinnette called me and she said, "You know I think that's what we should call the show," and I don't know if we had mentioned it the night before 'cause I thought she was joking.  I said, "Don't bother me I can't cope?  We're gonna call--," I said, "You're joking," she says, "No, no I mean it I really think we should call it that," and I said, "Well that means I have to write a title song called 'Don't Both-'--."  And this is what's going through my head (laughter) what am I--which turned out later to be a great exercise, it was a lot of fun to do.
Story_ID: 358052
Speaker 1: Now was that your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: --first big collaboration with her [Vinnette Carroll] that went on to be as successful as it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it didn't, it didn't become--we did two more collaborations before that hit Broadway because we went on to do 'Bury the Dead' [Irwin Shaw], which is what I originally went up there [Urban Arts Corps] for and then we did 'Croesus and the Witch,' which was a fairy tale, which I owe The Times [The New York Times] a lot of thanks for, too, when they said, "Take your family, children, take your--," blah, blah, blah, and anyway so we were constantly working, even while we were working on getting 'Cope' ['Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope'] on.
Story_ID: 358053
Speaker 1: Talking about protest songs and then civil rights songs and you said to me 'Don't Bother, I Can't Cope' ['Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope'] is all about--?
Speaker 2: Ac-, actually what I call it, it is just like a celebration of our sojourn here in the United States of America and the talking about the things that we have done and accomplished and the, and the things that we've had to go through to do it and I think one of the reasons it was such a hit that--that especially among African Americans which is see themselves portrayed in a such a positive, uplifting way on stage you know and I think it was eye opening for a lot of other people who don't know the kinds of contributions we've made, like Daniel Hale Williams performing the first open heart surgery on a kitchen table, you know.  They don't know when they stop at a stop light that it was a black man [Garrett Morgan] who invented, you know, the stoplight that, that a lot of thi-, and I just got great joy out of being able to say--even some of the kids in the show were exposed to things that they, they didn't know about at that time, and I have tried to do that since--
Story_ID: 358054
Speaker 1: I've written a musical ['Phillis'] about Phillis Wheatley because the thing that intrigued me about her is her intellect, the fact that she came here somewhere between five and six years old not--from Senegal, not knowing any English at all, which most of the--all of us came, you know, as slaves didn't know English, but by the time she was in, as a teenager, sixteen, seventeen years old she was translating Latin and it tells you that the brain comes in all colors, you know, and brilliance, if you're allowed, you know, to exercise all the talents within you, and then I did a show ['Carver (Don't Underestimate a Nut),' Micki Grant] about George Washington Carver, of course.
Speaker 2: And that show you did for The Public Theater [New York, New York], is that the one for The Public Theater?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.  It was done first Omaha [Nebraska]; it was a commissioned work for the Omaha children's theater [Omaha Theater Company].  I had originally done it as a full-length musical, and--just the score, and then when that didn't come off I got a commission just to do it as a children's--'cause I didn't let that whole score go to waste, it's still half a score there that's--for young people you can only do about an hour, you know, then they were fascinated and they do it in the schools and then it was also done at the Eden theater [Eden Theatrical Workshop] in--is it Arizona [sic. Denver, Colorado]?  (Laughter) Anyway, anyway but the reason why I liked to do those is, is because it exposes, it's one way of the history out and a lot of people don't want to read history but they will come and, and see it in a, in a production, and I figured the stories fascinate me they might fascinate someone else, you know, and I learned a lot in my research on Carver, I learned a lot and the same thing with Phillis Wheatley.  A lot of people that's--and they know one poem she wrote something about my dark hue or this--and they hold that agai-, but they don't know what she's saying and the context of which she's saying it and they don't know her fragility that she--she died at like thirty-three somewhere between thirty-three and thirty-five in chattel birth and had accomplished all this, it, it's just--I think we need to know those things.  I think we, as a people, I, I hate to say, but I think quite often we dismiss a lot of our history and because I hear young people today say, "Well why do I need to know--," you need to know that, that's, that's where you come from, you need to know who you are and why you are and how you got to this place and on whose shoulders you stand, you know, and that's, that's been a part of my attempt at writing, and I think I want to entertain, but I don't think that they're necessarily exclusive.
Story_ID: 358055
Speaker 1: You know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well whose shoulders do you stand feel you stand on, who has opened doors for you?
Speaker 1: Well I think I, I, I go back to--I'm standing on the shoulders of Moses, who was Harriet Tubman, who went back south nineteen times putting her life in danger, you know.  Once she was out of there should could've stayed out there (laughter) you know, but she went back nineteen times, and I, I stand on the shoulders of those people like the Sissle [Noble Sissle] and Blakes [Eubie Blake] and the Mills [Florence Mills] who were--they were always making theater, doing music.  Yeah I mean Eubie Blake you see it, you know.  Andy Razaf, who used to write marvelous lyrics, all of these people were doing things under the most trying of circumstances.  When you talk about the Chitlin' Circuits and the, you know, they were, they were--but they were going out and, and doing their thing under the most trying of circumstances sometimes, and when I think of I stand on the shoulders of my cousin Jeni [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon] certainly, you know.  She came from the same area of the woods that I did there in Chicago [Illinois], and then a lot of people say, "This little kid from the South Side of Chicago, how do you know you're gonna do anything?"  I, I think I might of mentioned that when I decided I was gonna leave the Center Aisle Players, and they said, "Somebody ought to talk to that girl, she thinks she's gonna go to Broadway," (laughter).  I mean, you know, 'cause that's a fantasy, you know, but for me it was just a fantasy that I had to reach for you know.
Story_ID: 358056
Speaker 1: How did you know of Broadway?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: How did you know of Broadway as a child in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I guess I knew more about pictures or movies but I knew about Broadway because of theater, because of community theatre, you know, and the shows that we were doing from Samuel French and all those little books we were getting were shows that had been produced on Broadway.  Most of them were shows that were white shows, you know.  I really didn't know about--'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] is the only thing you really knew about in my era that-- Broadway, the things that Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake were doing, that was back I guess in the '20s [1920s] or something--I, I don't--but I certainly know about it now because I'm a history buff, but at that time I knew about it because I was involved in community theatre.  I watched, watched the Oscars [Academy Awards], I watched the Tonys [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] as I said I, I visualized myself and when I found myself at the Tonys for the first time I was there where I had visualized myself being, you know.
Speaker 1: Well the world of, of Broadway--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the world of theater in New York [New York] is still relatively a white world--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --wouldn't you say?
Speaker 2: We had our heyday in the '70s [1970s] and, and we haven't had it since.  In the '70s [1970s] and, I, I--[HistoryMaker] Melvin Van Peebles' 'Ain't Supposed to Die' ['Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death'], and then he came with 'Don't Play Us Cheap' [Melvin Van Peebles], and then once 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope' opened and people realized that, that there was commercial value to doing a black show and, and people turn out to see themselves and see their images and people were coming in droves and right after that comes 'The Wiz' and, and 'Sophisticated Ladies' and 'Ain't Misbehavin' and it, it was just a plethora of, of marvelous black shows in the, in the '70s [1970s], you know.  First one I saw 'Purlie Victorious' ['Purlie'] was the first you know musical that I had seen on Broadway, which I guess (laughter) I--it was terrific you know.
Speaker 1: Which was that which you?
Speaker 2: 'Purlie Victorious.'
Speaker 1: 'Purlie Victorious.'
Speaker 2: Which was based on--I'm--not 'Purlie,' it was called 'Purlie,' but it was based on Ossie's [HistoryMaker Ossie Davis] play 'Purlie Victorious,' and they just called the musical 'Purlie,' but then there were years in between that, you know, but that made a big, that made a big, big stir of course and made [HistoryMaker] Melba Moore, of course, and then it's who else?  That's Sherman Hemsley was in it, Alan Alda was in it you know and, oh, oh, great gospel singer [Linda Hopkins], oh, she just had her--oh gads, that name escapes me.  All these people were in that, in that show and that's one of my, one of the first shows I saw when I came to New York, yeah.
Story_ID: 358057
Speaker 1: Well in the 1970s was there a sense or more so of black theater than there is today?  Did you feel like in the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) like oh, we're doing these great things?
Speaker 2: In, in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s].  I was here most of the, most of the '60s [1960s].  I was doing a lot of regional theater at that time, but here in New York [New York] there were all kinds of little theaters, people doing their own thing.  They had the New Lafayette Players, you know.  They had the Urban Arts [Urban Arts Corps], they had amassed people because you knew, you had to do, you have to make your own work, you know, but, but practically everything I've, I've done, or Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] and I did, we made our own work, you know.  So it was very exciting during that time there was a lot going on.  We had the Black Theatre Alliance [Black Theatre Alliance of New York]; all these theaters had come together in an alliance.  That's how much was going on at the time.
Speaker 1: How did the alliance form, were you a part of the formation of the alliance?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well not so much, (unclear) it was a part of where I worked like, like the corps would be a part.  It was made up of the theaters, yeah.  I remember [HistoryMaker] A. Peter Bailey was very much involved in that whole movement.  I don't know that it still exists as such anymore, but you have people who are still holding on, valiantly like [HistoryMaker] Woodie King, Jr. you know with the New Federal Theatre [New York, New York].  You have Crossroads [Crossroads Theatre, New Brunswick, New Jersey] over in Jersey now and [HistoryMaker] Ricardo Khan (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you work at Crossroads when you did the [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis and--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes I directed Ossie and Ruby [HistoryMaker Ruby Dee]--
Speaker 1: And their son?
Speaker 2: And Guy [Guy Davis], I directed the family [in 'Two Hah Hahs and a Homeboy,' Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis].  Well not with the girls (laughter) but--
Speaker 1: Was that the only time the family had performed like that before?
Speaker 2: That, that I know of.
Speaker 1: That you know of, that I know of also.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, Ruby was recently honored in Los Angeles [California], and I think Woodie was interviewing her at one of the functions and he asked her about the experience and she--I had never heard what he told me that she said something to the effect that: "We never--the three of us whenever we're together it's a lot of fireworks going on.  And somehow I don't know how she did it but we never had any kind of fireworks when Micki [HistoryMaker Micki Grant] was there, she kept us all calm and separated," (laughter).  I said, "Oh well that's nice I'm glad to hear that," (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you do it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know it's wonderful, I guess listening to each one, you know, but not and I think because each came to me as coming to each other, you know, and I, I really don't know.  I didn't know that I was doing that (laughter).
Speaker 1: So to go back.
Speaker 2: But it was a wonderful--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: --experience, yeah.
Speaker 1: Just to go back a little bit to your acting off-Broadway, the early start, you did 'To Be Young, Gifted and Black' [Lorraine Hansberry]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: Well in, in many ways number one I liked the fact that it was an integrated show, and at some point I had to portray Lorraine Hansberry, and I loved giving that speech every night: "You are young gifted and black," and I could, you know, just imagining her giving that speech to these young people and it was wonderful to do that every night, and then the friendships that you make and I've been fortunate in that.  I've always retained some friendship from almost every show and Gertrude Jeannette [HistoryMaker Gertrude Hadley Jeannette] played Mama at one point and yet for the longest time there were two people but she played it for the longest point, and to this day I still call her Mama when I see her, you know.

Speaker 1: When did you cross over and by that I mean, you know what I mean.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, what do you mean?  (Singing), "Cross over the bridge," (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, (laughter) and to, you know, you know, this mainstream world of, of acting and theater and, you know, when did you get an agent that sent you out to--for 'The Edge of Night' that you know where you're the first African American to be on that show, like when did people start to see you in that light of okay, she, she's the first African American to have a contract role on a soap [soap opera].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did--yeah.
Speaker 2: I really, I really you know, I haven't really gone back 'cause each step just seemed to--like one step after the other, things seemed to like segue because the thing with 'Brecht on Brecht' ['Brecht on Brecht: An Improvisation,' Samuel French] started as you th-, it was just Roscoe [HistoryMaker Roscoe Lee Browne] and myself, and I found that more and more I was doing things that would--in a mixed setting and when I started on my first role on I think it was 'Another World' it was just like a under-five, and I would say it's no small part.  You do absolutely your best work, I don't care if you have two lines, you know, and somehow they called me back years later because of that--'Edge Of Night.'  Ruth, I get them--Ruth Levin [ph.] and, and Bo Howard [ph.], these were the two agents who were working at the time, and they were both very good for me, but they saw me off-Broadway.  Now you have to have courageous casting people and courageous producers as well who are willing to take a test.  Somebody has to say you know, why, why don't you try this?  And I've always given them, them credit for that as casting people, but sometimes you just have to wake somebody up and say well why can't--you know I just saw this, I saw this woman downtown and, and she was fabulous in 'Brecht on Brecht.'  She was doing a lot of (unclear) stuff, and she did, you know, I think be nice as (unclear), and so I found myself on 'The Edge of Night.'  Now quite often since I didn't have a contract so they could've let me go the next week.  Quite often, if you acquit yourself well or in such a way that, that they like you, the writer will just start writing you in more and more and that's really what happened.
Story_ID: 358059
Speaker 1: What was the response from that, fr-, from the public at-large to see a black woman on a daytime soap [soap opera]?
Speaker 2: Well it was, actually I've gotten more response--people still me they remember that ['The Edge of Night'], but I think that the big thing happened with 'Another World' was what more people talk about because I, I was very much integrated into the show and, and I understand that they had, the watching clubs and stuff like--the colleges and if you had a class at this time or other you were supposed to watch and tell us if Peggy was on today and what Peggy did and all that, and people were calling me Peggy if they could see me on the street.  Peggy and they'd get, you know, wave to you down the street.  I was, I was Peggy Nolan [Peggy Harris Nolan] to everybody and I, I hear people to this day they say, "I, I grew up watching, my grandmother watched you.  I've been watching, you know, when I was a kid.  Every day we had to watch, you know, 'Another World,'" and, and when even when I did 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,' so many people would come backstage, this is white and black, and say, "I never thought I'd have a chance to see you in person.  I never thought I'd have a chance to touch you," you know, but you become a friend.  That's the difference in doing film and even doing theater.  Although you have people stand outside to get your autograph, but when you do television on a regular basis, you're going in a person's home every day.  So you become like an acquaintance, you're really a friend, and when they see you they behave as if though they really know you.  They don't mind touching you, or whatever.  I used to get mail from people telling me their troubles because I would listen to people's troubles on the show (laughter), you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 358060
Speaker 1: On the show you're a psychologist, psychiatrist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, no that was on, that was on 'The Edge of Night.'  Oh the second time, the first time I was I worked for a person who's like the head of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], what would be called the CIA, you know, and that--I was Susan Earle and it was a wonderful role like I remember one time when they had me behind the door listening to what was (laughter) going on, it was kind of fun to do, but at the same time I was doing a show in Chicago [Illinois] every night and I was flying back and forth, but when you--the (unclear) times, when you're young and eager you don't turn down anything and it just so happened that I got 'Bon Voyage, Titanic' at the same that I was doing 'The Edge of Night,' and I got to know the pilots and the, the you know the flight attendants.  Everybody--and I know they held the plane for me once when they knew I was coming (laughter), and when I walked in the door everybody was looking up to see who this was that they were holding the plane for, and the pilots watched the show and they would be standing, they were waiting for me when I'd come in and say hi (laughter), so you know I've had some really magical moments but it's, it's by preparing myself to take whatever opportunity came along.
Speaker 1: How would you say you prepared yourself t--
Speaker 2: No id-, see, I have people coming to me and they say, "I wanna be--and I wanna do this and, and how do I do that?"  I say, "What are you are you doing about it?"  You know, you just come to someone and say, "Tell me how to get into movies.  Tell me how--," it doesn't happen that way.  And so knowing what I wanted to do all along the way I was trying to do things to prepare myself, and taking the courses, acting courses, interpretation of literature, studying at the--you know, studying my music, just when I came, when I was in Los Angeles [California] I studied as I said with Florence Russell.  When I came to New York [New York] I immediately hooked up with Graham Bernard, who was teaching a lot of people for Broadway and how to, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I and that's interesting because I wanted to just touch on that a little bit when I was talking about crossing over.  Did you ever see, I mean were you--and I'm just asking, I don't know.  Were you ever trained to speak white for lack of any other way to put it?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no I wasn't trained to speak white ever.
Speaker 1: But you know what I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, speech classes and diction or you can't sound black or you can't do this and that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah I, I did have speech because it--at one point when I was coming to high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], speech and drama were combined.  As a matter-of-fact on the one of the courses is called Speech/Drama, so you, you learn to--
Speaker 1: Standard stage but I'm saying no one ever, you know--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in your world of, of acting says, oh, you--we need to--
Speaker 2: No, what they, what they've done (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) have you sound this way--
Speaker 2: --is tell me--I've been told that I was too cultured or--and, and there's a young lady in, in Chicago [Illinois] who was in AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)] who did a whole article in the AFTRA Magazine [SAG-AFTRA Magazine] because she was told that she wasn't black--didn't speak black enough for some of the commercials, but I never did you know comer-, my commercials were crossovers from the beginning, but then there's certain people they want that have a certain sound.  I don't--you know, my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] was from Georgia by way of Birmingham [Alabama] to Chicago, and when my--my mother didn't have a southern accent.  My mother spoke very (unclear), very fast, you know, and so I don't know (laughter), it could be an amalgam of, of that and then she worked in white homes and, and it could be an amalgam, I, I don't know but I just know she was always a very energetic speaker and she was, and she was very strict about our language, our use of language, and I remember when she would say, if you'd say get she'd ask you to spell it and when you said, "G-E-T," she'd say, "You didn't say that, you said G-I-T," you know.  Oh she wouldn't--my mother never used ain't--
Story_ID: 358061
Speaker 1: Well in the '70s [1970s] when you--when we had this renaissance of plays on Broadway you know, [HistoryMaker] Melvin Van Peebles and all, and we also had sort of that same thing in, in the film you know what--in what's called now blaxploitation films.  Of course they were not called that then.  How did you see those films at the time, like 'Dolemite' and 'Coffy' and, you know?
Speaker 2: 'Cotton Comes to Harlem' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cotton Comes to Harlem' (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I remember my friend, she's my friend to this day, Mabel Robinson, (unclear) out of that bale of cotton (laughter), but those were great day because you got to see, you got to see your people.  You got to see Godfrey Cambridge, you got to see Bill Cosby, you got to see Belafonte [HistoryMaker Harry Belafonte], you got to--it was like you say we, we had to make our own, own work and then we got introduced to people that we didn't even know about in, in film, you know, with the 'Super Flys' ['Super Fly'] and the--
Speaker 1: Did you feel that those--
Speaker 2: I wasn't feeling (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they were introductions, I mean for example 'Super Fly,' you think that character was an introduction t-, as to something about black culture that you necessarily didn't know about?
Speaker 2: No, no because actually we were doing what, what--in that sense which is why I didn't really particularly like I think it was called 'Harlem Nights' or something with--
Speaker 1: Eddie Murphy and--
Speaker 2: --Eddie Murphy, I, I loathed that film because it seemed to me we put every cliche that whites had ever said about us in that film, you know, but in, in some of the others there were really comedic what you were happy to see was the black being in charge, you know, that the, the--that the cops were in charge--if you--they're just in charge.  Well, well the only you're gonna be in charge is if you write your own script, you know (laughter) and those--something--I think that's what we were seeing at, in that size, because in the minute they would come out people would try and find some time to go out see that film you know and it's, it's the same, it's the same when I say that people were coming to Broadway in droves.  Sometimes they didn't know what they were going to see because our people are not that taken with reviews anyway.  They--it's more word of mouth with them, you know, but I think we're discerning.  I think, I think we're discerning, but then remember when you're hungry sometimes you can feed people a lot of almost anything if you're hungry enough.
Story_ID: 358062
Speaker 1: 'Your Arms Are Too Short to Box with God' ['Your Arms Too Short to Box with God,' Vinnette Carroll], in that, for that you received a Grammy [Grammy Award] nomination?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  That was my second Grammy nomination.
Speaker 1: What was the first?
Speaker 2: Well, I won the Grammy for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For?
Speaker 2: --'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.'
Speaker 1: 'Don't,' okay, right, right.
Speaker 2: I actually won the Grammy.
Speaker 1: Which you received?
Speaker 2: On stage--
Speaker 1: On stage.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) at the theater because I wasn't there at the Grammys.  I wasn't even thinking about it.  I wasn't even thinking about the fact that I was--would win it and that, that very same night I was singing at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] for a benefit for CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], the civil rights, group and then the, the word came in while I--I think just before I went on stage that I had just won a Grammy and they announced (laughter) it there at Carnegie Hall and then the next day, or a couple of days they presented to me on the stage at the Edison theater [Edison Ballroom, New York, New York] in front of the theater-going audience, and Will Holt, who was the conceiver and director of the 'Leonard Bernstein Theatre Songs' ['Leonard Bernstein's Theatre Songs'], which is another show that I, I did, yeah.  Like I say, things just intertwined and people intertwined.  I keep meeting people coming and going.
Speaker 1: So that and then you--that led to--so 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,' let's talk about all the awards you won for that show.  You won the Critic--the Outer Critics [Outer Critics Circle Award], the Drama Desk [Drama Desk Award], did you win a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for that as well?
Speaker 2: No, I got three Tony nominations for book, music and lyrics, and Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] was nominated--first black woman for directing, and the show itself was nominated as best musical.
Speaker 1: And you were in that show as well?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah so for the Outer Critics Circle I got nominated for the score as well as performance and Drama Desk for scores plus performance--lyrics as well as performance.
Speaker 1: Now was any of this going to your head at the time?  Were you thinking I'm hot stuff?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Ha, no I tell you what, it, it was wonderful but you lose a lot of your own, your own authority over your, your life after--quite often I was being told who I was to have lunch with, where I was going, who I was--you know, and it's a responsibility, too, you know because you're representing not just yourself, you're representing the show, the producer, you--
Speaker 1: The money people (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, you know, and I felt the same when I was under contract to 'Another World' it's a responsibility because this is a door.  I always say, you know, if you're gonna bang on a door, be prepared to walk through when it opens, and so if I was going to open a door, I, I wanted to set a great example because maybe if I didn't the door would slam back (laughter), you know.  So, I, I feel it's a responsibility, but suddenly here I was considered a, a Broadway star.  I was getting invited to all opening nights and all, I'm just invited here, and invited there and having lunch at Sardi's [New York, New York] and you know talking, interviews and I guess in a way I was thinking okay, yeah, this is all right, this is--why not (laughter).
Story_ID: 358063
Speaker 1: We're gonna go back and just throw in stuff that we didn't--when we were talking about the civil rights.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well you were gonna sing for me, the last--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me what you were gonna sing?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a song called 'It Takes A Whole Lot of Human Feeling,' which more or less became my signature song, and I was just gonna do this last verse for you because when you were talking did I write for civil rights and actually this is one of the numbers I did for Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] the first day I went to sing for her and the last verse goes (singing), "They--I overheard a man say that he wouldn't hurt a flea and if a fly (unclear) on his nose he'd let it be, well, maybe I'm just stupid, but it's hard to understand that same man wouldn't even shake my hand.  It takes a whole lotta human feeling I know from what I've seen that it takes a lot of human feeling just to be a human being."  And I was fascinated--
Speaker 1: Very nice (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) when Carmen McRae used it as a title song on her album and Gladys Knight and the Pips did a rendition of it, but for me--and most people when they think of that show they all seem to remember that--what was that song about human feeling? You know that song about human feeling--they can't--if they can't remember they remember that thing.  Oh and there was one, there was one line I have to tell you because every single night you could almost predict it.  It would get a visc-, an audible response from the audience and, and it went (singing), "They say over population is an ever present thorn, yet we kill each other fast as we are born and sometimes I have to wonder what strange plasma we're made of when we have to ask computers whom to love.  That's why it takes a who-," you know, and all of our night, it was predictable.  The audience would go, "Ah, oh," you know and let out that little murmur of laughter because computers were just coming in with all that you know find your lover stuff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And now (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and now it's really (unclear).
Speaker 1: It's e-Harmony and (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 358064
Speaker 1: So when you look back just over--even before we--because I still wanna talk about TV, but when you look back over the theater you've done 'Alice In Wonderland' ['Alice'] and I mean you've done so much in theater, what stands out for you, what are some of the things that stand out?  I'm sure you're--
Speaker 2: So many for different reasons.
Speaker 1: Then tell me why and those reasons why, you know?
Speaker 2: Okay, well 'Alice' it's a big disappointment, it's not coming into New York [New York] and closing out of town.  Which we had Debbie Allen as Alice, and, and Alice Ghostley was in it and Paula Kelly and we just had a marvelous cast and then besides it was being produced by Mike Nichols, I mean what more could you ask and also I felt that I was in, not only in collaboration with Vinnette Carroll, but with Lewis Carroll, and my thing, 'cause Lewis Carroll wrote a lot of these little verses and trick verses and stuff and my--I was trying but striving to make it almost seamless, and in some ways I think I was successful, you know, where you had to pick out which did Carroll do and, and what did Grant [HistoryMaker Micki Grant] do, and I had great, great, great fun writing that show.  Just, I just and I thought I did a pretty magnum good job and--so that was one of the main things having that kind of collaboration with, with Lewis Carroll as well as having that marvelous cast, and I always enjoy my casts if they, you know, are talented people because they are the ones who are delivering your work, you know.
Story_ID: 358065
Speaker 1: I loved doing 'The Ups and Downs of Theophilus Maitland' [Vinnette Carroll] because I always had this affinity for island music and this way I got a chance to do a whole show of island music and I had a great time with that.  I even went in for somebody every couple of times (laughter), and 'Working' I, I enjoyed 'Working' because actually Stephen Schwartz came to me and asked me to be a part of the, the creative team because you know Stephen he's, he's--also does music and lyrics.  He's a marvelous writer, and he usually does his own lyrics and own music and he was writing (background noise) this book, I mean he was reading Studs Terkel's book called 'Working' ['Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do'], which, you know, and Studs always interviews these people from various walks of life, so this book was done on just working people and in, in fact when he--he said when he was writing the music he was trying to come up with a, a [HistoryMaker] Micki Grant style song and he decided why am I doing this, why don't I call Micki Grant, you know.  Of course when he said he was doing this musical and--'Working,' I, I felt like a lot of people did when Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] said she wanted to do a musical about 'Bury the Dead' [Irwin Shaw].  I was like, how you gonna do a musical with all these interviews with people talking about their jobs?  I'm so proud of that show.  I, I just, it's a wonderful show I think, and it plays somewhere all the time.  I only had three numbers in it, but they were in incredible spots and, and really done so well and Lynne Thigpen, if you listen to the record she's doing two of them and, and on the recording and oh, gads--she's not on the recording, the three people who did 'Lovin' Al,' which is about a car hiker [hitchhiker], but anyway Patti LaBelle did one of the songs when they did the TV film but when we would--I had only done two songs for the show and one was about the car hiker which we wanted a kind of bluesy sound to and that was the first song he came to me for and we--in fact sat right here in this room when I was with the guitar and played him some stuff, and he was talking about another moment in the show and I was--had started work on a song and I just gave an idea of what that would be like in terms of that moment he was talking about--people's desires and dreams and summing up.  He said, I knew I was right coming here you know and I went and I completed the song and it became the title song under the movie credits, you know, and Lynne Thigpen also did that song and it's a very popular audition song now it's called 'If I Could've Been What I Could've Been' ['If I Could've Been'].  (Singing), "If I could've been what I could've been I could've been something with some luck to do what I wanted to.  I would've been something, a tower of strength the center of power at ten bucks an hour, you know," (making sounds), but anyway and then the ending goes on, but then we opened at the Goodman Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] in--(unclear) workshop in, in Chicago [Illinois] and two songs are in it and I, I was reading through some of the interviews, and there was this domestic woman and talking about her travails and how people ignore her and sometimes talk around her like she's not even there and I, I went to Steve I said, "You know, there's a whole genre of, of working people.  That's a really large class of people that are being left out," and I said, "I wanna do something about cleaning people," and he says (gesture), and I did this song called 'Cleanin' Women,' and it became the eleven o'clock number on the show and Lynne Thigpen did it up.  (Singing), "Cleaning women without faces coming and going on a first name basis, I'm talking--you're talking to somebody who knows and after too many years Lord I don't wanna be in one more laundry room.  I don't wanna pick up not up another broom.  One of these days just wanna sleep 'til noon," you know, and then she goes on and on and so I'm, I'm very proud of, of those three pieces.  Very proud of the fact that it's, it's a very popular show, it's playing some place all the time and, and I like the experience of working with all the other--there were five of us, five writers on that show.
Story_ID: 358066
Speaker 1: Well you had the experience also of working with Jennifer Holliday, was that ['Your Arms Too Short to Box with God,' Vinnette Carroll] before or after 'Dreamgirls'?  Jennifer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Before.
Speaker 1: Before.
Speaker 2: In fact, that's how she got seen for 'Dreamgirls.'  She, she did a song when she came back that she--we picked her up for the tour  first, and then the tour came back into New York [New York] which made its second appearance on Broadway and Alex [Alex Bradford] had written a song called 'I Love You So Much Jesus,' and it was a like a huge aria which is what Delores Hall really won the Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] at.  Delores Hall won the Tony when the first time around and I'm sure she won it on that song (laughter), you know.  So Jennifer got a chance to, to show off this incredible voice with this great aria and, and that's how she was seen to come down and, you know, start work-shopping with 'Dreamgirls,' but I think the very fact that we--'cause she came in to audition from Texas.  She wasn't living in New York and we all so we could feel good about maybe having a little something to do with that (laughter).
Story_ID: 358067
Speaker 1: So of the collaboration with Ms. Carroll [Vinnette Carroll] which are--you know, all of the work you're proud of, but what stands out as most memorable (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it has to be 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,' I think because that's, that's where we became important to each other you know?  In other words, it was an important thing for her about--the Broadway director, nominated for a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre], you know what I mean and it was an important move for me 'cause it, it put me out there where people could see my work and, and as a team we became a very important team by way of I think at one point in time you could say we had a little power (laughter) you know as two black women.
Speaker 1: Do you know of any other teams of black women that have been as successful as the two of you with composing music and lyrics for shows on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Black?  I don't know of any black woman composers, especially composing lyrist.  As a matter of fact I understand I'm in a handful of people period who do both for Broadway and starting back with Irving Berlin and Cole Porter.  Of course, Stephen Sondheim, Stephen Schwartz.  There, there are about ten people who do both, but no I, no I really don't and as far as I know, and I won the Grammy [Grammy Award] I don't any woman of any color had won a Grammy for a Broadway score, you know.  Betty Comden had won, but they did lyrics.  I'm talking about for a complete score of music and lyrics you know, and I think it's time.  I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sure they're out there.  I think it's time, you know.
Speaker 1: You have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't there have been any women of, of that have the kind of stature that if you pardon my saying so that Vinnette had at one time.  It was almost, there was almost nothing that we would decide to do to coordinate that you didn't have every producer in town coming down and look at, you know.
Story_ID: 358068
Speaker 1: Did you know they were doing 'Color Purple,' the musical ['The Color Purple,' Marsha Norman]?
Speaker 2: I had heard, yeah, I had heard some time ago that they were writing it, Regina Taylor, 'cause she had such success with 'Crowns' [Regina Taylor], you know.  Of course they didn't have to have an original score I think for 'Crowns.'  Well, I don't--some things I, I--
Speaker 1: Talk to me; this is oral history.
Speaker 2: Well it was, it was after the person [Susan Birkenhead] who was thought--who had done lyrics told me about it at a meeting of the Dramatists Guild [Dramatists Guild of America] council, and we were both on council and she's, she works--she was one of the lyricists working and she also did the lyrics for 'Jelly's Last Jam' [George C. Wolfe].  It so happens she's not black, so when she told me that she was going to be doing--I couldn't help but express myself, you know, and I said, "Who's doing the music?" And I, and I don't know if she told me who was doing the music but I said, "Well, would you remind people that I'm here?"  You know.  I, I couldn't help myself.
Speaker 1: Of course not.
Speaker 2: You know, that you're telling me that you're doing the lyrics for 'Color Purple,' but then as it turns out it went over to a whole different producer-ship, I guess.  I don't know who, I don't know who was originally producing it with Regina, whether there's the same producers, or called in someone else, but I find that a lot of the creative people, people in important positions were not people of color, and to me 'Color Purple' was so intrinsically African American.  I'm not, I am not opposed to people working in you know different (unclear), we live in that kind of society.  I'm certainly not opposed you know, I wrote, I wrote a whole score based on--for Hazel, the comic strip character Hazel, and she's Jewish, you know, so I can't say I'm opposed to that, but I, I happen to think that we as black people know more about what goes on in other lives than they do about us, because we work in their homes, we work in their businesses, you work for a living, you know.  So I think we can know a lot about that, and a lot about how we, we deal in the world of that mixture.  I just feel that there's, there's so few opportunities for us and we're constantly making our own work until when somebody comes along with a big pile of money and can hire people and for a show, and I repeat myself that it's so intrinsically black not to have that many people of color involved on the creative end--it's just puzzling to me, that's all, and not necessarily just for me, yet they're wonderful writers out there.  I'm sure composers--and now with what's happening, some of us spend so much time--as I say equip yourself, I wanted to be in the theater and, and I have tried to grow as a theater writer.  Every show I do I try and expand and expand to do more and more.  I've gotten sometimes I've almost written operatic, you know, to keep the music flowing it's almost a constant flow because I am really dealing with wanting to write for the theater.  Doesn't mean I wouldn't a movie score if somebody offered it to me, you know, but now all of a sudden people are just coming in from everywhere who have never spent a moment trying to study what theater is about, or they're putting things together from records, this but every, you know and, and those of us that who've really spent our lives and our energy really learning the craft are somehow it seems to be getting shunted aside.  All of a sudden it's, it's all the people who are making--who make the rock records and look every show that's coming in now is based on somebody's rock career, you know, and so you don't have to expend that energy of writing a song, the songs are all there, they're all written.  They weren't necessarily in the writer's mind that one of these days it's gonna be a Broadway show.  They come from all different avenues, you know.  Well I'll let you get a little bit of what I'm--you know and--I am not bitter, that is not to say that I am bitter, but I am aware.  I am aware of what's taking place, you know.
Story_ID: 358069
Speaker 1: So is it 2002 you received the call that they wanted you to come to Chicago [Illinois] to star in 'Have Our Say' ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann]?
Speaker 2: Oh no, it doesn't seem as long ago as it's been.  It's been a long--it's ten years ago.
Speaker 1: Has it been ten years?
Speaker 2: I can't believe it myself, I cannot believe it myself.  It look, it's like it was yesterday. It was 1996 of February, February of 1996 when they had just had a big commemoration for Lorraine Hansberry in one of the theaters downtown and I think I got the call that same Sunday.  I'd gone to the commemoration, and it'd come on when the call came in.  It was on a Sunday because usually you don't get calls, you know, for work on a Sunday.  It was on a Sunday.
Speaker 1: Who called (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, her--Judith, she was one of the producers along with Camille Cosby and, and Judith Berns [sic. Judith Rutherford Marechal James] and, and when she told me her name you know, "And I'm the--one of the producers of 'Having Our Say,' and Emily Mann," whom I had just done a reading for at Princeton [McCarter Theatre Center, Princeton, New Jersey], "has told us that you would be perfect you know for Sadie [Sarah L. Delany], and we're doing it in Chicago, would you be interested?" And of course when they said Chicago I was interested.
Speaker 1: Right away?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Judith turned out, she said I'm Judith, I don't know if you remember me.  I wouldn't remember her.  "I'm Judith Marechal, we've worked together.  I produced you."  I--she produced me in the 'Leonard Bernstein Theatre Songs' ['Leonard Bernstein's Theatre Songs'].  So I said, "Judith Marechal," and she had got--I said, "You deserted us; you went to Hollywood," you know.  She has a company with the Dreyfuss [Richard Dreyfuss], Dreyfuss and James [Dreyfuss/James Productions], you know.  When I say Berns--Judith James and she--they have a company together.  So she, she went Hollywood on us and she says, "Well I'm back now," (laughter) and no, so th-, I went there.  I was there in my hometown, it was, it was terrific.  All of '96 [1996] we went to the Atlanta festival [National Black Arts Festival] in August, by that time I had taken over the--I went in for Frances Foster.  Actually I went to standby for her and Frances left the show in May.  I was going on in the matinees because Frances was recovering actually from a stroke and, and they didn't want her too taxed that much, so I was doing the matinees and from February until May I think Frances left May and that's when I took over the role permanently and we went to the Atlanta festival and played there and came back to Chicago.  We were playing way on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois], which not a side inhabited by a lot of people of color (laughter), but they found their way over there and then they started talking about--when leaving Chicago, I guess we were there a good six months, and we went from there to the Cleveland Play House [Cleveland, Ohio], and I can't--from there the tour really started in earnest, and we covered almost seventy cities in the space to all of '96 [1996] and all of '97 [1997] we were out.  Maybe we get in for like when we played Princeton you know I could get home or something like that but we were out.  I think I've been every state now.  I didn't get there, I didn't get to Hawaii because of that but I--when I got to Hawaii I'd been in all fifty states (laughter).
Story_ID: 358070
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But before that show ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann], you had not been on stage for a long time.
Speaker 2: No, I, I hadn't and that's when they--when they called--when she [Judith Rutherford Marechal James] called me and I had seen the show (unclear) and I am just so proud of it and just thought it was a terrific, terrific show and a terrific way of presenting the book ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Sarah L. Delany and A. Elizabeth Delany].  Emily Mann is very good at that, by the way, doing real plays based on real life you know and, and although she had taken it from the book that the young women had written and when I hung up the phone and I--of course when she told me Chicago [Illinois] that was a clincher, and I hung up the phone and I said, "What have I done?"  I had seen the show and there were only two people on stage for three acts, my dear, not two acts, three.  Only two people, and I'm thinking about all these lines.  I used to be terrific at lines, you know, especially when I was on the soap [soap opera].  I'd just get lines like that, but I hadn't done anything like that in a long time and I said--I started thinking about all of these lines and, and you know they cook an entire meal on stage during these three acts and at the very end they serve it, you know, and so they're busy all the time.  I don't know whether you are cutting cucumbers or making a ca-, you're busy every moment and you've all these lines they're throwing out.  You can't drop a minute, not a second, not a mini-second you know.  Your concentration has to be absolutely there every minute because they're only the two of you.  Anyway I show up in Chicago in the dead of winter and right away you know I'm watching them on stage and Frances [Frances Foster] and Lizan Mitchell, who later becomes my co-star (unclear) with for two years, and I started, you know, learning the lines from the next day on and I realized that my facility was still almost intact, you know.  I was told later by the stage manager that I was probably the most line perfect of anyone who played the part [Sadie], you know, which is pretty darn good.  I guess 'cause when you're scared (laughter) you're gonna pay a lot more attention.
Story_ID: 358071
Speaker 1: And that show ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann] also--didn't it go to South Africa or some place (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, in 1998 we went to South Africa, the Market Theatre [Johannesburg, South Africa], we played there for six weeks.
Speaker 1: How was it received in South Africa?
Speaker 2: Very well received. There's a lot of, you know similarities when you talk about apartheid and I mentioned that when I, I was there.  I said you know we had apartheid in our country, you know and also they have the color thing there.
Speaker 1: Lighter and darker as we do?
Speaker 2: It's sometimes right in families, in the same family one can be called a black--one could be called colored. It's, it's--in fact my dresser was considered a colored ,you know, 'cause we talked about those things and it, it was, it was interesting but it was being on the mother soil and I don't know what I expected but it was more than I expected.  It was better than I expected, you know.  I saw these people with all these black people in markets and supermarkets and doing things and having this, and I'm not sure how long Mandela [Nelson Mandela] had been there, and they loved this man.  Sometimes I would ask white clerks some things about it but you know, "What about Mandela?"  One of them, "Oh, the best thing. Oh, he's wonderful," but all of a sudden they were a part of the world again.  Th-, soccer had become very big again, you know.  You could watch it on television because for years they hadn't been able to play world soccer.  They were just out, all of a sudden they were back in the world again, and I didn't--everybody I talked to just loved Mandela, black and white--
Speaker 1: What were the crowds like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) 'cause there was only one person.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: One person and she was our driver, white person, used to drive us to the theater every night, and she was talking about how things were better when the way they were, and after I got over my initial shock for about two seconds I said, "Why?  Do you think some people are supposed to have everything and other people are to have nothing?  You feel that you should--," (laughter) okay, sometimes I can't help myself, I just, I just can't help myself that she would say that she thought things were better when, when people couldn't live where they wanted to in their land and in their own country they could you know, had to carry passes to say you're a human being practically and she was a young woman, too.
Story_ID: 358072
Speaker 1: Now were the audiences mixed--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at the show ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What about the people who stayed to meet you after the show, were mixed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Quite often, quite often they were white, and there were Indians, too, we were invited and--because my friend, my friend and co-star, Lizan [Lizan Mitchell], was--she did her chanting and what have you and--every night, and--
Speaker 1: She's a Buddhist?
Speaker 2: --not exactly, what is the Ganesh, the--she had her guru, but any (laughter)--
Speaker 1: And Neculai [Neculai Burghelea] may know, but no he doesn't know okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway--so the we--this young Indian woman invited us out though and I think it's really because of Lizan and to her place and the interesting place we went to was this young German was married to this Zulu woman and they had met when she was Germany I guess doing something and they had met in Germany and he had made the move to South Africa with her, and we were invited to dinner at their house and they had this beautiful, gorgeous kid, little baby (laughter) and they seemed quite happy and, and content.  It was--that was, you just don't--you know you have to be in a place you can hear and read so much you know but then again I'm sure there were a lot of people that were coming and the car would drive down the street people coming over for a handout and everything.  Still now I guess there are not enough jobs and everything, but I saw so many people who seemed to be doing, just right there at the theater [Market Theatre, Johannesburg, South Africa], the security people and the you know the--there was a restaurant right across from the theater that would run by and then right next there was a very high upper, upscale restaurant, too, but I was just--and then at, at the same time you saw all the street vendors though, and the women who made the beads and the you know--end of Belize  I went through there, the villages, and their homes are just so outstanding, so artistic.  Have you seen the--all various colors and, and God it was just beautiful, it was just--it was quite an experience.  The only thing I missed was not getting to Cape Town [South Africa] which I understand is one of the most beautiful spots in the world.  I did get to Pretoria [South Africa], got to Soweto [South Africa], which was--I wanted so much to get there because the history behind it with all those young students who were murdered or whatever. So I got there a couple of times and they had restaurants there.  You know black people, we ate there and, and they were visited by white and black when you go into those restaurants it would be mixed and the only restaurants that I went in were mixed.
Story_ID: 357650
Speaker 1: Just going back a little.  I want to have you fill in how you actually got the role [in 'Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann].  You said you'd done the reading but then when you talked about the movie version--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll and--just tell me the story.  So in the film--?
Speaker 2: Well in the film, Diahann Carroll played the role of I actually played on stage, which is Sadie [Sarah L. Delany], which is the older sister which was funny because Ruby [HistoryMaker Ruby Dee] played the younger sister (laughter), which is a role that Lizan [Lizan Mitchell] was playing and by this time I had sort of gotten use to the way things happen, you know that you don't always get the movie, and the next thing I knew they had called to say that, that we--and I found out that they really wanted to find a way, Emily [Emily Mann] as well as the producers, to have the two of us in the movie because we had done it longer than anyone and it really had become the--identified as the Delaney sisters and people like--as I said before some of us really thought that we were sisters or related or something because it came across so emphatically on the stage and so in real life Bessie [A. Elizabeth Delaney] and Sadie had come to the theater to see themselves being portrayed on stage and they were sitting up in loge and apparently someone happened to look up there during their visit and, and spot them and the whole audience looked up there and saw them.  They had--were not aware that they were there and had started applauding, and they had this scene in the movie, and they wrote Lizan and myself into the scene, so when Ruby and Diahann or Sadie and Bessie, Bessie and Sadie were looking down on the stage, they were looking down at me and Lizan, and I'm the one who happened to look up and spot them and I turned to Lizan and we started (clapping) and then the whole audience started (laughter), and so I said, well we did get in the movie anyway and we went through the same thing, had to put on the same makeup--'cause you know makeup person traveled with us all that time.
Speaker 1: The same one?
Speaker 2: Yes, and she's--it was a great experience for her because she's now gone, gone onto one of the TV stations and for you know one of the head makeup people there and everything--
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but see that was a great resume for her.
Story_ID: 357651
Speaker 1: You got that role [Sadie in 'Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Emily Mann] because Phylicia Rashad was doing--and then I mention Phylicia Rashad because she had done another play that was similar.  What was her play?  What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no I didn't know that Phylicia--no I got the role--
Speaker 1: No, she--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: What was the reading that she--
Speaker 2: The reading of--Mary Alice was supposed to be reading 'The Old Settler' [John Henry Redwood].
Speaker 1: 'The Old Settler.'
Speaker 2: It was the 'The Old Settler,' and Mary Alice was supposed to be reading it with Barbara Montgomery.  Now Phylicia and Debbie [Debbie Allen] went on to do it as a TV show because it's about two sisters so which, it was ideal for them. But that night, for the reading, Barbara Montgomery was supposed to read one part, of one sister, and Mary Alice was supposed to be the other sister.  Mary Alice was the one who could not be there and John [John Henry Redwood] called me at the last minute.  I had just finished doing a play of his, 'The Sunbeam' [sic. 'A Sunbeam,' John Henry Redwood], and he asked if I would go over on that Monday and he sent me the script over and read this part and I did, and that's when Emily Mann came over and saw the show.  She said she hadn't, wasn't feeling well that night but she came over anyway and when she came backstage and I understand she said later, "Where, where has this woman been?  Why haven't I seen her"?  Well, I've been around kid, you know (laughter) I, you know, but then she got in touch with Judith [Judith Rutherford Marechal James] and Camille [Camille Cosby] which was fortunate for me and told them that she had seen this person the night before or if she called them that night, I don't know.  Whenever she called them she said she had seen the person she thought would be ideal for Sadie.
Speaker 1: And Judith is like, "Oh, I know her," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Story_ID: 357652
Speaker 1: So just to go back to your television career, to revisit it for a moment.  What was the first role you ever played on TV?  Was it 'The Edge of Night,' or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know the, the first thing--
Speaker 1: The Brillo commercial?  Didn't you do commercials?
Speaker 2: You know the, the first thing--you're talking about the first actually running role?  That was--
Speaker 1: Or actually the first time you appeared on television?
Speaker 2: Well the first time I appeared I was in a doctor's office supposedly pregnant and, but it was like, I can under-five--it was just a one appearance, you know, and, and so--
Speaker 1: Were you the only African American in the doctor's office?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, you didn't, you didn't see that many--there was one show during that period of time called 'The Doctors' and the same person was behind that desk.  You'd see her all the time, she never had a word to say, never, never so--I know she wasn't under contract but that was just for I guess atmosphere and I think now they call them atmosphere people (laughter).
Speaker 1: Background.
Speaker 2: They used call it, oh background, they used to call to call 'em extras, now they call 'em (laughter) but any way, no you didn't see, you didn't just see a lot of interaction.
Speaker 1: Well when you got the role--
Speaker 2: But when I got the role [Ada Chandler] on 'Edge of Night,' it was really an integrated, really and I don't know that, that there's nothing about the role, in fact except for the when I went back to 'The Edge of Night,' either role was that--it was indicated that it had to be for a black person.
Speaker 1: But you realized that you must've been one of the black people on TV you know whe-, back during that time when you see a black person on TV you'd call all the other black people you know, hey, there's a black person on TV (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So how does it feel to have been one of the people who people call about there's a black woman on TV (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.  Well, I guess now I, I enjoy it more when people tell me about it and all and they had memories of it you know and they'd me how they use to cluster around or they would call each other on the phone to say what Peggy [Peggy Harris Nolan on 'Another World'] did today or if, if the others couldn't see it and the fact that kids told me when they were in college they would have watchers who, who was not having class on this day then you'd watch and it was all just--
Story_ID: 357653
Speaker 1: Did you feel you were opening doors when you were the first contract, the first African American woman to be a contract player on a soap [soap opera] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I, I, I always felt a responsibility, and I, and I--so would always try to be absolutely prepared when I walked on the set.  You had time during the day to brush up your lines, et cetera, well because they would, you know, do several takes and take you over several times but I use to walk on the set knowing my lines and sometime--and they used teleprompters at that time and there were some people who were so good at reading teleprompters until they made you (unclear) (laughter).  They can make it look as if you have forgotten your lines (laughter), oh, it's a real art, it's a true art to read, huh, is that right, and you're (unclear) (laughter), but no I made it, I made it a point to always being prepared.
Speaker 1: Did you feel outside of that that you had a responsibility?  I mean did you, were you concerned about the image you were projecting to viewers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, except that fortunately, fortunately its--they--it was a good image, you know, I mean I didn't really have to, I didn't have to be concerned about it, but as I said I don't think they, the role was intended really for a person of color anyway.
Speaker 1: How do you, how--do you know you got it, how they chose you?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think because they saw me off, off-Broadway in the show and as I said Mabel Hauer [ph.], and Ruth Levin [ph.] was the same way, and, and unfortunately I don't know which one was casting which show ['The Edge of Night' and 'Another World'], but I know both of them spoke to the producer.  They both had seen me do work off-Broadway and they may have seen me in other things, but I know a lot of people saw me in 'Brecht on Brecht' ['Brecht on Brecht: An Improvisation,' Samuel French], you know, and it's, it's a matter of when you know you've got the cast to a role if you, if you just make that decision that why not, and if the producer says, well, go ahead and we'll see, but the point is we'll see, that's your part.  That's your part you have to play, you have to let them see that this is a very good move you've made, it's a very good choice that you've made, and so you have to be able to hold up your part, and that was my concern, you know, just keep being written in, which means that you're doing something right.  And I think the part with, I think the part in 'Edge of Night' when I first got that was probably expanded and kept (unclear).  I, I was there nine months straight, you know.
Speaker 1: What did your cousin [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon] think about this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this was the time I was playing in Chicago [Illinois] at the same time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Chicago going back and forth.
Story_ID: 357654
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did your cousin think about what you were doing?  Jen--was it Jeanette her name?
Speaker 2: Jeni [HistoryMaker Jeni LeGon].
Speaker 1: Jeni.
Speaker 2: I guess she heard a lot but, (unclear) you know--when I came here I went back to California once 'cause I wasn't sure I was gonna stay here and this was, I thought it was the dirtiest place I'd ever seen and having just left beautiful flowers and stuff in Los Angeles [California], and even Chicago [Illinois] had suddenly become clean after I came here and stuff (laughter) and, but then after things started to work for me I, I--actually I had bought a house in California because I'd had this big hit song ['Tan Shoes and Pink Shoelaces'], and I bought his house and I went back and I did--rented it and I decided I was not going to come back, I was gonna stay in New York [New York].  So we didn't really make, have a lot of contact after that, but she was hearing about you know all the time and if I'd go back would be in contact I think she moved to Canada.  She moved to Vancouver [Canada] and she had started a school there and all that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did your mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] think about your success, about what you were doing?
Speaker 2: What did my mother think about it?  She was so proud until it was almost embarrassing (laughter).  She did--of course my dad [Oscar Perkins], too, in the shop you'd, you'd have to stop and at three o'clock and turn on television.  Whoever was in that barbershop had to watch 'Another World' and my mother would do the same thing and then when she started traveling to see the shows, she would actually be in the theater and she would hear people talking around her, my mother would say, "That's my daughter, she wrote it, my daughter wrote it," (laughter).  She--and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] would tell me that she said, "You should hear mother here, she's telling everybody that's your--," (laughter) and she said one of the things she loved about my being on TV was that this way she got a chance to see me all the time and then I started doing commercials and that was another thing, so she loved the fact that she could just--that's when she started watching soaps.  She never watched them before that, yeah, but sh-, this was her way of getting to see her daughter in New York--
Story_ID: 357655
Speaker 1: --All the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We talked about the Grammy Awards, the OBIE Awards [Off-Broadway Theater Awards], the Drama Desk [Drama Desk Awards], but you didn't mention or, or we didn't talk about the NAACP Image Award, when you received that award.
Speaker 1: That, yeah--
Speaker 2: That must've (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that, that was during the co-, playwright, yeah, yeah, that, that's one of my--that's my proud-, that's one of my things I'm most proud of.  I love saying I got the NAACP Image Award, yeah.
Speaker 2: And you love saying that because what does that mean to you?
Speaker 1: Oh, well it, it, because it's recognition from your, your people means that you've done something you've made them proud of and that they respect, and that's important, you know.  Course I'm, I'm very proud too.  A couple of years ago I got the award, Image of Women Now [sic. WIN (Women's Image Now) Award] from AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)], the women's committee of AFTRA, and that's an award for women who made an impression in television or opened doors for people in television or done things first in television, and the people before me like Barbara Walters had gotten the award, Angela Lansbury.  All those people had come and I'd--they decided I was of these people that they wanted to honor and so that, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that's good company.
Speaker 1: --was wonderful, too, you know.  It's--to be like an image for black people but an image for women in general, you know.
Story_ID: 357656
Speaker 1: So when you think of yourself is it hard to separate being a woman versus being black or do you see--I mean how do you see yourself?
Speaker 2: I feel and, and (unclear) civilized way, I, I felt as a woman that what's making a difference in how I was being treated more than I had at any other time, and I felt a lack of respect on the part of the producer, and it was not a happy experience once I left Amas [Amas Musical Theatre, New York, New York]. Amas was a wonderful experience when I was doing it off-Broadway, and once they decided to bring it to Broadway it became a very unpleasant experience for me and a lot of changes were made in the show then that--my, my show did not open on Broadway and--
Speaker 1: Because of all of the changes that have been made?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was just was not my, my show.
Speaker 1: How was that show received, the one that opened on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Well it was called 'It's So Nice To Be Civilized' ['It's So Nice To Be Civilized: A Neighborhood Musical,' Micki Grant], and I don't think I was treated in a very civilized manner (laughter) after the critics said--I--it was the first time I had ever gotten bad reviews, so I guess--my mother [Gussie Cobbins Perkins] was here, my mother was here because the revival of 'Your Arms Too Short' ['Your Arms Too Short to Box with God,' Vinnette Carroll] had just opened the night before.  I had two show openings back to back, which is kind of a first, too, I guess, and so my mother was in town for both, and my sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy], and so after these terrible, terrible reviews came out the next day, my mother said later that I was like the walking dead (laughter), like she said I was like a zombie, I was so stunned, you know, not that I--I knew the show--I was not happy with the show, but I was stunned with--because of what had all gone before with me with all the raves I've gotten from critics.  You know, I had, I had really--I guess I have to be grateful for that.  Sometimes you have to be brought back to earth, you know, but with such a thud (laughter), you know, so anyway--
Story_ID: 357657
Speaker 1: Have you ever worked with any of the artis-, black artistic directors that are around today, oh well George Wolfe [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe] isn't around anymore as an artist director, but like George Wolfe, [HistoryMaker] Kenny Leon (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would love to work with George Wolfe.  George Wolfe never asked me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Kenny Leon in Atla-, or I think he was in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Kenny Leon, I was involved with Kenny Leon for quite a few weeks or months in terms of bringing my show back to Broadway, but I don't think he's involved any more in that project.  He's gone on to something else, he's a very busy man.  He's a star and--
Speaker 1: Did you ever work with August Wilson or ever meet him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I almost have to--brought that picture out with me and August.  Well I would always meet up with him at the National Black Theatre Festival, he attended several times.  Yeah, so as a matter of fact, he made the first--and it became quite a sensation, it was repeated--he got into sort of a debate with one of the other artistic directors at his school because he was talking about the blacks in theater and how they had to do their own thing and this--he made this fiery speech at the National Black Theatre Festival, the international colloquium, which they had just started, and he was the first speaker, and they reprinted it in the American theater magazines, and it became (laughter) quite a cause to him.
Story_ID: 357658
Speaker 1: And I was the second speaker the following year so that's the reason I say it, I followed August Wilson (laughter), you know, and mine was on the image of black women in black theater, you know, and how, and how they were treated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what did you have to say?
Speaker 1: I, I talked about the fact that--in fact it ended up being called and that's what all the papers quoted, First Person Plural--that we had to start telling our own stories and not leaving it to other people to tell our stories and I talked about the fact that we were not just stick figures, you know, we were three-dimensional people and I quoted from some of the, the papers that talked about women in general being in, in some s-, having their own agenda per, per se, or, or being restricted in some way because they were women, and black women in particular, and then I, I said that we are as much a part of the world and, but we come from our own point of view and that's why we have to start telling things from our own point of view.  It's--actually it, it, it was very, very well received.  I was, I was writing right up to the last minute, and they had to persuade me to do it.  Larry Leon Hamlin called and he had the man in charge, an African professor there who was in charge of the colloquium.  He called me and I said, "Oh, gads, the keynote speaker at the collo--," you know, and I, but once I got, once I found, I said, that's always the main thing for a writer.  You have to find that thing in which you wanna hinge everything else you wanna say.  Once I found it--it ju-, I, I--you know, that morning I got up and I was still--because things are still going on in my head and I, I could say it.  My sister [Hattie Perkins Murphy] would--attended that, that festival [National Black Theatre Festival].  I think it was probably her second festival.  She was so proud and she was sitting in the audience, oh and then, and then that, the next day--and I had lunch at [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou's house, yeah, 'cause the night before I had just gotten the Living Legend Award, and she invited--let's see [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks was there and Vinie Burrows, and it was a nice little gathering.  She invited some of us 'cause she had gone (unclear)--she had worked with Vinie in 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet] it's a--I think a lot of people don't even know that Maya was involved in acting and on the stage.  Yeah, when I came here [New York, New York] she was in 'The Blacks' (laughter).
Speaker 2: I've seen her actually do one acting thing, and it was actually something that had been recorded that I saw through television or film or radio whatever and it was a skit she did with, with Richard Pryor.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'm, I'm like that's Maya Angelou (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'd like to see it, I know, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But it was, yeah it was, it was a good skit, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 357659
Speaker 1: You said that you were a history buff--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I'm just gonna sort of start to wrap it up now, and then we'll make the corrections.  Why do you, why do you feel history is important?
Speaker 2: I think it, it's kind of hard to know where you're going if you don't know where you've been.  I think that's glib, but that's true ,you know.  If, if you're walking down a road and you have to make a turn or go back if you haven't, can't figure out f-, which way you came from (laughter) you know you're, but I have always been fascinated by history because for me it's like opening, opening my eyes, opening, opening the world, opening the  background and I, I say this in terms of the world in general, not just black, even in school you know I would get dates I could tell you now when the Nazis invaded Poland, September 1, 1939.  I mean it's things like--it's, sometimes I see things in terms of what happened at that time.  I see things in terms of the--my first Broadway show ['Tambourines of Glory,' Langston Hughes] was the year that Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot, you know.  I was doing a commercial for Maxwell House coffee when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.  I was sitting in the studio and I, I all that, the dates and history and all that--what is going on at that time when you were doing this and that?  Well I may not have been here when John Brown was trying to help you know, but I know he got hanged for it, you know what I mean?  There was a man even at that time and this is a white man got hanged for trying to you know free--it's, it's--I just think it's fascinating.  I almost majored in history (laughter).
Story_ID: 357660
Speaker 1: Do you have any hopes or dreams for the African American community moving forward?
Speaker 2: I hope that we will appreciate each other and who we are.  I love it that there are a lot of people coming up in the corporate ladder now, and yet at the same time I hear people saying yet somehow they're betraying us, but that's, that's wrong.  I mean what white--we fought for all this kind of thing all these years.  I love it when I see young people making their way.  If they want to be investment bankers or whatever, and what I--for me I, I want to see an appreciation and that starts--that's first, that's where everything starts and appreciation of self which is what I tried to do in 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.'  The appreciation of self, I keep going back to that one, maybe that's why it's my favorite, you know, and that's, that's what I'd like to see because you have to--before other people can appreciate you, you must have an appreciation for yourself and your accomplishments and what you can do and be proud of it, and I have--I don't know how, I don't know why, but I have always had that.  I always felt that and I think it's my family's situation.  My family is a very proud, but not in, not in the negative sense of family.  They love each other, they're very tight knit, they think they're special, you know, and it's that whole thing about our family reunions and coming together.  We--people come from all over to join our family reunions who are not in our family 'cause they've never seen a family as tight as ours, so we've always sort of had an appreciation.  So I guess I never grew up with a feeling that I was inferior or this--I was always told I had to be twice as good, but then I always felt I could be twice as good, you know.  I worked at it, and, and--not that I always was but I, I didn't get frightened by it, you know.  Okay, okay I have to be twice as good, okay I will, you know.
Story_ID: 357661
Speaker 1: Well you spoke about your family, and I guess now is a good place for to make a couple of corrections and things that we--we stated before that you've since realized were switched about.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, oh, when I said Billy Goolsby, well his name is William Goolsby [ph.] and he and Tyre, yep and I said Tara, is T-Y-R-E, who was a cook and I said something about they have thirteen children or something?
Speaker 1: Between the two of them, right.
Speaker 2: They had (laughter) six, and we and, and we were positive that two of them or one of them was my [maternal] great-grandfather 'cause there's nothing in our, in our--we've gone back and researched the history.
Speaker 1: One of them is Goolsby?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we've gone back and researched thoroughly and Tyre was not listed as being, having jumped the broom with anybody so he had six, that we do know.  That she had these six children and one of them was--and when, when he died, he left the--to--her name was Anna Sarrow [ph.], S-A-R-R-O-W, his wife.  Everything was left to her, they had about six, five or six kids themselves, and when she died, he didn't leave a will, just everything went to her, and before she died she had left a will and in the will at one point she, she to one of her sons, she's, she's giving the Negro boy Jacob [ph.] to so and so and she said, "My Negro boys," blah, blah.  She simply said a Negro, the Negro and then she said my Negro and this is the wife of Billy you know, so and one of these was George [ph.], and she said, "They are free to go to whomever they want," but in the family, you know.  And so George married at that time, you could marry someone at another plantation.  He married her name, real name was Mary Jane Davenport [ph.], both of these people had come from England.  One had come from Lincolnshire [England] and the other, the Davenports I think, came from London [England], but anyway he married, they called her Jennie [ph.].  He married Jennie from the Davenport plantation, they could just--he could visit her.  They had six children during slavery, while they were still slaves, and then they were freed in 1863, and they had three more children so they had nine, and then and when Jennie died about four or five years later he married, her name was Sarah Echols, E-C-H-O-L-S, and I think she was about nineteen or something, and they had ten, and I think a couple of them--child--died in childbirth, but from the first marriage to Jennie, Matilda [ph.] was the oldest was born.  Matilda married William Eberhardt [ph.].  I don't know as much about him, but Matilda and William Eberhardt had Minnie Eberhardt [Minnie Eberhardt Cobbins], who was my grandmother.  So Minnie was a direct descendant from George Washington Goolsby.
Story_ID: 358073
Speaker 1: We were just--I said you should write, you know, some sort of story based on your history because it's so interesting and with music, and then I asked what type of music or instruments would they have used--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or played and then you told me so let's add that.
Speaker 2: Well, I was saying when--quite often they would make it a practice to separate slaves from different areas of Africa because they did speak each other's language, and that was to keep them from communicating and plotting and then they'd have to sort of learn this little English bit by bit and you'd know what they were saying, and so the slaves they had--drum, they would communicate with drums or beating on things that they'd make their drums and they would talk to each other with the drums, and they took the drums away when they discovered what they were doing, and, and, you know, now that we have this they have the use of hands and their feet and like sitting church like when you hear spirituals now (making sounds and beats) and so that, that foot is going, that's the downbeat, upbeat, downbeat, upbeat, so what people wonder why black people are always clapping off the beat, you know.  It's not really off the beat 'cause our foot is keeping that other beat, you know (making sounds), but that's because we--that's the way we had to keep our rhythm, the rhythm, we kept the rhythm but we had to make our own rhythm 'cause we couldn't make with the drums, you couldn't beat it because they were suspicious of everything, and that's history, that's why I love history so.  Where did that backbeat come from, why is that so intrinsic to, to our people when they say other people are clapping okay, you know, we have to teach them how to clap off the beat (laughter), you know--
Speaker 1: What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but it's because that's the way we did it.  We kept our beat--
Story_ID: 358074
Speaker 1: What haven't you done that you still want to do?
Speaker 2: I want to do--because that's one of the things I saw, and that is my realization that hasn't been realized yet.  I've done television movies, but I've never done a big screen movie and I still would like to do that.  The other thing I would like to do is really become proficient on the keyboard so when I sit down I know it, I know what I'm doing.  I sometimes can dream of myself playing concertos.  I know I'll never be a concerto but at least I should be able to play, (singing), "It takes a whole lotta human," (laughter), you know, but--
Speaker 1: What have you done (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) those are the two things I really would like to do.
Speaker 1: What have you done that surprised you, that you've been able to accomplish it?
Speaker 2: I guess maybe, but as I said before, writing as much as I have by, by stretching myself as much as I have, my experimenting and going in places that I really hadn't you started, you know starting from that folk thing to I've gone into complicated kind of things now and that I've--feeling confidently really, feeling confident that I can just about write whatever I want to.
Story_ID: 358075
Speaker 1: Well when it comes time to start thinking about a legacy what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I would like, I would like for people to feel like I feel about Barbara Jordan like, that she made us proud and then I would like for people to smile when they, you know, (unclear) because they feel good.
Story_ID: 358076
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The best job you've had as an actor?
Speaker 2: I, I, I think--
Speaker 1: 'Having Our Say' ['Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years,' Ellen Mann] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As a--no, I was going to say, as a young, as a young actress it was 'The Gingham Dog.' It's the first time I really carried a great adult lead and, and--
Speaker 1: What was the name of that play?
Speaker 2: 'The Gingham Dog' by Lanford Wilson, and I, I created the role in Boston [Massachusetts], when they brought it to Broadway I, I wasn't a name at the time.  They first brought in Cicely Tyson, and then two weeks later they brought in Diana Sands, and I had gotten the reviews of life, but I hadn't gotten the name of life, you know.  The next one would be 'Having Our Say,' which is another point in my life, you see?  These are two points in my life.  This was my best job as a, as a young actress and it was a very, very complicated story, it was a story of a dissolving mixed marriage that was on the verge of dissolving when it opens.
Speaker 1: Which is why it's called 'The Gingham'--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and when it opened on Broadway, George Grizzard was doing the lead, and he had read my reviews and he had told my husband [Ray McCutcheon] that: "I can hardly wait to play this with your, your wife," 'cause Diana was only supposed to stay five weeks and I was supposed to go in, but it didn't last five weeks.
Speaker 1: The show didn't last five weeks?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Why do you think the show didn't last?  The subject matter (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there was a relationship that had, remember the relationship I told you about, and I'm not saying it's because a, because a critic said it much later when I was getting an award at the Drama Desk [Drama Desk Awards].  He was president of the Drama Desk; he had seen it in, in Washington [D.C.].  He--I was getting an award for something entirely different.  He brought that show up at the luncheon.  He said I saw [HistoryMaker] Micki Grant do 'The Gingham,' and blah, blah, blah, and if they had that brought that cast here the show would not have closed.  So that's--it was a very special relationship.  You had to see that they had there was something between these two people before you know and it's some-, and it's the same thing happened with Lizan [Lizan Mitchell] and me, that's why I knew I could not recreate that with just anybody and Lanford, you know, you can ask Lanford Wilson, he's spoken about it because he came to Washington to see it.
Story_ID: 358077
Speaker 1: What other playwrights have you worked with that you have enjoyed their work, I mean Lanford Wilson's a great writer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was, it was a real treat to work with Leonard Bernstein, you know, for him to be there at the piano and telling when he wrote this and why this and that and then when I did the 'The Cradle Will Rock' [Mark Blitzstein], the concert version at Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York], and he, he was playing the piano, which is the way they had originally done it back in the '20s [1920s], Mark Blitzstein played his own score, so Leonard Bernstein played the score and I, I hadn't been here that long and I did the role of Ella Hammer and then the audience just went on clapping forever and forever and he got up from the piano and came back to help me from the second row and brought me back out to take another bow.  I would've been sitting there 'til now, you know, (laughter) I didn't know--I didn't know I was supposed to get up and take another bow, he got up from the piano (unclear), but to be on an intimate basis and talk one-on-one with s-, I mean, these are people--I remember growing up as a kid one of my favorite actresses because I just thought she had this great voice.  You've probably never seen her, Ann Sheridan, she was a movie star that used to play--like the George Rafts and the Humphrey Bogarts in, in that era, you know.  I was on 'Another World,' and she was on for period of time and I was sitting down, having lunch with her.  I couldn't believe I was sitting having lunch with Ann Sheridan, I saw--you know (laughter), but you wanted to know what my--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, hold on did you ever work with [HistoryMaker] Melvin Van Peebles?
Speaker 2: I never worked with Melvin but I--
Speaker 1: You knew him?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah we have great respect for each other.  I, I you know we relate to each other but I, I--
Speaker 1: Did you see his work when it was on Broadway?
Speaker 2: No, I, I saw 'Don't Play Us Cheap' [Melvin Van Peebles], I didn't see 'Ain't Supposed to Die' ['Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,' Melvin Van Peebles].  I saw 'Ain't Supposed To Die' recently at the Classical Theatre of Harlem, but I saw 'Don't Pay Us Cheap' was right there on Broadway at the time and I was through so we--I got a chance to go and see it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you see, I'm sure you did, but the, the when he made the big splash movie 'Sweetback, Buck'?  What is it, 'Sweetback's' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'Sweet Sweetback's Badass' ['Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song']?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know I didn't, I don't know what I was doing, but if I knew the year I could tell you exactly what I was doing as I said because I did a lot of regional work at one point.  I was, I was out of town a lot.  I worked Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Boston [Massachusetts], Washington [D.C.], Chicago [Illinois], you know, I did a lot of--
Speaker 1: Would you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that's why I worked so much.
Story_ID: 358078
Speaker 1: Would you say that your career has been, has spanned more in the broader markets than just the secular, sort of African American plays?  Would you say you've--just the regional theaters just there've been plays not particularly black plays?
Speaker 2: Yeah, or, or they have been a black play where there was a particular part.  I did a play at the, the Theatre of Living Arts [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in, in--where there was a part that's written for the black woman in the play, and she was one of the leads and but then no 'cause see I've done 'The World of Sholom Aleichem' [Arnold Perl] where I played the Guardian Angel that's you know.  I've done 'Brecht on Brecht' ['Brecht on Brecht: An Improvisation,' Samuel French], I did 'The Balcony' [Jean Genet], Chantal in 'The Balcony' with the French revolutionary, you know, and they wrote a special song for me to sing so, yeah, I've, I've done a lot things that were not written especially for blacks.
Story_ID: 358079
Speaker 1: Did you ever see any discrimination in your world, in the world of theater, in the world of television, that was directly, you know, related towards you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not really i-, that much in the theater, and like and I said the worst time I had I think it was doing because, because I was a woman, but I remember trying to get housing.
Speaker 1: On the road?
Speaker 2: Right in Washington [D.C.], and the--everybody knew what was happening except me (laughter).  You know we were going around these places and they were telling us no, and they had vacancy signs up, and, and somebody said, we got back in the car and, and the young lady who was playing with me said, "Well we got the shaft again."  Well the two of us were going in, she was black--I was black she was white and we were trying to find a place together so we could share and when she got in she said, "We got the shaft again," and I said, "What, what, what did you--?"  All of a sudden it hit me, maybe I shouldn't be going you know, is that what she's saying that we're being turned down because it?  I, I remember that very well because I, I'm just going along, I'm just so happy I've got this job, I've got (laughter) this is my second professional job.  I'm going here, I'm down here in Washington, D.C., the capital of the nation, and the--wait 'til I tell the folks back home, and I can't--so it's never even occurred to me that the, that Washington at that point would segregate and this was 1963, '3 [1963], 1963, yeah, 1963, can you imagine that?  Yes you can (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Course, of course you can.
Story_ID: 358080
Speaker 1: --Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So the last question I wanna ask, and this is sort of going to rack your brain, but I want you to think about a performance that you--and just think about your career and the performance.  I mean I'm just gonna say performance of a lifetime--when you left the stage you felt, I have given one of the greatest performances of my life.
Speaker 1: I don't know that I felt it when I left the stage, but I felt it when I came to get my bowing audience (laughter).
Speaker 2: Or even that, yes, when you, when you--the moment you can tell I did it, you know, I nailed it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that, that's, that almost wiped me out when I opened Broadway, 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope' because, 'cause number one, here I am starring on Broadway, but I've written all this material so all this, you know, I have to take responsibility for all this and I--but most, but Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] you could take some of the responsibility, Vinnette, but here I am the people around me are singing my stuff and I'm in the middle of it and I come out to take my bow, and it's like--the audience just rose, just--you know it wasn't like a smatter here, and a smatter, just whoosh.  They were on their feet and, and cheering and, and that takes your breath away, it really--and so I, I would have to say that's it of course and when the reviews came out and repeated again like in Washington [D.C.], I didn't expect the reviews I got and that's when I burst out crying, burst into tears, but--and then I remember when Al Green opened in 'Your Arms Too Short' ['Your Arms Too Short to Box with God,' Vinnette Carroll] on Broadway, and I went back stage to say hello, I hadn't seen him in rehearsals or anything and I thought well this is the first time he's gonna meet me, one of the composers.  And I went backstage and he had me sit--wait outside for several minutes, outside his dressing room, and I thought, well.  But then when I thought about it, maybe he had to go in and collect himself.  You know what I mean?  He was not--here his Broadway performance, his debut.  Well it's rough, you have to go, you have to go and sit down for a minute and collect yourself.  It, of course my opening night everybody's flocking backstage, and you know all that, but you still have to have a moment to collect yourself and I said so maybe that's--he's in there or no, being a minister that he is he might be saying, "Thank you, Lord," or whatever, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 358081
Speaker 1: That time standing ovations were meaningful, and I'm saying that to say what?  They have lost a lot of meaning today.  You, you it's you can almost anticipate there's gonna be standing ovations just about--anything you see.
Speaker 2: Well I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But not a real ovation, but I mean people standing.
Speaker 2: --not a real--right, yeah, but I reserve mine (laughter), or, yeah.
Speaker 1: Good, and Vinnette [Vinnette Carroll] used to ask me every night she'd call, you know, "How did the show go," blah, blah, blah.  "Did they stand?"  Because if you said, "Yes," that meant something, that meant something if you said, "Yeah I think the whole audience stood."  Then that meant that there was a great show.  I, I don't think it has, it's almost like obligatory.
Speaker 2: It is almost like obligatory.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You see, well you know why you paid a hundred bucks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you don't know what you're--
Speaker 2: --to sit in that seat.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: They'd better make me stand.  And but the last thing I wanna say about just the standing and, and this is also, you know, with 'The Color Purple' [Marsha Norman], I think I stood because I had never seen in my life a play where the end--well I guess I had, but for something, I don't know something I mean because I've seen all of August Wilson's and the cast was entirely black.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But something about that cast, it seemed black, and it seemed, you know, just--the spiritual aspect of it I thought you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Just the first part, the whole thing wasn't great, but part of it I was like, you know, this like being in a black church in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: And I don't think I've seen that authenticity on Broadway before you know. Well with the people, you know the guy was like a preacher you know, so I stood for them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know who, well I hate--you know who first did this?
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: Well, there, there's a whole scene, there's a whole scene in--well before 'Tambourines of Glory' [Langston Hughes], you know the, the lead, leading player Hilda Simms was playing a preacher, that's why the Clara Ward Singers [The Famous Ward Singers] were in the show.  There's a whole scene in 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope' dedicated to the black church, where I said Sunday morning is a one-day of the week when you don't have to fight, you don't to fight the bus line, you don't have to fight the unemployment line, you don't have to fight with this, you don't have to fight--you know--it's a one-day of the week, every day is gonna be Sunday because for black people that's, that is that, that's the day they get to be called Mr. and Mrs., or sister and brother, and not Janie and Tom, you know what I mean?  And the national--this whole scene and, and that, there's the holy day, that's the first time anybody's seen anybody go along and Alex Bradford was just so great at it, he could just do that little holy dance and then of course there was 'Your Arms Too Short' ['Your Arms Too Short to Box with God,' Vinnette Carroll], which was the quintessential gospel show, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gospel, yeah.  And all of those always get me, but you're right--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --those preceded 'The Color Purple.'
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And you had, and you had the master you had Alex Bradford in the show and Bobby Hills [ph.], and (unclear) else but they were great gospel--Alberta Bradford, his wife you know but we left, but first we had at the beginning of the show, then we switched it totally and put it at the end.
Speaker 2: Which is--
Speaker 1: Because that's what left people, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 358082
Speaker 1: Leave us with something, leave us with a song, leave us with something you've written that's meaningful.  Play--can you play three of those chords?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Those three chords and--
Speaker 2: Oh gads.
Speaker 1: Or just leave us with something?
Speaker 2: All right.  There's a song ['Fighting for Pharaoh'], which seems to me that's as meaningful today as it was the day that I wrote it, and I'll just do, of course when I start doing it I start doing the whole thing, and actually I was turned on to writing it because of one line from 'Bury The Dead' [Irwin Shaw], and these corpses that don't want to be buried are saying, we are all here we've been planning for Pharaoh and we've been fighting for these people, and I just took that one line, fighting for Pharaoh, 'cause it--and I started--I did it as a folk song when it in the show ['Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope'] it went in as a gospel 'cause Alex [Alex Bradford] was doing it.  (Singing), "History's pages say man through the ages has never run short of war, for he's always found something worth fighting and killing and dying for. (Making sounds) Fighting for Pharaoh, fighting for Caesar, fighting for good King Arthur, fighting for glory, fighting for power, state or religion, fighting for jurisdiction and territory we've been dying for freedom, dying for slavery, dying for cotton and for oil and gold, dying for country, drying for honor, dying for God and peace and banners on a pole.
