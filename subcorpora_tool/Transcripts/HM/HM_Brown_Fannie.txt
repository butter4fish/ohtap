Story_ID: 123835
Speaker 1: Now this next section is the one that I--I warned you about with the People magazine-ish type questions and the first one asks "What is your favorite food?"
Speaker 2: That's a very interesting question.  What is my favorite food?  Since I like so many I would say my very, very favorite would be cornbread dressing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Dr. Brown, do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is spring because everything is new and growing and blooming.
Speaker 1: Great, and how about a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color from childhood is yellow.
Speaker 1: Great.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination would be a beach anywhere.  Florida, Nassau, Cozumel, just a beach.
Speaker 1: Laughter.  Okay and the last in this series of questions.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have several phrases and sayings that I like.  One that I'm particularly drawn to is a prayer of Jabez asking to "be blessed. My territory to be increased. To keep the Lord's hand on me and keep me from evil and not to hurt anyone in anyway."  And then a second one that I like to live by and it tends to be wonderful for the non-profit arena "for those of you who don't believe it can be done, get out of the way to allow those of us who do believe it can be done to get it done."
Story_ID: 123836
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much for sharing those.  Now this section deals with your family background.  And so I'd like to begin this portion of the discussion by asking if you would tell us about your mother.  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Bertha Grant.  She was also born in Montezuma, Georgia.  And she was born in the early 1900s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did she also grow up in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: All right.  Right there in--
Speaker 2: In Montezuma.
Speaker 1: --Montezuma (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  And what do you know about her background and her growing up?  Did she ever talk about your grandparents or did you know your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well fortunately for me I did know my paternal grandparents--maternal grandparents and lived with them.  Actually my mother and the whole family lived with my grandparents so I know a lot about them growing up.  Her life was of course quite simple.  She was born in 1933 so times were hard.  They really didn't have a lot.  They didn't live in the City of Montezuma, they lived in a rural area.  And my father [Marvin Grant] unfortunately migrated to--and I say unfortunately because it left her in a--at a deficit but migrated here to Akron, Ohio, to find work and therefore my mother had to move in with my grandparents.  And so times were hard.  Things were hard.  So she lived a very difficult life.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: Now when does that migration take place with your father coming to Akron?
Speaker 2: It took place around the mid to early '50s [1950s], like early '50s. My mother had a set of twins.  And after that my father migrated with the intention of finding work to send back to get my mom and to move her to the Akron community.  And those plans did not work out in that either she was not ready to go or I think there was a little rift between their relationship so she didn't move at that time.  And then my father would come back from time to time.  So he did come back and she (laughter) got pregnant with my sister and I which is a second set of twins that my mother had and raised there.  And we really didn't move to the Akron community to reunite with my father until the summer of '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I need you to go back to Georgia--(laughter) (simultaneous) for a little while.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: -- But I just wanted to get a sense of when those major changes were taking place.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --All right.  Again, 1940s because you said your mother was born in 1933.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the Great Depression.  You said it was a difficult time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they didn't have a lot.
Speaker 2: Right--
Story_ID: 123837
Speaker 1: You said also you knew your grandparents so I wanted to make sure that your maternal grandparents' names were included as part of this record too.
Speaker 2: Okay and I very much like that because I think of all of the people in my life.  The one who influenced me the most was my grandfather.  And his name was Willie B. Causey [ph.].  And my grandmother's name was Birdia, B-I-R-D-I-A, Causey [ph.].  And they raised my mother [Bertha Grant] and nine other childrens--children and in the later part of their lives, we as a family lived with them.  So I was very, very close to my grandfather and my twin sister was very, very close to my grandmother.  So I glean a lot from him and to this day--you know most times I'm emotional as I talk about him and his influence and impact upon me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what--what was it, excuse me, that was so special about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Well with me, he spent a lot of time with me.  If I had issues, you know, we would be together and have--sometimes I would try to keep them from him and he would just get me talking and share what was bothering me and I would do that and then he would you know, with his wisdom, give me something that--that would assist it and it was his demeanor with me.  He was very gentle and quiet and soft.  Now although there were times when he raised his voice.  The times that he raised his voice with me were very minimal and yet--I could tell that I was his favorite and (laughter) it was just special, it was a special relationship.
Speaker 1: Good.  Now I'd like to ask also about growing up as you said in your grandparents' home.  What were holidays like?
Speaker 2: Holidays were fun.  Because in--in those days, unlike today, we didn't have all of the commercialized materials.  We created our own.  For an example, for Christmas we would go out and--to holly bushes.  We could actually pull our decorations from true live holly bushes and evergreen trees and make our wreathes and make our swags and so it was a very, very festive time.  We lived in Georgia so we had pecans aplenty.  So you know before Christmas where everybody would be at home shelling pecans for the cakes and the pies and all of that.  So you know everything leading up to it was exciting.  And as a special treat my mother would always get sparklers, which now we cannot do because it's a fire hazard.  But you know in Georgia it would be warm and that was a special treat.  Every kid would have two.  One in each hand.  And we would run up and down the lane with our sparklers.  (laughter)  And then quickly get our baths and go to bed so we can wake up to presents.  So it was a wonderful time.  And Easter was always exciting because we always had parts and--to recite on Easter Sunday.  And at that time our church only met once a month.  And so if another church of a different denomination had a program then although we were Methodist then we would have a part in the Baptist church (laughter) choir or play or whatever they were having--presentation.  And that was always exciting time.  And then my three sisters, well there were four of us since we're two sets of twins, there were three girls and one boy.  We had our own little singing group.  And if we didn't--sometimes we'll each have a part and we would sing as a group together also.  So we would always look forward to that.  Most times my mother could do a makeshift Easter basket.  I know she did her best.  And sometimes we would have those or sometimes we wouldn't, but we would always have candy at Easter time.  Thanksgiving was not a--a very festive time.  You know it wasn't like a big party or anything at our home.  Of course we would have Thanksgiving dinner but that would be about it.  I can recall some Thanksgiving not even having the family together.  It was just a regular day.  Some of them were.  Some of them were not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fourth of July was exciting so holidays were fun.  There were times because we were so poor we worked in the morning of July 4 and then had a little bit of celebration in--in the afternoon.  And there were some times where we didn't have anything on the Fourth of July.  But when we did they were festive.
Story_ID: 123838
Speaker 1: Well Dr. Brown you mentioned that there were four children--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --in the family and I'd like also have their names be a part of this record as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well my older brother and sister, their names are, and he's a reverend now, Reverend Bobby Joe Grant.  And his twin sister is Barbara Ann Grant.  My twin sister's name is Jenny L. Grant.  And mine, of course, Fannie L. Brown at this point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I--I wonder because I--I still want to get information of both your mother's [Bertha Grant's] childhood and your childhood because you're both pretty much raised in the same household (laughter), by the same people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --while your father [Marvin Grant] is seeking employment in Akron [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but comparing the 1950s--
Speaker 2: Un hun.
Speaker 1: --the era of your childhood with the 1930s.  The difficult days where your mother is coming of age.  Did she often say that "well our holidays (laughter) weren't this festive" or "that we didn't have the kind of abundance that you have in the 1950s, you should appreciate this?"  Or did she make those kinds of comparisons being in the same setting?
Speaker 2: Well, being children we always wanted what we didn't have and we always wanted what we saw other children had and she would make general comparisons, but not a lot of specific things.
Speaker 1: Um.
Speaker 2: And very much the comments that you mention, you know, that you know in my day we didn't have a lot and we didn't have this and I only had one doll or something like that.  And most of my clothes were hand me down and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when I ask about the holidays, the special festive occasions that you mentioned were both religious holidays, Christmas and Ester, especially.  Now was the church really central in your life as a child and in the life of your--your mother and your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Oh very much so, very much so.  Though we only had services once a month, I mean that was a very sacred time and there was nothing about missing it.  I mean when Sunday morning came and it was our--the third Sunday of the month, you were up getting ready to go to church.  And then fortunately we had two denominations operating in our household.  We were Methodist.  My mother, grandfather [Willie B. Causey] and all of the children were Methodist.  My grandmother [Birdia Causey] was Baptist and so she went to a different church.  So we would, of course, go to the Methodist church on the third Sunday of the month.  And then when the Baptist met then we would go to the Baptist church (laughter).  So--and then there were you know the other two Sundays of the month we would find someplace else to go.  So we--we were always in church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unlike church today, we didn't have several services, we had one service and that was that.  But it was a central part of our growing up.  You know the singing of the songs, you know making sure that we had a part in every presentation, going, being there.  They had a lot of activities, choir rehearsal, those who could sing.  We were smaller so we didn't go but then my mother was a member of the choir.  When my brother and sister got older my brother sang, my sis--my older sister didn't.  So church was a central part of--of our lives.
Speaker 1: Un hun.
Speaker 2: You know as young people and I--we never got away from it.
Story_ID: 123839
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that--that there were two denominations, one Methodist and one Baptist.  Did--but I wonder do you remember the names of those two churches?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The Methodist church was Barren Lane A.M.E.--African Methodist Episcopal--and then the Baptist church was Piney Grove Baptist Church [Macon County, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And you said the church only met one Sunday--
Speaker 2: (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --out of the month.  Why was that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was because of the ministers.  They were traveling ministers at that time.  And they assigned a minister a territory and they could not travel--and it was a wide territory unfortunately, so they travel each Sunday to a different church.  And therefore we ended up with our services, the ones that I can remember, the third Sunday of the month.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is this a rural community down in Montezuma, Georgia, or is it a town, or a big city?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a very, very small town--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the church was rural.  The church was in you know a rural part kind of north of the city.  So I can't even estimate the number of folks in the little town but not very many at all.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: A one-stoplight town.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well that's sort of an estimate (laughter) at least for me.
Speaker 2: That helps.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay but and I wonder also about something else that you mentioned.  You said your mother [Bertha Grant] was a member of the choir and the children had a singing group.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how did that come together?
Speaker 2: Well we were very, very small and of course we would watch different groups come to and typically they came to the Baptist church not the Methodist church.  We would watch them and so we decided that we would have our own little singing group and we practice during the week and then we kind of learn to harmonize and we were tiny, six, seven, eig--you know, eight, nine around that age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a name for the group?
Speaker 2: We just called it--they used to call it just the grandkids.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Great.
Story_ID: 123840
Speaker 1: Now I'd like also to get some information on your father's side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of the family.  How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Hmmm, I would describe my father and hopefully there's no relatives out there who would take offense to it.  My papa was a rolling stone.  (laughter)  He was a rolling stone.  He had, of course, us as a family and then when he moved up here he had another family.  And so that was one of the reasons it was--I guess maybe the little rift between my mother and him but that was the way it was.  And so finally after fourteen years, because I was fourteen when I moved here, they were able to get it together again and mend their relationship.  So, he was a man who just kind of lived life to the fullest.  And I think that would be the best way to describe it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a good person.  He was you know--he just--there were just different phases in his life that brought about different experiences for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Marvin Grant.
Speaker 1: All right.  And was he also a native of Georgia?
Speaker 2: He was a native of Georgia.  Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he was.
Speaker 1: That same community?
Speaker 2: Same community, different county.  We lived in Macon County, Georgia, one that's well known nationally.  But he lived just above us and I believe it was--oh I can't think of the name of the county [Peach County, Georgia], but it was mostly near Fort Valley and you know there's a state college there and it was between like Fort Valley and Marshallville which are two towns north of Montezuma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were your father's parents also in Georgia while you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.  But unfortunate we didn't see a lot of them because even though they were, I would say about twenty miles away, without ready transportation it was difficult for us to see 'em so we didn't see 'em a lot.  I would estimate that we probably saw them maybe eight times a year.
Speaker 1: Good.  And what are their names, please?
Speaker 2: See that would be very interesting because we call them by their nicknames and so I never really knew their real names.  (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Nicknames are fine.
Speaker 2: Nicknames are fine?
Speaker 1: Well yes it's your story.  (laughter) So you'll--
Speaker 2: It is my story--
Speaker 1: --know what it means (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and you know I kind of embarrassed to--to say that I never really knew their real names but he was called Mr. Plug [ph.].  Plug Grant.  And she was called Ms. Delp [ph.].  And that's the way we addressed them and --
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the Grant grandparents?
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Okay for record.
Speaker 2: --the father's grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know my--my father's parents.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 123841
Speaker 1: And I also wanted to ask is this--you said this pretty much a rural community there in Montezuma [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or a small town with one stoplight?  But is your family a farming family or they engaged in other kinds of activities?
Speaker 2: We engaged in farming but not as sharecropping type.  We were just engaged in farming to supplement food sources.  We always had a vegetable garden, an extensive one, with my grandfather [Willie B. Causey] at the helm.  So we always had lots and lots and lots to eat and therefore we had lots and lots and lots to do in the summer to prepare it.  We canned some, we froze some and cooked some.  And he had, of course, animals.  And he would slaughter animals.  And we would process the meat.  And that would keep us over the winter.  So we farmed but not to make a living but just you know to supplement our food sources.
Speaker 1: Okay so a small farm?
Speaker 2: Very small, very small--
Speaker 1: Un-huh.
Speaker 2: --I would say he had access to three to five acres.  You know when you're planting three to five acres is a lot.  And he planted a--a variety of different foods.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is it fair to say it's subsistence farming or again do people have day jobs or (laughter) or in the farming is sort of on the side?  Or is it sort of a family enterprise that you have a farm that is sort of self-sufficient?
Speaker 2: Well, to--to further explain, my grandfather was a caretaker of a farm for another gentleman.  He maintained--you know this farmer had herds of cattle and of course a barn and a few horses.  And he maintained that for him for a fee.  And that was his livelihood.  And then he had access to the land to plant whatever he wanted.  My grandmother [Birdia Causey] was a stay-at-home caretaker, homemaker, and my mother [Bertha Grant] worked outside as a domestic on day-to-day basis.  She worked for one entity one day and another, another day.  And she was careful about planning to make sure that she had a person to care for each day of the week so that she could actually work five days a week.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sometimes six.
Story_ID: 123842
Speaker 1: Un-huh--
Speaker 2: And you mentioned earlier in our discussion that sometimes on the Fourth of July [July 4], the children would work and then the celebration would begin.  So is that farm work also that the children were involved in?
Speaker 1: Yes it was farm work, but it was farm work for other entities.  In Georgia, of course, it's known as the peach state.  So in the summer there were a lot of peaches to pick.  And we would, of course, if there were peaches to pick and--and there were field owners all over the place and they always had different grades of peaches so you know you could work for one the first part of the week and another the second part of the week.  It all depended on when the peaches were ripe.  And so of course, if there was work to do, we would do that on the Fourth of July and then come home and then have a very, very nice meal.  But you know if work--if there was work to do you worked.
Speaker 2: Okay
Speaker 1: There was no--you had no option as a child.  You know you couldn't say "I don't want to do that today".  That was what you were going to do.
Speaker 2: Great.  Now did you find that you were able to combine work and school or did the work stop during the school year?
Speaker 1: Wow that's a very, very interesting question.  And you're catching a big part of my history.  A piece that I really didn't like.  I really enjoyed school.  And there were all different types of crops in the South: cabbage, peaches, peas, cotton and so because we were very poor, you know we were among the population to do that kind of work and we did it.  And my mother [Bertha Grant] would take one of us out of school one day of the week you know and we would work with her while the other three would go to school.  And so that was a time that I hated because I loved school and I never wanted to take a day out.  I could find zillions of excuses why I had to go to school that (laughter) day but sometimes--sometimes it worked but not very often (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --unfortunately.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So that's a very interesting question and I think even to this day you know I enjoy the learning process and I think some of those early days had something to do with my--I--I just have a passion for learning, a passion for being in that environment.
Story_ID: 123843
Speaker 1: Now you said you were fourteen--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you left the South--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: --and came to Akron [Ohio] to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for the family to be reunited.  Did you continue to work and pursue education with a passion once you came up north to Ohio?
Speaker 2: Well, when we moved to--to Akron, of course, there was no kind of--no work like that to do, no farming.  And too young to get a work permit so I didn't really work when I came here just went to school--you know during the academic term September through June.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned a work permit--
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: --within the context of this discussion about the North.  Were there any labor laws in the South to say who was (laughter) too young to work and who was not?  (simultaneous) Or did people--
Speaker 2: I believe--
Speaker 1: --or did people not concern themselves with that?
Speaker 2: --there were laws--laws existed but people didn't concern themselves with it.  No one enforced them.  And none of the parents cared because summer was a time for them to--to build their financial resources for the winter.  My mother [Bertha Grant]--we would work all summer, and she would save the money and those dollars would take us through the winter.  And you know it was just the way things were.  Nobody questioned it.  You know you--there were no entities, no legal entities, no lawyers, nobody from any social service agencies coming around saying that you know you are violating child labor laws.  You worked.  That was the way it was.  And we were like many, many families during that time and none of them had anything to say because they wanted you to work.
Speaker 1: Now Dr. Brown, we have about a minute left on this first tape, but I do at least want to mention the names of those schools where you acquired that passion for learning before we wrap this up and then we'll talk about your early life in the North.  And the names of the southern schools please?
Speaker 2: My elementary school, that name was--was D.F. Douglas Elementary School [Montezuma, Georgia] where I went and then in junior high I went to a training school and it was called Macon County Training School [Macon County, Georgia].
Story_ID: 123844
Speaker 1: Okay, Dr. Brown, you said you migrated to Akron, Ohio, along with your family when you're fourteen years old and that's about 1968?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you also said at the end of the last segment that there was no farm work in Akron (laughter) and at least none expected of fourteen-year-olds.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, did you continue to--to work in any kind of job or were you able to focus on that education that you were so passionate about?
Speaker 2: Well, we were able to focus on education because there were no jobs.  I mean we--you couldn't at my age at fourteen you couldn't get a work permit until you were sixteen to work in restaurants or things like that so we really didn't do any work, we just kind of stayed home and looked for experiences like trips to the library in the summer and just went to school, of course, during the academic term.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said your father [Marvin Grant] had initially come to Akron in search of employment.  Did he realize that dream of finding a better job here in Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a bitter--bittersweet realization also because he came and he found work cause my father was a very, very hard worker prompt, dedicated, committed.  And so he found a work at a foundry and that foundry's name is Twentieth Century Heating and Ventilating.  And they just made a lot of castings with a lot of that asbestos dust.  And he worked there until he retired.  And unfortunately that was the very thing that killed him.
Speaker 1: The retirement or the asbestos?
Speaker 2: The asbestos.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know it was a part of his lungs and--and during that time there were no OSHA requirements.  And they weren't required to wear masks or to kind of prevent that from going into their lungs.  And so he held quite a bit of it in so at the end you know his lungs were literally destroyed.
Speaker 1: Okay. And when did your father pass away?
Speaker 2: My father passed away in April of '98 (1998).  So he's been dead about seven years now.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: But he--he lived to see his children become adults?
Speaker 2: Yes he lived to see his children become adults yes--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --and you know some strain relationships but toward the end all mended which was very, very important to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 123845
Speaker 1: And how about your mother's [Bertha Grant's] experiences in the North, does she continue to work once the family moves to Akron [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother has an interesting work history.  After moving to Akron, she was able to get employment with Kent State University [Kent, Ohio].  So she worked as a maid at Kent State until she retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes and she worked evenings.  So it was kind of hard for her but she did.  That's--that was what she did.
Speaker 1: All right.  And did she--did the family stay in the Akron area?
Speaker 2: Yes, we--we remained in the Akron community.  My mother bought a house while working at Kent State University.  Still lives in that house today.  We as children, have moved around different suburbs of Akron but very, very close to Akron and because you know we all work in Akron so we need access, quick access so we didn't move too far away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when I think of Kent, I think of college town.  Very different from Akron which big university here too, but what was that commute like every evening for your mother?  You said it was difficult for her to work those evenings (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well it was difficult for my mother because at the time she could not drive and there were buses and different groups who would actually drive employees to the location to work and then pick them up.  Then there were like carpools.  There are people who had vans.  They would take a large number six to eight people working there, you know, those folks who either couldn't drive or didn't drive or didn't have any kind of transportation to get them there, like they would create this carpool.  And then you know like I said there was a taxi of sorts that would actually just kind of contract like a verbal contract with six to eight people and it would take 'em back and forth.  And because of that my mother learned to drive.  So she has a very, very interesting history.  She is very feisty and aggressive when she needs to be.  And she had difficulty, you know sometimes the taxi would show up and sometime it wouldn't show up and she got angry one day and said "I'm learning to drive."  (Laughter)  And she learned to drive and started driving herself (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 123846
Speaker 1: Now Dr. Brown, what are some of the earliest memories you have of--of living in Cleve--I'm sorry not in Cleveland (laughter) we are in Ohio near Cleveland but in Akron [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Early memories?
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: Early memories would be being at home in the summer.  And because I just had this passion for learning it was just kind of difficult for me to just sit and do nothing so I read every book I could get my hand on, went to the library when I could and wanted just to be successful academically.  And didn't have a lot of opportunities for experiences that could expand my horizons so I was a limited at what I could do in the summer and I always found that to be a difficult part.  And then because my mother [Bertha Grant] didn't drive early on, we didn't have transportation so it was not like we could go to visit or to you know go to the library or go to some of the parks, anything like that.  Fortunately we did have a park just up the street so we could walk to that park.  But you could only do that so often before it became boring.  (Laughter)  So those are the things that I remember during my childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know when moving to Akron at fourteen with not a lot to do but limited but you know I tried to take advantage of whatever I had and that was one thing that my grandfather [Willie B. Causey] told me that you know and again that connection there he told me to take advantage of every opportunity presented to me.  So I tried to find those opportunities and I took advantage of whatever was available.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at fourteen in Akron then, you freed up from some of the work in the summer (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) get bored because you don't have the kind of academic
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --opportunities during those summer months either.
Speaker 2: Trying to make that adjustment to having so much to do and every minute filled and then with limited amount of things to fill all of that time--
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: --so it was adjustment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know, Dr. Brown, a lot of the folks I talked to whose families migrated from the South have fond memories of going home to the South in the summer.  Was that part of your childhood as well, vacations in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately not.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Because we didn't--we didn't travel home and you know it's kind of I guess very similar to what happens today.  We--we would only travel home if we were going to a funeral.  And we didn't make a lot of vacation-like trips or I didn't.  My mother went at one point when my grandparents [Willie and Birdia Causey] were ill and stayed for a little while but I can't remember going back for a vacation.  You know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--we were still too poor to--for vacations.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: All right.  But your grandparents were still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were still alive.
Speaker 1: So were you in touch with them either writing letters or telephone conversation sometimes?
Speaker 2: Periodic telephone calls and periodic, you know, exchanging of cards, birthday cards, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 123847
Speaker 1: I want to ask also about your educational experiences here in Akron [Ohio].  What high school did you attend when you came here at fourteen?
Speaker 2: Coming here at fourteen, I attended Central High School.  It was Central High at the time and now it's Central-Howard High [School, Akron, Ohio].  So I had the pleasure of attending both.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first year or so at Central and then the name changed to Central-Howard High.
Speaker 1: Un huh.  And as a high school student again passionate about learning, did you determine as a--a teenager that you would continue to pursue education beyond the high school diploma?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Because that was another thing coming from my grandparents [Willie B. and Birdia Causey] and other older individuals in Georgia.  They could see early on that I had a--a passion for learning because at that time, you know we worked in the fields like a lot of young kids and the older workers would always ask us you know about our education you know "What are your grades?" and "How are you doing"?  And I would be so proud and take mine in so they would kind of take you under their wings and--and you know they would just utter these I think encouraging and inspiring phrases like you know "You keep that up and you're going to be a very successful person" or "You're a very, very smart." And "You're very bright".  And "You know all you have to do is continue to work".  And those are the things that kid of motivated me so when I got here that was kind of a part of--of my psychic you know it was like whatever you do, you know, do it to the fullest and try to you know be the best that you can be.  And then in the auditorium at Central High School there was a quote from Abraham Lincoln.  "I will study and prepare myself and when the opportunity present itself" I--you know I'm sure that--I'm just paraphrasing that "I will be able to move forward".  And so I would--every time I would go into the auditorium I would see that phrase and it just kind of captured me.  It was like over on the wall, kind of like etched in stone and I would read it and internalized it.  And you know I would then kind of build it on to or attach it to all of those inspiring words coming from my elders in the South like "study, prepare yourself", "study, prepare yourself and one day you will achieve".  And I--of course, coming from the South was concerned about being able to operate or learn or produce at the same level as students in the North.  That was just a big thing to me because I was warned or you know people would share with me that you--you might have difficulty.  They may drop your grade when you go to the North and that kind of thing.  And so I think I even tried harder because of that.  You know the--the one thing that I didn't want to do was to have--to be put back a grade.
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: So you know it was exciting for me.  Again being in a school and keep in mind we were separated, segregated all of that time in the South you know from the time that I was born until I was fourteen I had never gone to school with any kind of diverse population of students.  They were all black.  And then going into a school where the majority of the school--the students were white, it was an adjustment for me.  But fortunately you know I met two saints.  And we just kind of went through together and I'll always remember them because they just kind of took me under their arms and kind of shared with me how to maneuver through.  One's name was Merle [ph.] Cruise and the other was Crystal Tate.  And I've lost touch with them.  I can't find them at this point but--and, and they were both white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know just having that relationship after coming from one where I had no--no relationships with anyone other than black students, it--it was special.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was able to move in the college prep courses and stay there and then move forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So those are two students--
Speaker 2: Two students.
Speaker 1: --who are going to school with you?
Speaker 2: Absolutely in the same grade.
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Story_ID: 123848
Speaker 1: Do you remember any teachers who are especially influential in--on your high school educational experience [Central High School, Akron, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  There was one teacher, my math teacher, Mr. Pareni [ph.] and you know he is a legend in the Akron community cause just--just a long time educator, just committed himself to math.  Could have done a number of other things but just committed to students.  So he helped me to maneuver because math was a difficult topic or subject for me and he didn't make it easy and he didn't make excuses.  You do the work, you get your grade.  You don't do the work, you don't get your grade.  But you can do it.  And he made me believe that I could do it and I did.  And the other one I can almost weep because he was so helpful but never wanted any kind of thanks or gratitude.  I think--I sent him several--I think he accepted them but I saw it as a part of his job and that--that person was a Mr. Carl Goudi [ph.].  He since retired and I believe moved to Florida but he was so helpful to me and inspired me.  I can recall having to take my SAT.  He actually came to my house.  Picked me up.  Took me to Kent State University [Kent, Ohio].  I took my test.  He stayed there while I took it.  Took me back to his house for lunch and then brought me home.  Now that was dedication.  That was a teacher.  And so I just--my heart just goes out to him because I think without him doing that for me that day I would not have been able to get to Kent State University.  And--And that's like that special thing that teachers have that you know see something within a student that the student cannot even identify or see at that time and then give you that little push to keep you moving forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you think that interaction with teachers and the positive experiences at Central had any effect on your decision to pursue post-secondary education?
Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 1: As a career field.
Speaker 2: I think possibly a--a little bit, but my experiences later I think dictated (laughter) what I would do academically you know once I moved into the college ranks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So when did you graduate from Central High School?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty-something long years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 123849
Speaker 1: And by the time of your graduation, had you already decided what college you wanted to attend?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  I was going to attend Kent State University [Kent, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did you live on campus or tried to commute?
Speaker 2: Well actually I didn't attend.  I, I had planned.  That was my--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --that was one of my goals.  I was going to attend Kent State University because my mother worked there and you know there was a possibility at that time that I could get my courses for free.  Well that fell through and I could not.  I was living in the North High School [Akron, Ohio] district but went to Central-Howard [High School, Akron, Ohio].  And this is kind of like a--I think it's a fate story but it's also a vain story also (laughter) at the same time.  I made cheerleader in my junior year and I did not want to go to North High School.  I wanted to cheer at Central-Howard.  And so in order for me to go to Central-Howard, I had to take up a trade.  So I took up drafting and stayed in that program and completed it.  It was a two-year program junior-senior.  And from my senior year since my college desires fell through, my plans, I was able to get an apprenticeship at a company in Barberton [Ohio] called the Babcock and Wilcox Company as a draftsperson.  At that time they called `em draftsman, but that's neither here nor there.  A draftsperson and so I--I went through that program.  It was a long--I think it was like 3,276 hours of time that you had to put in on the job and in the classroom and, and did that and successfully was able to secure my Journeyman License from the State of Ohio as a--a draftsperson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's where I went after--after high school.  And worked there for, had to be about eleven years before I started pursuing my college education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I started out taking classes at the University of Akron and then I transferred to Hiram [College, Hiram, Ohio], took some classes there.  And then eventually completed my undergrad at Malone College [later Malone University] in Canton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in 1990.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 123850
Speaker 1: Now may I ask what kind of work did you do as a draftsperson for eleven years?
Speaker 2: That's quite interesting.  A whole cadre of things.  I started out, of course, on the board drawing and this was before computer-aided design (laughter) so it was like pencils and paper, vellum, and that kind of thing.  So I started out drawing.  And of course, coming in we started out with some of the smaller pieces, A and B size drawings and then eventually up to C and D.  And I did that for a while.  And I had the opportunity then to start it--to process the drawings from the engineering room to the shop.  And I was called an "allocator" although I didn't think I was going much allocating.  My thing was when the--when the drawings came from different departments off the floor, I would take them, make sure we had the number of prints needed to be shifted to the manufacturing facility so that that piece could be produced.  And I had a requirement of everything, you know how many prints should go, when they should go and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And enjoyed that job immensely.  And then after that I became a part number expert.  We were moving from the old manual system to a computer system.  We used to have just large volumes, books with all of our part numbers in it and not really a part number just an item.  If you needed a screw, a bolt, some kind of assembly, it was in a booklet and you just ordered that item.  Well we had to--and, and I'm very proud of the role that I played in that we then converted that booklet to a computerized system assigning all of those little pieces and parts numbers and then we went so far as to put together what we call part numbering assemblies so that you know if you had a, a bolt assembly, you wouldn't have to worry about ordering all the little piece parts because you could label it with just one number.  And so that was a--moving an organization from one era into the next.  And I was very instrumental in that because we trained all of the individuals not only in the Barberton area, but we trained folks in the plants also how to use that system.  So we traveled and that was an exciting job for me because it was all new and then that, that job inspired me then to complete my degree because then that teaching--I don't know excitement, enthusiasm, that desire was heightened at that point because you know I was in front of the classroom teaching people something that was valuable and useful and then all of a sudden I wanted to do it again.  That thing I felt at eight years old, I had to have it again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 123851
Speaker 1: And had the opportunity then to go on to, after completing an undergrad degree, to get a master's degree.  And after completing the master's degree, I had so many credits towards the doctoral degree, I--it was just senseless to stop at that point so I went on and finished the doctorate degree as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now was all of that education completed here in [University of Akron] Ohio?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And you're still working while you're doing all this?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Which was very, very difficult.  But you know I was like a driven person.  I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.  Anybody who wanted to be sane that is.  I was just driven.  It was something that I just had to do.  It was like I was compelled to do it.  Because once that interest was heightened it didn't matter.  It--any--nothing else mattered.  It's just I had to do it.  I was married at the time.  I had young children at the time, so--and I worked also.  Full time in school.  Full time at work and a full time mother.  And I just--I girded up my loins and said "I'm gonna do it.  I don't care what comes, I'm gonna do it."  And it was a difficult time with family because family want you to be there and if I'm--for me it was more important for me to complete an assignment than to go to a family dinner and I chose not to go to dinner, to stay home to make sure that I would prepare the work that I had needed the next week at school.  So, in, in--I still have that excitement today.  If there was an opportunity for me to gain some type of fellowship this minute, I would take it because I just enjoy that, that environment and--and those experiences.  I just do.  I--I can't explain it.  I guess it's like being addicted to something.  You just want to have it and if you get the opportunity you will do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I just want to backtrack a little bit for clarity sake.  You said for a time you--you started out doing "A" and "B" size drawings and then went to "C" and "D"--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --size drawings and I don't know what that means and --
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maybe the people watching the tape won't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Can you just explain, explain briefly what it is that you're drawing and what's the difference between the "A", "B", "C", "D"?
Speaker 1: Okay.  "A" and "B"s are smaller drawings.  An "A" size is like an 8 1/2" by 11" sheet, like a sheet of paper.  A "B" size is double that side by side and a--a "C" is significantly larger.  It's about a--a 20" x 36" and a "D" is of course significantly larger.  It's about maybe 4' by 3' and then there "E"s and "F"s.  Which you know they progressively get bigger and you have more and more views.  On an "A" size typically it would be like one view of a piece.  A "B" size you might have two pieces too.  You might look at the front of it then the side of it.  And then once you get to "C" then you know you have your projections.  You have what it looks like from the top.  What it looks like from the front.  And then what it looks like from the side.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Are these machine parts that you're drawing? Or--
Speaker 1: Yes, these are machine parts.  Sometimes it's one item.  It could be like a massive screw.  Guess you know the work at Babcock and Wilcox dealt with a fossil and energy producing equipment.  And you know you could have a smaller boiler.  One that maybe generated heat for school and then you could have massive like three and four huge boilers that generated electricity used to produce power to generate electricity.  So you could have a small one item or you could have like an assembly on one--one page.  It all depended.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I--I did just want to get that on the record.  So-- (laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) so that we would be clear on what you meant by that. But thank you--
Story_ID: 123852
Speaker 1: I--and I wanted to ask at this point when did you complete the requirements for your doctorate?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now you're prepared for a very different kind of work.  No more machine part.
Speaker 2: Right.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: And a lot more teaching, perhaps with this Ph.D..
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you quit the other job immediately or what happens at that point when you have the Ph.D. in hand?
Speaker 2: Well about mid-way after almost completing the master's degree, I left Babcock and Wilcox cause I had started working part time and took an assistantship and worked part time at the university.  So eventually, I left Babcock and Wilcox and just worked with that assistantship at University of Akron [Akron, Ohio].  After graduating of course, I--it was my desire to teach at the collegiate level.  That's what I wanted to do.  That's what I was preparing myself for.  But unfortunately, based on some unwritten rules at the University of Akron, they didn't want to hire individuals that were educated there.  They wanted to pull in individuals from other areas of the country.  And unfortunately for me that was difficult because I was confined at this area because I had small children in school.  My husband [William H. Brown] had a job.  He worked here.  So I couldn't very well pick up and go someplace else.  So I started working as a program manager for Akron Public Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 123853
Speaker 1: Dr. Brown, you were just starting to tell us about completing your Ph.D. and then getting back to the classroom setting.  You're not able to get that fulltime position at [University of] Akron [Akron, Ohio], but you are to do some teaching.  So what was that like to teach at the collegiate level?
Speaker 2: Well, I taught part time and it was like a--a dream being fulfilled because I--I knew at that point that I had something to give and I knew from the training that I received while getting my education that I could deliver education.  You know, and deliver it well.  I mean that was my strong suit.  So I felt very good at--at that point and taught part-time at university.  Actually taught in--in several locations.  To star--taught part time at Stark Tech [Stark Technical College].  Now it's Stark State [College of Technology, Stark County, Ohio], which is a junior type college.  Also taught at Southern Ohio College, now Brown Mackie [College, Akron, Ohio].  And then I taught at University of Akron, teacher prep courses.  And couldn't secure full-time position and so I took a part-time position with Akron Public Schools as a Program Manager.  And I helped provide supplemental education to homeless children and youth which was extremely rewarding because the one thing that you'll find with sheltered children, when they come in they're very enthusiastic, they're bright.  Doesn't matter where they came from or what the circumstances were, they were, but after being there for a couple of weeks you can see that light begin to fade dim and go dark.  So it's my role to keep it exciting for 'em.  To make sure that that was one thing in their lives stable and that was their education.  And so it was extremely rewarding and they were just so loving.  And that was just a happy time in my life and I was just happy and then this position came along.  I was serving on the Advisory Council for the Coming Together Project and our Executive Director passed away.  As a matter of fact, he passed away eight years to this day.  And they were looking, the board of course, were looking for a replacement.  And they, of course, you know, put an ad in the newspaper to bring in some applicants, some candidates.  And I really was not even concerned.  And somebody mentioned to me that I should.  And so I went to my colleagues and friends and said "What do you think about this"?  "Should I do this or shouldn't I"?  They said, "Well it couldn't hurt.  You got a job.  If you don't get it you still have one.  So try it.  You might even enjoy the interviewing process."  So I did and I threw my application in the ring about three days before the deadline and wouldn't you know it I--it was selected.  I had a background.  I knew a lot about the organization.  I had been with it since its inception as an Advisory Council type person and made it through all of the cuts.  I think there were twenty and then they cut it to five and then they cut it to two.  And so I was selected.  And that's another part of my fate story and I've been here ever since as Executive Director of the organization from the time that it just started until now.  And so it's evolved considerably so much so that we have launched a national initiative, and we're taking this Akron model and replicating it in other communities.
Story_ID: 123854
Speaker 1: Well can you just tell us please a little bit about the mission of the Coming Together Project?
Speaker 2: Well the mission of the Coming Together Project basically is to assist community groups with developing relationships so that they can work together and build a stronger community.  The mission advocates every person has equal worth and that by working together we can build a stronger community and we will do that through our innovative programs.  And I believe the--the words in the stated mission is "through creative and innovative mechanisms, it will ensure racial harmony and cultural awareness."
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kinds of programs do you offer here?
Speaker 2: Well, we offer a--a variety of programs.  We have three types.  We've categorized them into three areas.  Social programs, cultural programs and educational programs.  Educational take up approximately 60 percent of all that we do.  And we have of course adult programs, youth programs.  And we have a lot of collaborations as well.  Our education programs are across the board for young people, for corporations.   And our social programs are those where we try to attract large number of people.  We have a--an event with the Triple-A Baseball team in town [Akron, Ohio].  We also have an annual unity walk where we just invite everybody to come and walk and make that commitment to build a stronger community.  And then our social prog--I mean our cultural programs tend to be collaboratives.  And we collaborate with entities all over the community.  With the performing arts hall, with the art museum, with the hospitals, with Akron Public Schools, of course.  With different departments at the University of Akron [Akron, Ohio].  With Kent State University [Kent, Ohio].  You name it we collaborate with them.
Story_ID: 123855
Speaker 1: You know, Dr. Brown, when I think about it, it's been forty years, a little more than that actually, since [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] uttered his famous words about "envisioning a country or a time when his children would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character" and yet we still have a need it seems that you're suggesting, for the services offered here by the Coming Together Project.  Teaching people to appreciate diverse racial groups and cultural groups.  Have we made any progress since 1963 in the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: We have made some progress, but of course, we have a very, very long ways to go.  We've made progress in many, many, many areas, education, housing, employment.  Some in the law enforcement system, particular in the way of hiring.  But we still have so much work to do.  We have so many groups of people unfortunately unaware of the contributions and skills of certain groups and they still have stereotypes about those groups and unfortunately many of those folks are decision makers and until we can get decision makers to accept people, forget the stereotypes on who they are and what they bring to the table, there will always be a need for the Coming Together Project.  And I tell you I don't expect to see an--the dismissal of my position in my lifetime.  I do expect that it will come.  I don't expect that it will come within the next fifty years.
Speaker 1: So what will it take to speed the day when we have true cultural diversity and the recognition?  Again that character and the content of the character is more important than the superficial.
Speaker 2: I think it--it will take a lot of education.  Helping people to understand that by in large we are, you know, we have heard this phrase so many times.  "We are more alike and we are different."  We do have the same aspirations, the same goals, the same desires, the same wants for our children.  And when we can educate folks to understand that we're all equal in that sense, I think that we'll be moving toward the mark.  And that piece being able to educate folks is a difficult part because we find here at the [Coming Together] Project those folks who are ready to move forward will come forward.  Those folks who are not will stay in the background and it's difficult to bring them in even to a dialogue to discuss issues.  I find that what you have in your head, whether it's a stereo type, a bias, it cannot be replaced until there is something to replace it with.  And if you don't come forward to hear it, to read it, to understand it, to get it from some resource, then it is never replaced.  And so I consider that the job of Coming Together Project.  That's our job.  We are to get those seeds out there, to introduce the information, to have people to process it.  And they'll process it in their own time.  You know sometimes those changes will come immediately upon hearing it, seeing it, reading it. Sometimes it comes after it's contemplated for weeks and months and years.  And sometimes it never comes.  But it will never come to anyone at any time if it--if the information is not put out there.  And I see that as the role of "Coming Together" helping people understand that we can all work together.  We don't ever all have to sit around, drink coffee, and sing "Kumbaya," but we can all work together and build a stronger community and we can all benefit from it.
Story_ID: 123856
Speaker 1: Well, Dr. Brown, since you've been with the Coming Together Project almost since its inception, what are some of the--the greatest accomplishments of the organization?  The things of which you're most proud?
Speaker 2: Well, number one, I'm most proud of our youth component.  Because we have a high school component, a middle school component and now a grade school component. And I think that if we can educate our young people on accepting and appreciating differences, then the world will be better.  So I'm very, very proud of that.  I'm also proud of a national recognition that we have been able to--to get.  Number one starting out with the U.S. Department of Justice and having a relationship there.  I'm also extremely proud of all of the folks in this community who work day in and day out to make sure that this project will continue.  Because you know they com--they commit to it.  As you well know, any time that there is a cut, diversity is the first thing that goes.  I mean that's something that they say we can live without but in reality we cannot live without it because we're becoming a more diverse society with different groups, different traditions.  And we have to ex--we--we cannot assimilate (laughter) all of them.  You know that's a pipe dream.  Why don't we just accept them and include them, appreciate and value what they bring?  A novel idea, huh?  So I'm, I'm very, very proud of the people in this community who commit themselves to making sure that his project continues.  I'm also proud of all of the programs that we have been able to develop and that we're able now to take those same programs into other communities.  We know that they're successful here in the Akron [Ohio] community.  We were able to take them out into other communities across the country so that they too can see the benefits that we are receiving.
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Brown, you--you've been at Akron for thirty-seven years now, almost?
Speaker 2: A very long time.
Speaker 1: And--and I believe that at the time of your migration that this was sort of the rubber capital?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Okay and--but the community has changed.
Speaker 2: Absolutely it's changed.  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --Has your organization changed over the years to adjust to the changes in the community?
Speaker 2: Well fortunately for us the rubber era had ended when we were starting.  All of the rubber companies, for whatever reason, had migrated to different locations and now although they have a presence in the Akron community, the actual plants or manufacturing facilities are in other places.  So we have become since that time, a kind of service producing community.  And just like Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] was known as a college town, now Akron is becoming a college town because University of Akron is moving swiftly into the downtown area and consuming many of---of the buildings.  So we are soon to be known as a college town and--and--and a service town.  But we're doing something quite interesting in the Akron community and I'm so proud because Akron sometimes is a front runner, a sphere header of things.  And we have this very interesting group in town called Torch Bearers.  And they are about the business of keeping professionals here and attracting new ones.  Because see we do have an issue with economic development in northeastern Ohio and they are working very hard, very hard to attract young professionals in the area, but at the same time, to keep the ones that we have.

Speaker 1: This program [Coming Together Akron], and I think you said it earlier in the interview, but just want you to reiterate is in a Firestone building?
Speaker 2: It's in a Firestone building, yes.
Speaker 1: Is there any formal relationship with Firestone Tire and Rubber?
Speaker 2: Well, our relationship started when the--when the program started or when we became a nonprofit entity.  You know anytime you become a nonprofit org, you have to establish your board and, of course, we did that.  One of the board members happen to be the General Counsel at Bridgestone-Firestone at the time.  His name was Dave Thomas.  And the of course, manufacturing facility and headquarters had moved to Nashville [Tennessee].  And he knew that there was space in this particular building and he offered that space as an office for the project and we have been here ever since.  And so we--we now have a very, very strong relationship with Bridgestone-Firestone in many ways not just because we utilize space here, but also they were the funders for the expansion.  They provided a quarter-million-dollar grant to help us to get started in--in order to replicate in the other communities.  So we have a strong relationship one that I hope that we'll have for a very, very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I--I can't help noticing how important migration was in your own family history.  Coming to Akron [Ohio] where there were jobs and people could buy homes and get better jobs in the North than they had in the South.  And then for those jobs very often after the 1960s to go south where they could get labor for cheaper wages.  And, and for the communities sort of dig in their heels (laughter) and try to provide other services to keep the city alive.  Do you think Akron is winning that battle to create new jobs even if they're in the service sector and to keep Akron alive and moving in the right direction?
Speaker 2: I think they are.  You know I'm very proud of the individuals in the Akron community because once they put their minds to something (laughter) they--they are committed to it.  Just last evening we had a Greater Akron Chambers Annual Meeting and there were 650 people signed up for that meeting which is astronomical in this community.  And they were there because the chamber had hired an individual and, oh I'm just upset because her name escaped me but her face is right there in front of me, and she's been consulting with the Greater Akron Chamber to help it--help it change its image, but at the same time, reach its goals.  And of course the goals are to attract business into this community.  And based on the advice and the expertise coming from that consulting, we are moving along the way finding out what we need to do to attract business.  You know, number one educate our--the young people here.  Make sure that they have an education so that if the entry comes in, they would be able to fulfil positions with educated--an educated workforce.  So and not only just talking about these things, but also putting some strategies in place.  And so I think that we're on the road at this point to changing, although we're service industry now, we're changing that so that we can just kind of redefine ourselves but be self-sustaining all at the same time.
Story_ID: 123858
Speaker 1: Dr. Brown, you said that you don't see all of the changes that you envision happening in your lifetime.  But because of the work that you do here with the "The Coming Together Project", what do you hope your legacy will be to the community of Akron [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, number one I hope to leave the legacy of a person committed to change and inclusion.  If someone in a hundred years read any information about me in my role as Executive Director of Coming Together Akron, and Coming Together USA, I hope that there will be a paragraph on the efforts that I made to make sure that we changed our community for the better.  We included every entity in the change and that everyone in our community benefitted by those changes.  I want to be viewed as a change agent.  Not so much a leader or a figure head, but a person bringing about change.
Speaker 1: And Dr. Brown, I think I would be remiss if I--If I didn't ask you to mention the names of your children and your husband because they were such an important part it seems of the change that you went through in working and balancing family and school and work and all of that so that you could be Dr. Fannie Brown.  And so can we please have their names for the record?
Speaker 2: Okay, my husband's name is William H. Brown.  And my son's name is William H. Brown II, not too much of a stretch.  And my daughter's name is Shannon Marie Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we have one son and one daughter.
Story_ID: 123859
Speaker 1: Well we've come almost to the end of our discussion but I'm just wondering is there anything about your history, any significant chapter that we rushed through or glossed over, anything that I didn't ask about that you would want to be a part of this story.
Speaker 2: The one piece that I don't think I talked about a lot was like my spiritual evolution.  You know I started out as a--a child being introduced to Christian concepts early on and learning you know the best that I could with what I had and from my grandparents but also they instilled in me that desire to continue that and I think without faith, I would never have been able to accomplish any of the things that I've been able to accomplish in my life.  Because I think that as [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] said that particularly as it relates to his principles of nonviolent resistance the sixth one is--has something to the effect that the--the universe is just and there is some God or spiritual being moving us toward universal love, and I believe that, you know I'm--I'm a part of that.  I'm a part of that force and I think without it, without God in my life, without being a Christian, without having that force to attach myself to--to rely in, to--to pray to, to be guided by, to--to be prepared by, there's no way I could have accomplished anything in my life.  And you know if you look at my life, you know from a poor black child from rural Macon County, Georgia, with hopes of becoming everything but the means to becoming nothing.  To have accomplished this in my life.  And you know to some it would be minimal or nothing but to me it's great because I knew where I came from and hopefully this story will help other people.
Speaker 1: Dr. Brown, I--there's so much that I wanna ask you, but I wanna ask you now because you--you talked about the importance of spirituality whether you're active in a church in Akron [Ohio]?  And if so, what church is that?
Speaker 2: I am with Akron Alliance Fellowship.  It's a--a fellowship that tie in with my philosophy as it relates to my position.  We are about ministry across the world.  Not just providing you know a spiritual attachment but providing and meeting physical needs and that is one of the reasons I joined that church.  Because we're all over the world and we don't go in with just the message of Christ, we go in with help.  If they need a hospital, if they need dental assistance, if they need clothing, we go in with physical help.  And--and I think that is the essence of what Christ stood for.  Yes, we--we want to convert people to Christ but we wanna help people with their everyday lives right where they are with whatever need that they may have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said that focus in that congregation complements the work that you do on a daily basis?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 123860
Speaker 1: Now I know you're busy and probably have more than enough things to do but I'm also curious about other organizations that you might belong to.  Are there any social or fraternal, or benevolent organizations--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --that you're affiliated with?
Speaker 2: I am affiliated with quite a few.  Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority [AKA].  I am also affiliated with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I am affiliated with the American Association of University Women.  I am affiliated with the Suma Health System, their Community Advisory Board.  Oh I wish I had a VDoc I just read 'em.  It's kind of hard to--to just cite all of them.
Speaker 1: Well that's a good start because I have a question already.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Most people know the NAACP because of its history of activism in the civil rights arena and university women, we would expect that because (laughter) (simultaneous) you're a Ph.D. and you spent so much time with universities but Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, what is it about that organization that makes it so attractive to so many college educated African American women?
Speaker 2: Well, I joined the graduate chapter out of--I was out of college before I even knew anything about it and wouldn't have had the time even if I had known about it while I was going through school but I joined a graduate chapter.  And I joined it because they--you know the--the cry or the byline is "Service to All Mankind".  And again tying into my philosophy you know I wanted to do at that time whatever I could to help other groups within the community and, and that was our charge as a chapter and so that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's the one thing that made it attractive to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And has Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority historically lived up to that--that charge?
Speaker 2: For the most part, but I have to say in--in recent years I don't spend as much time as I did earlier because I don't have the time.  I won't say unfortunately I will say the job that I have keeps me busy fifty, sixty sometimes seventy hours a week and so I had to let some things go and sorority meetings was one of the things (laughter) that I decided to let go because again and I'm committed to bringing about the change.  You know I'm committed to making sure that this organization is successful.  I--let you know it's a passion.  It has to be successful because I--I always see myself as a person who go into an organization and lay the groundwork.  I'm a foundation builder.  When I'm gone somebody else will come in and build on the foundation that I've laid.  So the part that I play is extremely important so it has to be right.  I have to spend the time to get it to the place so that the next person comes in will be able to take over.  That's my role.  I saw that as a role that I had in my previous position as a program manager for Akron Public Schools [Akron, Ohio] provide that supplemental education for children and youth.  And the person who took it over was able to just slide in, take it and move it forward. It has to be the same way.  And since this is such a larger scale, it's even more important.  So I'm just committed to--to laying the foundation the way it should to be laid.
Story_ID: 123861
Speaker 1: Dr. Brown, I said I would save at least one more question for this segment.  And the question is sort of wordy but maybe I can say it quickly so that you will have a chance to speak.  I wonder if you would please comment on your migration again from rural [Macon County] Georgia and having to miss out on education to being a PhD here on America's North Coast [Akron, Ohio] and becoming an educator and ultimately educating the entire community and the nation about the value of diversity.  How does that feel, Dr. Brown?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm asked that question quite often.  People ask me you know "how does it feel" and "can you reflect upon it"?  And I have to tell you that 90 percent of the time I am so busy doing the work until I don't reflect upon it enough probably.  It's just recently I've been thinking about how much we have been able to accomplish.  And I always say "we" because I can never say that I did it alone.  I can say I was a--a leader, a front runner, but I can't say that I did it alone.  I--I think it's awesome.  You know I'm thrilled as I reflect upon what we have been able to accomplish in the short time that I've been with "Coming Together [Akron]" you know. I worked on the Advisory Council from '93 [1993] to '97 [1997] and then from '97 [1997] to 2005 as the Executive Director.  And starting out as an organization with nothing in place.  I mean nothing in place.  And I say that with a capitol 'N'.  To be able to--to bring structure to the organization.  That gives me pleasure.  And then the fact, and I don't think I mentioned it in previous tapes, that we were successful in you know bringing then President [Bill] Clinton to Akron [Ohio] for the first town hall meeting on race and he came due in part to this project.  And from that visit, we gain national notoriety.  And from that time forward we have been moving on and now to actually to have affiliate communities.  Communities who saw what we were doing and wanted it.  Wanted to replicate it.  Liked it.  Came.  Saw.  Visited.  Just adopted it.  Went back to their communities and implemented it.  You know that--that's awesome.  They say the, the highest form of praise is to be replicated or you know, again I'm paraphrasing, I don't keep all of these phrases in my head, but basically you know, the, the best--the highest form of adoration is for somebody to actually replicate what you're doing to think that it is so important and so effective that they want to do it.  So that piece feels very, very good and as we bring on more communities, I think that I'll have a little bit more time to reflect but at the same time, I know that I'll be working hard.  Now currently, we have you know, crafted legally this USA umbrella.  So Akron is attached to it because we had to, of course, change the name from "Project" to "Akron".  Certain guidelines and principles.  Anytime you start a, a national organization, you have to have some guidelines and structure and so now its Coming Together Akron.  We also have "Coming Together Star County" and "Coming Together Decatur".  And I'm talking about Decatur, Illinois.  All tied to that national umbrella.  And currently we're negotiating with Detroit, Michigan, Racine, Wisconsin and we have a request in from Los Angeles County [California].  So as we work to process six entities underneath the umbrella, we will learn.  We will evolve.  And then we will be prepared to take on the next six.  So you know I must tell you I--I am very, very proud of that.  But also again proud of all of the people who are just committed to making it happen.  Not gonna sit by the wayside and say "Well that's one that we don't have to fund."  "That's something that we can put on the backburner."  They realize that it's important and so they keep funding it and so we keep moving forward.
Story_ID: 123862
Speaker 1: Okay.   Well I'm glad you mentioned the--the visit with President [Bill] Clinton and--and that sort of town hall setting because I believe I saw that on TV and I'm probably not the only one, but I'm wondering if you would give us the approximate date.  If you could give us the year and then we could cross reference this interview with I'm sure the other footage that's out there and maybe people can go back to that and see exactly what was discussed here in Akron [Ohio] when the President came to town to talk about diversity.
Speaker 2: Okay, well that was a monumental time for the project [Coming Together Akron] so I can tell you the day, the time and the hour.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It happened on December 3, 1997 and President Clinton was scheduled to arrive at 10:00.  He arrived at about 11:00 and was on stage at 11:15.  And it was an exciting time for this community.  You know it was just--the City was abuzz.  Like when you came in today you know it seemed to be very sleepy and quiet.  Well that day people were everywhere.  It was so exciting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep and from that day on the Project has been moving forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how was Akron selected and--and why "Coming Together"?
Speaker 2: That's--that's a very, very good question.  Again I believe its fate and prayer (laughter) because we were in a running with some major cities.  Like Los Angeles [California], Detroit [Michigan], Chicago [Illinois], Akron, but we are fortunate.  At that time, we had an extremely powerful and compassionate congressman.  Congressman Tom Sawyer [Thomas C. Sawyer].  And we shared with him that we--you know President Clinton announced in the summer of '97 [1997] that he would have four town hall meetings.  So as soon as he made that announcement, we then contacted Congressman Sawyer and said--what--can we get him to come to Akron?  And he said that would work on it.  And we just started preparing packets of information.  I think we prepared at least four packets of information for Congressman Sawyer to take to the White House.  And I believe it was on November 12, 1997 they called a conference--a--and at that conference we were told that Akron was in the running because there were cities all over with best practices as it relates to diversity and race relations.  And the--at the--President Clinton formed the--the, it was a--a diversity council of sorts and gosh it is "President's Initiative on Race Commission".  I think that's--that's very close to the name of it.  But anyway, they had developed these press conferences or created press conferences in all of these cities with best practices.  Akron, of course, had one.  They had the press conference at the Mayor's office.  And one of the reporters from our local newspaper, the Akron Beacon Journal asked if Akron was in the running for that first meeting.  And Executive Director of that Commission, that group said "Akron was in the running".  And you know they did a huge article the next day.  They were excited.  We were satisfied with that.  We were coming back to our offices doing flips so happy Akron is in the running for the first town hall meeting on race.  What do you think about that?  And then that very next week they called us and told us that we had been selected and, and let me tell you.  We had a, a reporter in Washington [D.C.] for the Akron Beacon Journal and she called, her name was, is I believe still, I don't think she's married at this point cause I don't know, it's been some time ago.  Desiree Hicks.  She called me on the phone and said, "Be waiting.  We had a press conference here today and they announced that Akron would be the site for the first town hall meeting."  She said, "They're gonna give you an official call from the White House."  So I said "okay Desiree, you're probably pulling my leg but all right fine.  Thank you."  So she hung up and I waited because she said don't go home until you get your call.  So I waited.  It was five o'clock no call.  Five fifteen no call.  Five thirty the phone rings.  One of my colleagues pick up the phone and she says "Fannie, it's the White House and they want to speak to you".  I'm so excited so I grabbed the phone and sure enough they give me the details that Akron had been selected and that they would be sending an advance team to Akron and we would work through all the details together.  So it was an extremely exciting time for all of us here at the Project and the community at large.
Story_ID: 123863
Speaker 1: So, where was the meeting [President Bill Clinton's 1997 Akron, Ohio town hall meeting] actually held?
Speaker 2: It was actually held at University of Akron [Akron, Ohio] on campus.  Very extensive protection, secret service, a lot of guidelines, routes, tactics, strategies and having to know all of that and, and work with them.  It seemed to us organized, but to them it was organized chaos.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I, I do thank you again for introducing President William Jefferson Clinton into this discussion of your history because he seems to have made quite an impression on you and also impressed a number of other people.  There's some really bad jokes told about him (laughter) being the first black president and I think part of it has to be with the fact that he--he really did, at least appear to embrace diversity and, and not just through tokenism, and not just golfing occasionally with [HM] Vernon Jordan, but really (simultaneous laughter) embraced diversity and used that to shape certain policies and of course, now folks have expressed concern since 2000 especially about the loss of ground and the lack of trust among Americans from various cultural ethnic racial groups and even stratification on class lines.  Do you--again I guess I've asked this question before but is all that pessimism justified?  Or are you still optimistic about the possibilities of American people finally embracing diversity as something that's to be valued.
Speaker 2: I'm optimistic about it.  I'm sure it will happen.  And I think we did lose ground after Bill Clinton left office because you know he started a movement nobody was talking about race when he started introducing dialog and dialog in every area.  The first one, of course, and I have to say it was the best one, although he had four, the first one was very well publicized.  Very well known.  It was, I, I guess on every station across the US.  People were calling me from every corner of the country telling me that you know they saw us on television.  So I know that it--it was extremely just a wonderful (laughter) moment in my life.  Again, I am getting back to your question optimistic but guardedly so.  I know that we'll have a lot of work to do.  If you recall in Clinton's administration, he had minorities from every sector and not looking just at race, but looking across the board at race, religion, ethnicity, gender, moving folks into those positions and helping the country to realize that it doesn't matter who you--what you look like, if you have the credentials and the skills you can move in the position and become a value and asset to any organization or business and you know no matter what you say I think it's important to model that.  And so he did that.  And so I think at this point we have lost ground.  Just like historically you have a lot of groups weary of the--I would say the, the motive for moving people in and out of, of certain positions and historically believe that we could never get there.  And with Clinton we had hope.  And now that he's gone, they're starting to move backwards and say that that hope is gone.  It's going to be another twenty years.  I've heard somebody say "it'll be fifteen more years before we see the growth that we saw at that time."  And in some ways I can agree with that and some ways I don't.  And we don't have time for me to (laughter) go through all of that.  But I, I will say that just as in the past we have been reluctant to believe that we are--we will be considered equal.  We know that we should be but we also know that we have not been in the past.  And now with things the way they are, we just don't see it happening.  But again, I'm optimistic because I know that there are many Fannie Browns around the country.  You know people with the same passion that I have to move communities to the point where they make decisions that include everyone within the society.  Make decisions that will help everybody contributing to and benefiting from what is done in a community.
