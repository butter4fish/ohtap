Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted by [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden.  The videographer is Scott Stearns.  The interview is being conducted at Bethel Baptist Institutional Church in Jacksonville, Florida, and the date is October 19th, 2006.  Madam HistoryMaker, would you give me your full name and would you spell your name for me.
Speaker 2: My name is Camilla Bolton Perkins Thompson [HistoryMaker Camilla Thompson], and it's spelled C-A-M-I-L-L-A, B-O-L-T-O-N, P-E-R-K-I-N-S, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you. Mrs. Thompson, would you give me your birth date and your birthplace?
Speaker 2: My birth date is March 6th, 1922, and I was born in Jacksonville, Florida.  In fact, I'm a second-generation Jacksonville person.
Speaker 1: Good.  And would you tell me what your occupation, your profession, has been over time and what it is presently?  How would you describe your profession, what you've done?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, basically, my profession as a career was that of teaching, and I taught chemistry and physics, and the larger part of my career, in the beginning I had to start out in the junior high school level, because in Jacksonville there was only one senior high school when I graduated from college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and came back.  So naturally, they did not need a chemistry major, because they already had enough people to teach chemistry in the high school level, so I had to teach junior high school science and even health, which was considered along with it.  And sometimes I had to teach math, because I had enough hours in math in order to have it on my certificate, but I tried to prevent having it there, because I didn't want to switch from math to science.
Speaker 1: What year did you start teaching?
Speaker 2: I started in 1943-1944 year.
Speaker 1: And you retired from which institution and what year?
Speaker 2: I retired from Florida Junior College, which later became Florida Community College at Jacksonville [Florida State College at Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida], and I retired in July of 1981.
Speaker 1: And what did you teach at the junior college?
Speaker 2: Basically, chemistry I--if I was able to get in, because I was certified in physics, so I taught physics on a part-time basis just to see what it would be like, and I did it for at least three years, and I went out to the naval air station [Naval Station Mayport, Jacksonville, Florida] to teach the persons who were stationed there and were civilian workers who needed to take physics as a part of their quest for education.
Speaker 1: Now, you have another academic discipline which I guess was an avocation, and you've contributed much to--to this subject area.  What is your other academic interest been over the years that you are still working on?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My interest has been history.  I have become so fascinated with history, and the interesting part is that when I was in high school [Stanton High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida], it was not necessarily one of my favorite subjects.  I'd get it, but I think I became--I just thought that having to learn dates had no meaning, and now when people leave dates off, I say it's not historical 'cause you don't know when it happened.
Speaker 1: So what have you done in the history area as a--almost as a second career?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I have done quite a bit of research on various factors--events, persons, places--and I have put them into columns.  One of the columns that I started doing earlier, I just had columns, but then I started titling them, Reflections on Black Jacksonville, and I started writing those and putting them in one of the African American newspapers, local newspaper [Jacksonville Free Press].
Speaker 1: When did you have your first article published; do you recall?
Speaker 2: In 1985 the first article was published, but it was not under the title of Reflections on Black Jacksonville.  It was one that was interesting to me, and it dealt basically with persons who were members of the city council going back to the earliest days, because African Americans had been disenfranchised out of the political scene for quite a while in Jacksonville.

Speaker 1: We're gonna come back and look at your career in more detail.  But before we do that, and before we look at your family history, we have some People magazine type questions, kind of relaxing questions, and it will give the viewers of your interview another side of your personality.  And so the first question is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's difficult, but anyway, one of my favorite food perhaps is toma- a tomato.
Speaker 1: Tomato?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite time of year, your favorite season?
Speaker 2: Spring is my favorite season.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of my favorite colors would be pink.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, New York City [New York, New York] has been a favorite with me just to go see plays, see the sights that you don't see other places, but not to live, come back after I've been there.
Speaker 1: Right.  I agree.  Last kind of warm-up question: do you have a favorite phrase or saying or philosophical thought that you often share with relatives, friends, colleagues?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  Let me see (laughter).  One of the things I try to say is that it won't last always, so just live one day at the time.
Speaker 1: Same one I use, take one day at a time, sometimes a half a day at a time.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 376827
Speaker 1: We're going to start now by looking at your roots, your family roots, your growing-up years, so that we will have a context in which to look at your career, your achievements, your contributions, and things that motivated, inspired you to do the things you did in education and in history.  So we're going to start with your mother.  And would you give me your mother's name and her birth year and birthplace?
Speaker 2: Her name was Camilla Marie Bolton Perkins [Camilla Bolton Perkins].  Her birth year was 1896.  She was born in Jacksonville, Florida, and her parents [Lavinia White Bolton and Stephen Bolton] had come from North Carolina, but she was born in Jacksonville.
Speaker 1: And she was raised here, she grew up here?
Speaker 2: Yes, she grew up here and went to school here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did she tell you about her growing-up years, her childhood years here in Jacksonville?  Were there stories that you recall her sharing with you?
Speaker 2: I recall some of the stories, and one of them was what happened when the May--the fire of May 3rd, 1901 occurred.  She was telling me that her parents had her pack up her belongings and get ready and move out of where they lived, because they thought the fire may come that way. And so all she could carry were a few clothes and her doll, and that was the thing that she remembered most about what occurred in that 1901 fire.  They were moving away toward the water, because they were afraid that the fire was going to get in the area.  And incidentally, the area that they lived in is very near to this area.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Okay.  Any other stories that you remember her telling you about her growing-up years?
Speaker 2: Well, she said that her parents made sure that she studied and did well in school.  And during that time when you completed high school, you could take a teachers examination, and if you passed that examination, you could start teaching.  So she was able to pass that examination, and she started teaching.  She started at a very young age because she passed the exam, and then later she went and took courses at Florida Normal and Industrial College [Florida Memorial University, Miami Gardens, Florida] in St. Augustine [Florida] and continued until she got her A.A., and later she received her bachelor's [degree] from Florida A and M College [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University]Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florided in Tallahassee [Florida] the year after I received mine.  The summer after I received my bachelor's, she received her bachelor's because--
Speaker 1: Now, what year was that again?
Speaker 2: The year she received hers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was 1947.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No.  Yes, '47 [1947].  No, she--nope.  Had to have been '44.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she had a full teaching career then, she taught for a number of years?
Speaker 2: Yes, she taught a number of years, but when we were young, growing up, my father [D.W. Perkins] did not want her to teach, so she was home as a housewife and worked in the--and was in the neighborhood, like volunteering in the neighborhood and around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you remember your mother, her personality?  What was she like as a person?
Speaker 2: She was warm and outgoing and giving, and she liked to do volunteer work, and she liked to be a part of things like their gardening circles and garden clubs.  And she liked music, and so she was trying to see if she could do a little music career, but a lot of times we would--you know, people say, oh, no, I know she's not gonna try to do that.  But she loved music, and I remember she had a little instrument known as the mandolin, and she was playing that, and she would, you know, do a little piano.  She didn't become professional in any of them, but she liked music, and that was one of her great hobbies.
Story_ID: 376828
Speaker 1: And what was her mother's name, your maternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: Her mother's name was Lavinia White [Lavinia White Bolton].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Whitesville, North Carolina [sic. Whiteville, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And her father, Adam White, brought the family to Jacksonville [Florida] back--well, I found a record of 1870, but it seems that I've been told that they came around 1864.
Speaker 1: Why did they come here; do you know?
Speaker 2: I never--they never said why they came, but evidently, whoever his father was or his family, they may have had a little money, because when he came, he bought quite a bit of property in several places in town, and one of the sections not far from here is known as Adam White subdivision.  It's on the maps at the off--tax collector's office.  People don't know much about it now, but it's there from back in those earlier days.
Speaker 1: Very interesting, yeah.  How well did you know your grandmother?  Did you spend much time with her?
Speaker 2: We spent quite a bit of time with her, and--in that I recall in the afternoons or, you know, weekends there would be quite a gathering, because my uncles, two of my uncles, had wives that would come over, and my grandmother and their--and my aunts would get in the kitchen, they would cook, and after they finished and we would eat, they would clean up, and then many times they would sit down and make quilts or crochet or knit and make quite a number of things.  And there was a grape arbor in one of the yards, because all of the yards sort of adjoined each other, and when the grapes were ripened, they would often make grape jelly and jam.  And I recall one of the worst (laughter) spankings I got was because I decided that I wanted to taste some of the jelly one of the times before it was--
Speaker 1: --ready (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) ready.
Speaker 1: What about your mother's father?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Stephen Bolton, and he was a contractor and carpenter, and he taught his sons that skill so that they could use those skills, although they didn't necessarily have to work with it because one of my mother's brothers became an editor.  He graduated with honors from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and came back and became a newspaper editor, but he died rather early.  And then the other one, one of the other ones, became a carpenter, and one became the secretary of a masonic group called Joseph's--St. Joseph's Aid Society [Jacksonville, Florida].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Where was your grandfather born, your mother's father, Stephen Bolton?  Where was he from?
Speaker 2: He was from North Carolina also, but I can't remember the county.  It's a strange county, but it was all somewhere near Whitesville and Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And you spent time with him, you knew him, your mother's father?
Speaker 2: My mother's father?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Bolton.  Stephen.
Speaker 2: I didn't, no.  I think he was--he had passed when I was born.
Story_ID: 376829
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  What was his name and when was he born and where?
Speaker 2: Okay.  His name was Daniel Webster Perkins [D.W. Perkins], and he was born January 19th, I think, 1879, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, on the coast.  And he came from a large family, I think they said it was like seven or eight brothers and only one sister, and he went to school in the area and taught and worked part time in order to complete his education, and then he went to Shaw University Law School [Raleigh, North Carolina], because at that time Shaw University had law schools and medical schools.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he graduated around, I think 1902, and went to Knoxville, Tennessee, to practice.  He didn't stay in Elizabeth City too long.  I guess it was just too small for a business, and--but they would go on about, oh, he's the first African American lawyer (laughter) to finish law school.  But he didn't stay there long.  He went to Knoxville, Tennessee, and stayed maybe four or five years, and then he moved to Tampa, Florida, where he set up his practice first in Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you know him?  Did you spend time with him?
Speaker 2: Yes, we spent quite a bit of time with him, and the reason I'm a member of Bethel [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida] is because he was a member of Bethel, and my mother [Camilla Bolton Perkins] was a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, the Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal [Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Church; Ebenezer United Methodist Episcopal Church, Jacksonville, Florida], and we would go with her sometimes, but he traveled quite a bit.  We called it--we said he was a circuit lawyer, and he traveled quite a bit in Florida, working out cases, particularly cases where people's civil and human rights had been violated, and he had several landmark cases that dealt with that, and when he traveled, then we would have to go with her to church, but when he'd come back, we were all excited to come back to--we call this our church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about his parents [Edith Perkins and John Perkins]?  What do you recall?
Speaker 2: I really did not get a chance to learn too much about them.  I--I knew he had, you know, I knew that they lived in Elizabeth City and they were from a large family and they were a nice family, but we seldom got a chance to meet them. We--I met a few of his nephews and others.  In fact, he had a nephew, Paul C. Perkins [Paul C. Perkins, Sr.], who finished Howard Law School [Washington, D.C.] and came here around 1948 or '49 [1949] to practice law with him, with my father here in Jacksonville [Florida] in the Masonic Temple.  But his nephew decided to move on to Tampa [Florida] to practice with one of his friends, because my father didn't want him to move any of the pieces of paper, you know, anything that was on the desk, so I think he decided, I think I better strike out on my own.
Speaker 1: Did your father have a general law practice or did he specialize in anything in that--in those years; do you know?
Speaker 2: At one time he specialized in civil and human rights, and then later I think it ended up being general, because one of his landmark cases was he served as chairman of the committee to go before the Florida Supreme Court to prevent the disenfranchisement of African American lawyers.  The legislature was trying to stop African Americans, lawyers from practicing in Florida, and he won that case before the Florida Supreme Court, and another landmark case was the one where he simultaneously, along with others from Texas and others, was able to go to the U.S. Supreme Court and allow African Americans to use the name Shriners in their insignia and paraphernalia.
Speaker 1: Did he tell you any stories and memories of his growing-up years as a child?
Speaker 2: He's told a few about how he and his brothers and his sister would, you know, get along and how they would even--they were given work ethic so they all worked as--you know, in order to be a part of what was going on in their life.  So he believed in working, and his parents instilled that in him.
Speaker 1: When did he pass, your father?  Do you recall?
Speaker 2: He passed on March 4th, 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, incidentally, my mother passed December 24th, 1971.  He lived only about three months after she passed.
Story_ID: 376830
Speaker 1: Let me ask you the same thing that I asked you about your mother [Camilla Bolton Perkins].  What was your father's [D.W. Perkins] personality like?  How do you remember him as a person, as a father?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was very outgoing.  If we--we walked often to church, and he loved walking, and walked anywhere we would go, although he had had a car, but he didn't never learn to drive, he had to have someone drive him.  But anyway, when we'd be walking down the street and we'd see someone staggering and going on, and he would say, "How are ya doing, how ya doing, Deacon?" or, "How are ya doing?"  And I'd say, "Daddy, you know him?"  And he say, "No, I don't know him, but you don't have to know 'em to speak."  And he instilled in us the idea that you speak to everyone regardless, because you don't ever know when you may need them.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 376831
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories as a child?  How far back can you remember?  What incidents do you recall in your very early life?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Let's see.
Speaker 1: Pre-kindergarten.
Speaker 2: Pre-kindergarten (laughter).
Speaker 1: If you can.
Speaker 2: If I can remember anything from pre-kindergarten.  I was getting ready to say something from kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Well, even kindergarten.  Go ahead.  Kindergarten's fine.  We'll start there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  I went to kindergarten or whatever they called it then or pre-kindergarten--that's really what it was--at Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Church [Ebenezer United Methodist Episcopal Church, Jacksonville, Florida], because they had a nice one, and the ladies that ran it, my mother [Camilla Bolton Perkins] was very friendly with, so I went there.  And I also came here, and they had--in the Sunday school for that age group, they called the cradle roll, earlier cradle roll department, and primary department.  And I recall they had the little Sunday school cards with photos of Jesus and the disciples and other things in that area, and they had what they called the sandbox that stood up off of the floor, and they had sand in it, and we were told to build our idea of what we thought was taking place, you know, in that area on that Sunday, and we thor- I thoroughly enjoyed that, so my earliest memories go back to things like that.
Speaker 1: Any others that go back around that time?
Speaker 2: I just remember we--my parents would take us visiting with friends, and on Sundays we would go for long rides and go different places and visit people, something that is almost a lost art now, the idea of going and visit, and Sunday was--Sunday afternoon was the day that you went to visit, or Saturday afternoon.
Story_ID: 376832
Speaker 1: Did you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I had two sisters.  I didn't have any brothers, but I had two sisters.  One was close to me in age, and the other one was much younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you give me the name of the one that was close to you?
Speaker 2: The one that was close to me in age was Lavinia Edith Perkins Mathis [Lavinia Perkins Mathis], and she was born in September, September the 24th, 1923, so we were pretty close in age.  And our other sister was Danette--I never remember her middle name but (laughter)--Danette Perkins Robinson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born October the 25th, 1932, so she was like ten years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are they still living, your sisters?
Speaker 2: They are still both living, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was the occupation of Lavinia?  What did she do?
Speaker 2: She was a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A family of teachers.  At what level was she--
Speaker 2: She was at junior high, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Danette?
Speaker 2: Danette taught in the Head Start program.  She was supposed--she started out she was gonna be a secretary, but then she didn't do that too long.  In fact, she worked for my daddy [D.W. Perkins] a brief while.  When she mentioned it the other day, I had almost forgotten, it was so brief (laughter).
Story_ID: 376833
Speaker 1: In addition to the, the car rides that you would take and visiting people, what else did you and your parents [Camilla Bolton Perkins and D.W. Perkins] and sisters [Lavinia Perkins Mathis and Danette Perkins Robinson] do together as a family?  What are some of the things that you remember doing together?
Speaker 2: I remember trips to the beach, 'cause the beach was quite popular in those early days, and we would go to Manhattan Beach [Kathryn Abbey Hanna Park, Jacksonville, Florida].  Manhattan Beach was a beach for African Americans.  It was where our--near where the Mayport naval air station [Naval Station Mayport, Jacksonville, Florida] is located today, and there were about six families that owned property down there, and some of them had bathhouses, and they had a restaurant and rooms where you could maybe spend the weekend or a week or wherever.  And so around the '30s [1930s] people started asking them to sell, and some of them sold the property, but one family, the Mack Wilson family, refused to sell, so in 1938 a mysterious fire destroyed their beach place.
Speaker 1: And this was called Manhattan Beach?
Speaker 2: Manhattan Beach, and I wrote a story about it in the African American newspaper [Jacksonville Free Press], and someone on one of the television channels made a remark on television.  I didn't hear it, but some others heard it, said that they didn't believe there was such a place as Manhattan Beach.  They'd never heard of it.  And several of the people called in and explained that where it was, and I went and I found an atlas that showed the ocean in that area and that sure enough, Manhattan Beach is distinctly marched--marked there.  And that area now is bordered by the naval air station at Mayport, and a place called Hanna Park [Kathryn Abbey Hanna Park, Jacksonville, Florida], which is a recreational park.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Maypolt?  Is it Maypolt?
Speaker 2: That's M-A-Y-P-O-R-T.  That's one of the major--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --naval air stations.
Speaker 1: Now, how far is that from here, from Jack--downtown Jacksonville [Florida]?  Where is--
Speaker 2: From downtown Jacksonville, let's see, that's hard to describe (unclear) driving that to work every day now.  Let's see.  Maybe a half hour away.
Speaker 1: Going south (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you go past--
Speaker 1: Going south?
Speaker 2: --go south then toward east, I guess, 'cause you go like you're going toward the beach.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you sort of veer to the left.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, what about American Beach [Florida]?  Did you go there?
Speaker 2: All right.  American Beach, I went there.  American Beach was founded by the Afro-American Life Insurance Company [Jacksonville, Florida] and, incidentally, by Afro-American Life Insurance Company was founded at Bethel [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida].  Reverend J. Milton Waldron, the minister, called six other businessmen together and--to start an insurance company--or a benefit, because African Americans could not buy insurance from the white companies.  And he felt like--he started a bur- he started with a burial league in the church, because people needed money to bury their relatives, and so instead of it just being in the church, he decided that it should spread all over the city for African Americans.  So they organized it as an African American benefit association, and it became the Afro-American Life Insurance Company.  And Mr. A.L. Lewis [Abraham Lincoln Lewis] at the time was the fourth president, and since Manhattan Beach was sort of going out of existence, he found this property over in Nassau County near Fernandina Beach [Florida], and they purchased some of the property with the pension fund money of the Afro, but the state didn't like that, but later they were able to get some more property because--
Speaker 1: Who did they purchase it from?
Speaker 2: They purchased it from the county.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But they used pension fund money.
Speaker 1: Oh, pension fund money.
Speaker 2: And that was--pension fund money, yes.
Speaker 1: I gotcha.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And so this is one of the problems that they had, although some people say Mr. A.L. Lewis purchased the beach.  He didn't purchase it with his money, but he was the person who was the president at the time and the power behind it.
Speaker 1: Abraham Lincoln Lewis.
Speaker 2: Abraham Lincoln Lewis.  And, see, he had to go to his board of trustees and directors, and they approved it.  But the state frowned on it after they once did it.  And--
Speaker 1: So you're saying that American Beach followed Manhattan, came after (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  It came in 1935.  And, see, by 1935, you know, most of the--we had almost been pushed off of Manhattan Beach.  And so that was what happened there.  And so af- the American Beach really was a thriving beach.  It had nice businesses, homes, and all kinds of things, but then Dora, Hurricane Dora came through in 1964 and devastated the place.  It destroyed quite a bit of the property, and some people never came back to restore, and then some others did.  But they are trying to get a rebirth, but it's not going to be the same kind of thing, because some of the homes that are going up there are not like regular beach houses.  They are mansions.
Story_ID: 379645
Speaker 1: You were telling me about going to Manhattan Beach [Kathryn Abbey Hanna Park, Jacksonville, Florida] with your family.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Were there other things that you remember doing with your family?  This, the car rides to the beach, anything else sort of that stands out?
Speaker 2: And I remember we'd--we would take trips, you know, to nearby places.  And after I got older, when I was in high school [Stanton High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] in--oh, in '39 [1939] when I finished high school, my father [D.W. Perkins] and some friends were going to the National Negro Business League conference in New York [New York], and that was the same time that the New York World's Fair [New York, New York] started.  So we went up in our automobile with a Dr. Patterson [ph.] and his wife and Miss Eartha M.M. White--she was the historian of the group--my father, mother [Camilla Bolton Perkins], and me.  And they went to the meetings while we stayed with some of my mother's cousins in Harlem [New York, New York], and it just happened that there was a cousin around my age who knew how to go to Statue of Liberty [New York, New York] and all those places.  The older cousins didn't know anything about it.  They'd go to work and come back home, and their main entertainment was playing cards and that kind of thing, but she knew.  So my mother and I got a chance to see other parts of New York, and after the meeting was over, then we spent several days going to the World's Fair. And that was where I was real fascinated by what was going on, and we purchased one of the little harps, 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,' that Augusta Savage sculptured in honor of James Weldon Johnson and his brother, John Rosamond Johnson [J. Rosamond Johnson].
Story_ID: 379646
Speaker 1: What street did you grow up on here in Jacksonville [Florida]?  Where did you live with your family as a child and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As a child?
Speaker 1: --and a teenager, yeah.
Speaker 2: I lived in LaVilla [Jacksonville, Florida].  That was a section of town, and I lived on Beaver Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell LaVilla?
Speaker 2: That's L-A and a capital V-I-L-L-A.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, that was a section of Jacksonville.
Speaker 2: That was a section of Jacksonville.  In fact, earlier when James Weldon Johnson and his brother [J. Rosamond Johnson] were born, it was a separate, small, incorporated little town.  And--
Speaker 1: Black town.  Black town.
Speaker 2: It didn't--no.  At first it was a combination.  There were Syrians, Jews, and others.  And then later, Jews and Syrians and all sort of moved out, and eventually, after it was incorporated into the city in--City of Jacksonville in 1887 [sic.], then eventually more and more of the Jews--Jews and Syrians and others moved out of the neighborhood except for those with businesses, and it became more African American; but it did not start out as an African American community.  A lot of people here think so, but it did not.
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted that to be clear, so thank you.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, what street did you live on in LaVilla (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I lived on Beaver Street, West Beaver Street.  We lived--at first our address was 1019 West Beaver, and then later they changed these numerical numbers on houses here, and it became 949 West Beaver.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about the street, the neighborhood?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  There were some who had large two-story houses, and then next to them there may have been a small bungalow, and then across the street there may have been three or four little houses they called shotgun houses, you know, the kind with--you could walk on the front porch and throw a ball from the front door all the way through the back door and it not hit anything because there was a straight wall--hall down the center.  And--but the people were friendly and you played with each other and you were not aware that maybe your house was larger than their house or their house was smaller than yours, and there was--and neighbors were neighbors, because if you did anything, by the time you got home, your parents knew what had happened and the persons had said something to you, letting you know that what you'd done was wrong.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

Speaker 1: What were the occupations of the adults in your neighborhood?  Your father's [D.W. Perkins] a lawyer, your mother's [Camilla Bolton Perkins] teaching?  What were the other occupations of the people?
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Right next door to us on one--on our right was a Mr. Jack James, and he was a Pullman porter, and I recall he would be dressed up in his black uniform and everything, and he would walk down to the train station and may come back in like two [o'clock] in the morning, he had no problems.  And we were not that far from the train station, maybe say maybe six blocks, seven blocks, and he could walk, but now you can't walk one block sometimes.  Then some of the others were--worked in stores, like one was a porter and receiving clerk, and another one in the neighborhood [LaVilla, Jacksonville, Florida] was a pharmacist, another one was a newspaper--had his own little newspaper and newspaper editor and--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the pharmacist at all, by any chance?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  It was--He was not on that same street, but Mr.--Dr. Butler, I think it was R.M. Butler [ph.].  And there were several other pharmacists, but not there.  And then further in the other direction there was a funeral parlor.  It was called Carter's funeral parlor [Carter's Funeral Home], and it's still there now.  It's Carthage [Carthage Chapel, Jacksonville, Florida], moving on toward town, and then two blocks from that was another one, G&M Baker [sic. D.M. Baker Mortuary], which was perhaps the first one founded in Jacksonville [Florida].  And then going on down further, we had the family--the Vanderhorst [ph.] family, and Mr. Vanderhorst had several little entrepreneurship things.  He managed the--at the cab company for the--for African Americans.  It was owned by a white person, but they--he had a section, he managed that, and he managed a shoe store that was in the Masonic Temple building, and he had several other little businesses that he did.  He had four daughters, and all--three of them became teachers.  One became a librarian at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] where her husband taught in the biology department, and the one daughter became a housewife because her husband had a funeral business, and so she helped with--in that business.  And then there were--there was a Dr. C.A. Ward [ph.], and his stepdaughter was a teacher, and his son--stepson was a postman, and across from them was Dr. O.W. McIntosh, who was a doctor, and then around the corner was Dr. W.W. Shell, Sr., who was my doctor, and one of the--and then in another section around the other way was Dr. S.P. Livingston [Smart Pope Livingston] and Dr. C.M. Shaw, but the interesting thing is that just about all of those doctors except Dr. McIntosh had two-story houses.  Their practices were on the first floor, and their residences were on the second floor.  And that seemed to have been a common pattern seemingly in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Did you always live on Beaver [Street]?
Speaker 2: I lived on Beaver until my husband [Capers M. Thompson, Sr.] and I built a house in 1955, and we are on 21st Street.  We've been there since 1955 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--but your childhood, your high school years are all on Beaver.
Speaker 2: Yes, all on Beaver, uh-huh.  And I didn't have far to walk to junior high school.  I went to LaVilla Park School [Jacksonville, Florida], which later became A.L. Lewis [A.L. Lewis Junior High School, Jacksonville, Florida].  And then I walked to Stanton [Stanton High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida], which was maybe about four or five blocks from my house.  But I always wanted to walk a long distance or sometime I'd stay with my sister's godmother way out so I could walk with some of my classmates all the way out.  I thought it was fun to walk a distance to school, didn't know that I had it made.
Story_ID: 379648
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I want to talk about your early schooling and elementary, junior and senior high, but before we move to the schooling, to kind of finish up on the neighborhood and growing up, what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up on Beaver Street in LaVilla [Jacksonville, Florida]?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, one of the sites was LaVilla playground [LaVilla Park; Florida C. Dwight Memorial Playground, Jacksonville, Florida], and that was the playground that one of my mother's [Camilla Bolton Perkins] friends, Miss Florida Cutton Dwight, was the director.  She was the first playground director there.  In fact, she was the first playground--African American playground director in Jacksonville [Florida], and she started out at another park, Oakland park, but she was at LaVilla more.  And so I could go there, and she had games to suit, you know, children of all ages, and then they had--they played baseball or softball, basketball, and she had arts and crafts where some of us learned how to knit and crochet, and we played games like jack stones and shoot marbles, and we had the maypole plaiting during May, and all of these kinds of things.  So she made quite a difference in the lives of many of the young people, and some of them fondly recall Miss Florida Dwight as being their person who helped them.  And then there were movies in the neighborhood, and there were several movies around the corner a few blocks, the Strand Theater [Jacksonville, Florida] and the Frolic Theater [Jacksonville, Florida].  And later--I was out of college by then when they did the Roosevelt [Roosevelt Theatre, Jacksonville, Florida], but the Ritz Theatre [Ritz Theatre and Museum, Jacksonville, Florida] was in 1929, and many times our parents--we would walk around there, and when we would leave there, there was Dr. Othewald Smith [ph.] who had a pharmacy and his medical practice in a building across from the Ritz, and he had a little ice cream set-up, the little wrought iron table and chairs, and we just loved to go there after we had been to the movies.
Story_ID: 379649
Speaker 1: You grew up in absolute segregation in Jacksonville [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about segregation as a child, and as a teenager?
Speaker 2: I remember that we had to ride on the back of the bus and that if that's--a sign was placed and say whites forward and Negroes--I think that's what the term was then--back.  And if more whites got on, the bus driver would come and move the sign further back, and eventually you would see that some of the Negroes had to stand if there was no room and you couldn't sit anywhere near them, and I remember that was a major factor, and I remember how people were relieved later when they finally got African American bus drivers and changed that.
Speaker 1: How was this situation explained to you by your parents [Camilla Bolton Perkins and D.W. Perkins]?  Did you--your parents talk about this?
Speaker 2: They sort of talked about--yeah, they talked about it, and I'm trying to remember exactly what terms they use when they said, well, you--you know, you can't sit on the front of the bus, you have to move back to the back.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  How did you feel about that?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, at first I didn't really understand what it meant, so I just went to the back, but then later I realized that this is not the way it should be, and I was not pleased, and I didn't do too much of the bus riding later after I really realized what it was, and when we would go downtown, in some of the stores, you would see the signs over the water fountain that were saying colored water and white water.  And then they had the counter, lunch counters, that mainly were for whites, and the Negroes could go up and maybe order something on one end and then move on out, so that was a major thing.  So when they had what they called Ax Handle Saturday, that was interesting to me.  We were down there when that happened.  But they moved us out so fast, we didn't see the actual encounter, we saw the people picking up the axe handles and moving toward the store where the young NACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] members were attempting to sit at the counters, but we saw the run-in, but the police made us move and go around in another direction out of the way, so we didn't see it.
Speaker 1: How old were you when this happened?
Speaker 2: I was an adult then, because that happened in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, the '60s [1960s], okay.
Speaker 2: That was in 1960.  But as a child, I remember that you had to sit on the back of the--and then we had the--really, the streetcar was the main thing for me, because the streetcar ran right past my house.  It was on tracks.  They called it--some places they called it trolley, but we called it streetcar.  It was on tracks, but you had to sit at the back.
Story_ID: 379650
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  How old were you and what school did you first attend?
Speaker 2: I was five, about five and a half, I guess.  I went to LaVilla School [Jacksonville, Florida].  We called it Old LaVilla, because it was this old two-story building, framed two-story building.  It was--oh, maybe about three blocks, four blocks away around the corner at Church [Street] and Johnson Street or Church and Stuart.  And the elementary classes were on the first floor, and the higher classes were on the second floor.  And then by the time I got to--what was it, fourth or fifth grade, many of the--most of the Jews and all, and Syrians had moved out of the neighborhood, and so they turned the school they had over to African Americans, and that school was--we called--was called LaVilla Park School [Jacksonville, Florida].
Speaker 1: So when you first went, then, it wasn't segregated.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: When you first went, it wasn't segregated then.
Speaker 2: It was segregated when I first went to school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We had a separate building and everything.  Then later we went to the other school that the whites had moved away from.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So it was still segregated.  And we had--I remember we had--they had the old books that they used because some of them had maybe four or five names in them, but my parents [Camilla Bolton Perkins and D.W. Perkins] wouldn't let us use those books.  They would buy the books for us so we wouldn't have to use those second-hand books.
Speaker 1: So how many years did you--how many grades did you complete at the elementary level at this school?  Did you have a middle school, a junior high at that point or--
Speaker 2: No.  At that point it was--they called it grammar, and it went from primary to eighth grade, and you graduated from eighth grade.  But what happened is I was skipped from--they used to have A and B, and I think I was skipped from, like, 3-B to 4-B and then maybe from--or it may have been a little lower than that.  Anyway, I was skipped twice, and I was, you know, ahead of most of those who were--who had started out with me.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked school, and I was an avid reader.  Many times my parents would think I would be asleep, and I'd have a lamp down on the floor reading, and if I picked up a book in the afternoon, I wouldn't go to sleep until after I had completed it.
Speaker 1: What did you like to read?
Speaker 2: All kinds of (laughter) novels, and they--that was what I got.  My godmother would give me books as gifts at Christmas and Easter, and my parents did, and I--they were novels during that earlier time, like 'Little Women' [Louisa May Alcott] and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 379651
Speaker 1: How old were you, then, when you started high school, grade nine?  Did you go to a high school that was nine to twelve or--
Speaker 2: Okay.  What I did, ther- they had an all-girls high school here called Boylan-Haven for girls [Boylan-Haven School, Jacksonville, Florida].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-O-Y-L-A-N.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And H-A-V-E-N.  And this was started in 1860--what was it?  I'm trying to remember whether it was '66 [1866] or '69 [sic. 1886]--by some of the missionary women from New England of the Methodist Episcopal church, because they were--they thought that girls needed a special kind of thing.  They had one for boys.  They had Cookman Institute [Jacksonville, Florida] for boys, but the girls had nowhere, so they started Boylan-Haven.  And I would see the girls riding the streetcar, going back, and so I decided that's where I wanted to go, but my father [D.W. Perkins] didn't want me to go to Boylan-Haven.  But I insisted, so he let me for ninth grade, and--but after I got there, I was disappointed.  So I stayed there for ninth grade, and then I left and went to Stanton [Stanton High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] from tenth through twelfth grade.
Story_ID: 379652
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in high school [Stanton High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my favorite subject was science and English.
Speaker 1: What led to the interest in science?  Was it an individual teacher that influenced you in--to be interested in science or what--did you have--go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I really became interested in science because I wanted to be a pediatrician, and--but my father [D.W. Perkins] decided that women didn't need to try to be in the professions like medicine and law because--and his excuse was he had a friend whose wife had a medical degree, and after she got married and started having children, she never used it, and he thought that was a waste of talent, brain, and money.  So he said, no, I'm not gonna let you go to medical school, but I went ahead and majored in science, hoping that he would change his mind, which he never did.  And during that time there were no scholarships and stuff, so you had to depend on parents or someone to send you to medical school.  So that's how I ended up in the classroom.
Speaker 1: I see.  Were there any teachers at high school that you especially remember having an impact on you, influence you in any way in terms of your studies or your--your development?
Speaker 2: There were quite a number.  I remember Miss Cotsey Jones [ph.], who was one of our English teachers, and she--she really made us interested in English, and then Miss--following her the next year we had Miss Amy Currie, who was really strict about what you did, and even after she became--had retired and come across adults, and if they would even split one verb, she would say, "Oh, evidently I didn't teach you, because you wouldn't be doing that."  And, see, those things were the kind of things that made an impression.  And my history teacher was very interesting.  I liked her, although history was not necessarily what I wanted at the time.
Speaker 1: So you took biology?
Speaker 2: Yes, biology.
Speaker 1: Chemistry?
Speaker 2: Chemistry, but when I got to my senior year, we didn't--see, we only had the segregated one high school, and the teacher who had taught physics was out on maternity leave, and they couldn't find another person to teach physics, so I didn't get physics in high school.
Speaker 1: How much math did you have, mathematics?
Speaker 2: I had quite a bit of math.  Let me see.  What did I have?  Besides all the general math, I had Algebra I and II, I had geometry, I had--what else?  Calculus or something, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Well, that would be quite rare to have calculus at that time, that period (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I didn't have,  I took calculus later at college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: At college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.
Story_ID: 379653
Speaker 1: What did you do during the summers while you were in high school [Stanton High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida]?  Did you have summer jobs during the summertime or--
Speaker 2: I tried (laughter)--I went somewhere to take a job, I think it was at a hospital, and I didn't last but about a week (laughter).
Speaker 1: What kind of work was it?  What did they have you doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, they had us doing all kinds of things, and I said, no, this is not for me, and I couldn't stand on my feet all day like that, so I basically--and during the summers I worked--when I was in high school you mean?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I'd--I ended up going to the Girl Scout camp and voyage camp and, you know, doing that kind of thing and volunteering, working with younger children.
Story_ID: 379654
Speaker 1: So you finished high school [Stanton High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-nine [1939].
Speaker 1: And what came next?  Where did you move on to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--I moved on to Florida A&M College [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] in Tallahassee [Florida].  I had planned and had applied and been accepted at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], but all of a sudden my father [D.W. Perkins] decided, oh, that's so far for her to go, and he said, I think she needs to go somewhere in the state, so I ended up going to Florida A&M.
Speaker 1: And that was a public school, a public college then, right?
Speaker 2: That was a public college, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What was the tuition?  Do you remember?  Or was it free at that time for state residents?
Speaker 2: No, it was never free that I knew of.  We had to pay all the way through.  But the rates in comparison to what they are today, it's almost like it was free.  And it was separate and segregated, because over on the other side they had Florida State College for Women [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida], Florida--yeah, Florida State College for women, only.  But then after World War II [WWII], when veterans and all came back, and some brought wives and moved into Tallahassee, they didn't see the need of going down to Gainesville [Florida].  See, Gainesville, University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], was an all-male school, and so they just said no, and they protested to the state to have to leave Tallahassee to go to Gainesville, and the women would have to leave Gainesville to come to Tallahassee, so they made both of the schools co-educational.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But Florida A&M was co-educational from the beginning.
Speaker 1: How were those college years for you?  How do you remember your four years at FAMU?
Speaker 2: Well, I loved college.  (Laughter) In fact, I told someone I think I--one time I almost forgot I was--what I was there for, 'cause I was majoring in extra-curricular activities (laughter).  I was in the traveling debating team, I was on the Y [Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)] board, I was on the drama team, I was a part of the Sunday school, and I pledged to the sorority there and just was into quite a number of activities.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you where you were inducted, the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and Beta Alpha Chapter at Florida A&M.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your sorority?
Speaker 2: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The pink and the green.
Speaker 2: Pink and green (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who was your--who were your chemistry instructors at Florida A&M?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The one that I remember was a Dr. Paul Fields [ph.].  In fact, I believe he taught me all of my chemistry, because, see, Florida A&M at that time was a rather small college.  So one instructor may teach you several different times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were there other women majoring in chemistry?
Speaker 2: There were a few that--I think basically, with my class may not have been about but two of us, and one of the instructors would make assignments in books that were in the library, and the fellas would go and check out the books, and they would pass them around from one to the other, and they would keep them checked out, and we would have difficulty getting those extra books to study from, because we were in--you know, only two of us, and we had a hard time trying to get some of those books, because we had to fight against the fellas.
Speaker 1: Was there any kind of--I don't know--discrimination or behavior from the male chemistry students towards you and the other--I mean, looking at a lady coming into chemistry, was there any obstacles there?
Speaker 2: They didn't seem to show it (laughter) openly, so if it was, it was hidden.  They seemed to--you know, I guess they say, well, if they wanna try this, let 'em try it, yeah.  They weren't openly hostile.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 379655
Speaker 1: You graduated from FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] with a bachelor's degree in chemistry.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What came next?  Where did you move now with that degree?
Speaker 2: Well, I started--since I--University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], Florida State [Florida State College for Women; Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida] were not open to African Americans, I would go during summers to some of the other schools.  I went to Teachers College at Columbia University [New York, New York] a couple of times, but I couldn't go regularly because I had a family.  And then when National Science Foundation started giving out grants, I got one, and I went to A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], and I went to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] twice, because one of my biology instructors, a Dr. Frederick Inge [Frederick D. Inge], was teaching there and he was over that end, he made sure that I got into that program.  And then I went to--oh, my first experience, though, was at Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland [Ohio], is now Case Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University], but at the time they were two separate schools.  And I went there and took three chemistry courses, and at the end of the summer the instructor said, "Well, we gave you such a rigorous time because we wanted you to go back and teach prospective engineers so that you can send them to Case."  I said, oh, I should have selected the wrong one (laughter).  But I did well, but I--it was work.  It wasn't, you know, play.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Now, when you were taking these summer courses and going to Case and to Columbia--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --were you teaching at this point?
Speaker 2: I was teaching.  I was teaching, and some of the hours could be used for extending my teaching certificate.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  Where did you first teach, what school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I first taught at a little school in what, Gifford, Florida, which was the African American, or the Negro section, of Vero Beach [Florida], and I ended there because one of my friends was principal, and he and his wife were down there, and he just had to--he needed a science and a math teacher, so he prevailed upon me to come on, because at the time I was only going to be able to sub in Jacksonville [Florida].  So I went down and spent one year, and I ended up teaching algebra, general math, chemistry, general science, whatever (laughter).  And he wanted me to teach geometry.  I said, oh, no.  So he ended up teaching the geometry.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 379656
Speaker 1: Your first teaching experience was in black Vero Beach [Florida].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (laughter).
Speaker 1: Science, math, and so on and so on.
Speaker 2: What was your next teaching position?  You only stayed at Gifford [Florida] a year, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What was your next position?
Speaker 1: It was in A.L. Lewis Junior High School [Jacksonville, Florida], and because I went in sort of as the--maybe the last person, the principal told everyone else to, you know, give her at least one class, so you know what happened (laughter).  I got the worst classes (laughter).  But anyway, I had maybe a health--a health class, and an eighth grade science class and a ninth grade general science class, but I had a combination of all--some all kinds of classes, and I worked there about three years before I went on maternity leave, and when I came back, I was sent back there for maybe a couple of years, and then I was moved on to Davis Street School [Jacksonville, Florida] and--
Speaker 2: Let me just stop you there if I can.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Who was A.L. Lewis [Abraham Lincoln Lewis], the same gentleman that you referred to earlier (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --as being the president of the Afro-American Insurance [Afro-American Life Insurance Company, Jacksonville, Florida]?
Speaker 1: That's right.  And the school was named for him because he had made quite a number of outstanding contributions in the community.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: And there are one or two other things that perhaps are named for him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the school at first was LaVilla Park School [Jacksonville, Florida], and then they named it for him.  In fact, many of the schools in Jacksonville [Florida] are named for outstanding African Americans.  In fact, we have six former members or pastors who have schools that were named in their honor.
Story_ID: 379657
Speaker 1: Now, your first daughter [Muriel Thompson Watkins] was born in 1947.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  So you had a--went on maternity leave.  Tell me when were you married and who you married.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was married on June 22nd, 1946, and I married Capers Michael Thompson [Capers M. Thompson, Sr.], and his father [Earlinn Thompson] and mother [Ruth Vaught Thompson]--his mother was a teacher, his father was a pharmacist.  And there were eight children.  He was, like, the third of that number, and they were evenly-divided siblings, four boys and four girls.
Speaker 1: What was his occupation when you married?  What was he doing?
Speaker 2: He was in the post office.
Speaker 1: A postman.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a postman, and then he later became a clerk in the post office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had gone to college with me [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and stayed about a year and a half, and he later went to the [U.S.] military and was to come back, but he had taken the examination for the post office and was accepted, and so he said, I'll work here temporarily.  But, you know, the temporary became permanent, but it turned out to be a good job because he got paid year round and the benefits were good.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 379658
Speaker 1: So your daughter, Marie, was born '47 [1947], right, 1947 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Muriel [Muriel Thompson Watkins] was born.
Speaker 1: Muriel.  I'm sorry.  And then you went--you continued, went back to the classroom?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And where was your next appointment?  Did you go back to Lewis Junior High [A.L. Lewis Junior High School, Jacksonville, Florida] or--
Speaker 2: For a short time, I think for a year or two, and then I was sent to Davis Street [Davis Street School, Jacksonville, Florida] because they wanted to do an exchange with a teacher, so I went to Davis Street.  And later, after Davis Street, I later went out on another maternity leave, and went--when I went back, I ended up--Davis Street had become Isaiah Blocker [Isaiah Blocker Junior High School, Jacksonville, Florida].  It was named for one of the former principals.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So who was born second, who was the second child?
Speaker 2: Capers Michael Ali or Capers Michael Thompson, Jr. [Capers M. Thompson, Jr.].
Speaker 1: And what year was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1951.
Speaker 1: And then you went back and continued to teach?
Speaker 2: For a short time, and I had to go back out again (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Reginald Daniel Thompson [Reginald Thompson] was born in 1953.
Speaker 1: And then you went back to teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I stayed in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who took care of the children while you were teaching?
Speaker 2: Well, at first I had someone come in every day while I was gone, and for a while it worked out well, but then later would have someone call at the last minute and say she wasn't feeling well, and so that didn't work well, and so I found a nice nursery, a kindergarten in the area, and sent the children, because it became to be a hassle.
Speaker 1: Right.  Uh-huh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was what happened, but they did all right in the nursery and kindergarten.
Story_ID: 379659
Speaker 1: Now, eventually you moved on to teach to--teach at three--at two high schools; is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Two high schools?  What was the first high school that you--
Speaker 2: Well, really three, in a way.  One was junior-senior high.  Then one that was Northwestern [Northwestern Junior-Senior High School; Northwestern Middle School, Jacksonville, Florida], then one was Raines High School [William M. Raines High School, Jacksonville, Florida], and then the third one was Andrew Jackson [Andrew Jackson High School, Jacksonville, Florida].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.  And all that time you were teaching chemistry primarily or--
Speaker 2: Primarily, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you remember about those high school teaching years?  What are your memories of teaching high school chemistry all those years?
Speaker 2: Well, the students who were taking the chemistry seemed to--most of them seemed to have been very interested, and so it was not too difficult a job.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Now, the junior high students don't seem to ben- you know, they are more playful, they aren't quite sure where they are going.
Speaker 1: But the senior high students who are in disciplines like chemistry were, you know, easier to handle because they knew what they wanted to do, and you--they would really go to it except for a few who maybe the parents made them get in it and they didn't wanna get in it and they didn't put forth the effort that they should have.
Speaker 2: Did any of your high school chemistry students go on and major in chemistry and follow in your footsteps or go on in the professional of chemistry?
Speaker 1: Many of them.  Many of them.  I just was with one of them who is a--a doctor out in California.  He was here for the dedication of a part of a road to one of his sisters because of her outstanding work with the national teachers organization and the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations], and he was talking about, you know, how inspirational it had been to have been, you know, a student at that time.  And then some of them said, guess what I'm--what I majored in after they fought so.  I say what?  Not--yes, chemistry (laughter), so some of them majored in chemistry, some of them majored in things that led to medical careers.
Speaker 2: This was a lab course, the chemistry you taught, they had lab, laboratory?
Speaker 1: They had lab, but in some cases I had to make the lab up, then in one--at Raines they worked out a system where I would have the same group of students who were my chemistry students for their lunch period.  And so the way the lunch period was set up, they would have enough space left so that the--the lab would be able to work out as a separate lab, but in most cases, I just had to make their own--the lab.  They had laboratory equipment now, but some of the periods were only a single period, so I had to work out a lab schedule for it.
Story_ID: 379660
Speaker 1: When did you leave Raines High School [William M. Raines High School, Jacksonville, Florida]?  You were there from 1965 until when?
Speaker 2: January of 1970, and it was that time the Duval County [Florida] school board had decided to desegregate faculties on--in a larger, official way.  They had done a little bit, but this was official, and so I left there.  And I said that I went to Andrew Jackson [Andrew Jackson High School, Jacksonville, Florida], but that one semester I didn't go to Andrew Jackson.  I went downtown as a federal desegregation teacher.  I forgot that.  They had--they selected four of us on the senior high level to be federal desegregation teachers.  I was in science, and there was someone in history, someone in math, and someone in English, and we had to go to different schools where teachers had been reassigned to see how they were faring, and we did that for one semester.  They also had some in the elementary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were kind of overseeing the deseg process?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, as a part--just as one of the teacher part.
Speaker 1: You weren't teaching chemistry, then, you were doing this work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I wasn't teaching chemistry, I was just doing that.  I was going to see how they were doing and, you know, we were supposed to make suggestions if they needed help, and that kind of thing, because--
Speaker 1: These were teachers that had been reassigned now?
Speaker 2: These are teachers who had been reassigned--
Speaker 1: --under the desegregation code.
Speaker 2: --under the desegregation code.  And what happened--a lot of the whites who had--who were reassigned to the African American schools, some of them refused to come, and so they sat out that semester.  They stayed home that semester, and the school board let them go right on back in their positions when they came back, but the African American teachers were not given that opportunity.  So we had to go and see how they were doing at the different schools, so we were going all over town from Eastside to Westside to Northside to Southside.
Speaker 1: How many high schools were there, one on each (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were a number of them by then.  There were a number of them.  Then we had junior high, too.  Now, that was where the major problems were in the junior, right before they became middle schools, you know.  We went from junior high to middle school.
Speaker 1: You had oversight over the junior high, too, then?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had to do all of the secondary schools.
Speaker 1: Now, you did this for a half year or a year?
Speaker 2: Half year, from January until June, and the school board decided they didn't need secondary people any longer for that, because they had supervisors, so they said the supervisors could do it, the subject area supervisors, but they let the elementaries continue.  Many of them continued because they had more elementary schools.  They had gangs of elementary schools, so they kept some of them on for maybe another year or two.  So when I found out that they had an opening at Andrew Jackson, I applied for it, because I was assigned to a school that was miles away in another section of town, and I decided I didn't want to drive way out there.
Story_ID: 379661
Speaker 1: So how long did you teach at Andrew Jackson [Andrew Jackson High School, Jacksonville, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Oh, about six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About six years.
Speaker 1: And in the same subject area?
Speaker 2: And the same subject area.  All chemistry, because I had worked on chemistry curriculum during the summer with some others, and one of the men who taught at Andrew Jackson asked me if I'd like to teach there, and I said, "Well, what are you gonna do?"  And he said, "Well, I'm moving into curriculum at Andrew Jackson, so they need a chemistry teacher."  So I said, well, let me know who to see, and I--he did, and I took his place.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  What came next after Andrew Jackson?
Speaker 2: I decided to see what the next level was like, the--the junior college level, and so I started working part time there.  One summer I did a biology class for someone who was on summer sabbatical, and then the next time I did about three years of physics at the naval air station [Naval Station Mayport, Jacksonville, Florida].  They offered classes at the naval air station at night for people who--for military people who were off duty at night and also for maybe some of the civilians who worked there that wanted to take courses and they got credit through some of the colleges at the time.
Speaker 1: When did you get your master's degree?
Speaker 2: I didn't get my master's degree until 1974, because one thing these--most of the schools in the state were not open to African Americans at that time, and so I had gone to schools occasionally in and out of the state.  Now, Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] finally got a master's program, but it was not in--I was thinking I was gonna get it in chemistry.  And so I didn't want to go to Florida A&M when they finally got one because they were just meaning to doing a little education and a little counseling.  So I went to various science institutes and to my--on to summer school on my own, like Case Institute of Technology [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], Teachers College at Columbia [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York], A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] in North Carolina, and Hampton University [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in Virginia, and took courses.  So when I went into the master's program when it was open at University of North Florida here in Jacksonville [Florida], I had about forty graduate hours.  And, of course, I think they only gave me credit for maybe six of them or maybe nine, but they had a maximum number that they would let you carry into that area.
Speaker 1: Now, when you got your master's degree you were teaching at that point, 1974.
Speaker 2: I was at Andrew Jackson (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Still at Andrew?
Speaker 2: I was still at Andrew Jackson.
Speaker 1: But you moved up another step beyond Andrew Jackson, did you not?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That was when I moved into the Florida Junior College [Florida State College at Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida], and I went to Kent Campus, which is going toward the naval air station.  And I thoroughly enjoyed that, because one thing was interesting, that campus had been a military housing unit for the naval air station, and we--they had little barracks, and so our classes were in barracks.  I had one class of a building for lectures and another building for chemistry lab, and it was really interesting.  But I think after that first year they started building a permanent campus, so they would maybe tear down my lecture hall, and I'd have to go somewhere else while they were completing that part, then they would get around to another one, and they just built the buildings one by one by tearing down the different barracks and building the brick campus, and they have a lovely campus out there, and they have everything in it that we requested, including a teaching auditorium that--where, you know, you are down here and the students are in slanted, you know, seating up front, and then the boards are there where they can see them, so some of the people were complaining in the other departments, how did you get this?  We said, well, they told everyone to write out your request, and we requested that, because we knew that was the best way to do it.  So when I taught the chemistry there, I had, like, maybe two of my classes would have lecture together, and then they would have separate labs periods and days.
Speaker 1: How long did you teach at the Florida community college?
Speaker 2: About five years I came out, I retired, because my husband [Capers M. Thompson, Sr.] was ill and he wanted me to come out so we could travel, and we did do some traveling, and we got to do some more traveling.  We went to Los Angeles [California] and San Francisco [California], and we went to Hawaii.  We passed by a travel agency and they said, "See Las Vegas or Hawaii," and we said, "Hawaii! (Laughter) We can see Las Vegas anytime."
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 379662
Speaker 1: Today you are known for your research, writings, preservation, dissemination of the African American history of Jacksonville [Florida].  When did you move on to that road and how did you get started into African American history?  What have you done and tell us--tell me how you get into that.  Because my experience was very similar.  I taught science, and then I moved from that into history and have done African American history, so we have done some very similar things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Similar things, very similar things.
Speaker 1: Tell me, how did you get interested in African American history?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because you, like me, didn't like history in high school, so--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--disaster (laughter).
Speaker 1: --how did you get into it?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was one of the persons that my mother [Camilla Bolton Perkins] was very friendly with had--I had worked with her when I was at Isaiah Blocker [Isaiah Blocker Junior High School, Jacksonville, Florida].  She was--she became--she was an English teacher became the first dean of girls in the school, and so she said, "Well, I want you to help do some things--extra things," and she said, "One of the things we are going to look at Miss Eartha White's [Eartha M.M. White] collection."  Miss Eartha M.M. White had quite a collection of artifacts, papers, books, photos that she had kept, and she had a little building in a section out--known as Moncrief Road that she called her museum, and Miss Rutledge [Wilhelmina Rutledge] was incidentally the president or the chairman of that little museum, and my mother happened to be one of the members.  I can't remember whether she was treasurer or secretary or what.  And so she said, "I'd like you to be my co-chairman," and I accepted it.  And so when I saw all of these things that Miss White had, I just became fascinated, and I started doing research, and I didn't--I identified some of the photos and things that she had, and so what we did, we were able to remodel--we had got a grant, and we remodeled the second floor of the mission, part of it, and set up what we called the Eartha M.M. White Memorial Center [Eartha M.M. White Memorial Art and Historical Resource Center, Jacksonville, Florida].
Speaker 1: Now, this was when, what year or time period?
Speaker 2: This was beginning around 1976.
Speaker 1: After you had retired.
Speaker 2: No.  I was still working, but I was going there.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) 1981 you're talking about.  Close to retirement, okay.  All right.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, close to retirement, uh-huh, and I'd go by when I would leave work and do that kind of thing, and so we had some--the furniture, we had it reupholstered and got it organized and set up, and we got some of her papers, but incidentally, more--a lot of her major papers are at the University of North Florida [Jacksonville, Florida].  They have a Eartha M.M. White collection over there, because someone went to that museum and went down to her--the trustees of Miss White's property and said that they had some boxes of junk out at the museum and wanted to know if they could have them.  Well, the trustees did not go and look.  They said, okay, you may take them.  And so the person took them out there, and they had a major collection of E.L. Weems film and photos and this--E.L. Weems was a major African American photographer in Jacksonville.  He was a member of this church [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida] and church photographer, and his portrait is right over on the side on the wall over there.
Story_ID: 379663
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually let me just stop a moment.  Who was Eartha White?
Speaker 1: Eartha M.M. White was--
Speaker 2: Who was she?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. She was a humanitarian.  She organized the Clara White Mission [Jacksonville, Florida].  She and her mother [Clara English White] lived across the street there on 1st Street, and her mother started a soup kitchen where people came through the side door and they gave them soup every day.  That was way back around 1904.  And so Miss Eartha White--her daughter helped her with that.  When her mother died, she decided to continue the work and organized and called it the Clara White Mission, and she moved from there and found a building on Ashley Street as a permanent site.  It was empty, and so she went to the owners and asked if she could have the building rent-free for about three months so she could paint it and fix it up and then later she would try to buy it, and so it is--it became well-established, and this--I think she finally was able to buy it around 1932 or '33 [1933], and it is still going today.  It's financed through city grants through United Way [United Way Worldwide] and through contributions of many interested people, and they feed the needy every day, and they have long lines.  Sometimes they feed as many as four hundred people, and they come from everywhere.
Speaker 2: Awesome.
Speaker 1: And the one time they were also giving out clothing and doing other services, but they basically do the feeding.  And now they have a culinary school there for homeless veterans, and when they finished, some of them end up getting jobs at restaurants, hotels, and other places.  So she was the person who I was referring to.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: And so she had many collections, because she knew a lot of rich people, and if they decided, I wanna throw this chair out, she'd say, oh, no, don't throw it out, I'll take it, and she had it in her little museum.  But vandals broke in in around '75 [1975], and so that was when the board decided it's time to do something with her things, and so some of them are on the second floor of the Clara White Mission and they are set up like a little museum.  It doesn't meet the qualifications of a real museum, so I--that's why I called it a mini-museum.
Speaker 2: I see.
Story_ID: 379664
Speaker 1: Well, you got into, to writing items around the history, black history in Jacksonville [Florida]. Tell me about your writings and where did they appear and how did you go about that work?
Speaker 2: Well, I was really starting out to write family history and family genealogy, and so when one of the African American newspapers came along, I was asked if I would, you know, write a column during Black History Month, so I started doing that, and I did that from '85 [1985] until '91 [1991], and I just would select any topic.  I may decide to talk about African American politics, I may decide to talk about a person that is in business, I may talk about an organization or anything, some event that occurred, maybe some social event, like someone had a debutante party at the Richmond Hotel [Jacksonville, Florida] here for their daughter, and that kind of thing, and it caught on, and we put the name, Reflections on Black Jacksonville, and--
Speaker 1: That was the name of the column?
Speaker 2: That was the name of the column.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the newspaper that--
Speaker 2: The newspaper was the Jacksonville Free Press, and it's still in existence today, but I have not written for them in--well, I may occasionally put something in and I turn in a few.
Speaker 1: So this is a weekly writing that you did?  Was it a weekly column?
Speaker 2: It was a weekly writing, it was a weekly column, but it ended up being a lot of work trying to write weekly, but then it sort of gave me something to do, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Of course, you retired in 1981, so you had now more time, I guess, to look at the black history of the city.
Speaker 2: Yes, I had more time, and I--I would go to the library, because they had a mass of all kinds of microfilm, because the one major newspaper that was finally left, the Jacksonville--what is it--the Florida Times-Union had once--and the Jacksonville Journal [Jacksonville Journal-Courier] had once had a little section about two pages they called News For and About Colored People.  And when I went down trying to find that, I found out that they had destroyed all of those except for--from 1950 to 1965 of the Florida Times-Union, and they had not saved any of the Jacksonville Journal, and we had some articles left--my father [D.W. Perkins] would save a lot of newspapers and all, and I found columns and things that people had done in his files, and that's why some--we did a group--two or three of us did a presentation for the staff and editors for the Florida Times-Union one year, and they were wondering where we got some of the things, and we had it from our parents having saved those papers, and the Times-Union had not saved them, but the others--they do have them on microfiche from 1950 to 1965.  And so I just continued from then, and people became interested, and it helped the newspaper with their distributions, and people would be interested to be interviewed, and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 379665
Speaker 1: Now, this writing that you did on a weekly basis and the research and the sharing, that provided other activities for you in African American history, so what is some of the other involvements that you've had in the African American historical resurrection here?
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Laughter) Well, one of the things I was--became a tour guide for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] in their black historical tours.  The group had organized and isolated about several sites as historic sites, and I ended up being one of the tour guides to take groups around, and our groups included school children, senior citizens, young adults, or other groups who would call and want to have tours, and then two friends and I started putting African American history on slides, and we would do slide narratives at maybe the junior college during Black History Month and some of the schools, elementary and high school and middle schools, would invite us to come and do presentations for them for their black history presentations and even other organizations, so it developed and moved into that.  And then I was chairman of our history and art--history committee here at the church [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida], and we would write--every time we'd have an anniversary we would do a little mini-history of the church and we asked to be a standing committee, and we tried to keep the history going, and we are now in the process of trying to do a whole history book, and it's difficult to get people to stay committed to do a whole book.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: But we're still gonna try to do it.
Speaker 1: Well, have you--I want to come back to the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], African American--what is it called?
Speaker 2: African--our tour, African American tour.  Here's one of the brochures with the name on it.
Speaker 1: Maybe we can pull it up and you can--yeah.
Speaker 2: (Displays brochure) It's a tour of metropolitan Jacksonville [Florida] with the historical sites, and sometimes we add some other--there are some people that will come and say, well, I'd like to see something other than African American sites, so we have solved that in one way we add something like taking them by Alltel Stadium [EverBank Field, Jacksonville, Florida] where the Jaguars [Jacksonville Jaguars] play and the new arena, and then we have A. Philip Randolph Park [A. Philip Randolph Heritage Park, Jacksonville, Florida] on that same side of town, and there's a statue that has been placed there, Bob Hayes, the fastest--you know--human runner who was--who graduated from Matthew Gilbert School [Matthew W. Gilbert High School] here in Jacksonville and Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Jacksonville, Florida] before he went for--he went to Dallas Cowboys.  So we--we add a few other sites that would be of interest to them, but this is the major thing.
Story_ID: 379666
Speaker 1: Describe one or two of the major historical sites in your black heritage trail.  What are a couple of the sites?  I'm sure that Bethel Baptist [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida] is on the tour (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is on the tour--yes, it's on the tour.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little, briefly, about the history of this church.
Speaker 2: All right.  The church has an interesting history.  It started out in eight--it was organized in 1838 as an integrated church, because you had four white members, the minister and his wife, and a deacon and his wife, and you had two slaves, Peggy and Bacchus, and we have had that documented in a book called 'The History of Jacksonville from 1530 until 1924,' [sic. 'History of Jacksonville, Florida and Vicinity: 1513 to 1924'] by T. Frederick Davis, and then there are other sources with that.  And they built the first church in Jacksonville [Florida] in nine--in 1840.  That was the first church of any denomination, it was built in 1840, and it was downtown around Newnan Street.  But later they decided to move out toward Myrtle Avenue, which was going westward, and when they moved that way, they picked up quite a number more members.  And, in addition, one of the things about it, most of the Civil War was fought in this area at Olustee, Florida, which is a little further away, but then there was a scrimmage that was in Jacksonville, and they said that the first blood that was shed in Jacksonville was around Bethel Baptist Church.  It was out in the Myrtle Avenue area, but then later they decided to move back downtown, and this was still during the Civil War.  But when they got downtown and got to their building, the government came and took over the church building for federal soldiers who had to be hospitalized, and made it into a hospital, so the members had to meet other places, so that meant they were scattered and divided.  And later after the war, the two groups went to court and--because by this time the African American members were in the majority, they were awarded the name Bethel and the property, but they later sold the property to the whites and moved and built their own building at another location.  And finally they built a brick building that was similar to the one that they originally were in, and when they outgrew it because it only would hold a hundred people, when they moved from there, they had to tear that building down and build a brick building, and that was a lovely brick building that was burned in the May 5th, 1901 fire [sic. May 3rd, 1901].  And after that, the members had to work hard to restore their own homes and get another building, so by 1904 they were able to get this building completed.  M.H. Hubbard from Utica, New York, was the architect, but most of the workers--
Speaker 1: So you're talking about the old building that we're--right here, that we're in now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right there along the other side, the historic building.  And, though, incidentally, the pews that in there are the original pews that were placed there in 1904, and the stained glass windows were placed there, and there are four major ones that tell something on the life of Christ.
Speaker 1: When was this new addition we're in now, when was this built?
Speaker 2: This part--okay.  This was a part of the old.  But then on the other side where you were supposed to go around, this education administration building, and that was completed in 1988, and then that new building that you stopped in front of was completed in 2000, and the first service was held in there in January of 2000.
Story_ID: 379667
Speaker 1: Well, we are here surrounded by all the artifacts and the history of Bethel [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida].  Did you help to put this together, this museum that we're--church history museum (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I led the group in trying to get it together, because as we were writing histories, we asked people to look in their attics and garages and find old programs and old books and artifacts, and we got so much until when we finished, we were saying, well, what are we gonna do with them?  And so we said, we can't throw it out.  And so in the process, the pastor was moving from this room, which used to be the pastor's study, into an office in the administration building, so we asked for this room.  And so this is what we have, and we got this set up and had the grand opening in 1995.
Speaker 1: I see.  As I sit here talking with you, in the display case to my right, your left, there's a very large book, and it says, membership book.  That has the names of members during what period?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's an interesting book.  It has the names of members from 1870 to 1924, and there are some others, but the sad thing is that the book that comes from '25 [1925] to the '50s [1950s] is missing.  But then we have one that takes up in the '50s [1950s] and moves on.  But we were happy to have that one.  Someone who had a beautiful handwriting entered the names of each one of those members.  They gave the name, the address, the church that they came from, the location of that church, and how much that person pledged to give each week, each month, or each year, and all of that is listed in that membership book.
Speaker 1: What are the--some of your other favorite items and artifacts in this church museum?  Which ones do you have special feeling about, any others besides that?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things, some photos that we have on either side behind you have the photos of some of our early organizations like deaconess boards, deacon boards, trustee boards, early choirs, and that kind of thing.  And in the center there, there's a large list of people who made contributions to the reduction of the mortgage in--between 1918 and 1919, and we found that on the stairwell, and it was where we found this rolled up, and it was real dusty, and we said, oh, how in the world can we clean it up.  But when we looked again, there were two pages, and all we had to do was peel off the top page, and we have a clear document, and so we were able to go and have it framed so that people can look.  And people gave anywhere from maybe fifty cents up to--I think the highest amount was like five hundred, which was given--left as a part of the estate of Mr. A.W. Price, who was a member here and also one of the seven founders of the Afro-American Life Insurance Company [Jacksonville, Florida].
Story_ID: 379668
Speaker 1: In addition to Bethel Baptist [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida] as part of your tour, how many other sites are there on the tour--
Speaker 2: We have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that people can visit when they come to Jacksonville [Florida]?
Speaker 2: We have over thirty sites.  I think on that brochure we have thirty, but we have added some additional sites since then.  Oh, and incidentally, in here--I'd like to go back to here--we have a little bulletin over there, 1914 church directory, and we looked in this large membership book, and we saw John Hurston name there, and we said, we wonder if Zora's [Zora Neale Hurston] name is anywhere, because we've been told when she came and lived with him for a few years that she was a member of the church, and we went, and sure enough, she's listed in the church district that he belonged, and they lived on Evergreen Avenue, and her name is there.  It's John Hurston, his wife, Blanche [Blanche Hurston], and Zora Neale Hurston.
Speaker 1: Good. Very good.
Speaker 2: And that was--and some people have come to do research, and they said that that wa- those were the missing years, they didn't know where she was, and they found it here.
Story_ID: 379669
Speaker 1: What is your current project in working on the history of your city [Jacksonville, Florida]?  What's your current project?
Speaker 2: Well, my current project I'm working on here--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --history of the city--I want to do a book that perhaps uses the columns [Reflections on Black Jacksonville] that I've written and just do a column of book rather than a straight-out history book, because those reflections of--most of it has been documented, and then some gives personal reflections from people, and then my other project is one here where we are trying to write a real history of Bethel [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida], because when we look up, we read, and there are many variations that people start writing, and it's not based on really documentation and real research.
Story_ID: 379670
Speaker 1: I think that we probably now want to move to what we call the wrap-up questions in our HistoryMakers interview, and let me ask you first, is there anything else you would like to add to this interview that I have not asked you about?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything except that I would like to see some much younger people become interested in perpetuating our history, because I think our history is so rich, and they seem to think that nothing was done by African Americans, but we were the builders of America.  It was built on our sweat, tears, and blood.  And I think that younger people need to know that and move and it's not old stuff, but I think they need to know that they need to have an appreciation of some of the things and the bridges that helped get them over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Why is history important?
Speaker 2: It's important because you need to know where you came from so you won't make the same mistakes.
Speaker 1: Are the public schools in Jacksonville [Florida] taking advantage of and using a lot of the rich history that you and the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and others have unveiled and presented?  Are the school systems incorporating any of that today that you can see?
Speaker 2: Very--to a very limited amount, because I was on a project--oh, it's been--I can't remember whether it was 1997 or '8 [1998] or something where two or three of us along with some others were given the task by the Jacksonville Historical Society [Jacksonville, Florida] and the school board to write a minority history project, and we did that, and they brought teachers from public schools to do lesson plans based on the narratives and research that we had done.  But the only problem is the person in charge who was the supervisor became ill, had a stroke at a very young age, like forty-two, and the school board didn't follow through on it, so that material's just sort of gotten lost.  So there are a few teachers who try, because there's a mandate that they do incorporate black history into the curriculum, but very few follow through on it, but there are some who are very interested in incorporating it, and they call people out to talk with their classes to show them film and show them film strips and, you know, interact with the students about the rich history.
Speaker 1: Are you doing--are you still doing a lot of that yourself or--
Speaker 2: To a limited extent, uh-huh.  But I'm trying to get what we have on video so that it can be used by the schools, because it's difficult sometimes for us to continue to be going from school to school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.

Speaker 1: How do you feel, Mrs. Thompson [HistoryMaker Camilla Thompson], about the way that you have led your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm--I think I'm pretty well-satisfied, because I--I don't know too much more that I would have done or--I've had very few things that I would change.  There may be a few things, but on a whole, I think it's been rich and rewarding, and I've volunteered and done the things I wanted, and shared with others, so I don't really have any real regrets.

Speaker 1: You mentioned several times, and we talked about it on the telephone, that you'd like to transform your columns [Reflections on Black Jacksonville], your weekly columns, on black history from the newspaper [Jacksonville Free Press] into a book.  Is there anything else that you'd like to do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: Put some of the material that we did on the oral history on video so they can be distributed to schools and other places where they would have the use of it, particularly so the students would learn and know and get an appreciation for the rich heritage that they have.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American communities here in Jacksonville [Florida]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That things will improve, because we just have so many instances recently of crime.  There's one time during the earlier part of the year they were saying that Jacksonville was the--had the highest criminal rate in the state, but now they have carried it to a smaller town based on percentages, but that's not a good (laughter) thing to be noted for.  And I'm just hoping that things would get back where they should be, and I really wish that they could find some way to encourage those people who stand on the corners doing nothing to go and get some kind of training so that they can be productive.  And if they can be productive, then they'll feel better about themselves and they won't have time to think about all of the heinous crimes and things that are going on.
Speaker 1: Okay, one last question.  How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I guess as someone who tried to help others to improve their lives as much as possible and be as helpful as possible.

Speaker 1: This is a group of African American lawyers in the early 1950s, and they called themselves the Colored Lawyers Association, and in 1968 the Colored Lawyers Association renamed the group to the name D.W. Perkins Bar Association [Daniel Webster Perkins Bar Association, Inc.], and they have continued the work of helping those who need legal advice and legal help as well as providing scholarships for students who want to become lawyers, and also they provide services like helping them prepare for the bar examinations, and D.W. Perkins with this group--these--most of those lawyers in that group were lawyers who did their sort of intern practice in his office.  Many of the lawyers when they first came out would come to his office and do their practice work before they went into their own businesses or went into state or local agencies.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And which one is--
Speaker 1: And the one on the left front seated is D.W. Perkins.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.  I can't see it too well.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: This is the Capers Thompson family, my family, with my husband, Capers Thompson [Capers M. Thompson, Sr.] and [HistoryMaker] Camilla Thompson, and these are our three children.  On your left we have Reginald Thompson, and then next to him we have Capers Thompson, the father, and then I'm next to him, Camilla Thompson, and next to me is our daughter, Muriel Thompson Watkins, and over on the other side is our youngest son, Reginald Daniel Thompson.  And so we were standing on the steps of Bethel [Bethel Baptist Institutional Church, Jacksonville, Florida] here in front of the historic sanctuary, because the new sanctuary had not been built.  I think I need to hold them closer to me first, and then I can see what it is.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) father and mother (unclear), when it's taken and where?
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my parents which was taken during the 1960s.  On one side you see my mother, Camilla Marie Bolton Perkins [Camilla Bolton Perkins], who was a former school teacher and organized the barristers' wives.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  The three Perkins children.  I'm standing.  I'm the oldest, Camilla; and then my other sister, Lavinia [Lavinia Perkins Mathis], is standing on the other side; and the youngest one, Danette [Danette Perkins Robinson], is seated.  She's the baby of the family.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) taken?
Speaker 1: Taken--oh, my goodness.  I imagine it must have been sometimes in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear) what is this a photo of?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Oh, this is a photo of the historic sanctuary of Bethel, and this was completed in 1904, and it still finds use, because we have many services in there still, and it is one of the finest churches in--that was in Jacksonville [Florida] during that earlier day, and excursions would come from all over the nation just to see the church.  That was a monument, they said, to the colored people in America.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  This is the last one.
Speaker 2: What is that?  No, I don't know what that is.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) at FAMU College [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Here's a photo of me at Florida A&M College.  I'm sitting on the steps outside of Jackson Davis Hall, one of the famous dormitories at the time, and that later became a classroom after I left Florida A&M.
