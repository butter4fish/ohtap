Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 633751
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask, ask about your mother's side and your father's side [Louis Taylor, Sr.], but I'm gonna ask about them separately so we don't--we don't get them confused.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can, can you get your--give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Tena [Tena Chapman Taylor], T-E-N-A, middle initial was B--you want her maiden name or her--
Speaker 1: Maiden name and--
Speaker 2: Maiden name--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was Chapman, C-H-A-P-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: C-H-A--
Speaker 2: P--
Speaker 1: P--
Speaker 2: --M-A-N.
Speaker 1: --M-A-N.  Okay.  And Taylor, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was 1905.
Speaker 1: Was she born in Centreville?
Speaker 2: She was born in Mississippi, yeah, Centreville.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I can go back--I can go back to 1820 and probably go back further than that but it gets to be a little washy then.  It's not true facts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, are there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, that's about as--
Speaker 1: --are there stories prior to 1820?  I mean, the stories are good to have, too, 'cause they're clues sometimes to what, what might, might have happened.  So, is there a story about your family prior to 1820?
Speaker 2: There, there are information about them, you know, that they know from where the family was prior to that time, but there's no data as, as--we haven't been able to find any data that lists the names and the dates.  That's pretty washed.
Speaker 1: Well, what, what, what do they say happened?
Speaker 2: Well, they say that there was no records prior to--
Speaker 1: No, I mean, what did they actually say that, that, that was going on that, that there's no record of?
Speaker 2: No, the, the only thing we've been able to find is that when it goes back to the next, they just state that their, their parents were in a certain state, came from a first--certain state, and that's all the information (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did they come from?
Speaker 2: --that's available.  They were mainly from South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's the story in the family that, that they were--
Speaker 2: So, that's as far as--back as we can go, is somewhere in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, were these ancestors in South Carolina slaves?
Speaker 2: I would assume so.  That's what we assume that, yes, they--either that or they were, you know, descendants, the first descendants of slaves, if not slaves.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't--you know, that, that would've been the case in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina in those days.  And so--but, but there's a story that they--well, we know they're in Mississippi in 1820, right?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We know that they were in Mississippi in 1820.
Speaker 1: Okay, by 1820.  Now, are there any stories--
Speaker 2: And I was trying to think, I don't remember any legal data for 1800.  You know, I was trying to--I don't remember seeing it.  We didn't get anything into that, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, now what is--what, what kind of--what did you find out about 1820, about what was going on in 1820?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the year that my--let's see, that would be my great-grandfather [Joseph Chapman] was born, was 1820.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was he born in the same part of Mississippi?
Speaker 2: He was born--yeah, he was born in--no, he was born in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they moved--they moved to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now was, was he a slave in this situation?
Speaker 2: No, not--we don't have any indication he was a slave.  He's listed as a farmer or farm hand or, you know, working on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: That's in the information that's been able to be found.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he was born in 1820--I mean, do you have information, you know, before the Civil War about what he was doing or after the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Well, we just have mainly the census data, so, you know, and that doesn't go into much detail as to, you know--you know, what or where or any history or anything, you know, 'cause they just ask what is the occupation and they'll put farm or this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so--
Speaker 2: You know, just one word and that's--they don't go into any information.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your great-great-grandfather [sic.], born in 1820, he's in the 1820 census?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's back--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's back either the 18--or right after the 1820, but he was in the census, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It might be the 1830, '40 [1840], somewhere out there.  But anyway, I was able to go back and find out that this mother and father was out of South Carolina but there was no other information other than that.
Story_ID: 633752
Speaker 1: Were there any stories on that--on, on this side of the family about the end of slavery and emancipation and all that?
Speaker 2: Well, there was--there was stories about this individual, my great--I guess you'd call it great--was it great-great-grandfather [sic. maternal great-grandfather]?
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Joseph.
Speaker 1: Was, was it Campbell or?  I mean, Chapman, rather.
Speaker 2: His name was Joseph Chapman.
Speaker 1: Chapman, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Chapman.
Speaker 2: Joseph Chapman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, what--
Speaker 2: And also they were saying that what it was is that they had somehow utilized him as a breeder.  One of their relatives was able to relate that story to one of the members of our committee on his story--his- history, that they had categorized him as a breeder and they took him all over the South to breed, so he got to be known as a breeder.  And they in- indicated that they thought that he had bred somewhere on out of over a thousand kids.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is not the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and that--
Speaker 1: --first story like--
Speaker 2: --he had--you know, and also that all of the women of the family was really up against him and also his family, although, you know, they didn't take any steps or anything, but they just were, you know, disconsent [sic.] with the whole situation and also with him.  I don't know why they would blame him 'cause he was only doing what they were forcing him to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he was--so, you could say that he was a s- I don't know whether you wanna call it a slave, you know, but anyway--
Speaker 1: I think so if he's being made--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's--
Speaker 1: --to do--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you could categorize him a slave 'cause he--
Speaker 1: 'Cause he certainly--he lived through--he would--he would've been forty-five years old when the slaves were freed finally.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so he, he would've lived at least half of his productive life doing that.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he, he finally got married and he was much older than his wife and, and they had--what was it, eighteen kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of those was my grandfather [Jacob Chapman].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your great-great-grandmother's [sic. great-grandmother] name, do you know?
Speaker 2: Her name was Laura [Laura Chapman], L-A-U-R-A.  Now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't know her maiden.  We never found out her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so they had eighteen kids and your, your, your great-grandfather is one of those--
Speaker 2: Yeah, family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather had eighteen kids, so he (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Oh, your grandfather?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Both (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, everybody--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I didn't have eighteen, though (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you can see how it spreads out and it gets to be quickly (laughter)--
Speaker 1: A lot of--a lot of relatives, a lot of cousins.
Speaker 2: You better believe it.  I mean, the family reunions are quite large on that side.
Story_ID: 633753
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, are there any, any stories passed down about life on the farm or ghost stories or?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there are some from my grandfather, although he was not a slave or anything, but he passed stories down that he originally was in--I think he was in Centreville, Mississippi, and the [U.S.] military came and took over his land and he had to move to Gloster [Mississippi] 'cause they were--used it for a camp during the World War.  I've forgotten which World War, probably World War II [sic. World War I, WWI], I guess.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But they used it for training and they--and they seized the land, so that was a story he, he's told us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my father [Louis Taylor, Sr.] was one of the--he was a farmer in Mississippi in Centreville, and he's told us stories of how he was one of the small farms that were, I guess you would call the--like the lease farms that you were given a certain area and then you had to--
Speaker 1: Sharecropper?
Speaker 2: Sharecropper or--yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, let's, let's get to him later.  I just wanted--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to get your mother's [Tena Chapman Taylor] side first, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And we get your mother's side down, then we'll go to him and we don't get them mixed up.  So, so this is your mother's side.  So, your, your mother's father had land.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is the land--
Speaker 2: He had land.
Speaker 1: --that the government took over.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had land and he was farming.  He was always farming.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Jacob.
Speaker 1: Okay, Jacob Chapman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's see, he was born in 1863.  I think that--
Speaker 1: So, he was born when the Emancipation Proclamation was written.
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1863.
Speaker 2: 'Cause--okay, 'cause, 'cause I remember his wife was born in 1873.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and that--that's your grandmother, right?  That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would be my grandmother.  That would be--
Speaker 1: And what--what's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Eliza [Eliza Turner Chapman], E-L-I-Z-A.
Speaker 1: So, they would've been born during--they were born during slavery themselves actually and just, you know, two years later the slaves were freed.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now--so, did any of them have any stories about that experience that they shared with you?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Like I was saying, no, none of them--none of that's--you know, and I didn't find out about my great-grandfather [Joseph Chapman] until just recently.  At our last family reunion, somebody had come up with this story, had found it--you know, found it from one of the relatives.  So, every year--we have reunions every two years, so every two years, usually there's new information or someone's come up with additional stories that we try to add.
Speaker 1: Now, this story about being a breeder is one I've heard a couple times before at least, so we know that this is--this happened down south, especially after they cut off the transatlantic slave trade in the 1830s, they would--the only way they could get more slaves--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is to breed them.
Speaker 2: Right, of course.
Speaker 1: They couldn't go get anymore--any fresh ones.  So, so this is something that is not that--is not that unusual, but I, I--you know, I haven't heard that many people talk about it, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 633754
Speaker 1: What did your mother have to say about growing up down there [in Centreville, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother--my mother went to school and she also went--I'm forgetting how far she went, but she was also teaching, so she was a teacher in the South.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean when she was growing up, the--
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean growing up?
Speaker 1: Any stories about growing up, yeah.
Speaker 2: She--I don't remember any stories of her growing up other than farming, you know, working on the farm and how hard it was.  You know, we heard those stories, you know, of the back breaking and how, you know, much time you had to spend out in the field and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, this, this is a different south than what we have now.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.
Speaker 1: So, I just--I just--there's got to be some stories about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about race relations at least and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, I didn't hear too much about race--remember, they were on a farm and they were not close to the town, so it wasn't that they were going into town that much, you see, and so--and from all indications, most of where they were living was mainly black.  It wasn't that they interacted with any, you know, too much in, in that--tho- in that--those areas.
Speaker 1: But you can see where, where it might be a story in here somewhere 'cause if other people look forward to going to town and they try to avoid going to town, then that's a different--
Speaker 2: So, right, right.
Speaker 1: --mentality, you know.
Speaker 2: It must've been something that caused that, you know, but I--one of the things I would imagine would be the, the cost and also, you know, the--'cause I, I do used to hear, you know, my, my--mainly my grandfather [Jacob Chapman] would talk about, you know, how little they were paid for, you know, things that they produced on the farm and, you know, and how expensive things were, and that was back in those days (laughter), you know.  But, but it was very little about race relations 'cause I remember the first time we went south.  I wasn't--I had no idea of race relations, I mean no--you know, my mother and no one else had said anything about race relations, and when we went south, it was me, my brother [Louis Taylor, Jr.], and my sister [Theresa Taylor Doughty], we would--the--only three of us went.  We went together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the first time I encountered anything, you know, that said white only, black only, and you had to sit certain places in the bus, 'cause we didn't know.  We just got on the bus and sit up to the, the first seat, and they said, "No, you can't sit in that."  We moved to the next seat, they said, "You can't sit there."  Nobody's on the bus, we couldn't understand--what is--what are you talking--what's wrong, you know?
Speaker 1: Your parents [Tena Chapman Taylor and Louis Taylor, Sr.] didn't prepare for that?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  We didn't know.  I mean, that was the first encounter and it--and, you know, it was--it was a shocker, you know.  I mean, it was the fir- but, you know, after you--you know, you learn pretty fast.  After a while, you see and then you talk to other kids and they tell you, yes, that's the way it is and so forth and so on.
Story_ID: 633755
Speaker 1: But your mother [Tena Chapman Taylor] didn't have any stories about growing up in terms of what she--did--now, did she talk (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --about what she wanted to--
Speaker 2: 'Cause she--you know, 'cause she taught--where, where she taught was all black, you know.  You know, it was segregated and she taught, you know, the kinder- you know, in the lower grades.
Speaker 1: Well, so, so I, I take it she wanted to be a teacher when she was going to school, right?  Is that what she--
Speaker 2: I, I assume that.  You know, she never said any different, you know, that she--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --had any desires of being anything else.  Now, once we moved to Chicago [Illinois], she never taught again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know whether it was bec- it probably also stemmed from maybe there was a, a higher education requirement or something in that area.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Now, did she go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to some college in the South 'cause I remember her talking about that she did go.  She didn't finish, but she just went through a, a year or so, then she started teaching.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'd have to have a four year degree in Chicago to teach.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be the--yeah, but in the South, you could--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some places you could teach with a high school diploma.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Though that's not always the case 'cause there are some--
Speaker 2: No, but that's--
Speaker 1: --some schools in the cities where people have master's [degree] and Ph.Ds.
Speaker 2: And, and it's strange because my father [Louis Taylor, Sr.] also went to some college in the South and I don't remember him talking about--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --other than he talked about the farm, you know.  The, the, the most things that I heard was about the farm and how hard it was and, and about their situation with the sharecropping and how they had to leave to get out of there, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your father in a second, but--
Speaker 2: Okay, but I was just saying--
Speaker 1: --just--but your--
Speaker 2: --this is both of them--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --together.
Speaker 1: But, your, your, your mother, do you know what school she went to?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't--I don't remember the name.  You're talking about the name of the school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What college it was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 633756
Speaker 1: Well, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Louis, L-O-U-I-S, S, Taylor [Louis Taylor, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And S stands for?
Speaker 2: Samuel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was 19--let's see, she was born in 19--1905--no, no, hers was--hers was 1905.  Is that what I gave you for her?  And his is 1909.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was a little younger than she was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was he born in Centreville [Mississippi], too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the families were in Centreville.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, how far back can you trace your, your father's family?
Speaker 2: Now, his is, is not--don't have much on his and it's strange, you know, 'cause his seems to dwindle out quick, that it, it can't go back that far with his, go back to his mother and father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what was his--
Speaker 2: His--
Speaker 1: --mother's name?
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: What was his mother's name?
Speaker 2: His mother's name was Mary [Mary Spears Taylor].  I don't know her--the maiden name, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mary.
Speaker 1: And she--was she from, from around the same area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was originally.  She was born in--not in that area.  She was born--where is it?  It wasn't Louisiana.  She was born I believe in Maryland.  Somewhere up north she was born.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did he meet her up north and--I mean, or, or in Maryland?
Speaker 2: I would imagine that they met somewhere in the South 'cause they were back and forth from Louisiana to--no, no, not, not, not Louisiana.  They were back--they got--they, they were--they met in Centreville.  Now, she might've--might have been born down in Centreville.  You're, you're talking about that's--let me get it straight now.  That's his mother--we're talking about his mother, right or her mother?
Speaker 1: No, your father's mother, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Father's mother, that was Mary.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  I don't know where, where she was born.  I, I don't remember.  We--'cause we were trying to see if we could find out where she was born.  She was born in 1883 'cause my father's father was born in 1873.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, and, and what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: This is on my father's side, Carey--K--C-A-R-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, Carey Taylor?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so--now, was he a sharecropper, too (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I would assume so, you know, but I--like I was saying, there's not much information we've been able to gather on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, your, your father grew up on a farm I take it?
Speaker 2: Right, right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they, they, they didn't own it?  They, they were leasing a farm for their work basically, right?
Speaker 2: Right or either they were working on their parents' farm or whatever, you know.  That's what most of them did, you know.  They worked with their parents.
Story_ID: 633757
Speaker 1: Now, did your, your dad [Louis Taylor, Sr.] have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he went to some college, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think he and--he and my mother [Tena Chapman Taylor], I think they went to the same college.  He didn't finish either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was, was it some place in--
Speaker 2: --married and they had that small thing with the farm and left.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your father went to college, but he didn't finish either, but--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --but some--was it some place in Mississippi that they went?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, it would be somewhere in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Some place close by where they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would think somewhere in Mississippi.  I don't--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of what--
Speaker 2: What I'll do is see if I can--you know, we haven't been able to find out.  Most of--most of those--them are passed now.  They're gone, so I'll have to--you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I had a similar situation in my family.  My father didn't know where his father went to college and his father went to college somewhere, but he didn't know where.  And it was actually a defunct college 'cause he said he, he knew what city he went to college in, but he didn't know the name of it which was--
Speaker 2: Name of it.
Speaker 1: But, by checking the city on--to find out what black college was there, you know, we were able to find out what it was, though, though the college has been gone--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --you know, closed for a long time.  But--so, there are a lot of little industrial schools and then some things that popped up that no longer exist.
Speaker 2: Right, that, that don't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --exist anymore.
Speaker 1: So, now--okay, so your, your father, now, did he share with you like what his aspiration was, what he wanted to be?
Speaker 2: A electrician.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: And, and he did work in that area, so, he--

Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about--well, your parents more than likely met in Centreville [Mississippi] 'cause they were already there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they--I'm sure they met there and, and maybe at the school, too, you know, since they were both there and probably close, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Is there a--is there a story about how they, they became, became a couple, how they got together?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I don't remember anything on that level other than I know they got married and then they were sharecroppers and then the left there and went to Little Rock [Arkansas] 'cause--and then from Little Rock went to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, there's a story here I know 'cause we--you, you been wanting to tell it and here (laughter)--I think, so what, what, what happened?  Now, she's [Tena Chapman Taylor] teaching school, right, and he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he's [Louis Taylor, Sr.] farming.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what happened that they--that they left?
Speaker 2: There's--something happened.  There was some conflict.  You know, I, I sort of deduced that there was some conflict that came up between he and the--whoever he was, you know, sharecropping for--
Speaker 1: The white guy that owned it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) or either he--or either there was some conflict--some type of conflict occurred, may--and felt that they had to leave, and they just--and the quicker the better, so they left and went to Little Rock 'cause I had a--I have a uncle in Little Rock and they went and stayed there for a, a while, a short while, and then went on to Chicago.  I have an aunt--let's see, who was--it was his aunt, his aunt was in Chicago, and we went and lived with his aunt over on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, did your, your father come from a large family?
Speaker 2: No.  There was only--there was only he and three other brothers [Willie N. Taylor, Norwood Taylor and Jake Taylor] and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, whereas your mother had like eighteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in her family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had the large family.
Story_ID: 633759
Speaker 1: At any rate, your--so, your parents [Tena Chapman Taylor and Louis Taylor, Sr.] like left because of some conflict and they, they went to Little Rock [Arkansas] and then moved on to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, about what year--what year did they get married?  How, how long had they been married when they moved?
Speaker 2: Let's see 'cause I remember leaving there and, and them talking about it.  I was probably about three, so that would've been about 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, 1935.  So, by 1936, they're in Chicago, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably about 1936, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Probably in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-six [1936], okay.  So, now when you think about your parents' talents and their dispositions, their personalities, the way they walked and talked, the way they looked, who, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father.
Speaker 1: Okay, why?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my father was an engineer and I'm an engineer.  He was also inclined in music and I was inclined in music.  And he had an interest, you know, in community and also in others that he could help and I have pretty much the same interests, so I see that I am just walking in his footsteps (laughter), see.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what, what instrument did your father play?
Speaker 2: Well, he--see, I played the piano.  He, he didn't play an instrument.  He, he could play an instrument 'cause he could play the piano, he didn't play that much, but he, he sung.  He was a singer and he was a member of a--back then, they used to have quartets.  He was a member of a quartet called the caress--what was it called?  The Progressive Moaners.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they, they were out of a church in Chicago.  I think it was--was it Pil- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Progressive Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Progressive.  Yeah, Progressive--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Baptist Church, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I heard of Progressive Baptist Church.  So, they were the Progressive Moaners.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, okay.  Now, did he--did he make any records or anything?
Speaker 2: No, you know, back in those days (laughter), I don't know if they had the chance to--
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know sometimes they got 'cause remember those were the old 78s [78 rpm record] back then (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, and even now, there's--some of the church groups make a record and they're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --really--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --they're really good, you know.
Speaker 2: But no, no--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that they made any records.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Did he travel to other--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, they traveled.
Speaker 1: --churches?
Speaker 2: And they, they had a--an automobile with their name on the side.  You know how they, they used to have a--you know, and they would travel to different places and different cities, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well there's a professional aspect to this.  I just want to make sure I--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, we, we hit on it.  So, he wasn't just, just singing and, you know, nobody knew who he was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But he was with a group that people knew and--
Speaker 2: No, he was--a group and they--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they were extensive, you know.
Story_ID: 633760
Speaker 1: And also, he [Taylor's father, Louis Taylor, Sr.], he liked to do acting and performing, you know, 'cause he was--back in those days, he used to do a lot with the radio and different avenues of--he used to--he used to come on late at night and 'I Love a Mystery,' I think that was the name of the program, where he would play different roles.  'Cause I remember it was--it would be so late that we wouldn't get a chance to listen to it 'cause we'd have to go to bed, you see, so (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, he's a--'I Love a Mystery,' huh?
Speaker 1: I think that was the name of it.
Speaker 2: And on, on the radio (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, I remember something--it was something about a mystery that, you know, they would be doing.
Speaker 2: Now, was this a integrated effort on the radio or--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: It was a local program there in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: You, you remember the station [WBBM Radio, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: No.  No.
Speaker 2: I just--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I thought I'd ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause I never--
Speaker 2: I had to ask.
Speaker 1: You know, that was back when they had the old radios, remember (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I had to ask--
Speaker 1: And usually, you know, you, you wasn't allowed to touch those radios, you know, unless (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a parent was doing--
Speaker 2: --culture of that, but really, that's how it--that's how it was then?  You couldn't really--the kids weren't allowed to touch the radio?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  That--you didn't have access to electronics like the kids of today, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 633761
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have and--
Speaker 2: I have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) where, where do you fit in?
Speaker 2: I have one brother and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you name the oldest and--
Speaker 2: The oldest is my sister who is Theresa [Theresa Taylor Doughty] and her last name is Doughty, she's married.  And my brother, his--he's a junior.  His name was Louis Taylor, Jr.  So those are the only siblings I have.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're in the middle?
Speaker 2: I was the oldest.
Speaker 1: You're the oldest?  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the first one.
Speaker 1: All right, you're the first one.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was born in '32 [1932] and my sister was born in '37 [1937] and my brother was born in '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: Now, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The earliest childhood memory I remember was in Little Rock [Arkansas] and the re- the reason I remember that is, is something occurred in Little Rock that stuck with me and--now, why, I have no idea.  But I remember this guy went down and looked like he was in a sewer.  You know, he took the top off the sewer and went down in there.  It looked like he put the top back on and then a machine rode over him.  And I couldn't understand why would he go down in that sewer and let this machine roll over him.  Of course, I figured out later that they were doing some type of work down there and the machine had to go over it and probably let something down or do something, you know, to aid the person down in there, but I just couldn't understand going (laughter) down in that hole and, and letting that machine come over you, you know?
Speaker 1: Now, these are the first recollections of an engineer (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, whatever, you know, but that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, it sounds like--yeah, it sounds like an appropriate recollection from an--
Speaker 2: But I never forgot that.  I never forgot that.
Story_ID: 633762
Speaker 1: Where did you live in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: When we first got there, we lived on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], then we moved to South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  We was over on 34th Street.  And then we left there and went on 46 [Street] and Evans [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, would you say that you grew up at 46 and Evans (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's where we grew up, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 46th and Evans.
Speaker 1: And can you describe like your neighborhood and what was going on there?  And, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that area was a--you know, a--an area where everybody knew everyone, you know, and everybody looked out for everyone that--if you did something down the street, then that individual or that parent or that adult would tell you about it and also tell your parents, and then your parents would also let you know about it.  So, it was--it was something that you couldn't do any wrong and get--expect to get away with it.  So, you knew that (laughter), you know, but you had to at least when you get in the area, you know, the--at least try to know that you've gotta pretty much walk the line, you know, and that everybody's looking.  The other thing I remember is that all of the neighbors, the kids, everybody was like a family that if they saw that you need something, they would try to help you.  If one family had a problem, then everybody would try to participate in.  And we used to also sometimes have block--I, I guess you would call them block parties where we would close off the street and families would bring out food and whatever and whatever, and the kids would play out in the street and so forth and so on.  So, it was very enjoyable and, and it was something that as I--as I recall, that we grew up and, and it's lasted a lifetime.  I mean, just like we were talking about [HistoryMaker] Harold Pates and, and all of them that, that there was many up and down the block and there's many that we still communicate and interact with today that's from that block.
Speaker 1: Now, you lived in a--what, what size building did you live in?
Speaker 2: I lived in a six flat, a six flat building.  Right in the middle of the block there was a six flat building.
Speaker 1: And, and Dr. Harold Pates, who we interviewed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he lived in the building.
Speaker 1: He, he lived in the same building, yeah.
Speaker 2: He lived in the same building.  And then also--I don't remember the others that lived in--but, there was four other apartments in that building, so it was six apartments in that building.  And everybody, you know, knew everyone.  And I remember when Pates was--he, he was playing the horn.  He was--you know, he was then taking horn lessons and I was doing piano.  I don't think Patricia [Patricia Pates Eaton] was doing anything then.  Patricia first off started out with the piano, then she finally went to voice.  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Harold Pates' sister.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She's a opera singer.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: A classical singer.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Well, she started out with the piano.  And I don't remember what Henry [Harold Pates' brother, Henry Pates]--Henry started out with something--back in those days, you know, you all--everybody took some type of (laughter) music, you know what I mean?  I mean, not that you planned on, you know, pursuing it as a career, but you just was expected to do something in music.  So, everybody up and down the block did something in music, you know, so--or voice or acting or something, but in the arts.
Story_ID: 633763
Speaker 1: And also what happened is, the, the way I got started in it is my father [Louis Taylor, Sr.] was working at the Chicago Musical College [Chicago College of Performing Arts], which was located in Chicago [Illinois].  That's since--that's the--demised now.  There's--it's--no longer exists.  But he was the maintenance engineer there, that he took care of all of the maintenance and electrical, and you name it, then he took care of it.  And so he got one of the instructors to take me as a student and so that's where I started to pursue the piano was there.  And, and every time I'd go to take my lessons, all of a sudden he would just show up, you know (laughter).  I knew when I went down there to take my lesson that all of a sudden, here he come walking in the door, you know, or either he would meet me out there as I'm walking in (laughter).  And, you know, and I used to wonder--well, now, I say--well, he must be waiting for me or something, you know (laughter).  But, now that I understand time, you know, I know he just know the time and he just getting there at that time, you know.  But, anyway--
Speaker 2: Did--
Speaker 1: And my sister [Theresa Taylor Doughty], she took--she took piano and my brother [Louis Taylor, Jr.], he took bass fiddle.  He took the bass.  He had the bass.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you have a musical hero in those days, somebody you wanted to emulate?
Speaker 1: No, the piano, no, not really.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: 'Cause, see--
Speaker 2: Not Duke Ellington or Count Basie or--
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of them--
Speaker 2: --Art Taylor or?
Speaker 1: You know, but the, the, the thing of it is is when I first started--and, and all of us when we first started, you know, we were saying, you know, why are we playing this?  You know, 'cause, you know, you gotta play the classics, you know, and you gotta practice the classics.  You know, you never get to this other that you hear (laughter), you know, so I, I didn't, you know, because--I was saying, well, why don't they teach us, you know, some of this and they, they said, no, you learn the classics, then you'll get that later on in life, you know.
Speaker 2: You look like you'd be a good piano player.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: You have very long fingers.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know if anybody watching this can see them when you move them around, but you have long fingers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I had to make a choice, you know, 'cause I had to either choose engineering or music.  So, I ended up choosing engineering.
Speaker 2: So, you had to make a choice?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, back then, usually when you went into college, you know, you take all these battery of tests, you know, and they, they came up and said that, you know, "You're equal in engineering and music," and, and they--counselor suggested, you know, choose which--you know, and pursue that rather than trying to do both, you know, so--and the counselor also was saying, "You're, you're better--easier to get a job if you go (laughter) into engineering than going over here with the piano," you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, we're getting way ahead of ourselves and I want to--
Speaker 1: Okay, but anyway (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) take you back to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --school.  Now, you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 633764
Speaker 1: You started at--what was that Forrestville [Forrestville Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Forrestville, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Forrestville--I--that--I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess--it's--that's still there, isn't it?  Or I think it's still there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is still there and I, I hear so many stories about Forrestville.  It's like 47th [Street] and--what is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's 43rd [Street]--
Speaker 1: 43rd, okay.
Speaker 2: 44th.  It was right on 44th Street--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at--and, you know, between Forrestville [Avenue] and--what is it, Champlain [Avenue] or whatever, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what, what, what was Forrestville like?
Speaker 2: It was a grammar school.  You know, it was regular grammar school as far as I could tell, you know, nothing great or strange about it, you know.  I enjoyed it.  You know, it was a--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I always had a favorite subject of math.  You know, I was--I was always good in math and that was--my favorite subject was always math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess math and music would be--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, math and music.  But, usually, you know, you didn't--you, you didn't have much music then in school.  I don't know what they have now, but then, you didn't have--I don't remember any playing the piano in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they only played like--now, did you play the piano in church [Grant Memorial A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I would--you know, every so often what would happen is they would have church concerts or musicals and they would ask everybody that can play or something to, you know, get on a pr- I would get on a program and play a piece, you know, whatever, you know, 'cause all of us would, you know, play something, do something, you know.  But, other than that, there was--you know, that was about the only exposure.  And, of course, you know, the, the teacher have her concert once a year that she have, you know, everybody, all of her students to play.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you--did--were there any special teachers at Forrestville?
Speaker 2: I remember one teacher of Mrs. Thompson [ph.] and mainly because that was her field, was math, you see, so we sort of connected, you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was like in the upper grades.  That was, you know, not the lower, but the upper where I was getting close to graduating.  It was like either sixth, seventh, somewhere up there, sixth, seventh, eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you enjoy sports and that sort of thing when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed basketball, you know, 'cause we used to play--that was one of the things we used to play out there on the street.  You know, we used to put a net up there on the light pole 'cause we didn't have any, you know, basketball courts, really.  So, we would get a basket and tie it up on the light pole and that's how we would play basketball out in the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, at school you play some, but you--you know, it's not like you can play almost every day out there on the street, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at Forrestville, was--I take it Forrestville was pretty much all black, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was all black.
Speaker 1: Except for the teachers, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  The teachers were integrated, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the ratio you think of the teachers to the--
Speaker 2: I would say it was probably--it was probably about 60/40, 60 bla- 60 percent black.
Speaker 1: And 40 percent white?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 633765
Speaker 1: You were ten years old when World War II [WWII] started.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have any remembrances of those days at school [Forrestville Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and what it was--'cause you grew up during a unique time, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --no, I, I remember, you know, the war and also the rationing.  I guess that was the main--that's the major thing I remember was the rationing of food and the rationing of goods and so forth that that--I do remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my father [Louis Taylor, Sr.] didn't go and, and it was--it was some reason--I don't--I don't remember the exact reason he didn't go.  It was some reason.  I don't know whether it was where he worked or what he was doing, but some reason 'cause I think they were drafting at that time for World War II.
Speaker 1: I think they were drafting younger men.  I, I don't know where, where the cutoff was, but your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --your father would've been--
Speaker 2: Probably, probably was younger, right.
Speaker 1: He'd have been about almost forty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was up there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, I just--I don't know what the story is, but--so, so, he, he didn't serve, but did he have to do anything for the government during the war or anything?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Did he have--
Speaker 2: Other than I'd hear him talking about the--you know, the problems, you know, with the--getting items and food and things, you know, that they had rationed.
Speaker 1: So, they, they, they--I read they rationed stuff like margarine.  You could only have--
Speaker 2: Yeah, margarine--
Speaker 1: Shoes, so many shoes.
Speaker 2: Sugar.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Name it.  Coat--you know, and especially wool and stuff, you know, that they needed for uniforms and things, so--and metal, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they--yeah, people collected metal, right, for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  They would go around and collect metal for the--you know, for the war effort, metal and--they used to collect other things, cans and do it for the war effort or something.  I remem- I do remember something about they would try to get the kids involved with, you know, collecting and turning them in.
Story_ID: 633766
Speaker 1: Now, you went to high school at Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Dunbar, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, how were your grades in grade school [Forrestville Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Were you considered a good student?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was--I was, you know, up there in the honor--usually the honor society, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I had no problems with, with grades.  And then I went to Dunbar 'cause--I, I don't remember why I went to Dunbar 'cause I could've gone to either Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] or DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], and I don't remember why.  But, anyway, I chose and went to Dunbar.  And at that time, they were talking about that supposedly they was going to build a new school, and I went four years and they hadn't built that school yet, and they were telling us when we first went in there, well, well, you'll be the first ones into the new school, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: It didn't, didn't happen that way.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).  I don't know how many years later they finally built the school.
Speaker 1: Now, Dunbar, I take it like DuSable and--was created as a--
Speaker 2: And Phillips was all--
Speaker 1: Yeah, was created as a black school.
Speaker 2: Right, it was.  It was all black, that's right.
Speaker 1: And named after the great Paul Laurence Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, so it was a vocational high school, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And so is that--were you studying like drafting or something in preparation--
Speaker 2: Well, I was studying what they call radio or electron- they called it radio at that time.  They just called it radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any special teachers at Dunbar that you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember Hambrite [ph.].  He was the shop teacher and also Simmons [ph.] was the, the math teacher, was--I remember Simmons 'cause Simmons used to always tease me and call me the Head 'cause I liked to do math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a math teacher, you know, and so he appreciated anyone that was interested in math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, were you a--were you a popular student in high school?  Were you the kind of guy that would be in a lot of clubs and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in a number of clubs, you know, and I wasn't in sports.  I wasn't in sports, but I was in a number of clubs and organizations and things, you know, that--and I knew a lot of the guys that were in sports, you know, into sports, but I wasn't in sports.
Speaker 1: Well--what, what clubs were you in?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the chess and checker club and I was in the Honor Society [National Honor Society].  I was in--I don't remember--we, we had some club that did all of the communications and radios and all of that stuff, so I was in that club and, and probably a couple of other clubs.  I don't remember all of the names of it, but it was enough to keep busy.
Story_ID: 633767
Speaker 1: Then, you know, the church activities and I was in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] at that time and, and other--
Speaker 2: Was that out of the church, the Boy Scouts?
Speaker 1: It was at another church.  There was no Boy Scout activities at the church 'cause it--the church--at that time, the church was at--see, there was a church right there on the--in that block, in the 4600 block of Evans [Avenue].  There was a church right there on the corner and that's the church we all went to.  And then that church moved over to 40th [Street] and Drexel [Avenue].  So--
Speaker 2: What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Grant Memorial AM- A.M.E. Church [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. So, you didn't--you didn't go to the same church [Progressive Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] as your father [Louis Taylor, Sr.]?
Speaker 1: No, no, and probably because of the proximity, you know, 'cause it's just--you just walk right down there, you know, and you're there.  And all of the kids and everybody in the neighborhood, that's where they went, you know, just right down into that church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you sort of grew up in that church, you know, and that was the church that we all went to.  And I used to sing in the choir.  We all sing in the young people's choir and we had clubs in the church, so we were in clubs in the church and things of that nature.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you sound like you're pretty busy.  You're a Boy Scout, too, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, now did you have to work when you were in school [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Well, what I--what I was doing is I was delivering papers.  I would get up early in the morning and go down to Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and I would deliver papers at--in--at Hyde Park.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had been working since I was twelve.  I--and, and I've worked every--you know, since twelve.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So.
Story_ID: 633768
Speaker 1: So you're in the National Honor Society and, so when it came time for--well, well, tell me this before I, I ask you about graduation.  When would you--when did you first hear about what an engineer really was?
Speaker 2: Probably back in, in grammar school [Forrestville Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], I had some--and also my father [Louis Taylor, Sr.] used to talk about it a lot, too, 'cause that was--that's what he was into and he loved doing, so he would talk about it, you know.  And I remember going down to--one time, I went down--I was down and I took music lessons and after music lesson, he took me and took me around to some places, you know, and I was looking at some of the things and these instruments and all these boxes and electrical and all that stuff and I was saying, boy, this is really something, you know (laughter).  So, at least that--I remember that.  I don't remember--I don't remember--you know, I remember being exposed to, you know, a lot of different things 'cause I had a lot of interests and I used to plan--like I would find old radios and I would bring them home and work on them, you know, and fix them and get them to working and things like that, you know.  And then after a while, people started bringing them to me, you know, to fix (laughter) for them.  You know, after a while I had--I had all these radios.  My, my mother [Tena Chapman Taylor] told me, "You're gonna have to get that stuff (laughter) out of here," you know.  But, anyway, so that--you know, that sort of like lead into it 'cause I, I started doing that when I was in grammar school, started working with radios and tubes and stuff, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you remember--now--let's see.  Gee whiz, it wasn't until you were twenty then that TV really started coming out or about, about eighteen--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Eighteen?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Somewhere up there the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --TV started coming out 'cause that was still, you know, just the radio and, and just, you know, listening to the, the wireless as they used to call it, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, did they have the tube display in, in the drug stores and grocery stores where you could bring your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  They had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your, your tubes?
Speaker 2: They had--they had the testers there that you could bring your tubes and test them.
Speaker 1: That's right, it's called U Test Them [sic. U Test M].
Speaker 2: Right, right.  That's--
Speaker 1: Capital U.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: U Test Them.
Speaker 2: U Test Them, right.  And you could test them.  And some stores even had where you could buy the tubes right there, of course, you know, after you test it and it tests bad, then you can just buy the tube and take it back and replace it and, you know--and off you go.  So, you know, it was quite interesting with the--and, you know, then they got rid of the tubes and went to the transistors, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that--those were--that's--those days were over.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter).
Speaker 1: But--okay, so, when you were a senior in high school, you're, you're at Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], now did you--did you think--did you ever at Dunbar think I, I wish I'd have gone to DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] or--you know or, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh, because I enjoyed--the, the difference was I enjoyed the shop 'cause they had more--you know, the electrical shop was more of a hands on working, you know, with electronic instruments and things.  You know, 'cause they had testers and things there, you know, for the students.  So, they--it was--you know, and I enjoyed that.  And they had models that you could make and try and try different things and wouldn't have gotten that at the other schools.
Story_ID: 633769
Speaker 1: Now, were, were there any special teachers at Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] that really--
Speaker 2: Well, I said Mr. Hambrite [ph.], remember I mentioned that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, Mr. Ham- that's right.  That's right.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And also, there was one, Mr. Renfro [ph.].  Those were the two I remember, and a Mr. Scott [ph.].  Mr. Scott was, was an all around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so, did you have counseling about college when, when you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had counseling.  And, and what happened is before graduation, I was recruited to work at Spiegel [Spiegel Inc.].  So, I, I left school early and went on staff at Spiegel in their testing department.  'Cause at that time, my father [Louis Taylor, Sr.] had passed 'cause he passed in '43 [1943], and my mother [Tena Chapman Taylor] was not doing well, and so I felt, you know, that--you know, and, and I didn't, didn't have the funds to continue to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, just went on and went to work.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, Spiegel, your, your title was, again?  You were the--
Speaker 2: Tester.
Speaker 1: Tester?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Do the testing of radios and then they had televisions then, so it was testing televisions, too, radios and televisions.  And that's--
Speaker 1: See if they really worked the way they were supposed to and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were supposed to work--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and also if there was some minor repair or maintenance that had to be done to them, you know, before they are shipped off to the customer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also, we would receive if the customer got it and it didn't work or they had problems, then they would ship it back and we had to repair them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--so, you were there like a couple years or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to think what year was--let's see, that was fifty--that was--
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: --in the 50s [1950s], yeah, 'cause--
Speaker 1: You, you graduated from high school in 1950.
Speaker 2: Right, I--high school in 1950--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --but I went there probably--'cause I was supposed to graduate in--I guess, it was June of 1950.  I must've went there sometime like May or--April or May, somewhere like that time.
Story_ID: 633770
Speaker 1: So, you're working for Spiegel [Spiegel Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --by then?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked for Spiegel.  Then, then--I forgot what--something happened and, and they stopped.  They start--they--I think they disband that department or something changed.  The--I think the technology changed.  Something changed as I remember.  Something changed and they started to downgrade and disband that department.  And so I ended up--I--eventually, I just left Spiegel's and went and worked at a couple other places 'til finally I ended up at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1952?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this would probably be--went to--yeah, the--I, I was at the--so, I was at Spiegel's probably a couple years I would think.  I'm just guessing, a couple of years.  And then after I left Spiegel, I'm trying to think--I remember it was two other places I went to and I didn't like those places and I left.  One was a tube place that used to make the television.  Remember they used to have the--like that tube there?
Speaker 1: A big picture tube.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I used to--I worked at a place that manufactures those tubes.
Speaker 1: Now, was that for Zenith [Zenith Radio Corporation; Zenith Electronics LLC]?  I know they were in Chicago [Illinois], but--
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: --but, but--
Speaker 2: That was not Zenith.  I forget the name of that company.
Speaker 1: Motorola [Motorola, Inc.] or?
Speaker 2: But what they would--what they would do, that's all they made was the tubes.  They didn't make anything else.  But, see, at that time, Zenith and all the others, they weren't doing the tubes.  They would build the television but not the tubes themselves.
Speaker 1: So, if you were proud that you got a picture tube that's supposed to be--you got--you bought a--say, you bought a Magnavox--
Speaker 2: Zenith or--yeah.
Speaker 1: --and say now I have a Magnavox, with the Magnavox picture tube and all that stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I was getting the same tube as somebody else got--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I didn't know it, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and the thing of it is, you know, usually what happens is if, if, if it's--don't work, then they would send it back to us at the factory and we would rebuild it.  You know, they, they--you can rebuild that tube 'cause you just open it up and clean all of that facing and everything off of it, wash the tube out and rebuild it and ship it back again (laughter).  So, we used to do all the tubes, you know, and they come back.  As long as you didn't break the face.  You know, if you break the face, then it's no good, but long as it wasn't broken, then we could open it up and clean it, you know, and, and put a new face on it and test it and re- put a new screen and projector on it, and it's ready to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I worked there for a while.  Then I--then I do remember that I tried--I don't know why I tried working at a bakery.  You know, I don't know why I went there.  I, I don't know to this day why I went to that bakery 'cause I didn't stay there hardly any time, you know, but I just wanted to try it or somebody told me something and I'll say, well I'll try it, you know.  I was--
Speaker 1: Was this a small bakery or like a big thing like Sunshine [Sunshine Biscuits Company; Kellogg Company] or--
Speaker 2: No, this was a small bakery.  I forgot the name of this ba- and they did--they mainly did cookies, cookies and crackers.  And, and what I was doing was mainly maintaining the machines, you see, so it sound like it was like an engineering thing, you see?  But after I got there, I found out, I was just running the machines (laughter) 'cause the person didn't show up, you know, for this machine, so I had to go over there and run the machine, you see?  Not only fix it, but run it, you see (laughter)?  So after a while I said, no, this is not for me and it was hot in there, too, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 633771
Speaker 1: And after that, I went into service.  I think I went--yeah, I went to the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] and then went into service.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I went to service at--from the post office.
Speaker 2: So you went to the post office in '52 [1952], right?  And--
Speaker 1: I went in the service in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were there a couple years at the post office.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now, you joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Tell us about that.
Speaker 1: I wasn't joining it, I was drafted.
Speaker 2: You were assigned to it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, I was drafted.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  Well, tell us about the--what is the Signal Corps anyway?
Speaker 1: Communications.  You know, it's, it's the communications area of the military.  Each branch has its own communications division, and what we did is, I was with the, what we call the microwave division.  You see these towers out there with the round microwave cones or you don't know their microwave, but that's what they are, microwave.  I was trained and used to work on those for the Army.  We would go out in different areas and set up towers and I also set up the equipment and test the equipment, make sure it's operating.  And if the--if something happens, then we'd have to come in and repair it to get it back into operation.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So, so you were in the [U.S.] Army.  Now, now did you leave the United States?
Speaker 1: No, unh-uh.  No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I went to school at Fort Monmouth [Monmouth County, New Jersey] and the school was so long that when I got out of school, they were saying I didn't have enough time to go overseas unless I wanted to extend the time, and I didn't want to extend the time just to go overseas.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you were in the Army from '54 [1954] to--
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], okay.
Story_ID: 633772
Speaker 1: Now, what, what did you do when you got out [of the U.S. Army Signal Corps]?
Speaker 2: I got out, I, I worked for--a short while for--who was that?  For the telephone company in Chicago [Illinois], Bell Telephone?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Illinois Bell [Illinois Bell Telephone Company]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked in the--in the office, and that didn't work out after I got in and saw what that was--what was involved with that.  Then, I went back to the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  'Cause, see, I had left the position at the post office and I had a certain amount of time that I could go back, so since that didn't seem to work out, then I just went on back to the post office.  Then from there, I went to junior college.
Speaker 1: This is in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was at--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Jones--was it--what was it?  I think it was Jones Junior College [sic.].
Speaker 1: Jones Commercial [Jones Commercial High School; Jones College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's no longer exists now.  I think it's gone now.
Speaker 1: There's a Wilson--there's Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois]--let's see, junior college--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, maybe, maybe--
Speaker 1: Jones Commercial is a high school.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, it was Wilson.  That's what it was, Wilson.
Speaker 1: Wilson Junior College?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wilson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Junior College.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause Wilson and Chicago State [Chicago State University] was together, right, at that time?  Chicago Teachers College [Chicago, Illinois] was--that's what it was called at that time.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So, it was Wilson Junior College.  I went to Wilson Junior College--
Speaker 1: So, this is--
Speaker 2: --for two years.
Speaker 1: -nineteen fifty-seven [1957]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '57 [1957].  Yeah, '57 [1957] I went there and I stayed there for two years.  I didn't graduate.  I just took all the basics and then I went to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 633773
Speaker 1: Now, in 1957, you met your wife [HistoryMaker Ollie Taylor], too, so--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, she had her chance to tell the story of how this happened, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --now, this is your, your chance to tell--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My chance to see whether they coincide.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they match up, right.  So, so--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I met her in New York [New York] when, when I was in the [U.S. military] service.  I was in the service with her cousin.  We were in--stationed at Fort Devens together.  That was in Massachusetts.  And sometimes I would go into New York with him and he would invite me to--over a stay 'cause we would usually go in for a weekend.  We would go in like either Friday or Saturday and then come back Sunday.  And I met her while I was there with him.  They were cousins.  They were cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She said things really happened kind of quick.  So, you all were married within, within about six months, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, let's see.  When--I met her that--some time that--in '56 [1956] and we got married in '57 [1957].  So, I don't--you know, I mean, it was June of '57 [1957], so, so it was--I guess you can call that quick, you know.  I don't know (laughter) whether you call it quick, you know.
Speaker 1: She said, said you all went to see [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Price at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].  Now, do, do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I remember the Apollo.  I don't remember who was there.  You say it was Lloyd Price, huh?  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's what she said, yeah, Lloyd Price.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the Apollo but I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was playing there.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, and she said that you, you all got married in that December--that December right before the--
Speaker 2: No, we got married in June.
Speaker 1: In June?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, that sounds--
Speaker 2: In June of the next--
Speaker 1: --maybe I've got that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, either my memory's wrong or she's got it wrong too--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got married--
Speaker 1: In June of, of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in June of, of--
Speaker 1: --fifty--
Speaker 2: --fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: --seven [1957], okay.  All right.  June, 1957, all right.
Story_ID: 633774
Speaker 1: So, you're going to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] then, right?  You're working on--
Speaker 2: Let's see, fifty--
Speaker 1: You, you had started--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was probably going--either I was going or I had just finished with Wilson [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  I'm not sure whether I was in IIT at that time or I had just finished with Wilson.
Speaker 1: Now, we interviewed a material scientist out at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] named [HistoryMaker] Robert Bragg who was at IIT, and I, I--
Speaker 2: Bragg?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Do, do you remember him at all?  'Cause he probably--
Speaker 2: The name sounds familiar but I don't remember him.  Bragg?
Speaker 1: He's older than you.  I mean, he would've been--
Speaker 2: Been there at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he was--
Speaker 2: Black guy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he was working on his Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And he went all the way--he, he did--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause, you know, you meet a lot of them.  You know, you don't remember them 'cause it's been so long (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  I just thought that--
Speaker 2: But the name sounds familiar, Bragg, Bragg, sounds familiar.
Speaker 1: Light skinned man.  He's short, kind of stocky like, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause we used to--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Especially 'cause it wasn't--at that time, it wasn't that many black at IIT so, you know, the--
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a--an advisor or, or a--was there any special teacher there that was like a mentor to you?
Speaker 2: There was--there was a woman, a professor.  I don't remember her name, but she was in the engineering department.  She used to act as a--an advisor, you know, 'cause I would go and talk to her.  See, one of the things that happened--
Speaker 1: Now, that wasn't--let me ask a name, now.  I may be wrong, but there was a Jean Clark Dan that somebody mentioned last week at IIT and--
Speaker 2: Jean Clark Dan.
Speaker 1: She was one of the first women over there I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Jean Clark Dan--
Speaker 2: Was this the, the, the--she was not black.  I mean--
Speaker 1: No, white woman.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I don't remember that name, the Dan.  That--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --doesn't ring a bell.
Speaker 1: It might not be the same one.
Speaker 2: Now one thing that happened when I went over to IIT 'cause I went over to IIT, that was in--I'm trying to think.  That was in '57 [1957].  No, it would be--it would be--I must've went over to IIT in '58 [1958] 'cause I came out in '57 [1957]--'56 [1956].  I came out in '56 [1956] and then '57 [1957] I think I started at Wilson and I went there for two years.  So, it must've been '59 [1959] when I went to IIT.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went there--it was either '59 [1959] or '60 [1960].  I'd have to look that--but, anyway, I was--at that time, I was still working at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] and I left there and started working at the research institute, IIT Research Institute [Chicago, Illinois].  I started working over there and I switched to nights at IIT.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would--you would go to school during the day and then--oh, well, you, you worked during the day at, at IIT, then, then go to school at night.
Speaker 2: Right.  Before, I was going to IIT during the day and I was working at the post office at night.  But I was trying to think of the years 'cause, 'cause I didn't come out of IIT until 1967 and that's what took so long 'cause I switched--I stopped--that's right.  'Cause when I first went to IIT Research Institute, I had to go out into the South Pacific 'cause we were--they were doing some testing out there and they needed people to go out there.  So, I had to stop school and go out there, and I was out there for a year.  So, there was a year that I didn't go to school at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was in '62 [1962].  I know what year that was 'cause that was when they were doing the high altitude test out in the Pacific and that was 1962.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was there from '62 [1962] to '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 633775
Speaker 1: Then, in '68 [1968], I left and went to Sonicraft [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], okay.  Now, it's--
Speaker 1: Now, I had been at Soni- Sonicraft before then 'cause we had worked in J.T.'s basement even before that--we--I think we had started--it was 1966 when we first started, somewhere like that 'cause we worked--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now who--
Speaker 1: --part time in the basement--
Speaker 2: Who is--
Speaker 1: --on the weekends.
Speaker 2: Can you describe for us, like, who is J.T. Jones and--Jerry T. Jones and, and what is Sonicraft?
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Sonicraft is a communications equipment manufacturer that is involved with communications, command, and control systems that we were capable of designing, developing, testing, manufacturing, and field support, and our major customer was the government.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, this is 1966 when you all start--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1966 we started in J.T.'s basement.  We all worked together at IIT [IIT Research Institute, Chicago, Illinois].  J.T. was at IIT--the research institute.  J.T. was there, I was there, there was a guy named Carl Groom [ph.], there was a guy named John Anderson [ph.], another guy named Chris Preston [ph.].  We all worked at IIT.  There was five of us.  And then we had another friend who was a, a lawyer who was Garland Watt, and the six of us formed Sonicraft.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, was--now, this is a all-black group, right?
Speaker 1: Except one white.
Speaker 2: One guy?  One--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --white guy, okay.
Speaker 1: That was Carl Groom.
Story_ID: 633776
Speaker 1: Now, did you take advantage of some political situation where there was money available for--
Speaker 2: Well, what we found (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) black contractors?
Speaker 2: --is that at IIT, they couldn't find anyone easily, let me put it that way.  If you beat the bushes enough, you can find them.  But, they couldn't find any companies that would be capable of taking an idea and developing it and also going through the testing and so forth, all of the rigamamores [sic.] of getting it back to what was needed.  And so we looked at that and we were saying well, you know, that's a niche, you know, that no one has been able to fulfill.  So, we started in his basement and we were doing work mainly for ourselves at IIT Research Institute [Chicago, Illinois], you see.  So, that's how we started out.  We were doing work for IIT Research Institute.  Then, we started doing work for University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and, and also at some of the other labs that were around and, and different government labs that we started doing work for these individuals 'til we built the business up.  Then, we start each one, breaking away and going into it full-time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is '66 [1966].  This is the Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] administration.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they--now, I know what, what enabled you all to get going was a big government contract at a certain point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at a certain point.  But, see, when we first started out, we, we were doing small contracts.  We were doing, you know, like I was saying for University of Chicago and we did it for I remember Bell Labs [AT&T Bell Laboratories, Inc.; Nokia Bell Labs], we did some for them and we did some for some of the other labs around in the area, Argonne [Argonne National Laboratory].  We did a lot of work for Argonne, and, and IIT Research Institute.  You know, we did a lot of work for them, you know, 'cause we knew everybody over there at the research institute.
Story_ID: 633777
Speaker 1: And then we started going and pursuing government contracts.  We started with the [U.S.] Navy 'cause the Navy was, was up at Great Lakes [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois], and that's where the--all of their buying was coming out of Great Lakes.  So, we started with the Navy and we started doing contracts for the Navy, and that's how we got into the--mainly into government contracts--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was through the Navy.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And also through SBA [Small Business Administration].  SBA also aided us in pursuing contracts.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, in '66 [1966], you got a seventy thousand dollar contract.  That's with the Navy, right?  That's the one?
Speaker 1: That would--that would be the Navy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what, what were you supposed to do for them?
Speaker 1: That would've been in '66 [1966]?  I'm trying to think.  In '66 [1966], that probably would've been for amplifiers, building shipboard amplifiers for communications and also for communication throughout the ship.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What it is is they'll, they'll--amplifiers that they can mount anywhere aboard the ship and just wire it in and that gives them communications to those areas, and usually it's from the captain or from the brig or wherever through--communicate throughout the ship.
Speaker 2: You know--you know I'm reminded--
Speaker 1: And they--and they also do it for not only ships but also for subs, usually for submarines and for ships.
Speaker 2: You know, I--the, the image that comes to mind is that movie 'Mister Roberts' where the, the--
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: --captain, you know, makes all his commands on the--on the loud speaker, never comes out of his cabin hardly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yep.  So, we used to--we used to make those things by the thousands, you know.  It looked like--we used to say, you know, looked like every ship should have (laughter), you know, these things in every, every hole on the ship, you know, but they just keep buying it.  'Cause I--what, what we found out is that if they stop working or some--or something gets rag- you know, gets broken or something, they just take the thing off the wall and throw it overboard, you know, and then put another one (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wow.  Yeah, that's--yeah. It speaks to a lot of waste in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a lot of--
Speaker 2: --the government.
Speaker 1: --waste, you know, 'cause we also sold the government mo- spare modules, you know, that would go inside.  But that means you gotta open it up.  You know, you gotta take it a little--take something loose and take it down and you gotta take the screws off and take these modules off and buy some--put in new modules.  That was more work than if you just took the whole thing off and unplugged it and--you know, and put another one up and plug it in, you see?  But, anyway, it created a--it, it created a need, you know, that we kept supplying.  They--and I bet they're still buying those amplifiers.

Speaker 1: Now, some of the other--what were some of the other projects?  I got some written here, but what were some of the other projects of, of Sonicraft [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we did a contract where we developed a communications, secure communications for the Air Force One that--so that it would be able to broadcast, you know, in conditions of, you know, air--atmospheric interference.  And so we had that one.  That, that was one of the major contracts that we were able to acquire and that was in the early '80s [1980s] that we got, got that.  And that was to develop it, to also test it, and also to install it and to do field testing, and then to--if necessary, to build additional units.  We did build additional units for the--as backup for those items.  And then we did what was called a precision approach path indicator.  That was for FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] for guiding planes onto runways.  We also did omnidirection lighting systems for lighting, for giving lighting systems to--also at airports.  And we also did the transmissometer calibrator that was to calibrate light transmission along runways, that they could measure the light so that if a plane was landing or something, they would know how far the plane lights would be able to come down.  And we also did a lot of them for the [U.S.] Navy.  We--not only the shipboard things, but we did the--we developed one for measuring the depth of the water or depth of anything within the water, and that was for the National Oceanographic Association [sic. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration].  We also did one for their buoy systems.  You know, they have buoys all over the, the--large buoy systems for ships and for guiding around certain structures, that we developed a communication system for controlling the--controlling those buoys out there.  At one time, they had people that they would put in those buoys.  People don't know it, but they have buoys that's, that's almost as large as this room here below water, you know.  You, you don't see it.  You just see the thing sticking up with the light.
Speaker 1: Just the top of it, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, down below, they have a place for them to sleep, you know, and they have a toilet, you know, and those facilities down below that deck, and they also have generators for electricity and everything.  So, what we did is we built a system to take the place of a person there and mainly that person was to make sure the communications, the light and everything else was working properly.  So, we built a system to do all that monitoring.  And if the generator go down--'cause there was two generators there, so that if one go down, you could start the other one and, and send a signal back saying one of my generators went bad.  Or if the light goes bad, you can send back and say the light is bad.  And you don't have to have anyone out there 'cause nobody wanted to stay out there, but they were, were forced to go out there, you know, but that was their job.
Speaker 1: I would imagine that would be a lonely assignment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So, anyway, we built that for the [U.S.] Coast Guard.  That was one of their projects that we did.  So, we've done a lot of programs.  We also did a communications network for jeeps and vehicles that, that you can install within the jeeps or trucks and also the--we had the handheld walkie-talkies that we developed.  So, we've done a, a lot of developing.  At one time, we had upwards of five hundred employees and we were--had facilities at five locations.  There was two locations in Chicago [Illinois] and then we have one in Washington [D.C.], one in Massachusetts, and another one in--I forget where that fifth one was.  But, anyway, we had, you know, locations all over the United States, mainly close to the installations.

Speaker 1: Yeah, one of our HistoryMakers, physicist, [HistoryMaker] Carl Spight, worked--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was working there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) at Sonicraft [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he worked there.  Yeah, I remember Carl.
Speaker 1: He was a--he was involved in research, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the research engineer there.  He was over our research section or department there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you came in doing what role and how did your role change?
Speaker 2: Well, I came in, as I mentioned before, early on when we were in the stage of just getting off or just trying to see if it was--it, it was feasible, so it was--as I mentioned before, it was in Jerry's [Jerry T. Jones] basement that we first started out--was in his basement doing small, mainly circuit boards.  We would do circuit boards and build one or two for customers and it was individual items that we did for different customers in the Chicago [Illinois] area.  And then we moved from there to a storefront which was over on South Chicago [Avenue] at 74th Street.  They used to have a lot of--they--since then, all that's been torn down, but they used to have a lot of little storefronts right up and down South Chicago, and that's--
Speaker 1: Right, that's--
Speaker 2: We opened a storefront over there.  And from there, we went over to--
Speaker 1: About what year was that when you opened up?
Speaker 2: That was in '67 [1967].  And then, we went over to Burley [Avenue].  It was a furniture store that was vacant over there, and we were able to get that pre- pretty reasonable, and we needed more space, so we were able--we moved over to 82nd [Street] and Burley.
Speaker 1: That's over--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's over--
Speaker 1: --southeast (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's over east.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was in the old South Chicago Works [sic. South Works, Chicago, Illinois] neighborhood, you know, when they had the steel mills over there.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And then from there, we moved to seventy--we moved over to 88th [Street] and Greenwood [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay, 88th and--
Speaker 2: And then from 88th and--
Speaker 1: --Greenwood--
Speaker 2: --Greenw--
Speaker 1: Now, that's behind--Greenwood, that's--yeah, I think Greenwood, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There--do you know where--
Speaker 1: That's in like--
Speaker 2: --Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.] used to be?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Soft Sheen used to be--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --on 87th Street?  We were--we were just south of Soft Sheen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Down Greenwood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Down in the 88th block.  And then we expanded to the facility on 95th Street 'cause we ran out of space at Greenwood, and so we went and acquired the other sixty thousand square feet over there on 95th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's how we expanded to all these areas.  And then we had offices that we were--positioned close to our customers, you know, to the [U.S.] Air Force, to the [U.S.] Navy, to Washington [D.C.].  'Cause we had one office in Alexandria [Virginia].  That was the Washing- that was the--what we call our Washington office, and they would handle all of the contracts that came out of Washington.
Story_ID: 633780
Speaker 1: We interviewed a gentleman in Alexandria [Virginia] that used to work for the--I think he worked for the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration when they were coming up with con- when they were trying to, you know, make the contract process more equitable, and he ended up opening up a business, too, based on the kind of contract you could get.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And he, he hired engineers to work, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --for, for, for him 'cause he didn't know anything about the work, he just knew--he knew how to get the contract.  So--but--so, was, was your job on the--on the--on the contract acquisition in or, or the--
Speaker 2: Well, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: It was--you know, we were not that--what, what would happen is that we would form teams like for a program.  It depends on the program and extensity of the program.  We had some programs that would just repeat--or just built to print.  Those were what we call like small programs, although the dollar value on some of them was pretty high.  'Cause we had programs like with Ford Motor Company that the volume was high but the item was simple.  You see what I'm saying?  And then we had other contracts that were--the volume was low but the item was complex, you know, really complex when I mean complex.  And so, we, we would form teams based upon the requirement that we usually would have a project manager who would manage the project and then what he would do is contract with all of the departments for whatever he needs to meet or succeed with that contract.  And so I was the vice president and I was in charge of production, and the production includes the production engineers, the design engineers, the quality, the procurement, building, testing, packaging, engine- not only engineering but also the machine shop, coating, encapsulating.  It included all of those areas.  So, so, like I was saying, we, we had a vast organization when you look at it 'cause we could do anything.  You, you name it, (laughter) we would do it for you, you see?  If it involves electronics, then we would do it.  And from growing from next to nothing 'cause like I was saying, it was like two or three of us at the beginning and then it grew up to five, six hundred, you develop so that you do--you can do any of it, you know, 'cause you don't have it at the beginning.  Then as you get larger and larger, you gotta come up with the procedures and you gotta come up with personnel and you gotta get them trained and you gotta get them cleared and you gotta get them so that they know how to handle classified equipment and classified material, and they have to be classified.  You know, it's, it's, it's a vast--it's a vast area.  And also, it means that you're continuously learning and you're continuously advancing, which made it exciting.  You know, it kept, kept it--kept you on your toes all the time.
Story_ID: 633781
Speaker 1: Now, what, what was the high point of, of Sonicraft [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, the high point I believe was when we had--we went into a contract with AT&T [AT&T Inc.] in which we were doing a design and development job for FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], and this was to upgrade all of their communications equipment at airports, and that was a major contract that would've lasted somewhere on the order of ten to twenty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the, the high point of, of all the years, that was the contract, you know, that we had come up to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there--is there--was there ever a time when it looked like the whole thing was gonna cave in?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had those, too.  I mean, you don't--you don't be (laughter) in business without that.  I mean, not and, and grow and expand.  You know, the--I mean, you gotta be able to flex when it's required and also to--if you gotta back off sometimes, you have to back off.  But, we learned that early on, that the key was not to try to cover anything up or to get around things, to go ahead and hit it head on and go ahead and be truthful about what you found and to quickly get back to the customer and, therefore, sit down and see what you can do to resolve it.  And usually, if you--and you have a reasonable customer, they want it resolved, too, 'cause they want to go ahead and be successful.  So--but, yes, you, you will find out that, yes, you will run into those pitfalls and those pits that you gotta get down in and dig your way out.  Somehow, you gotta get out of them, you know.  And usually, like I was saying, you find that they, they--as you grow and you become more--I would say more adaptable, you will find that the--it's, it's less and less of them and they're less severe.  And so, you know, that's--and you get that mainly from experience.  A lot of it you will not get from books or anything else.  You know, you get it from experience.  And one of the things that I found out is that you can't really take anything for--you can't take it lightly and, and don't try to go around and skip items.  You know, don't--go ahead and do it, you know, especially--one of the, the key elements we had is that we did a lot of testing.  Our testing costs and our testing criteria was the highest element of what we were involved with, was in the testing, especially with the government and especially with [U.S.] military and especially also with the FAA.
Speaker 1: Now, now, did, did the government provide much oversight in terms of coming in and inspecting stuff and monitoring--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we had inspectors that were permanent.  You know, they, they were there every day and they would walk out to see what you're doing and also see whether you're following the specifications.  So, we had permanent FAA inspectors, permanent government inspectors, and we also had permanent inspectors like when we were doing work for Ford Motor [Ford Motor Company]--Ford had their own inspectors.  And also, other companies have their inspectors that come in.  So, you had inspectors all the time.  You always had inspectors.  And so, therefore, that also kept you so that you were pretty rigorous, you know, with your operations and that, you know, you wanted all of the personnel to be rigorous and also to be, you know, quality conscious 'cause, you know, that's something that no one, especially nowadays, will accept anything less than the best of quality.
Story_ID: 633782
Speaker 1: Now, what were you doing on your last job there as vice president [of Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The last one was that, that AT&T [AT&T Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the--
Speaker 1: What, what was your function?  I mean, that's what I mean (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.  It was--it was over manufacturing.  Usually what happens--usually what happens is that once we get a contract or program in, it usually go through a review and then after, it go through contract, what we call contract review.  They just review the contract to make sure it's what we bidded on and that nothing has been changed.  And then, it goes to engineering, and they will do the design and development.  They do all the design, the development, and they monitor the first bill when you bill what we call the first article.  They have to monitor that and also they have to go through testing 'cause most items that we bill goes through rigorous testing, you know, that they have all type of testing 'cause they--you have to remember that in terms of the military, it's got to operate not only in Iceland, but it got to operate in the desert.  So, you know, you--it (laughter) might go from there to there, you know, right on a plane, you see, so it--it's gotta be able to operate.  So, you gotta do all this testing and it has to operate aboard ship, which means the shaking and the rattling, so you gotta test it to make sure it'll, it'll operate that way.  So, one of the major items and major functions that I was involved with or I was controlling was the testing, to make sure the tests are done, that they're also adequate and that you're well within the parameters.  You're not borderline 'cause the borderline will kill you when you go into production.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so what was the state of the organization when, when, when you left?
Speaker 2: The organization had closed down.  We, we had closed.  It had closed then and that was something that happened with AT--at AT&T's organization that they could no longer perform on that contract.  And so, that--without that contract, we just couldn't, couldn't exist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you--when you retired in '96 [1996], basically you were vice president of operations, but the organization was really retired, too, at the same time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it, it was--it was dwindling down 'cause once that started to go down, then we start cutting back and start reducing operations.
Story_ID: 633783
Speaker 1: When you look back on the history of the organization [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and--I mean, at what--I know it, it was lauded as the only, the first and--of--the first black organization to ever get those kind of government contracts--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: ---(simultaneous) and that kind of work, yeah.
Speaker 2: We were the--we were the first.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Looking back, the only thing I would say is that probably could've done maybe more diversification.  I don't know.  We never had an off the shelf item.  We never produced anything that would be put on a shelf.  It was--it was always to some specifications for a specific function that was needed immediately, not to be sit on a shelf.  And, and when you look--when you look back at it, 'cause other companies--what happens to other companies, if, if one item or one product is incapable of holding its own, usually what they will do is they will override and just drop that program and, and also build on the other programs that they have.  In other words, they have diversification and we were caught--we didn't have enough diversification to hold us, to sustain us.  We just didn't have it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what happens, you know, when--a lot of times if you get such that you have a major, major contract that you're--you know, and you get into that position where you--you're totally dependent, you know, on that major project, contract, then you're subject to that happening, you know.  And I don't--you know, I don't hold any ill winds or anything, you know.
Story_ID: 633784
Speaker 1: Now did you participate in the--what, what do they call it, the minority contract buyers group out of New York [New York] and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I remember we were--we used to participate in the, the one from SBA [Small Business Administration], you know, SBA Development [SBA 8(a) Business Development Program].
Speaker 1: The contract, yeah.  There was (unclear) contract (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause we used to--
Speaker 1: Not, not contract--
Speaker 2: We used to always be with SBA and SBA used to--whenever we needed help or support or whatever in any of the government agencies, if, if necessary, we would try to call in SBA.  But--and also, we were members of, you know, manufacturing organizations that--the National Association of Manufacturers and, and National Black Association of Manufacturers [sic. National Black Manufacturing Association], and also the neighborhood business association, we were members of, you know, in the Chicago [Illinois] area.  So, we were pretty much involved--
Speaker 1: Now, there--there's an organization in New York that--and I got the name wrong before, but it--they--'cause we interviewed them.  They, they try to smooth the way for, you know, black contractors to show off what they can do and then, you know, to get--you know, to be visible, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --to the government.
Speaker 2: And who, who are they funded by?  The, the government fund them?
Speaker 1: Partially and then their other--yeah, but they're in New York City and they have a board and everything.  They get together--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --and they meet and members come in and they--they're able to see what's available and try to determine if (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  We didn't have that existing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: At least I didn't know of anything like that existing when we were there and could use it, you know.
Story_ID: 633785
Speaker 1: Did, did the Harold Washington administration help you at all in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had avenues that we were--after contracts out at--out at the airport [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] that--that's when they were putting in--they were getting ready to put in a transport system to the parking lots.  Remember they were putting in the trains ["L" elevated train]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --to the parking lot.  And we were--we were going--we were somehow co-contractors with--I was trying to think of the name of the company that was building--they were supposed to--there was--that was bidding on building the cars and we were supplying all the electronics for the cars.  It might've been GE [General Electric].  It was one of the companies, but they were not successful, and that was during, during the Harold Washington era.  And--'cause we--I remember we had spoken with Harold about it and he was saying, well, you guys, go for it.  You know, go on the bid with--you know, get with someone that's building the, the--'cause we couldn't build the, the--build it alone, so we, we had--and I think it was with GE.  It was with one of them that was building the cars.  They were building the cars and we would supply the electronics for the cars.
Speaker 1: All right.  But that didn't reach fruition.
Speaker 2: No, that didn't.  And also, there was other items that--you remember when Harold came in, he was--he was in--interested in opening the doors for minorities.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he had like one of the Lowrys, the Lowrys were helping him, I think.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  And so, he certainly told us, you know, that we should, you know, be bidding on the contracts that come out of the--you know, come out of the, the agencies there.  And we were--like I was saying, we were bidding on some.  We just were not--we were not successful at getting any.
Story_ID: 633786
Speaker 1: And see, one of the problems is that we found out that also, if, if you don't have connections or someone that can keep you up on initializing--see, one of the things that, that we also had, we had--we had different reps.  We had a representative in, in Washington [D.C.].  Beside, we had a office [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] there, but we still had a representative, contract representative that would go out looking for contracts just for us, and we had them in Massachusetts.  We had--you know, it's--these was just individuals.  You know, they had their own little business and what they do is they, they get different contractors.  They don't--they try not to have the same--the same type of contractor.  They try to have a different one of different types, so if they go into an agency, they're trying to sell a different type, but they don't want to have to be able to pick one above the other one.  But, anyway, the reason I was saying that is that we found out that that was the only way we could get really into government, at least get a foot hold or get into that because they find out things is happening before it comes out.  See what I'm saying?  So, you have a head's up.  You see what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have a head's up.  You know, you can't come in there at the end and (laughter) expect to compete against these guys over here that's got a head's up, you see?
Speaker 2: Somebody knows about it long before--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what I'm saying is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) While it's happening.
Speaker 1: --they have a head's up and they know how to massage it and also to interact, and if they have contacts to, to see those contacts and also interact with the contact, so then when it does come out, they're ready.  Now, you come out at the end, you know, and you struggling trying to get it together, you know, that's--you just won't make it.
Story_ID: 633787
Speaker 1: When you look back at it now, do you see another Sonicraft [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] emerging?  Has someone else been able to do this?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things is--you know, I could see it in other areas.  It could happen possibly in the health area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the health area, but I don't see it in the--in the communication because the technology changes so fast and you have these companies, you know, like, like Apple [Apple, Inc.] and Google [Google Inc.] and all of these that, that they're on the top of it now that they're creating up here and you're back here.  You see what I'm saying?  That you can't come out (laughter) and expect to be up here, you see?  The, the point is that it's, it's a different situation.  I mean, you could possibly do it, but it's, it's really--it's, it's something to come out and get into the race 'cause you're, you're so far behind and the technology is changing so fast that soon as they develop this, they're going on up here.  Now, where are you going?  You know, you can't go up here 'cause you have--you don't know where these guys have gone, you know, or where they're headed.  You see what I'm saying?  But you could do it possibly in some field--other fields, but the communications and, and the electronic technology is, is, is vast now.  It's--and also, it's international, too.  You know, it's--you have that market.  I remember when we were--back in the '80s [1980s], we were concerned about the international market back in the '80s [1980s].  We were concerned about, you know, all of the offshore that was going on 'cause we were approached many times about coming to other countries and setting up or moving, just move--they just--they would just move us to those countries and use their labor and they would set us up.  Or if we didn't want to move, they would set us up a company there and we just send the people in trained.  And so it was vast.  It's--it was--it was changing.  You know, well, we saw it was changing.  We saw that it was changing.  But the--as I--as I mentioned before, I think that it's possible in other areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You would have to look and choose your area.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You'd have to look.
Speaker 1: --dream growing up that you'd be part, part of something like Sonicraft?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I, I thought about it, you know, early on especially, you know, with radios and, like I was saying, was--you know, 'cause early on, was fixing radios and that was starting to grow, you know 'cause I was one time looking at possibly opening some little shop, you know, but developing and all--in the area that we got into, I could see that, you know, 'cause it was just a matter of, you know, the technology changing.  And the technology back in those days to me wasn't changing as fast as it changes now.  'Cause the technology nowadays, I mean, it's, it's vast.  It is really vast.
Story_ID: 633788
Speaker 1: Now, you've done a lot of volunteer work--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --too, and one of the places that you've been rewarded is eta Creative Arts Foundation [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We were talking about that when I came in.  Tell us about your work with eta.
Speaker 2: Eta--I really got involved with eta I think when we were down--when we were on South Chicago [Avenue] 'cause we was in the next block from--they were--they were further down, and I met Abena [HistoryMaker Abena Joan P. Brown] and some others over there when they, they were at a different facility than--where they are now.
Speaker 1: It's still on South Chicago?
Speaker 2: It was still on South Chicago but it was further back.  It wasn't, you know, where they are now right on 76th Street.  As I recall, 'cause we were at--we were at 75th [Street], 75th and South Chicago, a storefront there, right there--no, 74th [Street].  We were at 74th and they were at I think it was the next block, 75th, somewhere like that.  And, and then, they were just setting up like in a room like this and they just had chairs and, you know, and they were just getting started.  And we used to talk and laugh and joke and (laughter), you know.  We both wasn't doing nothing, you know, (laughter), plenty of time.  And, and that's how I first met some of those over at eta.  And then it just kept, you know, going and kept involved, that I would always participate and always try to make the different shows and the different functions that was going on.  And so--you know, then finally it got to a point that, you know, Abena said, "Well, why don't you come on over and, and join some of these committees or clubs or--you know, and help us out 'cause, you know, you can do it, you know."  So finally I, I did go over there and start getting involved.  And, and also, you know, I found out I started enjoying it, you know.  'Cause it was something I had never done.  I had never been involved with the theater or anything.
Speaker 1: Now, now it's funny, you're saying your father [Louis Taylor, Sr.] was involved in (unclear) at one time--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: But I, I never--
Speaker 1: But you never--
Speaker 2: --thought of it 'til--you know, I did think of it later after I got involved, you know, and I was saying, he was involved.  You know, I did think back just like--you know, you think back and you say, well--
Speaker 1: Yeah, did--
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Did your father know Ted Ward [Theodore Ward] or [HistoryMaker] Okoro Harold Johnson or, or Abena from those days from those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  I don't think Abena was around then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she, she--
Speaker 2: I mean, she, she might've--she was around 'cause she was--I think she was performing herself before.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know she was in the Richard B. Harrison Players and a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Was your father involved in that?
Speaker 2: No, he was only involved--he was only involved on the radio at night [WBBM Radio, Chicago, Illinois].  That's the only thing I remember that he was involved with.
Speaker 1: He, he were--he wasn't involved in the plays or--
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.  No, no plays, not the--you know, I never saw any plays.
Story_ID: 633789
Speaker 1: --Then I started to participate and finally got on the board there.
Speaker 2: We're rolling right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay good. All right.  So--yeah, now that, that was a, a--there was a pretty strong little business community around there.  I mean, across the street was Cecil Troy, right, with the Grove Fresh [Grove Fresh Distributors, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --franchise.  And so he was a--yeah, he distributed fruit drinks.
Speaker 1: Fruit juices.  Yeah, he was fruit--
Speaker 2: He had juices all over the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: He was--right, right.  He was--he was well in business and, and also well established.  And--but, it was--you know, I was sorry to see that--'cause no one took that over.  No one picked that up and--
Speaker 2: Grove Fresh when it--when--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, I guess--you know, I don't--but, anyway, he left that, that property to eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.  That's right.  And there's--I know a new theater is scheduled to be built across the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that--yeah, that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) street.
Speaker 1: You know, that was on the drawing board before I left.  Before we left Chicago, there was--there was--you know, had been designed and developed, and supposedly what had happened is that we were waiting for money from the state and also from the city and something happened and the money didn't come in, and they were saying that they don't know now that--Daley [Richard M. Daley] is no longer there, whether they'll ever get the--you know, the moneys that were supposedly coming from the city.
Speaker 2: So, monies were earmarked to go there, but--
Speaker 1: Right.  And also from the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) with the change of--
Speaker 1: --state.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it--that never came in.  So, it's, it's been a struggle, you know, to try to--and, of course, as time goes on, the cost goes up (laughter), you know.  It doesn't go down.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, it goes up.
Speaker 2: Now, did you know the contractor over there that built the original theater, Clayburn Jones [ph.]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Were you on the board then when they built the--
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--which was new in eighty--'87 [1987], '88 [1988], I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember when they did it, but I didn't know the contract.  I knew the, the architect that had designed the one across the street that, you know, did, did the work for that, at least--you know, it's done so far as he had done the--that design and for us across the street.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, yeah, that was supposedly scheduled to be--to have been built, I don't know, five, six years ago.
Speaker 2: Now, did, did, did your children [Anthony Taylor, Angela Taylor and HistoryMaker Valerie Taylor] participate in eta in any of the programs?
Speaker 1: Well, they, they would participate--some of them participated in the summer programs 'cause I had, you know, that and also some of my grandkids and--not grandkids, but my nieces and nephews and their kids participated, and they still participate in it, some of their kids that's coming along.  They participate in the summer program with the kids.
Story_ID: 633790
Speaker 1: Now, are there any other organizations you volunteer for?
Speaker 2: Well, here, I, I do--I'm with the Brazos Valley African American Museum.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's something.  I've never heard that there was one in the Brazos Valley.  That's where--we're, we're in the valley of the Brazos River (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's a--it's a--it's a small museum here that is in Bryan [Texas], yeah right in this area.  It's not far from here.  And it was built--it was built in 2006, and so--. And it's--you know, it's, it's small but it's a start.  You know, it's already outgrown, you know, the different items that we have available.  It's already outgrowing them that we can't even display half the items that's here.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Just, just briefly, can you kind of give us an idea of what the, the history of African Americans are here in Brazos Valley near College Station, Texas?
Speaker 2: Well, well, the, the major item here from what I've, I've been told is that if you remember when they came through to--with the notification about the--at the end of the war, the Civil War, that somehow Texas was at the end of the notification, that they hadn't been notified here in Texas.
Speaker 1: That Emancipation [Emancipation Proclamation] in Texas right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and that finally, I guess Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] or some, some--someone from Washington [D.C.] sent out someone in the [U.S.] military to come to Texas and to proclaim the emancipation.  And, and that's why they--here, they call it Juneteenth 'cause sometime, sometime in June supposedly that's when it was read and that's when it got accepted here.  Now, supposedly in other areas, it had already been accepted and everything. But, anyway, they call it--so every year, they celebrate Juneteenth.  And what happen--what had happened here, like, this was just like they were saying--just like Mississippi.  I mean, you know, the, the--they had slaves and they had plantations and that people would work on the plantations, and they were not allowed to have land or anything.  And then after that, they were allowed to have land, and what they formed was what they call a free--Freedmen's Town [Fourth Ward, Houston, Texas], and the Freedmen's Town was a certain part of Bryan--College Station didn't exist at that time--was a certain part of Bryan, and that's where all of the blacks that were freed was allowed in that--to go into that areas, and that area still exists.  And a lot of those houses that were first built at that time, some of them still exist, you know.  They're, they're falling down of course, you know, and they're starting to tear a lot of them down.  But, anyway--and, and a lot of them have moved out of the area, you know, spread it out.  Of course, the younger ones have left, you know, the--'cause the--because of jobs and also because of schools and so forth, so--but, they've left.
Story_ID: 633791
Speaker 1: But anyway, the area still exists and they still talk about Freedmen's Town [Fourth Ward, Houston, Texas] and that one of the things you find here is that you don't get much support and it--and it's as though people are still skeptical.  You don't get the--you know, the support of the community, the community support.  Like that museum [Brazos Valley African American Museum, Bryan, Texas] is there.  And I'll be willing to bet half of the people in the community haven't even been to the museum.
Speaker 2: You think they know it's there?
Speaker 1: Sure, they know it's there.  They see it's there.  I mean, it stands out.  You know, you, you see it's there, you know it's there and, you know, it's been, you know, in the paper and lot of fanfare and stuff go there.  And lot of times when they have parades over--you know, 'cause they have a Martin Luther King Drive [sic. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street] over in the area, they come by the museum.  The museum is not on that street, but it's right on the next street over.  But, they usually have the parade come around and swing around past the museum.  So, everybody know that the museum is there, but they don't come to the museum, you see?  You find some do, you know, some and some, especially some of the older ones 'cause we have, you know, a lot of--we give a lot of respect to the older ones 'cause we have a wall up there with a lot of the pictures of the older community people that grew up.  We call it the over ninety group.  All of them are over ninety years old.  And so we're, we're saying we'll probably start lowering it, you know.  Just like you're doing in pictures, we're, we're doing pictures on videos of, of all of those over ninety and asking--
Speaker 2: The oral--
Speaker 1: --them to--
Speaker 2: --oral histories:
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--but, we haven't finished all the over nineties, you know, 'cause even that don't always bring all of them out that's over ninety, you know, that--and you just wonder why, you know.  Why is people so skeptical and so--and, and, you know, you can understand somewhat, you know, that a lot of people have just not gotten over and they're just still skeptical and they still don't believe.  Well, you know, all of this is Republican territory anyway, and it's, it's, it's a--you know, that anyone that talks or say or anything directed towards, you know, being or, or existing as a Democrat is, is, is like an outcast.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, I, I, I sort of get the idea, they figure that if they can outcast Democrats, they can outcast them, too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I still don't understand how the museum get (laughter) in there, you know what I'm saying?  I haven't figured that out.
Story_ID: 633792
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my hope and concern is that, first of all, you can unify, you can get--unify with the community and become unified and the community can recognize their strength in unity 'cause they'll never get there un-unified, so they've, they've got to unify.  And also to be willing to sacrifice and to pursue positions of authority.  Now, those are the two things I see is they unify and positions of authority.
Speaker 1: So, people just don't want to step up.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  You don't see many getting in government, you know, and you, you wonder why, you know.  I mean, everybody know everybody, you know, but they don't.  And, and it's strange because the churches are strong here.  You know, the--every--some--everybody go to some church and the churches are strong, but I don't know, you know.  I don't know whether, whether it's the--you know, and you can't blame it on the pastors, you know.  They can't force.
Speaker 1: Well, I, I was gonna ask you like what the message was in church.  Is, is the message to act, to do something or, or?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that the church--like, the church that my daughter [HistoryMaker Valerie Taylor] belongs to, see she belong to the First United Methodist Church [Bryan, Texas], we belong to the Catholic church, and of course the Catholic church, that's a entity within itself, at least here it is 'cause it's mainly--you know, it's all white and there's very few blacks.  Just a few blacks.  But, the Methodist church that she belongs to is all black.  There's a few whites that, that belongs to it.  And the problem I see, just, just like there, is people don't vote 'cause you ask people, "Well, well, aren't you--aren't you going to vote?"  They say, "No, you know, it, it ain't gonna make no difference," or, "I haven't voted before, so--and, and you see how things are.  Me voting ain't gonna make no difference."  And you can't get--I don't know how you would change that, you know.  And you, you know, and there--there's papers 'cause there's, there's a couple of guys I know that puts out a paper every--you know, a, a paper every month, you know, with community activities and what's going on in the community.  And he put out about voting and they don't vote.  They don't come out.  They don't support.
Speaker 1: What, what percentage of, of the community is black here in--
Speaker 2: In Bryan [Texas] or in College Station [Texas]?
Speaker 1: Bryan--well--
Speaker 2: It's different in the two.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll, we'll say Bryan first.
Speaker 2: In, in Bryan--I would say in Bryan, it's probably like 60/40, sixty white to forty black.
Speaker 1: That's pretty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They say at one time, it was--it was--it was like fifty--it was--it was a little more black than white, they said at one time, but, you know, a lot of the younger ones left.  Now, in, in College Station, I would say it's like 70/30.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you count the students now, it's even worse than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's probably 80/20.
Story_ID: 633793
Speaker 1: Here's a question we always ask, too, is that when you look back on everything you've done so far in life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would say that be- being able to build and sustain a business [Sonicraft, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] for thirty years, even though it's not existing today, but still just doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and when you look back on it all, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: Well, if I knew then what I (laughter)--if I knew then what I know now, of course--of course, you know (laughter), you would do--you would do major items different, you know.  But, you know, you, you don't have that luxury, you see.  That's the problem.  If I could go back with the same knowledge that I have now, oh, of course, you know, of course you would do it different.  If I knew then what I know now, then it wouldn't--it would be more diversification in the business.  It would've been more diversi- diversified and wouldn't have run into that problem.
Speaker 1: In terms of the contracts you took and that sort--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of thing so it wouldn't be so dependent on the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: That's right, so dependent on one contract.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  That makes sense.
Speaker 2: You know, you could have many with the same agency, but not one.  And see, you, you, you--what happens is that--that's something that it's, it's hard to control 'cause, you know, as you grow and you start getting larger and larger contracts, after a while, you know, you gonna get to the point where you can't grow anymore or you can--your growth is so slow.  You can't--and so when that con- the contracts come, you know, 'cause you're up here and you're, you're at that point to have those contracts and you have to watch that you don't let one be your deciding point of existence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's--and it's hard to do because, you know, you're getting larger and larger and larger and larger.  And you--you know, and you tell yourself, well, if I get this, this will sustain me so many years and I can build it up, and you've done that before in the past, and that's those pitfalls.  You talk about sometimes you get them (laughter) and--you know.  That's--sometimes you hit those, you know.  But, before, you know, you were able to--somehow to bring it up, you know, but what happens is the industry sometimes changes also.
Story_ID: 633794
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Now, you have--you have three children, right?
Speaker 2: Three children, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who are your children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, first of all, I'm proud of--proud of them.  You know, they've all finished college.  They've all--professionals.  They've--none of them been incarcerated, none of them has been arrested, none of them is on drugs.  I have four grandchildren, two here and two in California, and a son [Anthony Taylor] who's in Wisconsin.  And we visit--you know, we, we try to visit, you know--the ones here [HistoryMaker Valerie Taylor], of course, we see every week just about, sometimes every day.  But, of course, the one in California [Angela Taylor] and Wisconsin, we try to go there at least once a year, go there and they usually get here once a year.  So, you know, we're a close knit family and that we have always been that way.  We've always tried to look out for each other and, and also to have the respect for each other and also the support for each other.  And, and it was that way when I was growing up.  You know, it was--it was--it was that way and I'm sure that it was the same way with all of--you know, that we had that same type of structure.  And they're making the same structure themselves.  You see, they're, they're structuring basically some of the basic fundamentals that we did and that theirs is--theirs is coming up that way.  So, they're starting to hit that age where they're getting ready to move into college and move on themselves, you see (laughter), so that's the next generation, you see?  But--
Speaker 1: So you can see a continuity over the generations.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can see that there's a continuity, um-hm.  And as I--as I look around the family, you know, there--there's a lot--there's a large family, you know, when you look at all of the numbers 'cause I, I remember we were in--where were we?  We were in--we were in--I guess we had a family reunion in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I remember we were at some function and we were looking around, we were saying, where did all these people come from?  And so I, I was telling my sister [Theresa Taylor Doughty], I say, you, you, you haven't seen (laughter)--you must haven't looked at the, the chart (laughter), you know.  I say you see all of them eighteen names and then there's eighteen of those (laughter), you know.  I said, you don't have them all.  If you had them all, you know--you know (laughter).  I don't know what you would do if you tried to get them all, you know.  I--you just couldn't.  You know, I mean, there's nowhere to hold them all, you see?
Story_ID: 633795
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that I haven't touched upon or we haven't talked about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think that you've touched on most of it.  The only thing I would say would be--that you didn't ask is, what do I dislike here that I liked in Chicago [Illinois] or, or I miss here from being in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and that's--you don't have the, the interaction in terms of the arts here and the functions.  For instance, you know, there, I was member of the assembly, you know, and we used to have functions with the assembly and a member of the Archdiocese council and they used to have functions there, and also the--and this--a lot of it is--was church, you know, but still, there was a lot of functions with the church that's not here.  So, you know, those are some of the functions that I don't see here.  Even sometimes we go to, to church in Austin [Texas], you know, 'cause there--there's a black Catholic church in Austin--we go there some time, is that it still doesn't function the way the churches in Chicago function and have the different outlets and also the different functions.  And, and also the camaraderie that you had there, you know.  And, and also, you know, this is a smaller town so, you know, you just don't have the, the--it--even though, you know, they're, they're starting to build it up and you're starting to see a lot more, but it don't have the quality, I would put it that way.  It don't have the--seem like have the quality that you, you have in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Chicago is a lot--a lot different from College [College Station, Texas]--from Bryan--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Bryan, Texas, I guess.
Speaker 2: You noticed that, too (laughter) (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 633796
Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy.  It's a little bit different, though.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I would like to be remembered as an individual, unique. Also as a member of a unique family, of a family that is unique. And also as a member of the community and as a member of the world 'cause now we're worldwide, you know, that I can pick up and talk across the world now that the world is smaller, and maybe even the--looking at the planets 'cause they're talking about Mars now, you know, see?  So, that will be something else that will be explored within the coming years is, you know, the--so, we have a lot--things that are changing and a lot of ideas and atmospheres and you name it.  And what I'm excited about is that even with what the--what is said about our economy and about the jobs and about the cost and so forth, we are vastly improved from where we were as I remember when I was a kid.  We are vastly improved and that we should not take it for granted.  Most people want to take it for granted that it should be better.  You don't do nothing to--nothing to make it better, it will not be better.  And you can't point to any one person that's gonna make it better either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I think, you know, we all are due for a hard look in the mirror (pause).  And I'll just leave it like that.
Story_ID: 633797
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, what are we looking at here?
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a picture of the laboratory at IIT Research Institute [Chicago, Illinois], about 1965.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  --all over it?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, there's writing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's--we put the writing on it.  We put all of the--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What is it?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: We said something about--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Have to zoom in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh--
Speaker 2: And that's--now, I won't be able to name those.  Left to right, Willie Taylor, and those are two members of the government from Washington [D.C.], and I believe it's for the [U.S.] Coast Guard, and that's when we were doing the item for the buoy assemblies.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the--okay, that's, left to right is me, Willie Taylor, right is John Jackson [ph.].  We're members of the Knights of Peter Claver.  And that's a Catholic fraternal organization.
Speaker 1: Right.  Saint Peter Claver tried to free the slaves in, in, where is it, Brazil?
Speaker 2: In, in Cartagena [Colombia].
Speaker 1: Cartagena, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Left to right, that's Anthony Taylor and Willie Taylor as cooks, posing as cooks.
Speaker 2: This is--left to right is Wilma Sutton, who was the president of our board of trustees, Willie Taylor, and then President Steinberg [Salme H. Steinberg] of Northeastern Illinois University [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: I didn't even ask you about that 'cause I didn't know.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Let me see, what was her name?  I don't remember her name.  Do you remember her?  She's in Chicago [Illinois].  I forget.
Speaker 2: On the left here?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: I forget her.
Speaker 2: Well, she look familiar.  I can't--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Okay, but I don't remember her name.  Middle is Willie Taylor and right is Bishop Perry [Joseph Perry] in Chicago.
Speaker 2: The mystery woman.
Speaker 1: Let me see who--let me--this was at the White House [Washington, D.C.] where we got a contract with the government.  And, let's see, left to right, let's see, what was her name?  Maybe I'll think of her name.  Let me start with myself, Willie Taylor, Garland Watt, Jerry Jones [Jerry T. Jones], and that's Darryl Dawson, Barbara Birthwright, and don't ring a bell right now.  I'll--it'll probably--maybe it'll come back.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And approximate date?
Speaker 1: Oh, the date that--the date of that would've been nineteen eighty--I'd say '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: I'd say 1982.
Speaker 2: And I believe that's when president--who was--who was the president in '82 [1982]?
Speaker 1: Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ronald Reagan was president.  Okay, that was--let's see, what was his name, captain from the [U.S.] Air Force and myself, and that was one of our displays that we had 'cause we did a lot with the Air force and also with FAA [Federal Aviation Administration].  That's why you see the plane landing 'cause we built a lot of communications equipment.
Speaker 1: And that was just my picture as a--the board of trustees.  And what are the--oh, that's the--well, that's already listed there.  Can you--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 1: This is the same picture, too, just big.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, you don't have to bother with that.  And, oh, you wanted the year.  Let's see, that year would've been--'cause that was probably the--one of the last ones I took before we left.  That was probably 2002.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That one over there was 2002.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  With Cardinal George.
Speaker 2: Oh, Cardinal George.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, this, oh, let's see.  That must've been nineteen thirty--'cause he, he was born in '38 [1938], so I would say it's thirty--something like thirty--1939.  It look like he's about one year old, right?  The baby there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Uh-huh, yeah, he does.
Speaker 2: So, 1939, that's Chicago.

Speaker 2: Oh, oh, that's Theresa Taylor, that's my sister, I'm in the middle, Willie Taylor, and then on the right is Louis Taylor.
Speaker 1: And the two adults?
Speaker 2: That's Louis Taylor [Taylor's father, Louis Taylor, Sr.] and that's Tena Taylor [Tena Chapman Taylor].
Speaker 1: Your, your mom, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Louis Taylor is Louis Taylor, Jr.  That's--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the same, Louis Taylor and Tena Taylor, and that's Chicago.  And that must be the same time 'cause if you look, it's the same--
