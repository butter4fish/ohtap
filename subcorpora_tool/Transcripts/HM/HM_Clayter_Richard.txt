Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: Waynesboro, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And did she grow up there?
Speaker 2: No, she--I think she did grow up there and she moved to Chicago [Illinois], I don't know how old she was when she came here, and she always say she grew up in the South, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was she an adult when she moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you, do you know anything about her background growing up?  Did she live on a farm or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they lived in this country town.  She had, let's see, (unclear) I think she had four sisters and a brother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did any of them come to Chicago when she came?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of them lived in Chicago except my Aunt Susie [Susan Warren] who I think lived in Lima, Ohio.
Speaker 1: What kind of person was your mother?
Speaker 2: I would have to say she was a sweet, loving person, very friendly.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: What kind of occupation did she have?  What kind of work did she do?
Speaker 2: She was a domestic, I guess you'd say.
Speaker 1: And she was that when she came to Chicago, that's what she did?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think she was that when she came to Chicago, I don't know, I guess she came here from the farm.
Speaker 1: Did she ever tell you any stories about her parents?
Speaker 2: No, I met her mother, well, I remember once meeting her mother, my Grandma Katie and there's a photograph somewhere of me sitting on her knee and a picture of her.  I don't know where, what happened to it.
Speaker 1: So her name was Katie Warren?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how about her father?
Speaker 2: Her father, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother's--
Speaker 1: Father, yes.
Speaker 2: --father?  Was Phillip.
Speaker 1: Phillip Warren?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you remember anything about him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you know what kind of work he did?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I don't remember him being in Chicago, but I would assume he must have died when they were in Waynesboro.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about any family members beyond your grandparents?
Speaker 2: You mean my aunts and uncle?
Speaker 1: Well, how about your, what would be your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, my great-grandparents, no.
Story_ID: 623615
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father.  Where was he born and his name?
Speaker 2: Kansas City [sic. Atchison, Kansas], his name was Richard [Richard Clayter, Sr.].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know when he was born?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he grow up in Kansas City do you know?
Speaker 2: No I assume he, I'm assuming, he was, he grew up here [Chicago, Illinois].  He worked here, he was a carpenter.  Yeah.  (Pause) No I can't tell you much about him.
Speaker 1: What kind of personality did he have?
Speaker 2: He had an interesting personality, I guess.  I didn't have much contact with him.  My father and mother [Bella Warren Clayter] divorced when I was a child.
Speaker 1: Do you remember about how old you were at that time when they divorced?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably four, or maybe before then.
Speaker 1: So you were never, got a chance to really know him at that early age?
Speaker 2: Another thing I know about him is my parents separated apparently and divorced, and he lived with a lady named Mamie [ph.], and he was quite a cook.  His favorite was sauerkraut and spare ribs and I don't know if he had any hobbies.  I know he worked with a bunch of folks, I think you have a picture, it's rather faded, if I'm not mistaken, he worked on the, on the railroad.  He had good hair (laughter) and supposedly he, I had good hair and he cut my hair and that's that, it was no good.  Didn't see much of him.
Speaker 1: Do you know, you said he worked on the railroad, did he work on the railroad as a carpenter?
Speaker 2: As far as I can tell, I'm going a lot by those photo--by this photograph, which is not too good.  He didn't work on the railroad.  I think he worked more or less in connection with servicing railroad train, you know, the cars and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 623616
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about his parents?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Let's see.  (Pause) No, not about his parents, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I assume they were also probably from Kansas City [sic.]?
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure they were from--let's see, Kansas City, I, I get that confused with Atchison, Kansas, where--I think that's where his folks were.  If I'm not mistaken, I think he was Irish and Indian [Native American], yeah.  So I'm assuming, assuming, that his father was probably--that's strange, somehow or other I get his background was Indian, Irish.  His mother [Amanda Clayter] I don't know.  I know he had some brothers and he had a sister, who was very close to her, my Aunt Mae [ph.] and she was my father's sister, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she live in Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Aunt Mae, yeah, she lived in Chicago.  She and my mother [Bella Warren Clayter] were very close.  It was interesting, my mother married her brother, and Aunt Mae married my Uncle Bill [ph.], my uncle, very interesting.
Speaker 1: So your mother married her brother after the, sometime after the divorce?
Speaker 2: I think so because there was a lady in the divorce thing.  It was a friend of my mother's, they lived on the West Side, on Hastings Street, I remember that.
Story_ID: 623617
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your early years growing up.  Where did you live in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: 5767 South Lafayette [Avenue], and I lived in a number of places.  The way it worked, my Aunt Rowena [Rowena Davis (ph.)], the one they called Sister, owned property, she owned a lot of property, and my mother [Bella Warren Clayter] always--never owned any property.  She would live as a tenant to my aunt's sister, Rowena, and I know she lived at one time on Giles [Avenue].  See what would happen was if you, I call her Sister, if Sister, if you didn't do what she said to do, she put you out, and I remember us getting put out.  We were living on Clark Street--no, in those days, Wentworth [Avenue], and we lived on the third floor, and in those days they had a group of men, they'd call 'em Reds, why, why I don't know.  They were, they were somehow connected with the Communist Party.  And I remember living at, I don't know the exact address; that was before--must have been four- 49 something or--I can't think when that was.  But anyway, you bring up an interesting point.  We were in the process of being evicted.  My mother--I was a child, I was a baby, obviously, and my mother, they were in the process of evicting my mother and the baby, my mother and the baby.  And these folks, these fellows came over, I mean, these big husky guys came up and they told the sheriff, "You are not going to evict that woman and her child," and they worked out some kind of an agreement, where the sheriffs would go away and come back later and we would, you know, be voluntarily out.  That was an exception of the place that--I think the only two places I didn't live, or maybe three places I didn't live, was Giles, and that was north of 35th Street I believe, and I lived a lot on Lafayette.  I lived on what they call Grove [Street].  I think it's now, I believe it's now--I believe it's Dearborn [Street], perhaps.  In those days, I think they called it Grove, G-R-O-V-E, we lived there.  And I can't remember, I can't remember the year but I was, evidently, I must have been four or five or something, I was a mischievous little character, and in those days they had the stairs went from the sidewalk up, you had to, they had built it so that I guess they anticipated a flood of Lake Michigan.  This was quite a bit, quite a ways away, away.  And I used to--a little girl and I, we used to play doctor and nurse, you know, and I was famous for setting fires under these stairs.  I think that's why my mother sent me down to, down south, get me out of that major trouble.
Story_ID: 623618
Speaker 1: What are some of your earliest childhood memories?
Speaker 2: Oh lord.  Earliest childhood memories, childhood memories are mostly down south.  Well, being the scourge of the neighborhood in terms of setting fires, being sent away and spent most of my time down south, well not--quite a bit.  My Aunt Miss [Clayter's maternal aunt, Primrose Warren Hayes] was a very, I consider to be a very, very mean person.  I got whipped for no reason, switches, with switches.  I'd have to go chose a switch and she would whip me and I'd have welts on my body.  I think she had some problems because a lot of times I got, I got whipped and I had no, no reason for it, you know.  Down south, it was a rural area and we lived in this house and it had two bedrooms.  They were, over on one side and I was across on the other side and they got me, and they got a piano for my room, and I think they got the piano so that I wouldn't hear them when they were in the process of making love, whatever they did, but that's not answering your question (laughter).  I was baptized in a creek.
Speaker 1: This was in the South?
Speaker 2: This all take place in the South.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  When did you go down south?  How old were you then?
Speaker 2: You know I've been trying to remember that and I think I must have been four or five because before that some, some of these men that I told you about earlier, the Reds, had, had a meeting, and this was at the house on Giles [Giles Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], they had a meeting and somebody said, "That little boy--," I was a little rascal, "that little boy's going to be a lawyer."  I think I must have been about four years old and that stuck with me.  I decided, no matter what anybody said, I was going, I had to be a lawyer 'cause this guy said I was going to be a lawyer, you know, but I didn't know about being a lawyer is, had no idea.  But down there, now that I look at it, was a great life because they had fruit that grew on trees and I was, you know, get the fruit.  We had a cow, the cow's name was Bessie, Bessie had a calf and she would give milk and then all of a sudden the milk would stop and then the calf would go there and the milk would start flowing so she, you know, looked out for their calf.
Story_ID: 623619
Speaker 1: Where in the South was this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wiggins, Wiggins, Mississippi was thirty-five miles from Gulfport [Mississippi] and I think it was between Gulfport and Hattiesburg [Mississippi], but we were on the, down--Biloxi [Mississippi], Pass Christian [Mississippi] and Gulfport.
Speaker 1: Now which, this was your aunt and uncle that you lived with?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were their names again?
Speaker 2: My aunt's name was Primrose [Primrose Warren Hayes], they called her Mi- Aunt Miss [ph.].  My uncle's name was Clint [Clinton Hayes], Clint was his name.  Incidentally, that reminds me.  I referred to my father [Richard Clayter, Sr.] being a carpenter, I couldn't drive a nail if you, (laughter) you know my life depended on it.  So, shortly after I got down to Mississippi, my dear uncle was doing something to the porch, they had, they had a porch with a swing.  He was doing something to this porch and he made the mistake of giving me a hammer and I hit my nail on my finger with a hammer and I uttered a word, I think, damn or something, and that man slapped me and I saw stars.  Believe me, you can see, people can slap you and you can see stars.  I'll never forget that.  I went fishing.  There was a big pond on Flint Creek and the fellows thought they'd teach me how to swim so they threw me in the water and I almost drowned, but I never, they didn't try that again.  But I'd go fishing. We'd catch fish, we'd catch something you probably don't know about, called an eel, it looked like a snake, good eating, man, really, tremendous eating.  I'd go hunting and where we lived, from the side of the street, which would be the east side and the west side and then across from that was another farm, and I don't know why this poor fellow was out there, a white farm and I used to play with the little, with the boy that lived there.  In fact we'd go hunting together with slingshots.  And one day the father came over and decided, he told my uncle that I wasn't to play with his son, you know, that was the end of that.
Story_ID: 623620
Speaker 1: Now how old were you during this period?  How long did you stay down there?
Speaker 2: I stayed down there until I went to Tuskegee [Alabama].  My first year, Stone County Training School [Stone Middle School].
Speaker 1: So you got your early schooling there?
Speaker 2: I got a year there.
Speaker 1: No I mean in Wiggins [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to elementary school--
Speaker 2: No, no, not in Wiggins, let's see.  My school was at Tuskegee, how'd that happen?  I'm not sure they had any--yeah they had to have.  Anyway, I know my first, first year was at--no, we're talking about elementary school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking high school (laughter).  Yeah we had a, we had what they called Stone County Training School in Wiggins, and I remember my [maternal] aunt [Primrose Warren Hayes] was one of the teachers there, and there was another lady named Beasley [ph.] and there was another lady named--I can't think of her name but she was a tall, yellow woman, good looking gal.  And the principal's name was Beasley and Beasley accused her, I don't know, something, some hassle came of it.  There was another guy named Mr. Williams [ph.] who had, one, two, three, I think he had three son- three, three sons, I hung out with them a lot.  They had a farm and something happened, Willis [ph.] and Beasley got together and set fire to the school, and I think they had to close down.  They called the sheriff out, and the sheriff sent word back, tell Beasley and Willis to come in whenever they get time.  Nothing was ever done about that.  Beasley had a, had a store.  So this was the year Joe Louis and Max Schmeling, what year was that?  Joe Louis and Max Schmeling, they had a big fight 'cause we had, I know we were over at Mr. Beasley's store pulling, you know, the radio, you know.  You see in those days, they didn't have radios and stuff like they got (laughter) later, they had battery radiator--radios.  'McGee and Molly' ['Fibber McGee and Molly'], I remember them and Bob Hope and Bing Crosby and, (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Do you remember how old you were during the Joe Louis/Max Schmeling fight?
Speaker 2: Well I was born in '22 [1922] so whatever year that was, that was--I really can't, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was trying to recall some of the stuff that went on when I was down in Wiggins.  I'm sure more happened than that.
Speaker 1: That's quite a bit.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 623621
Speaker 1: The elementary school that you went to, do you remember the name of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stone County Training School [Stone Middle School, Wiggins, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay, then from there where'd you go?
Speaker 2: Tuskegee [Alabama] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was there like a junior high school in between there?
Speaker 2: No, Tuskegee, one year.
Speaker 1: This was after you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: I didn't graduate, this is my first, my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Tuskegee is where you started the high school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did you get from Wiggins [Mississippi] to Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Best I know they put me on a train, a bus or something (laughter), there's a horse, a horse and buggy.  No I think they, they sent me there, I don't think, I, I think I went there on my own.  I mean, you know, they sent me alone.
Speaker 1: (ARIANA CLAYTER):  So you did K [kindergarten] through--I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So you did your elementary up to, what would--we would say now is junior high school in Wiggins and then your first year--
Speaker 1: One year, one year at Tuskegee--
Speaker 2: That was high school?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I got back and my parents managed to get me into Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].  We lived at 5767 South Lafayette [Avenue] at that time and I was supposed to go to DuSable [DuSable High School], DuSable, I don't know if you're familiar with DuSable, here in Chicago [Illinois], are you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But in those days they had ice that came in blocks, didn't have cubes, they had blocks and they had tongs that they used to take them in, take the ice in or whatever.
Speaker 2: The guy used to have a leather thing on his back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: --to hold the ice, yeah.
Speaker 1: Mr. Roberts [ph.], he lived at, he had an icehouse at 6000 South State Street I believe it was.
Speaker 2: Now how old were you when you came back to Chicago?
Speaker 1: I must have been, let me figure this out.  I guess I was at the usual, what was the high school age, usually--
Speaker 2: Fifteen, sixteen?
Speaker 1: Whatever, yeah, probably.  But I think I got out finally in forty- when did I get out of high school, '41 [1941] (laughter)?  An interesting story about that high school thing.
Speaker 2: This is Englewood?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's the same--Mr. Roberts let us use his address, the icehouse address, and that way I was able to go to Englewood rather than DuSable because my mother [Bella Warren Clayter] and Sister [Rowena Davis (ph.)] didn't have much confidence in the quality of education that they were producing at DuSable.  And when I got to my, applied for my second year at Englewood, Ms. Levin [Edith Levin] decided that my credentials from Tuskegee were not supportive of first year at Englewood.
Speaker 2: And Ms. Levin was the principal there?
Speaker 1: No, she's just one of the teachers.  She was, I don't know what her, she was a teacher there that did this.  So, she put me back instead of me starting in the second year at DuSable--not DuSable, at Englewood, I had to start back in first year.  And then in addition to that, I guess as punishment or something, I had to get to school one hour, not an hour, one, one class thing before the, you know, the regular classes started.
Story_ID: 623622
Speaker 1: What was the racial makeup at Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] at that time?
Speaker 2: White, predominantly white.  And let's see, had to have carried that right on through to graduation.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mr. Doyle [ph.] who was an automobile teacher, he taught automobile, auto class rather.  Burnham [Charles P. Burnham], who taught machine, machine stuff, I didn't like him 'cause what he would do is he would, he always had something to read and the students would just do whatever they wanted to do, mostly we pitched pennies (laughter).  And there's another lady, and I can't think of her name, a Spanish lady that I liked very much, is very nice.  In those days--this was in the day when Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], yeah, Franklin D. said no American son shall set foot on foreign soil.  I'll never forget that, and they had the boys on the way there at the time, so, see what politicians do.
Speaker 1: So this would have been like 1939, 1940?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so, probably in the nine- might have been 1940, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in any extracurricular activities while you were in Englewood?
Speaker 2: Like what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sports or?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), I was, what was I?  I think I was in basketball, yeah.  I don't know of any others at Englewood, no.
Story_ID: 623623
Speaker 1: At this time, did you, were you still thinking you wanted to be a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was, that was for sure, there's no question about that.  As a matter of fact, I had a, I had an encounter with my dear Aunt Miss [Clayter's maternal aunt, Primrose Warren Hayes] in Mississippi [Wiggins, Mississippi] when I, for some, I don't know how it came up but I told her, I made the statement, I want to be a lawyer and she said, "You'll never be a lawyer, you talk too slow to be a lawyer."  And I said, "I'll just be a slow talking lawyer," knowing I'd get my butt switched and I had to go get the switches and, you know, get the welts and all that stuff, the usual procedure.  That is off the point, back to Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].  When you graduate, when you're up, you know, for graduation, and they supposedly interview you and whatever, they got another name for it, but anyway, they decide whether or not you're going to college, or this or that and the other.  And of course they interviewed me and decided, no way, don't even think about it, you're not college material.  So they assigned me to, I had had this auto shop training, you know, I had learned the four basics, intake, convulsion, something, exhaust, so I got a job, Clark Maple Chevrolet [Chicago, Illinois], which is up in the area where I'm living now, I got a job at Clark Maple Chevrolet and I lasted one day for that--I had a problem getting my hands, I didn't want to get my hands greasy.  In those days, they had the grease thing and they had an oil thing and they had a, you had to get underneath the car, I guess they still had the, yeah they still have that, you got underneath the car in the pit and I got my hands greased so I never did go back to get my check.  They owe me one, but that was not your question (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's okay.  So, after your one day stint at the Chevrolet dealership, where did you, what kind of work did you do next?
Speaker 2: I think by then the, 'cause this was '41 [1941], yeah, I think by then they come out with ERA or NRA or something, you know, WPA [Work Projects Administration], and I went to some training for a year, for years.  They had a, they had a training for youth, youngsters or whatever, where they would train you, it seemed like it was the NYA [National Youth Administration] or something like that, I don't know, through that I learned the, I pursued the machine, machinist kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Was that the NWA [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was, something like that.  And I got, I went through that, the youth thing, and I got a job at the Tri-Cities: Rock Island [Illinois], Mobile [sic. Moline, Illinois], Davenport [Iowa]--Rock Island, there is no Mobile there.  And I moved there with my dear wife, first wife [Mildred Warren (ph.)].
Story_ID: 623624
Speaker 1: And when did you get married?
Speaker 2: Mildred [Mildred Warren (ph.)] and I married when I was in high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What year that was I'm not sure.  Was that high school?
Speaker 1: This is 1939, 1940?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or earlier?
Speaker 2: I'm inclined to think I was in high school but I couldn't have been in high school 'cause I didn't get married--my son Dickie [Richard Clayter III] was born in '43 [1943] and we got married because she was pregnant.  She didn't want to get married and I had this good old sou- southern culture and I said, yeah, the right thing to do is for us to get married since you're going to have a baby, so we did.
Speaker 1: So this would have been about 1943 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Big, big mistake.
Speaker 1: --that you got married?  Or did you get married after your son was born?
Speaker 2: I think we married, if I'm not mistaken, we got married in '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: And what was her last name?  Where was she from?
Speaker 2: Warren, W-A-R-R-E-N, same as my mother's [Bella Warren Clayter] family, Warren.  They were the, you know, I don't think there was any connection.  You see, this lady was born, she was Mildred, Helen [ph.], Raymond [ph.] and another.  One of the boys was in the [U.S.] Army got killed, and they were all, their parents, I think, in some catastrophe and they were all placed in orphanages and they were separated, you know.
Speaker 1: This was in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think the orphanage was in Chicago, no.  You know that's interesting 'cause Mildred's mother was named Ms. West [ph.], and she was a punitive kind of person (laughter) to her, not to me, to them, to, Sheridan [ph.] was the boy's name, Sheridan, Mildred, Helen, there was--.  But anyway, we were back at school right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, I was just trying to get some information about your, your first wife, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, first wife.
Speaker 1: I mean, we have it now but I was just, that's where it kind of got you off track a bit, a little bit.
Story_ID: 623625
Speaker 1: You graduate from Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You spend a day working for this Chevrolet dealership.
Speaker 2: Clark Maple Chevrolet [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you say you moved to Rockford?
Speaker 2: To where?
Speaker 1: To Rockford?  You said you had some job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no.  Let's see.  We had Rock Island [Illinois]; Davenport [Iowa]; Moline [Illinois].  There were just the three: Rock Island; Moline; Davenport.  Davenport's in Iowa.
Speaker 1: That was the Quad Cities as they call it today.
Speaker 2: Well in those days they called them Tri-Cities.  Later I guess they did, Quad Cities, they, you attached East Moline [Illinois] I believe.  They threw that in there and made it the quad.  And that's where I lived while I was at the Rock Island Arsenal, and I had an exemption, I was turning out five hundred during the rough drafts, rough, not draft, just the rough procedure of five hundred machine gun barrels per shift, and I stayed on that until, I had an exemption because of the war [World War II, WWII], the war effort, you know.  I was on that when my exemption ran out one day, the next day I was called in, advised that I had been drafted.
Speaker 1: So you went from working for the [U.S.] Army to being in the Army?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got sent to, I had to go to--it was crazy.  I had to come to Chicago [Illinois] and then go back to Rock Island, 'cause I was living in Rock Island, go back to Rock Island and be inducted and then go back to Chicago to the center, you know, where you get your hair cut and you get your weight measurements and your height measurements, you know.
Story_ID: 623626
Speaker 1: And then I got sent to Fort Sheridan [Illinois], and I was lucky because they were, they got--you see in those days, if you had a high school education, that was equivalent to a college education nowadays, I mean, then.  So this fellow asked me about, he interviewed me and he asked me about Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and I said, "You want me to go to that segregated school, and I'm not interested."  So he said okay.  Well they assigned me to be a graveyard--not a graveyard, a, I don't know, a grave thing came, grave registration came first or the, I think, I think the port battalion came first.  That was the roughest thing in the [U.S.] Army, you know, you--
Speaker 2: Loading and unloading ships?
Speaker 1: That's right, trucks, ships, whatever.
Speaker 2: And where was that at?
Speaker 1: That was at Fort Sheridan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it just so happened that a guy named Albert Retis [ph.] who I had been at Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] with, when we were friends, happened to be the sergeant on, on, in charge of, you know, a little space where they had, had us folks.  And every time a shipment would come up, he would let me know, so I'd go AWOL [Absent Without Official Leave] for a day while that shipment went out.  So I skipped the grave registration and I missed port battalion and I missed several of them.  And finally the authorities got smart, they figured out what was going on so I got shipped out without knowing I was going to be shipped out.  Shipped to Owensburg--Owen- Owensboro, Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Kentucky, yeah.
Speaker 1: Owensboro, Kentucky, and you hang out underneath the, they had this thing on stilts, the barracks were on stilts, and you hang out underneath there, at least I did anyway.  And they would teach you about the gas mask and the--this and that and the other.  And old stupid me, I didn't pay any attention.  So then we had to go through this stuff, they got through teaching this, teaching you this, you had to go through, you know, (laughter) a gas thing and I almost, I didn't know what the heck I was doing, I didn't know how to do it 'cause I hadn't paid attention.  I guess that's a habit I have, not paying attention, so I survived that.
Speaker 2: Now what fort was there?  Do you remember the name of the fort?
Speaker 1: I guess, I don't know about the fort, but that was, it was 3249, 3249 quartermaster corps [3249 Quartermaster Service Company].  What, I don't think we--I don't know if we had a name
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --other than that, you know, that was the company, the battalion or whatever.
Story_ID: 623627
Speaker 1: So did you stay in the quartermasters [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps] for the rest of your term in the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: And when did you get out?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I was in twenty-four months, I must have gotten out in '45 [1945], I'm not sure.  It might have been '45 [1945].  I think, I'm inclined to believe it was probably '45 [1945] 'cause I think I went in in December '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: So was the war [World War II, WWII] over when you got out?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was still going on?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think they dropped, they, see what they did, was the war on the Eastern Front (laughter) was over, 'cause they dropped a bomb, I think, and there was, they, they re- they sent us back on rotation.  I say, send us by, they called me back on rotation, 3249 [3249 Quartermaster Service Company], and was supposed to be on rotation for a month, you know, leave for a month, and then report back and they were going to ship us to the Philippines, the (unclear), I think, I think it was the Philippines, one of those islands anyway.  And I had, when I came back on this rotation thing to hook up with my dear wife [Mildred Warren (ph.)], who I thought was my wife, her greeting was, "Didn't you find anybody you could fall in love with?"  (Laughter) And I said, "No."  Said, "Well I have," is what she said.  So, that impacted me, needle- needless to say, so they were living at 6556 South Champlain [Champlain Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] in the back of a store.  And I think, I was not a drinking person but I went down to 63rd [Street] and Champlain, there was a, I think there was a lounge there, to have what you call--a tavern, and I guess I got drunk 'cause in those days the "L" track [elevated train], we had "L" tracks up, you know, ran on 63rd, and a train was coming and the noise of that train set off war experiences, and I crawled on my hand and knees from 63rd and Champlain all the way to 6556 South Champlain.
Story_ID: 623628
Speaker 1: Now were you ever in a combat unit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had that in Belgium, Tamines, Belgium.
Speaker 1: So you did go overseas through the European front (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah I went overseas right away (laughter).  I think, I think I went overseas in July, was it, maybe before then.
Speaker 1: And you were still in the quartermasters [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  The thing got kind of tough, that's when they had that breakthrough, and these Germans were, they were, they held a line, there were some tough boys.
Speaker 1: That was the Battle of the Bulge?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They had, they had, you know, they killed the G.I.s and they get their uniforms and they were dressed as G.I.s, we didn't know what they were and Brother Patton [George S. Patton] was doing his thing, a helluva guy.
Speaker 1: So you were in Patton's unit?
Speaker 2: No, I, I turned that one down (laughter).  Some of the fellows did go, did join.  They sent a call out, I guess you call it a call, they gave you an opportunity, okay, to join Patton's army.  It was the Third Army [U.S. Third Army; U.S. Army Central], whatever.  Patton and Montgomery [Bernard Montgomery], the, those two tough boys.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were kind of rivals at that time.
Speaker 2: They're tough boys.  They were tough, and they were rivals, that's right.
Speaker 1: So when did you come back from Europe?  Forty-four [1944], '45 [1945]?
Speaker 2: I guess, I came, when they sent (unclear), after we finished the stuff in, I didn't think about any of this (laughter), after we finished the stuff in Belgium, how did that work?  I guess what, what, what--those of us that were left were sent back on this rotation thing.
Speaker 1: So you were in England prior to D-Day?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.  We landed in, we landed in Le Havre [France], I think, I think we landed in Le Havre, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then from there your unit went through Belgium?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were in Belgium, well we, we went through France and we went through England and I have to take my hat off to the fellows that drove those trucks because in England they had narrow, narrow roads, and at night they'd have those 6x6s, the trucks, and they would drive down that highway with no lights on narrow roads.  I think I got the spirit sometime in Belgium, I did, yeah.  Other than that, I was kind of opposed to being in the [U.S.] Army.  I said, why in the world I--you know, I'm making the effort here, five hundred barrels a day and why would they take me away from that and send me, you know, to doing nothing.  I didn't realize what it was all about.
Story_ID: 623629
Speaker 1: We were just talking about, you know, your experience after the war [World War II, WWII].  You came back, this is when you got into a divorce with your wife [Mildred Warren (ph.)].  Did you only have one son at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you got divorced.  What was that about?  What--you were getting ready to tell us a story about the divorce.
Speaker 2: Well the divorce courts closed in the summertime and you could go out to--well outside of Cook County [Illinois] and get a divorce.  And my dear wife and her attorney were all geared up to go in divorce court when the courts reopened, but we went into court before the courts reopened--while they were, you know, out of service.  We went in and got, we went to one of the places where you could get a divorce while the court, you know, the courts were still having divorces.  And we got our divorce, so when the courts opened again, and they went in to see about (laughter) getting a divorce, they found out that already, she had already been divorced.  Incidentally, that reminds me, my daughter, Adele [ph.], yeah she had this child, daughter, Adele, and my mother [Bella Warren Clayter] was very fond of Adele.  Yeah, and so I had two chil- two children at that time, Dickie [Richard Clayter III] and Adele, and we arranged it so that my mother would have custody of Adele and I'd have custody of Dickie.  That was interesting.  But we got the divorce, had the divorce rather.  She always seemed to be opposed to my becoming a lawyer because, you know, in those days she thought she could hang some crime on me (laughter) and that would prevent me from meeting a moral qualification that they said you needed in order to be a lawyer.
Story_ID: 623630
Speaker 1: Now when you came back from the war [World War II, WWII], you went to school, where was that and--?
Speaker 2: DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And this what, 1945 and '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Well I was there four years, I graduated in '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: That's before 1946 you would have started?
Speaker 2: Yeah, four years and graduated in '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Now were you able to take advantage of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in order to fund your college?
Speaker 2: I believe you got $125 a month.
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like a lot today, does it?
Speaker 2: No, it's not (laughter).  It wasn't a lot then, as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: And what was your, what did you study?
Speaker 2: I think I got an A.B. in sociology.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular professors at DePaul that kind of influenced you at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We had mostly priests and there was one priest, Father Ginsburg [ph.], a Jewish guy became, became a priest, one of my favorite people.  Albert Vale [ph.], one of my favorite people.  You see, I wanted to, I wanted to do two years undergrad and then go another, go to law school and Vale encouraged me to complete, you know, the full four years.  Get that, they wanted to get that degree, then you don't have to worry about, you got your college degree whereas if you do two years, you don't really have anything, you know.  I think he's probably right.  Father Jaydos [ph.], my favorite character.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: International law.
Speaker 1: This is still at DePaul?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can tell you the stories about that, but anyway.
Speaker 1: What was the racial makeup of DePaul at that time?
Speaker 2: It seemed like it was mixed.  I think it was probably mixed, whatever that means (laughter).
Speaker 1: But there were some other blacks students there at DePaul?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 623631
Speaker 1: Now you graduated from DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois] in 1950 with a degree in sociology.  What did you think you were going to do with that?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), I didn't have much choice.  I had some kind of scholarship from the State of Illinois, and I had an agreement to work as a social worker, I forgotten for how many--I've forgotten the nature of the agreement but I know I had to do that, had that obligation.  So it wasn't a question of what I was going to do, they needed men 'cause, you know, for so called incorrigible youth, boys particularly, at St. Charles [Illinois School for Boys, St. Charles, Illinois], and I had agreed to do that.  I was trying, what, what did they do, I've forgotten now, what the state did but I know I had that commitment.
Speaker 1: And so did you actually do social work when you, after you graduated?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: For how long?
Speaker 2: 'Til '56 [1956], '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: And did you als- always work in the youth program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I did.  Wait a minute, let me get this date right.  It wasn't, couldn't have been '56 [1956], or was it?  (Unclear) I went to law school [Loyola University Chicago School of Law, Chicago, Illinois] in '56 [1956], didn't I?
Speaker 1: Well, 1950, you went to Loyola [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] for your master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went--was it '50 [1950]?  Yeah I guess it was, yeah.  I worked on my master's at Loyola, right, and I left Loyola and went to law school.
Speaker 1: So you were at Loyola for two years?
Speaker 2: I don't know how long I was there.  I did, I know I did everything but the thesis, it must have been '52 [1952].  It seems like these dates get screwed up.  Fifty-six [1956], I graduated in '56 [1956] I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you've been there, done there in '52 [1952] before you started law school (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 623632
Speaker 1: Now you had a second marriage?  That was in about 1950?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that was '50 [1950], Mary Lou, I believe it was '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: How did you--who was your, who did you marry at that time?
Speaker 2: Well wait a minute.  I met Mary Lou when we were at, we were both at DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois] and I guess we got married in '52 [1952], damn.
Speaker 1: What was her full name?
Speaker 2: Mary Lou Gullatt, G-U-L-L-A-T-T [Mary Lou Gullatt Clayter].
Speaker 1: And you were both students at DePaul together?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you recall where she was from?
Speaker 2: You mean where she was born?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I think here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 623633
Speaker 1: In '52 [1952] you started law school?
Speaker 2: Yeah that sounds about right, um-hm, I think so.
Speaker 1: And this was also at Loyola [Loyola University Chicago School of Law, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: At Loyola, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have any problems trying to get into law school?
Speaker 2: No.  I saw Dean John C. Fitzgerald, who I had, I guess because of my DePaul [DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois] degree and the fact that I worked on my master's [at Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I didn't even have to do the LSAT.  I went in to see him, Mary Lou [Mary Lou Gullatt Clayter] had--my wife at that point, we were married, obviously, at her urging I went in to see Fitzgerald.  First I applied to DePaul [DePaul University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois], that's what it was and he wouldn't accept me.  I've forgotten that guy but I think his name was Ward [Daniel P. Ward], yeah, he might have been the dean.  So then I applied to Loyola, Dean Fitzgerald, looked at me with his Irish brogue, I went in to go see the assistant dean and he signed me up and we had a class of forty-four, I was the only brother, Negro, whatever, in that class.  Was there a year when these four gals approached me and assured me that I did not belong, I did not belong there, where I belonged I don't know, but I did not belong there.  And I remember telling them that, well, look, there's one of me now and they'll be one of me--referred to, you know, color--there'll be one of me when this class is over.  And we finished the first year, they, they dropped out after the first year and we graduated out of a class of forty-four, we graduated with ten, I believe, nine or ten, I think it might have been ten, and I was, like I said, the first, the only one there that would start and the only one there to begin, to end.
Story_ID: 623634
Speaker 1: Now did you have any children when you graduated from law school [Loyola University Chicago School of Law, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Name your children in, in their birth order.
Speaker 2: Of course the first child would be, Richard Jr. [sic. Richard Clayter III], I think he was born December of '43 [1943], I believe, and next child would be Adele [ph.], yeah.  You say while I was in law school?
Speaker 1: Well your children for that matter.
Speaker 2: Let's see, we got Adele--
Speaker 1: And that's by your first wife [Mildred Warren (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: Adele and Dickie by the first wife, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year was Adele born?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What year was Adele born?
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Well what is the age difference between Adele and Richard?
Speaker 2: Well Adele was born, I believe, let's see, there's a connection there.  When did they drop the atomic bomb?  Was that in, in--
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945]?
Speaker 1: August of '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: She must have been born sometime shortly after that, around that time, I would think, yeah.  And, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your next child would have been?
Speaker 2: Well I had the two, Ariana [Ariana Clayter] and Da- and David [David Clayter].
Speaker 1: And when were they born?
Speaker 2: Try '66 [1966] (laughter).
Speaker 1: For Ariana?
Speaker 2: Ariana, yeah, Ariana, David, they're both born the same year, as a matter of fact, both '66 [1966], yeah.
Story_ID: 623635
Speaker 1: Now you just graduated from law school [Loyola University Chicago School of Law, Chicago, Illinois], what was your first job?
Speaker 2: My first job was, the firm was Starke and Anglin [Chicago, Illinois], I believe.  There--I was a social worker at the time and I was offered a job, I think, two hundred dollars a month, Golden State insurance company [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company] and had a falling out with my supervisor so I quit that job, and I went in this law firm practicing with Starke and Anglin.  I was not an employee, you know, I was on my own.
Speaker 1: So you just used their offices as your office?
Speaker 2: Well, there was, was a lawyer there; I shared expenses.  They gave me a lower rate.  I was, there was--Mary Lou's [Clayter's second wife, Mary Lou Gullatt Clayter] cousin, Adolphus Rivers [D. Adolphus Rivers], was there, as was Thaddeus Rowe [Thaddeus B. Rowe] and so forth.  Yeah, so I was sharing expenses and they wised--every time I got a case, I got a, seventy-five dollars was a big fee.  If I got seventy-five dollars, they got twenty-five and, yeah.  I never had a job as a lawyer, I just practiced law, you know, representing people, representing companies, representing--as they used to say, rabble rousing.
Speaker 1: How did you get your clients?
Speaker 2: I got my clients by hanging out in taverns at night, even though I didn't drink, and I had a couple of people and I got, I guess as a result of my being a social worker, their friends, you know.  But mostly I would hang out at these taverns at night, you know.
Speaker 1: So were you doing mostly criminal cases, or criminal and civil?
Speaker 2: Well I did criminal cases, I didn't have an awful lot, then divorce case, I did--I had near enough to do an appellate case.  I did my first case, criminal case, second case, I think was, let's see (unclear), I did, called myself doing a divorce.  I did a case involving a fight over a water cooler (laughter), it was an icemaker, is one of the, this in the years when they, before they really got popular, they finally came out with the idea of ice cubes.  I think so, Harrison versus Crockett [Crockett v. Harrison, 1960] about the ice cooler, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So there was some kind of damage action?
Speaker 2: It was a civil suit.  They were trying, (laughter) they, they had loaned him, they had loaned Crockett [Elzie Crockett] some money.  Crockett wasn't too bright.  They loaned (unclear) some money and he got, he borrowed some money from a guy named Harrison [Tommy Harrison].  I think money came from Harrison to Crockett and then this credit, by the way, they were trying to take the icemaker and I think they, I think they filed suit on behalf of Harrison, against Crockett, they're trying to use Harrison to get to the icemaker from Crockett.
Speaker 1: And you were representing Crockett?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was my man.  He was a ju- jukebox operator so that's how I met him, you know, in the various joints, so to speak, and I had some cases, I don't know how I got 'em.  (Pause) Oh lord, lord, the fights that I had to fight.
Story_ID: 623636
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other black attorneys around this time when you first started?  Was Partee [Cecil A. Partee] and Frost and all those people, were they practicing then?
Speaker 2: Frost and I were, Frost and I started out together.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Wilson Frost?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wilson Frost, we started out together.  Pincham was my favorite, I guess, Eugene Pincham [HistoryMaker R. Eugene Pincham].  I'm surprised you guys don't have him.
Speaker 1: We do.
Speaker 2: You do?  Okay.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Earl Neal?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Earl Neal?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Earl, I didn't know too well, I got to know him later in connection with the, Earl was the appraiser guy, he worked with this, with this guy appraising properties and acquiring properties, you know.  I was trying to think of--oh god, so many guys: Peterson [William E. Peterson]; Harris [James L. Harris]; my guy was Spurlock, Raul E. Spurlock [ph.].
Speaker 1: How about Oscar De Priest [Oscar Stanton De Priest]?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Oscar De Priest?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew, I knew Oscar De Priest.  We had a, how did we work together?  You see, we were in the civil rights stuff a lot, and De Priest, and something I, some connection I had with him, I can't remember right now.
Speaker 1: How about Cornell Davis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my guy.  Well, he was a friend of Frank, Frank, Frank Anglin [Frank Anglin, Jr.].  He met him through Marshall Bynum, Jackson Funeral [Charles S. Jackson Funeral Home, Chicago, Illinois], that's how I got hooked up with this cem- cemetery stuff.  They figured I was, I didn't have much to do (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now Cornell was a, a politician?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a state legislator, and he was on some key committee and that committee provided us a leverage to break down the segregation at Oak Woods [Oak Woods Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois].  Let's see, the Oak Woods, interesting.  You go out there now you see it.  They have Confederate soldiers buried there but we couldn't, they wouldn't bury us.  All we had was Lincoln [Lincoln Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois] and Burr Oak [Burr Oak Cemetery, Alsip, Illinois] as I remember correctly, and this, what was that guy's name?  Damn.  You know the guy that had the thing and went to Israel, I can't think of his name, he used to be with Easton Music [ph.], and he subsequently established this, I can't think, there was a group, a group of black Jews in Israel, and he did quite well.  In fact they got a restaurant out there on, darn, I can't think of that street.  You asked me about lawyers, I was getting off too far.
Speaker 1: That's all right.  So there was kind of a clique of black lawyers around this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, there were not that many of us.  Aaron Payne [Aaron H. Payne] was the name I was trying to think of.  Aaron was the first lawyer that got a ten thousand dollar fee in divorce court, and he got that for this doctor friend of mine whose wife is in an institution and I think some money exchanged hands (laughter), which often happened in those days, by the way.
Story_ID: 623637
Speaker 1: Were you involved--or was the Cook County Bar Association active during this period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were and I got interested in Cook County Bar Association.  I remember going to a meeting, they had to meet in the lawyer's offices and this lawyer had forgotten to pay his phone bill, evidently, so his damn phone got cut off, which reminds me there was a--yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you ever an officer of the Cook County bar?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Story_ID: 623638
Speaker 1: Now tell us a little bit about the Oak Woods Cemetery case.  Now how did you say you got that?  That was from Bynum?
Speaker 2: Frank Anglin [Frank Anglin, Jr.], of Starke and Anglin [Chicago, Illinois], Frank Anglin was good friends with--see Starke [William C. Starke] was a criminal lawyer, Ang- Anglin was a civil lawyer and he was a good friend of Marshall Bynum, who was with Jackson Funeral Home [Charles S. Jackson Funeral Home, Chicago, Illinois].  (Unclear) Jackson there on Stony--not Stony Island, Cottage Grove [Avenue].  And Frank, in those days, his being a civil lawyer and I think he was also Commie, Communist, he was good friends with a guy who started a Mc- it was a kitchen, no not kitchen, a McDonald's, and Frank was working with him and for some reason Marshall, I guess, I guess, Cornell [Cornell Davis] had talked to Marshall, Marshall Bynum, about doing something about this thing, and the situation at Oak Wood [Oak Woods Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 623639
Speaker 1: We're going to get back to your, your experience with the Oak Woods Cemetery case.  Bynum and Anglin kind of brought that case to you.
Speaker 2: Marshall Bynum.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You see, Frank, Frank Anglin [Frank Anglin, Jr.] was, was a very busy man and I'm pretty sure he was tied up with this McDonald's [McDonald's Corporation] creator, so to speak.  What's that guy's name?  Ray (Unclear) or Kroc, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Kroc?  Ray Kroc?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think they were, he was involved with him 'cause they were, you know, in this criminal, in this (laughter), in this Communist thing.  That was before communism was a bad word, in those days.
Speaker 1: So Anglin represented Ray Kroc?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: They were, they were friends and I think they were friends through this Communist thing.  I think that was the association.  You see, Frank, Frank could pass for white, Cornell [Cornell Davis] could pass for white, of course Marshall couldn't (laughter), wouldn't if he could.  I was trying to think of some of the lawyers.  There were not that many, I should remember all the guys, Levi Morris, [HistoryMaker] Earl Neal, Harris [James L. Harris].  You know it's interesting, most of these guys became judges, and I had that opportunity and I was stupid, I turned it down.  I'm always turning down opportunities, what's wrong with me.
Story_ID: 623640
Speaker 1: Well tell us a little about, what were the kind of the facts for the Oak Wood Cemetery case?
Speaker 2: The facts were, it seems to me that I recall, that Cornell [Cornell Davis] had had an eye on these guys and they'd been discriminating forever, and he went there, Cornell, when they sent Cornell--they had a body they wanted to cremate, they sent Cornell there and he approached the people about this cremation, and I think they scheduled the cremation, but Corneal they thought was white.  They scheduled the, the cremation, and when the folk got there to do the cremation, they saw they were colored and no way Jose, can't do that, you know, we don't allow, we don't--I've forgotten the exact word, we don't bury Negroes in this cemetery [Oak Woods Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois].  And they said well, don't have a Negro, I've got a non--how did they have that?  They thought he had a, in other words, they, they were under the impression that he had a white person, that he was white, and he had a white person he wanted to cremate.  They said, "We don't bury 'em, we don't create 'em, we don't cremate them, you have to go somewhere else."  Lincoln [Lincoln Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois], I think Lincoln or Burr Oak [Burr Oak Cemetery, Alsip, Illinois] were the two black cemeteries, so to speak, and I think Cornell, he evidently prepared for this 'cause I distinctly remember he had some pennies, he had a jar of pennies that he saved to use for the fee, and once they found out that he was in charge of this committee and the committee had, I don't know, ways and means, is just what it was, committee had some power to cut off some funds, they had to rethink the thing.  But in the meantime, I'll never forget this experience.  These lawyers had a deposition scheduled--
Speaker 1: These were lawyers for the cemetery?
Speaker 2: Cemetery, they were on the top floor of this building, lavish office, I mean--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the firm?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I don't, and we had a deposition, when they saw me there, they, they evidently didn't realize what was going on.  I guess they realized a lawsuit, but they were shocked when they, when I, they saw me there, you know, and we worked things out and they finally gave in.  I've forgotten what happened.  'Cause they didn't, the case didn't get much publicity.
Speaker 1: Did it ever go to trial?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or was it a settlement?
Speaker 2: There's a lawsuit filed, come to think of it, it was a settlement, not a trial, I don't think there was a trial.  I don't remember there being a trial.
Speaker 1: What was the settlement agreement?
Speaker 2: That they would open the facilities to, people no matter what--I don't think they went so far as to say no matter what the ethic, ethnic configuration was.  They definitely agreed to handle Negroes (laughter).  And stuff, I can't remember.  I didn't, I didn't figure, I was talking to my daughter [Ariana Clayter], I didn't figure why, I wondered why we didn't get more publicity about the thing.  It seemed like it was just kind of kept undercover.  They didn't blast out, say you know, "Well now we're open to Negro applicants and Negro cadav- cadavers," or whatever.
Speaker 1: They kind of wanted to keep it quiet even though they had settled.
Speaker 2: They did, they kept it quiet.  There's no television, no radio, no--I don't recall any newspapers, kind of hush-hush.
Story_ID: 623641
Speaker 1: And what kind of things did you work on after that?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  (Pause) Divorces, I did a lot of criminal stuff and I got civil stuff, I got in my divorces, divorces, divorces, divorces.  I had a lot of civil, you know, stuff where people would have, we would have a, we'd be protesting something and I'd get involved in that.  I got involved in a lot of civil stuff as well as--I kind of got disgusted with criminal stuff because it seemed like every time something came up that would benefit the accused, they'd (laughter), they'd go to the legislature or somebody and, and change the, and get a different thing there, you know, impact it so that the law, that they closed that loophole.  There's just too damn many loopholes in criminal law, it's frustrating, very frustrating.
Story_ID: 623642
Speaker 1: What was the judicial system like in Cook County [Illinois] in the mid-'50s [1950s]?  Were there any black judges?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had two.  We had Ferguson [Henry C. Ferguson], and we had Duke Slater and Duke Slater--Ferguson is what they call a police court judge.  I think he sat at the police stations, like they had the station on Wabash [Avenue], forty--was it 48th [Street] and Wabash?  He wasn't, he wasn't a regular judge.  Now Duke Slater, I think, got appointed as a regular judge and Duke was not too bright.  In fact they claimed he played football at Iowa State [sic. University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa] without a helmet, whatever that meant, but he was--.  And I think those were the only--oh, oh, oh, yeah, we did have, this guy was worse than any white judge you could appear before.  What was his name?  I think we had those three people.
Speaker 1: What was Ferguson's first name?
Speaker 2: Ferguson, was it Henry?  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: You don't recall the name of the third judge?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: You don't recall the name of the third judge?
Speaker 2: No, I guess I buried, I buried him in the unconscious.  He was something else, man.
Speaker 1: Now was Slater and this judge, were they sitting at Cook County [Circuit Court of Cook County]?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Or Chicago--
Speaker 2: Ferguson, as I indicated was, I think what you might call a police court judge.  If I'm not mistaken, he sat at the police station and that's where they handled cases there.
Speaker 1: And where was Slater?
Speaker 2: That was--Slater was, he sat like a regular judge.
Speaker 1: Was that the Cook County or Chicago municipal?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I don't think--he might have been, he might have been city.  All I know--no, he, no, he was on the regular circuit because I had a, I had a case against, I appealed his decision and the case was a guy named, I think Isaac Dupree [ph.].  So, he was, he was handling regular criminal cases.  Yeah.  But asking what the judges were like, I remember trying a case before a judge and I thought things were going real well, and they were, and you got a telephone call, and we came back, the difference was night and day.  I can't say that the man did anything in his chambers, but it seemed strange that there was such a change to the other side all of a sudden, you know.
Story_ID: 623643
Speaker 1: So, was the court system, did, did you feel at that time that black attorneys were not getting due respect in the court system?
Speaker 2: Oh, they weren't, we weren't.  We had to fight, fight, fight and it didn't do you much good 'cause the odds were against you, and you, obviously, were confined to representing people of your own color, your own race.  I think I did have two cases, maybe three cases, where I represented white folks.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was the Chicago municipal court and the Cook County court [Circuit Court of Cook County], were they both pretty hard for black lawyers or was one a little bit more receptive?
Speaker 2: Could you repeat that?
Speaker 1: Between the Cook County court system and the Chicago municipal court system--
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: --were, was either one of those a little bit more receptive to black attorneys during that period?  This is like the mid-'50s [1950s] or late '50s [1950s]?  Or you get treated the same in both, both of those courts?
Speaker 2: I think you caught hell in either one.  You know, they were very, they wouldn't do you any favors.  And we had a few judges, I mean a few white judges that were nice, but I don't know that there was that much difference between the court system that--I think we dealt mostly with municipal courts, I'm trying to think.  No, we didn't, we had divorce and criminal, we had regular stuff.
Story_ID: 623644
Speaker 1: Guess around 1959, you took some classes at Northwestern [Northwestern University School of Law; Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A short course in criminal law.  I, see, at one point I thought I wanted, I wanted to be a big criminal lawyer, ha, interesting.
Speaker 1: Was that like a one year course or?
Speaker 2: It was just a seminar, you might say a seminar thing, it wasn't a seminar, it was a course at Northwest- Northwestern, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: When did you leave Starke and Anglin [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I can't say.  I know I left them and then went with Crosson, Gassaway [Gassaway, Crosson, Turner and Parsons, Chicago, Illinois].  Yeah, we had Judge Campbell, Judge Parsons was a part of the operation although he had a setup--he couldn't practice law because I think he was an assistant U.S. attorney.  They should have J.B. Parsons, history maker for sure.  You guys have Parsons?
Speaker 1: I believe so.
Speaker 2: Oh, James Benton Parsons.
Speaker 1: And somebody named Turner?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Turner's interesting. We had two Turners, one, only one was a judge though.  What was Turner's name?  Turner was an interesting character.
Speaker 1: What is his first name?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  Was it Allan, wasn't--I don't think it was Allan, I should know because he came in the firm when I was at, with Crosson [James D. Crosson] and Campbell and Gassaway [Antonio M. Gassaway].  What was his name, was it Alvin Turner?  It may have been Alvin.
Speaker 1: Now were you a firm at this time or were you just sharing office space (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we shared, shared expenses.  Except (laughter), except it was interesting, in those days they had these black phones with a stand and every lawyer had his own phone, though they had the girls, the phone would ring and the girl has to get the lawyer to the phone, half the time she had a problem trying to figure out which phone was ringing.  It was awful.
Speaker 1: And were you still doing criminal cases then or had you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, had some criminal cases all through, as long as I, you know, as long as I could.
Speaker 1: Now how long did that group stay together?  When did you leave there?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Gassaway died, he was a great criminal lawyer, federal lawyer, I loved him.  Campbell went on the bench.  He used to work for the attorney general.
Speaker 1: What was Campbell's first name?
Speaker 2: Cal- I think it was Calvin [sic. William Joseph Campbell].  I'm not sure, but I think it was Calvin.  He's still around.  And let's see.  Crosson and I moved, Crosson--no, Crosson, Campbell and I moved to I think 159 North Dearborn [Street].  We moved, I finally convinced them to move out of, out of the hoods.
Speaker 1: Now where was that office at?  The one that were, now you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was six--at the, I believe it was 68 Garfield [Boulevard], that's when we moved to 159 downtown, and I think by that point, Gassaway had died and I think Parsons was on the bench and I don't think Turner--I don't know if Turner ever moved with us.  I don't know if he died or what.
Speaker 1: Now you said 159, where?  What street was that on downtown?
Speaker 2: Nine--159 North Dearborn.
Story_ID: 623645
Speaker 1: Were there any other black lawyers working downtown then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause when I first started, I started out with, with Frost, Clayter and Sherard [Frost, Clayter, Sherard and Howse, Chicago, Illinois].  Most of the lawyers downtown were at this place 180 West Washington [Street], I think it was, and you couldn't get, you know, you couldn't get a, they wouldn't rent anything, rent anything to you in the other buildings.  How did we break that down?  I've forgotten how we broke it down.  I know Frost [HistoryMaker Wilson Frost] and I were, we were 134 North LaSalle [Street].  At that time, obviously, yeah, I've forgotten how, how it broke down, but they, they finally, somebody got in somewhere and raised, raised a big fuss about it and we got started opening up.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year it was that you moved out with--
Speaker 2: Frost (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Crosson [James D. Crosson], with Crosson and Campbell [William Joseph Campbell]?  What year that you guys moved downtown?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  I know it ended up with just the three of us in the office, Crosson, Campbell and myself.  Everybody else, I don't think we had any other lawyers there.
Speaker 1: When did you hook up with Frost?
Speaker 2: Frost and I hooked up way back when.  Let's see, we were working for the State of Illinois--
Speaker 1: So this would have been later, after you guys moved downtown, your first group moved downtown?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  When did we move together?  We were only in that one on 134 North LaSalle, I don't know the date, I know, I know we first started out together and then I left there to go with Rivers, yeah, Lockhart, Clarence, Clayter, Smith [Rivers, Lockhart, Clayter and Lawrence, Chicago, Illinois], we moved to 29 South LaSalle, I think it was 29 South LaSalle.  I don't remember the year.
Speaker 1: And your next association was with Rivers, Clayter, Lawrence and Smith [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Again, this was office sharing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the office, never on salary, no, there was no salary, you know.  You try to get the money together to pay the rent and phone bills, secretary.
Story_ID: 623646
Speaker 1: Were there any black law firms that were actually firms in Chicago [Illinois] at this time?  Was there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you had, you had Neal [HistoryMaker Earl Neal], other than that, I don't think we had, and I don't think they were black, you know--now I don't know, they might have been, but you had some pretty heavy hitters there 'cause you had Neal, Leighton [HistoryMaker George N. Leighton], who else did they have in that office?
Speaker 1: And Leighton later became a federal judge?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was his first name, George?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was his first name?
Speaker 2: Was it George?
Speaker 1: George.
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was Pincham [HistoryMaker R. Eugene Pincham] or Montgomery [HistoryMaker James D. Montgomery] around then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they were around.  Pincham was around before I started practicing.  I was still working at, for the City of Chicago, in boys court [Illinois School for Boys, St. Charles, Illinois], when he was there (unclear).  He and Aaron Payne [Aaron H. Payne], I think, were partners together.  I can't remember.  Leighton, I think, got fame because some guy, some cop stopped him, they wanted to do something, search his car or search him and he objected and they I think he made a lot of changes then.  I can't think, it seemed like there was another partner with Earl and them and I can't think, I don't know, it almost came to me, a tax person, who was it?  I can't remember, it escapes me, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Story_ID: 623647
Speaker 1: How long did Rivers, Clayter, Lawrence and Smith [ph.] stay together?
Speaker 2: 'Til Rivers went on the bench.
Speaker 1: What is his first name?
Speaker 2: D. Adolphus Rivers, that's Mary Lou's [Mary Lou Gullatt Clayter], my wife's cousin.  And when did he go on the bench?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was on there long enough to retire, I know that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and after that group, you were with Frost, Clayter and Sherard [Frost, Clayter, Sherard and Howse]?
Speaker 2: No, no, that--my first foray into the Loop [Chicago, Illinois] was with Frost, Clayter and Sherard, that was the first group, I think.
Speaker 1: Was that before Starke and Anglin [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, that was, no, I stand corrected.  No, Starke and Anglin, see, when I left Starke and Anglin, I went to 68 Garfield [Boulevard] with Crosson, Gassaway and Campbell [Gassaway, Crosson, Turner and Parsons, Chicago, Illinois], pretty sure.  That's when I left Frost, Clayter and Sherard.  And then from there, where did we go and I'm probably, some of these forgetful people but I moved a lot.
Speaker 1: So from Crosson you went to Rivers, Lockhart [Rivers, Lockhart, Clayter and Lawrence, Chicago, Illinois]--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Crosson [James D. Crosson] went on the bench, Calvin [sic. William Joseph Campbell] was complaining because of, he had to pay this--his portion of the office expense I think it was seventy-five dollars, he complained and cried about paying that.  So I think it ended up just Crosson and I, and Crosson went on the bench, so it was just I (laughter).
Story_ID: 623648
Speaker 1: During this period, like so when you were, you were kind of explaining that Frost, Clayter and Sherard [Frost, Clayter, Sherard and Howse, Chicago, Illinois], now that, was that before Rivers, Clayter, Lawrence and Smith [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, do you remember what, approximately what year that was and about?  I mean, how, were you and Frost [HistoryMaker Wilson Frost] contemporaries in terms of age?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think we were, are or whatever, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So about how old were you when you guys got together?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see.  I got out of law school [Loyola University Chicago School of Law, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: And you're about, what thirty-six, thirty-seven?
Speaker 2: Well let me see.  My date of birth is July the 28th, 1922.  Okay, satisfies anybody who's worried about my age, and I was born in '22 [1922]--
Speaker 1: So in '56 [1956] you would have been what, fifty-four?
Speaker 2: I don't think I was that old, was I?  Twenty-two [1922] from '56 [1956]--
Speaker 1: That sounds about right.
Speaker 2: Forty-four [sic.].
Speaker 1: Forty-four?
Speaker 2: In my early, early forties.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're through to Frost, Clayter and Sherard and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well see we, we got, we got together while we were working together as parole agents at State of Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, when was that?  We think we kind of, we missed that when you were a parole, when you were a parole agent?
Speaker 2: This is, goes back to the social work and the, trying to--see, I was trying to remember when I was obligated to work for the State of Illinois as a social worker, and I guess that must have been before I--see I got a, when I left the state of--I know, when I left it's because it's--.  Frost and I got together, we were both parole agents for the State of Illinois, and I had this thing where I had to commit so many years.  It was after that, then I went into the School of Social Work [Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  But getting back to Frost, Clayter and Sherard, and you can throw Brother Stroger [HistoryMaker John H. Stroger, Jr.] in there because we were all sort of palling together.
Story_ID: 623649
Speaker 1: So this would be even before you went to law school [Loyola University Chicago School of Law, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  We were at, we were out of law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can remember where we were standing, in front of city hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois] talking with, talking with Brother Stroger [HistoryMaker John H. Stroger, Jr.], and he was taking the bar exam.  We had, so we had taken the bar exam, we were lawyers 'cause he was asking us, he was having some problems with (laughter), with the L- LSAT and he wanted us to help him and I remember saying, "Man, you're stupid enough, you don't know that, you don't deserve to be a lawyer," and that's, you know, what got into me.
Speaker 1: So you and Frost [HistoryMaker Wilson Frost] were lawyers and Stroger was--
Speaker 2: We were lawyers, we were talking with Stroger out in front of city hall--
Speaker 1: You're talking about John Stroger?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a helluva nice guy.  Yeah, John, we miss you (laughter).  Oh, lord.  What was the question?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I was trying to get some sense of when you and Frost were law (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What year, what year?  Or what?
Speaker 1: That you were in the same, you were working together?  You had, you had gone all the way back to when you were doing social work so you, I assume you guys remained friends even after law school and then you, at one point, you hooked up together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went to 134 North LaSalle [Street] together, that's where we, where we established our office, 134 North LaSalle, the Metropolitan Building [Chicago, Illinois], owned by Will--or somebody, the guy who had the, I guess he owned the Chicago Blackhawks, Wirtz [Bill Wirtz] or somebody (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wirtz?  Wirtz?
Speaker 2: I think his name was Wir- Wirtz, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay, after you and Frost, how long did that association last in terms of working together?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Was it several years or?
Speaker 2: I think so, I'm not sure.  I don't think it was that long, I really don't.
Story_ID: 623650
Speaker 1: After you're working with Frost [HistoryMaker Wilson Frost], Timothy Tyler and Associates [ph.], was that the next group you worked with?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I was with Frost, Clayter and Sherard [Frost, Clayter, Sherard and Howse, Chicago, Illinois], there together for a while, and left there and I went to Rivers, Lockhart, Clayter, Lawrence and Smith [sic. Rivers, Lockhart, Clayter and Lawrence, Chicago, Illinois].  Okay.  I think Lockhart [HistoryMaker James B. Lockhart] got a job with (Unclear), (Unclear) in other words.  And Lawrence died, I think it was, Rivers, Clayter, Lawrence and Smith [ph.], what happened to Smith [ph.]?  I guess he died as well.  I was left with Rivers, Clayter--then where did I go after that?  I guess Rivers must have gone on the bench around that time.
Speaker 1: What was Rivers' first name?
Speaker 2: D. Adolphus Rivers, D.A.R.  Oh, Jesus Christ.
Speaker 1: When were you with Timothy Tyler and Associates?  Was that after Rivers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was long after.  Rivers, then it had Woods, Tucker [Robert L. Tucker]--Tucker and Watson [Tucker, Watson, Butler and Todd, Chicago, Illinois].  Oh but there's a time when--Bill Woods [ph.], yeah, I think that came next, I'm not sure.  There was a time when I was with--but how does Crosson and them [Gassaway, Crosson, Turner and Parsons, Chicago, Illinois] fit in?  I'm still trying to think.  Frost and I were the first ones and left there and went to Rivers, but at some point I was in the office with Crosson [James D. Crosson], yeah, then Crosson went on the bench.
Speaker 1: Now at one point you were at Clayter, Wood and Rhinehart [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rhinehart [Vernon Morel Rhinehart] made his decease, Wood went on the bench, so that's--judge.
Story_ID: 623651
Speaker 1: Now back in, during this period, how did a black attorney get, get to the bench?  You said you had an opportunity at one time, how were black attorneys moved to, into the judicial system as judges?  Was there a process or procedure that allowed them to do that?
Speaker 2: There was a process and a procedure.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Did they have to have like, say, a sponsor?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, aldermen, was the committeemen.
Speaker 1: Oh the aldermen could help them get to a judgeship?
Speaker 2: They, well you start out by, you start out--how can I put that?  Well, you were, you were appointed, let's put it that way and--
Speaker 1: Now was the appointment made by the mayor, the governor?
Speaker 2: It was a committee.
Speaker 1: Okay, committee of aldermen?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, committeemen, the aldermen, the, the, you had an alderman and also you had, in connection with that alderman, you had a committee- committeeman who handled the patronage.
Speaker 1: Was this during the Daley administration?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So is this like the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: I'll just, I'll just go back to Daley [Richard J. Daley] and his cab company and so forth.  You see the alderman would have his committeemen and if they got mad at him they'd take away the committeeman-ship which means he could be aldermen but he wouldn't have any patronage.  They did that with [HistoryMaker] Anna Langford, so forth.  What the hell was I talking about (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I was asking how, how black attorneys got to become judges.  You were saying that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --came through the committeemen and the aldermen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the committee that select the judges, you're appointed, you know, you start out and if you don't mess up after the first year or so, then you run for office and you, you know.  I don't know if any people ran well, Republicans, there's some Republican folks that ran for office and didn't make it, yeah, you know, judicial office didn't make it, but seldom, usually if you were a Democrat you won, you know, 'cause you know, you've got the precinct captains working for you.
Speaker 1: Right.  And this would have been in the '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Probably, yeah.
Story_ID: 623652
Speaker 1: After Clayter, Wood and Rhinehart [Chicago, Illinois], you're at Tucker and Watson [Tucker, Watson, Butler and Todd, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was this in the '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I'm not sure, it was in the '80s [1980s], it could have been the '80s [1980s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  Now, unless you've done, you've done some work with some elderly organizations?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you get involved in that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I just, they just started referring cases to me, I don't know why, how, to tell you the truth.  Just something I started end up doing.  I did a lot of work with organizations, you know, community organizations and we were fighting, us against them, you know, the civil rights people versus the (laughter) powerful people.  I don't know how I got started with them.  They surprised me with an award, sole practitioner of the year or something.
Speaker 1: You must have been pretty active with them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called me, give me clients and I would, and then they'd have lawyers call, you know, with questions and answers and stuff.
Story_ID: 623653
Speaker 1: The Original 40 Club, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I got into that--
Speaker 1: Tell us what it was.
Speaker 2: The Original 40 Club started out, I think, as a situation where they had forty, it was composed of mostly politicians I think to start with, and then lawyers and judges got in because it was a networking thing, and I've forgotten, it started quite some time ago, about forty--ninety some years ago.
Speaker 1: And when did you get involved?
Speaker 2: I got involved through Crosson [James D. Crosson], hm, (pause) I don't remember right now, it's been a long time, I know that.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people in there when you first joined?
Speaker 2: Okay, let me see.  There was Crosson, obviously; Wheeler--
Speaker 1: Who was Wheeler?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Wheeler was one of the first black Americans who was admitted to the bar, they, they didn't know he was black.  I think he was the first one admitted.  He and his parents, his father, somebody, is the first one admitted to the bar [sic. grandfather, Lloyd Garrison Wheeler, Sr.], first, you know, colored person, whatever.  Let's see who else was in there, that I can give you a list, there's so many people, so many folks died.
Speaker 1: Was Montgomery [HistoryMaker James D. Montgomery] or Leighton [HistoryMaker George N. Leighton] or Partee [Cecil A. Partee] or any of those people in it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Partee was very active.  Leighton was not in it.  I think Leighton felt he was above it.  Neal [HistoryMaker Earl Neal] was not in it.  You didn't ask me who wasn't in it, you asked me who was in it, didn't you?
Speaker 1: Well those are some of the names that kind of, you know, were kind of prominent during that period, wondering if they were part of it.  Should mention some doctors, who were some of the politicians?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Payne, Payne was in it.  Let's see, god, trying to think, Cunningham--
Speaker 1: Who was Cunningham?
Speaker 2: He's a doctor.
Speaker 1: His first name?
Speaker 2: William [William Cunningham (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Any politicians?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to think.  No, lots of politicians, doggone, I should know them offhand, yeah.  We had a lot of doctors in there too, come to think of it.  At one time they claimed we had too many lawyers and lawyers claimed they had too many doctors.
Speaker 1: Was Cornell Davis in it?
Speaker 2: No, not to my knowledge, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: How about Dawson [William L. Dawson]?
Speaker 2: Dawson was in it, yeah.  He's one of the founders, I think.  Dawson; Sidney Jones [Sidney Jones, Jr.]; we mentioned dear Brother Partee.  You didn't mention Aaron Payne [Aaron H. Payne], he was in it.
Speaker 1: How about Dugas [Lester J. Dugas, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Did you know the Dugas family?
Speaker 2: Dugas, no, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he was a doctor.
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) (gesture).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it all men?  Were any women in it?
Speaker 2: It was all men, yeah.  I brought up having women in it and they put me out--wanted to put me out of the club.  I explained to them that it was unlawful to bar women (laughter).  They didn't even want to bar, they didn't even want to allow white folks in.  I broke that barrier with my good friend, I had a hard time getting him in.
Speaker 1: That was James Weinstein?
Speaker 2: James Weinstein, yeah, my buddy.
Story_ID: 623654
Speaker 1: What was your association with him?
Speaker 2: Well, I was just friends, we were members of a group called the River Rats [ph.], which was a poker game, poker group, we did, composed of, all to--that, that happened when I was at Tucker and Watson [Tucker, Watson, Butler and Todd, Chicago, Illinois].  See Watson [John H. Watson] was a, he wasn't much of a lawyer; he was a gambler and he hung out with the boys (laughter).  And I got in through him, a bunch of Jewish fellows and that's how I met Jimmy [James Weinstein].  Jimmy was with In These Times paper, and he was a good friend of Maury Alexander [ph.].  Maury was the, I guess he was the fundraiser for Israel, he had something to do with the founding of Israel, I think, I think he did.  That's a long answer, but that's how I met Jimmy.  Jimmy's a nice guy.

Speaker 1: Do you want to talk about the Polaris case [Washington v. Clayter, 1980]?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Polaris Engineering [Polaris Engineering Company]?
Speaker 2: What did I do there?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good question.  You ask me about the Friendship medical clinic [Friendship Medical Center, Ltd v. Chicago Board of Health, 1973], I can probably tell you about that.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: Friendship medical clinic, Dr.--.  That's interesting.  (Pause) Polaris Engineering, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Washington [Robert A. Washington], he was named Washington, I think.  I remember the name and now I, now it comes back to me is involved with Washington.  I think those people filed a complaint against me, I'm not sure.  His mother was a real piece of, piece of work, in my opinion, of course.  It doesn't mean, it doesn't mean she was, she could have been an angel.  I'm trying to think of the doctor, Dr., Dr., Dr., Dr., what is his name.  I keep trying to think about this Friendship Medical Center--
Speaker 1: Was this a case you worked on or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had a--Dr. Howard, T.R.M. Howard, yeah, I guess his specialty was, yeah--
Speaker 1: What was the case about?
Speaker 2: It was a medical clinic [Friendship Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois], about abortions.  I guess he, called him a great abortion--he had a place out on 103rd [Street], beautiful place, but I think he'd do his abortion stuff.
Speaker 1: Was he black?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Dr. T.R.M. Howard, and I think, I think I'm getting off the ques- getting off the case, I believe he was--no, no, that's not the right guy.  I'm trying to think of the fellow that was in, was a doctor, it might have been T.R.M. Howard, though, 'cause in those days, Dawson [William L. Dawson] was a major politician, he was a strong man and running against him, just, you know, forget it, you ain't going to win, if they didn't win it legitimately, they'd steal it.  So, the story had it that they offered T.R.M. Howard twenty-five thousand dollars or something like that to run against Dawson.  They were trying to find somebody to run against Dawson and they approached T.R.M., he said, "Yeah, I'll do it," so they gave him the money and he went straight to the bank with it and didn't spend a penny, smart man.  I think he was the one was involved with the Friendship medical clinic.
Speaker 1: Now who was, who was giving him this money?  Was this the, the Democratic organization?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see in those days, what you would do, if you were smart, you would get on the ballot as an opponent to the major candidate and, of course, they would pay you to get off the ballot, so they'd end up unopposed on Election Day.  Well, you know, you knew you weren't going to win but they weren't taking any chances.  They had the money, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: But Dawson was kind of an independent?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Dawson was kind of independent?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, Dawson was the man.  He was the man.
Speaker 1: So why was the Democratic organization pinning up Howard against him?
Speaker 2: So he'd be running unopposed.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so Howard was kind of the--
Speaker 2: He's the talking horse, he knew he wasn't going to win.  They put up somebody, they couldn't find anybody to run against him.  Finally, T.R.M. said, "I'll do it."  I think it was T.R.M. Howard, and another guy that was a businessman, a great man, Fuller, that's who I'm trying to think of, S.B. Fuller [Samuel B. Fuller].  He was, I think he got some household products, he did, Fuller Products [Fuller Products Company, Chicago, Illinois] or something like that.  You might have heard the name.
Speaker 1: Fuller Brush Company?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Fuller Brush Company was not, not a black company.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't think that.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  But anyway.

Speaker 1: Did you have any history with Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: Harold?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a chicken fry, fish fry, something, we raised money for Harold.  Harold and I were close, you might say, you know.  He knew me well, I'd like to walk in his office and be accepted: "Hey, Clayter [HistoryMaker Richard Clayter], how you doing?" You know, friendly.
Speaker 1: When did you first meet him and where was the--
Speaker 2: I think I first saw Harold when I told you about the time I saw him at the Cook County Jail [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know why, he, he's a friendly guy, you know, I saw him with this dust mop--not mop, it was a feather duster (laughter), in his railroad uniform and his cap and his red brim, whatever that thing was.
Speaker 1: And this is the time he was in jail for the income tax problem?
Speaker 2: That's when I first met Harold, yeah.  And why I met Harold I don't know, but he was a very friendly guy.  I probably met him in connection with some case that he was handling 'cause his father [Roy Washington] was a lawyer too.  He was a member of the Cook County bar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I recall, yeah, 'cause when you talked to his father, you had to be kind of careful 'cause he spit when he talked, you know, I mean, at a certain distance away (laughter).  Oh boy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 623657
Speaker 1: Tell us some of the most interesting cases you worked on that you say were your top four or five, including the one you--
Speaker 2: Oh, the one about the sidewalk.  My first divorce case, I didn't know much about, you know, I didn't know what the, the arraignment was--what they did was you had a prescribed kind of outline, and you asked certain questions, get certain answers.  Nobody was complaining, you get to the (unclear), blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, the judge kept interrupting me, and I finally said, well, "Well, I'm sorry, if your honor doesn't have time enough to hear this case, maybe you need to transfer it to another judge."  Of course Rivers [D. Adolphus Rivers] was in court with me (laughter).  He said, we called a rece- they called a recess.  He says, "You can't do that, man, they'll put you in jail," you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I said, "Oh, they will?  Okay, then we won't do that."  So I had to go back and follow the script, you know, apologize to the court, of course.  I think my most interesting case was one involving a gal name Marlene Ford [ph.].  Marlene and Robert [ph.] had a thing where they would go and, if you had a traffic matter, they would handle it for you, you know.
Speaker 1: Were they lawyers?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, they were just--and he was a great guy and she was a great gal, but she had problems, you know, and she went off the deep end and she tried to walk through a window, okay?  And she killed Robert while he was in his sleep.  So, my defense, obviously, was insanity, but we didn't win that case.  I think we had to take it up on appeal.  Yeah.  I had an interesting case against Woods--what used to be the Woods Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], it's now a restaurant, I think--I don't think, I know.  And, god, there's so many cases running around my mind.
Speaker 1: What are some of your favorites?  And the Woods Theatre case, what was that about?
Speaker 2: What, a what?
Speaker 1: What was the Woods Theatre case about?
Speaker 2: The worst?
Speaker 1: Woods.
Speaker 2: Oh, this lady's daughter was, they had an age thing, if you were a certain age, your children come in free.  And I forget her, Beulah Jones [ph.] was her daughter, so the child was big for her age and, you know, she looked like, she obviously wasn't twelve, I think it was twelve, and they wouldn't admit her and Beulah was a fighter.  So, we had to fight 'em, we won and I guess the satisfaction was that other lawyers who followed, you know, the sheets, called me for information and advice and stuff.  That was reassuring, to say the least.
Story_ID: 623658
Speaker 1: I've had some interesting--
Speaker 2: Tell us about the spitting on the sidewalk case.
Speaker 1: Oh, this was, I can't think of the town where this happened.  It wasn't, it wasn't here, I don't think it was here, it might have been, it must have been, it had to be, where this client of mine, guy, got to be my client, had run these two people off who had, who were in the west suburbs, and two white folks in this old car, I guess, I don't know how it happened, frankly, but they came to this bridge and they were, they crowded the car off the bridge, you know, so naturally the police came and, dah, dah, dah, and they arrested my guy and charged him with, oh, being under the influence, which he was.  It was a case--in those days, you had cases heard by justices of the peace, magistrates and then so on, and the JPs got their money from the fees that generated in court.  They'd fine people and they, you know, keep the money.  But this particular case came up for trial, my guy's charged with drunk driving, I had filed a petition for change of venue; transfer the case to be heard somewhere else.  With all the judges in Cook County [Illinois] except one, the one happened to be a former classmate of mine, Rene Goeir [ph.], I'll never forget him.
Speaker 2: What is his name?
Speaker 1: Rene Goeir, G-O-E-I-R, or something like.  I think he's dead now.  When the case came up--well, back up a minute, before that, the case had been continued, had been up before the so called court and the judge, or the magistrate or the JP, whatever you want to call him, was sitting on the fire, they had a fire engine, this thing took place in the fire station.  The judge was sitting on this seat where the firemen would normally sit and they had tables on the floor around so I knew that, you know, I was in trouble.  I got the case continued, filed this petition and obviously--oh my friend, Rivers [D. Adolphus Rivers], was there with me and we had some books, just (laughter), which we claimed to be--they were legal books, which we claimed were on point.  And the case came up for trial and, dah, dah, dah, and they were ready to go and I presented this motion, and here's my guy with all these books, you know, we, "Well, judge, we got the--," not judge, "Your honor, we got the magistrate here and we got the laws here," and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, "so we want this case continued."  And they didn't know what to do, they scratched their head and went back in what they call chambers and discussed it.  And they summons me in, I go in and, "Well, what are we going to do with this case?  We aren't ready for trial, but we're--," not trial, "we got the law," and blah, blah, blah.  "So you want time to research it?"  Okay.  "No, no, no, that's okay."  They said, "Well, we got to do something, we've got to resolve it."  I said, "Well, I'll tell you what, we'll enter a plea but not to drunk driving."  They said, "Well, fine," and we finally put our heads together and decided that the best we could do, we would have my guy enter a plea to guilty for spitting on the sidewalk, five hundred dollar fine, and that's the way we re- we resolved it.  He paid a five hundred dollar fine for spitting on the sidewalk instead of, you know, going the other route.
Speaker 2: Great.  That's a great story.
Story_ID: 623659
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to add, anything we've been talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess--
Speaker 1: Maybe I didn't ask you?
Speaker 2: Oh, the incident, I remember one incident when I was still a social worker, working for the city of--for Illinois, and my job was supervising boys from St. Charles [Illinois School for Boys, St. Charles, Illinois], and quite often St. Charles would be ready to relic- relin- relinquish the kid but mama didn't want 'em in the home.
Speaker 1: So St. Charles was a juvenile detention center or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, juvenile, yeah, not a detention center, it was where we send the boys to do time, you know, so to speak.  And the mama didn't want the children to come home, and, no, not children, the boy to come home and there you had--we were called parole agents, but they didn't like for us to use that term, that was Stevenson, there was a guy named Adlai Stevenson was in office, and he was very strict, straight, straight guy; Adlai was one of the few honest politicians you run into.  So they had the city, the state had, you know, we had boys, supervision of these boys, and they had a federal parole agency, and they had, they handled folks in pre- in federal cases that were on parole.  So, I'll never forget it.  I went in and we applied, I applied for a job with them, you know, 'cause that was a step up, and I went in, what is the guy's name?  I can't think of the fellow's name, but he interviewed me, and I guess I did well on the interview.  So he asked me, he said, "Well, what, your ambitions, what are your ambitions, what would you like to be," you know?  What kind of work or something, I've forgotten the exact question and I said, "Oh, I'd like to have your job."  Of course, I got (laughter)--that was the end of that interview (laughter).  Mr. Meeker, Ben Meeker; that was his name.

Speaker 1: What would you tell a young person today about going into the legal profession?
Speaker 2: I would tell them to first pursue political office.  If you win or lose, it can be a winning thing, it's not something that, you know, kids want to get into nowadays.  But I think that's a, that's a way to go, that's a step.  But see you, you're coming out there, but now, I understand, they hire them at some fantastic figure as opposed to my two hundred dollar offer when I started practicing law, and I'll pay 'em twenty, fifty and so on.  But I would advise them to get into politics, you know, get some recognition, unless they've got some connection, which is not likely.  I don't know, other than that, and you realize you're going to have to work like hell, you're going to run into some obstacles.  There are gonna be very, pretty tall hills to climb as they say.
Story_ID: 623661
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you've done that you would, if you had the chance, that you'd do differently in terms of your career?
Speaker 2: I might diverse--divert for a moment, when you asked me about incidents.  I remember this one case I had where they had set a trap, this prostitute had set a trap so that when a guy would, you know, prospect--the prospect, would go by this alley and they'd go by the alley, the pimp was there waiting, they'd grab 'em and bring 'em in and rob them, you know, so forth.  So, so we went to court and the guy was afraid, somehow or other, his wife had managed to find out about the damn case and she's present in court.  So he's between the devil and the deep.  I had to work out a deal with the judge to--I think I tried that case, yeah, I sure did.  That wasn't the one, but you run into so many cases where, you know, you can see justice is not going to be done.  If you get hung up with justice, you're in trouble.  Because justice is not going to be done according to your standards, okay, but there's two sides to at least every case.
Story_ID: 623662
Speaker 1: What was I going to tell you?
Speaker 2: Well I think I originally asked you, what kind of things would you do differently looking back on your past, if you had an opportunity to do so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  (Pause) I think I would probably be a little wiser in terms of recognizing that, in addition to looking out for other folks, looking after other folks, whatever term you want to use, you probably need to devote a little time at looking out for yourself, you know.  It just doesn't work to be 100 percent for somebody else and no percent for yourself.  You may think of it as not being, you know.  That probably comes from my Unitarian stuff, which we didn't talk about, did we?
Speaker 2: Your church affiliation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Unitarian Universalist, yeah.
Story_ID: 623663
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You see, I was a panel- I was a panelist on--for a while.  We had a broadcast that we did, regular broadcast.
Speaker 2: This is through the church?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  It was, how long ago was the, yeah, sponsored by the church, so to speak, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now you were originally a Baptist?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Or Catholic, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Bap- I was a Baptist and baptized in dear old Mississippi.  I was Catholic when conce- when--interesting, when I was in Belgium [in World War II, WWII], we were going to the front or something, and I looked off to my left and I saw what I thought, what I always believed to be, like an angel.  And I got--of course going to Catholic school helped, but then when I found out about this marriage thing, not marriages, infidelity thing with my first wife [Mildred Warren (ph.)], I approached (laughter) the diocese and sort of, whatever it is you get, exemption or something [annulment], and they said that I had to state an oath, swear, whatever, that I had not had--I had not consummated the marriage, that's what it was.  I said, well I can't say that, I got a child, how can I say I never consummated this marriage, you know?  So, I'm not going to do that.  Before that, I was pretty good, you know, I'd sit there and do the ma- I loved it when they did the Mass in Latin because one of the courses I took in school was Latin, you know, I could do the, "Hail Mary, full of grace, God is with thee; blessed," blah, blah, and I could do the, you know--follow the Mass, I loved that.  So--
Speaker 2: So at what point did you decide to leave the Catholic church?  Was it at that point?
Speaker 1: At that point, when they came out with that, I said, no, I'm not going to do that, you know, it's not so, it's not true.  Well, we can't give you an exemption, well, don't have to be a Catholic, you know.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Speaking Latin) Dominus vobiscum.
Speaker 2: And what does that mean?
Speaker 1: Dominus vobiscum, I think it means something for all of us [sic.], or-(speaking Latin) et cum spiritu tuo.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.

I would hope that folks would learn to live in peace, honor and respect each other and realize that, you know, you got, just because you believe something, I don't have to believe it.  Just because--you know, as I often say, give the other person their space, that's not, I think that applies not just to black, but it applies to the whole world, "We are the world."

Speaker 1: What message would you leave or lesson would you like to leave your children?

I guess I would summarize it by saying, give the other person their space to be who they are, the way they are, but understand you don't have to change 'em, you know (laughter).
