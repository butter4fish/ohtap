Story_ID: 130979
Speaker 1: All right, now before we get into depth, there are four, lightweight, and they're lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone.  So the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I would--my favorite food is probably, and this is going to sound really strange.  When I was a kid, my, my mother always--I was a thin kid, so she always wanted me to eat broccoli and asparagus and all these vegetables.  And strangely enough, one of my favorite foods right now is broccoli, I love broccoli.  And I hated it when I was a kid.  I, I wouldn't eat it, but I love broccoli.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yeah I guess my favorite color would be black.  I don't know, I just love, love black.
Speaker 1: All right, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  I would guess probably summer would be my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Jamaica, absolutely love Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the quote from Frederick Douglass that says in fact you may not pay for everything you get in this world, but you--you may not get everything that you pay for in this world, but you will most certainly pay for everything you get.  It's a profound notion that he came up with.
Story_ID: 130980
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna ask about your family history, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: All right, her full name is Lula Ella Starks.  Well actually on her birth certificate it's Harriet Luella Starks, Harriet Luella Starks.
Speaker 1: Harriet Luella Starks, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Luella, right.
Speaker 1: But she went by the name of, of--
Speaker 2: Lula.
Speaker 1: Lula Ella Starks.  And can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: L-U-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ella, Ella?
Speaker 2: Ella Starks, E-L-L-A, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born August 26, 1916 in a little place called Graysport, Mississippi, which is in Grenada County, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what are some of the stories passed down from her side of the family about her ancestors on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well they were basically farmers.  And my great-grandmother was a teacher.  Her, her husband was a, was a, a, a gentleman farmer in the in--at the turn of the century.  So they were fighting constantly with the local constabulary and, and the, the rich farmers that surrounded them.  They had--my great-grandmother had--what was it, twelve children.  And they were, you know they all went off to various places, Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], all kinds of places, California, etc.  And my grandmother was--on my mother's side, my maternal grandmother, was a, was--basically stayed in/around the Mississippi area.  And her children then went off to different places around the country.  But they were, they were fierce fighters.  Some of my mother's relatives were preachers and teachers and farmers.  So I come from a long line on my mother's side of teachers and preachers.  So I guess I'm follow, following in the tradition.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any, any good stories from your mother's side of the family that are passed down?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one sad story is the fact that my, my great-grandfather left them with a great deal of land in Mississippi after he passed away.  And through some unfortunate transactions between the men, because in, in those days the tradition was that the men, the boys handled the property.  And they did some strange manipulations and they lost much of the land because at the--around--just before all--during the World War II era, they put a dam in the area.  And they--the, the white landowners understood that the dam was coming in and they manipulated with some sort of manipulations, and got most of the land and then sold it to the U.S. [United States] government for this new dam and they lost the property.  But it was, it was quite a sad story because they--I think it must have been, might have been close to three hundred acres.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of land really, for--
Speaker 2: Yes it is.
Speaker 1: For black farmers, you know.
Speaker 2: For black people at that time, right.
Story_ID: 130981
Speaker 1: So this is your grandfather on your mother's [Lula Ella Starks] side.
Speaker 2: On my father's side, on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Great-grandfather, right.
Speaker 1: What, what, what, what, what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Clarence--no, no.  Yeah, his, his name was Bradley.  He was--they, they came from the Bradley family.  And from what I can understand, that they--his ancestors came over land from Virginia if I'm not mistaken, to Mississippi.  And he must have been born around 1859 or so, somewhere around in there.  So he was born into slavery, as was my great-grandmother who was a teacher, she was born into slavery.
Speaker 1: Now what, what was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Wilma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wilma, and, yeah that was--
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're not sure about the last name?
Speaker 2: Bradley, yeah.
Speaker 1: Bradley, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was married to Mr. Bradley, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well did your mother tell you anything about growing up that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Nothing other than the fact that she worked hard, you know she didn't, didn't finish school, a lot of schooling because of the fact that they had to, you know, farm.  And that was sad.  And that was, that was about it.  She learned to cook early; she was a great cook.  Worked in a restaurant when she was younger.  And ended up in Chicago [Illinois] after coming from Mississippi.  But other than that, she didn't talk a lot about--
Speaker 1: Is, is there a story about how she decided to come to Chicago or I mean were, were relatives here already, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well what hap--yes, there were--I had other aunts and uncles that were in Chicago.  So that was, that was a, a logical stop.  But she had gone to Saginaw, Michigan before coming to Chicago.  And, and came to Chicago in, in the '50s [1950s], early '50s [1950s] on the West Side.  And then eventually moved to the South Side.
Story_ID: 130982
Speaker 1: So we were originally West Siders, which is interesting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Very interesting story.  We moved to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], and this is that sort of West Side/South Side rivalry.  People say well what, you know where, where, where you from?  West Side.  Oh, you're one of those people that cut, cut people and, you know I never go to the West Side and that kind of crazy stuff.
Speaker 2: Break it down for us now.  What, what is West Side/South Side?  Now these are two huge communities kind of physically separated by downtown?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well what happens is the West Side, many of the people on the West Side are--and this is very interesting--many people on the West Side after 1960, moved to the South Side.  I mean moved from the South Side to the West Side because they--much of the South Side was, was evacuated.  And people were removed to build the, the projects that ran along the State Street quarter, and there was also a big movement of people who were displaced by the building of Prairie Shores and Lake Meadows.  So in both cases, some of those people who, who formerly lived on the South Side and what was then called the tenements or the ghetto or whatever--
Speaker 2: The old Black Belt.
Speaker 1: Old Black Belt, moved to the West Side.  But the stigma came because many of the people who came after World War II settled on the West Side.  And they were called the country bumpkins, the, you know--and the tradition of the old settlers was always on the South Side in the, in the so-called black belt.  And even today as we speak, a great majority of the elected officials, black elected officials in the city, live on the South Side.  And the people with the money, the businesses, primarily are South Siders.  And that's where that whole rivalry thing comes from.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And lastly, the West Side of course was decimated in the 1968 riots after the death of [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and has never been rebuilt.  There are large plots of land on the West Side right now as we speak, that have been lain fallow since 1968.  So it has this continuing notion that it's the last place anybody would want to be.  But again, if you'll notice, if you start where the [Chicago] Bulls stadium is and go west, it's beginning--development is beginning to overtake much of the near West Side.  So I would predict within the next ten years or so, much of the West Side will be redeveloped and many of the poor people will be again displaced.  If the 2016 Olympics had come, you would have seen a wholesale displacement, especially along Independence Boulevard where the swimming area was supposed to be.  So that held up some of the displacement.
Speaker 2: So thee, there's a subtext to the Olympics that we don't know.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Yeah, the subtext is that if the Olympics had come, it would have wiped out much of the area in--on the South Side particularly around the Washington Park area on the South Side, and much of the area around Independence Boulevard on the West Side.  Because again, the 2016 Olympics was really in reality a scheme for the redevelopment of the city, especially in those areas that were African--where African Americans reside.
Story_ID: 130983
Speaker 1: Give us your father's name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My father's, Vernon Lamar Terry.
Speaker 1: Okay and what, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Vernon Lamar was born in 19--if I'm not mistaken, he was born about 19, 1915 in--it was April, I think April 16 [1950] or so.  And, and he was born in a place--what is it called?  It, it's near, it's near Grenada [Mississippi].  Yeah, in Grenada County, I don't know the exact place of birth.  And again, the Terry family again farming family.  My great--my grandfather on my father's side was a farmer and he left--when he passed away, he had another three hundred acres of land, he had--it was--my father had two--four brothers, so it was five boys.  My grandmother on my father's side was a teacher, Harriet Terry.  She was born Harriet Fleming and she was a teacher.  He was a farmer.  And they were well known in that particular area of, of Grenada County, Mississippi.  Their sons, many of--most of them left the area all but one, my Uncle George stayed in the, in the, in the house and the farm.  And he was the last to pass away, he passed away back in May of this year.  And so there are no other, no other--none of the Terry boys are left.  So the land is now being parceled out between all the, the grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Okay so they, they managed to hang onto their land.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: In spite of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Yeah, they hung onto it.
Speaker 1: Okay what are some of the stories about that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well they were known again, as teachers and preachers.  God, this, this whole thing is sort of surrounds teachers and preachers.  They were--my uncles were known as the, as cads.  I mean they, they knew all the women.  They had, they had girlfriends--not exactly Tiger Woods, but they were, they were, they were, they were pretty, pretty busy in the area.  They worked in, you know, primarily in industrial pursuits because of them didn't want to stay on the farm.  So they went off to--one went to, to Michigan, one went to Memphis [Tennessee], another went to St. Louis [Missouri].  So they were, they were scattered around and left my Uncle George on the farm.  And he was the one that kept the farm intact.  But he was the kind, he was the guy, he was the only one--everybody came back every year to visit him, but he was the, he was the one who, who maintained everything intact because the others were off doing their thing.  But they tell the story of--well they used to tease me because I was not--I mean I would go and visit my grandmother and I was not accustomed to, to farm life.  And they would put me on horses and try to teach me to milk cows and stuff and that was--they, they got a--I mean that was fun to them because I didn't know what, what I was doing.
Story_ID: 130984
Speaker 1: My grandmother's--on my mother's [Lulla Ella Starks] side--her, her brother, Uncle Henry used to take kids to farm on tours.  And to, to work.  And he took me once to a, an outing to pick cotton.  And he would get paid for taking people to the, to the field to pick cotton.  And he took me and he bought me back to my grandmother's and said this boy will never make a farmer.  Get him out of here.  Send him to Chicago [Illinois] to his mother cause he'll never make a good farmer.  But that was, that was quite an experience.  Learn--watching and participating in cotton picking, as well as hoeing, taking grass out of--from around the, the cotton.  And the thing that impressed me the most was the fact that when you pick cotton, your hands swell because the, the, the boll of the cotton can--is stiff and, and you see people whose hands have puffed up from pulling the cotton out of the bolls.  And then to see women and old men as well as young children, pull these huge sacks down the, down the row of cotton and go and weigh up.  And they would have 100 pounds, 150 pounds.  And it was fascinating to me.  I just couldn't understand how people could endure that same kind of life for a lifetime and making such pitiful amounts of money and working literally from sunup to sundown.
Speaker 2: How old were you when you started going down there to--
Speaker 1: Basically--going to the farm you mean?  I always visit my grandmother on the farm cause my, my maternal mother, grandmother lived in, in the city of Grenada [Mississippi], not a city, a little small town.  But my grandmother [Harriet Fleming Terry] on my father's [Vernon Lamar Terry's] side lived in, you know had the farm down in--outside of Grenada.  But--and I would go visit her and that was, you know the going back and forth and so I got the, the, the, the contrast between the two.  And then dividing time between there and Chicago.  So I got all sides, farm, a small town as well as a big city.
Speaker 2: Would you like spend the whole summer down there or part of the--most of the--
Speaker 1: Actually, I went to school--my mother didn't want me to go to school in Chicago.  So I went to grammar and high school in Mississippi.  And spent all my summers in Chicago.  So it was reversed.  And so I knew many of the kids in the neighborhood on the West Side.  Some of them didn't even know that I had, you know, had gone to Mississippi to go to school because in the winter in Chicago obviously people go to different schools and, and different places.  So I was, I was teasing one of my students who works at [Moses] Montefiore [Academy, Chicago, Illinois] and I had a of couple friends who went to Montefiore which was in those days called the bad boys school.  And we used to tease people who--he went to Montefiore which meant he was very bad.  And we used to laugh at that, but yeah.
Story_ID: 130985
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let, let me go back to your parents.  Is there a story about how your mother [Lula Ella Starks] and father [Vernon Lamar Terry] met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother worked--and this is, this is very strange.  In Grenada County [Mississippi] was the same county or maybe it was the county next to it, where the McCain family--and this is the [Arizona Senator John] McCain who ran for president.  His ancestral family--
Speaker 1: Grandfather McCain.
Speaker 2: Moved from I think it was North, South Carolina to this county in Grenada in the I think 1837, somewhere around in there.  I, I, I--the timeframe escapes me.  But anyway, the McCain family had traditionally from the mid-1800's always had a military you know, a high ranking military person in the family.  And apparently one of his--either his uncles or great-uncles, Senator McCain's uncles or great-uncles, had this camp which was a World War II camp named for him.  So this Camp McCain, okay.  My mother worked at Camp McCain as a cook.  And she met my father was in the [U.S.] Army, and they met while somehow while he was in the army and she was working at Camp McCain as a cook.  And they, they you know had this relationship and, and, and later of course I was born.  But that was very interesting.  I didn't realize the connection between the McCains until I looked it up, but yeah.  Now Senator McCain's family apparently there's a, a couple of African American families in this--still in Mississippi who claim relations to the, the, the original McCain family.
Speaker 1: Blood relations, right.
Speaker 2: Blood relations, right.  But of course Senator McCain never talks about it.  But one--his brother admits it, that there is a blood relationship.  And they have an annual McCain family thing.  But yeah, so this family, this original--one of the original McCains was in the army and they named this camp for him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I assume your parents didn't stay together because of your name.
Speaker 2: No they didn't.  They, they, they moved, moved around.  My mother married a, a man named Monk Shaw.  And they moved to Saginaw, Michigan.  And from Saginaw she came to Chicago [Illinois], he stayed in Saginaw and, and then of course that's, that's when we, you know, got the introduction to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay and your, your father stayed in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Stayed in--no, he moved to Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He moved to Memphis, Tennessee where he, he passed away in 1971 he passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you see very much of your father growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we saw each other, yeah.  We, he you know I would go to Memphis and see him and funny thing about him was he was a modest drinker and he had always had a, a bottle of Vat 69 [Scotch whiskey] in the refrigerator.  I remember as a little kid.  And I asked him one day what is this Vat 69--he said that's my medicine, son.  So not knowing, I thought that was his medicine.  But yeah, he was, he was a modest--very jovial, always telling jokes and, and talking about my lack of adaptation to the farm.  That was one of his biggest jokes on me is that boy, you--he said I knew how to milk cows.  I rode horses, I did all, you know and you can't do any of that, you know.  It was really, it was really something, yeah.
Story_ID: 130986
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, now I had, have two brothers that were born before me, they're older.  Willie passed away in 1983, and my other brother, Roger, is a minister and a funeral director, and he lives in, in Broadview [Illinois].  So we, you know we always very close as a family, yeah.  But they of course understood the farm and worked the farm and you know, went back and forth.  So they, they were very--much more familiar with that than I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you consider your parents' personalities and their, their talents and--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably a little of both.  My mother [Lula Ella Starks] was, god I mean she was one, she was one of my heroines.  I mean she was just the, the sweetest, loving person.  I mean she sacrificed tremendously for me, you know being an only child.  Determined to make sure that I had, you know the best education; the best that she could provide materially.  Made sure that I went to Sunday School, god, A.M.E., African Methodist Episcopal Church.  My grandmother on my mother's side was a firm believer in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.  And they made sure I was there on every Sunday morning, in Sunday school and stayed for church.  And in some cases came back for night service.  So--and that's funny because we did Easter speeches, Children's Day speeches, we were in YPD, the Young People's Department, which is a part of the tradition of the, the A.M.E. Church.  But my mother was a great cook.  Firm but loving and sacrificed tremendously for me.  My father [Vernon Lamar Terry] again, supportive--a very, you know anything I asked him for, I got it.
Story_ID: 131270
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess my favorite childhood memory is coming on the train, the Illinois Central train, from Mississippi, going back from Missi--from Chicago [Illinois] to Mississippi and coming from Mississippi to Chicago and greeting my grandmother, my maternal grandmother.  And greeting my mother [Lula Ella Starks].  I mean that was just all--and my stepfather [Monk Shaw], that was always, it was a joyful time because in each case, they had presents for me, big hugs, kisses, the whole bit.  And I was just, just--felt very special.  We'd get off at--sometimes 12th Street Station, which is no longer there, sometimes at 63rd Street.  But that was a joyful time for me to, to come in and to, to, to that, that train station and see my parents there.  It was a joyful time.
Story_ID: 131271
Speaker 1: All right now we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess the sights and sound is primarily the, the sights of fresh food growing.  It's impossible to even imagine.  I mean my grandmother had, my maternal grandmother living in this little small town, had what was called a truck farm.  Which of course as you know was a--the tradition where people had a garden and I always laugh when I see Michelle [Obama] at the White House with her little garden cause my grandmother had one of those.  And she had tomatoes, string beans, some corn, a few greens, and I would go out and help her, you know plant.  And the smell, cause I love tomatoes, and I would go and just actually take the tomatoes out of the garden, wash them and eat them right there in the little area around, in that little garden.  That was, that was tremendous smell and the cooking of fresh food, tremendous.  Baking bread, eating fresh food, listening to the crackle of the skillet on Sunday when my grandmother would cook.  Fried chicken, we had fried chicken.  We had banana pudding, we had ice tea.  That, that was--that brings back tremendous memories to me.  And then when I went to see my father's [Vernon Lamar Terry's] mother [Harriet Fleming Terry], the smell of, of the country, clean, fresh air.  Again with as much--many vegetables that I would take back to my maternal grandmother's house and you know, watermelons that you would go out in the--in her garden and just pick big watermelons and cut them open.  And she'd make ice cream with a churn, with the ice in the thing and you'd churn it and make ice cream.  Just absolutely fantastic.  Those are great sights and sounds that I remember and smells.
Story_ID: 131272
Speaker 1: Okay, now you grew up right after World War II [WWII], basically.
Speaker 2: Basically.
Speaker 1: And so you spent time in Mississippi and in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And during the time you grew up, the Civil Rights Movement was starting to build I guess in the South.
Speaker 2: Precisely, precisely.
Speaker 1: What are some of your reflections on the political situation?
Speaker 2: The most, the most traumatic one of course was being in Mississippi with my--both grandmothers at the time of the death of Emmett Till.  And I remember the trauma of my grandparents, my grandmothers, at understanding the danger and overhearing them talking about the need to protect young boys in particular.
Speaker 1: Now you were almost the same age, you were twelve I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Around twelve, yeah.
Speaker 1: Twelve, yeah, it was 1950--
Speaker 2: No, about ten, about ten.
Speaker 1: When was Emmett Till, '55 [1955], '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Fifty, '55 [1955], about ten or eleven.
Speaker 1: Fifty five [1955], okay, okay, so you were ten or eleven.
Speaker 2: So I mean that was, that was a traumatic time and I'd just come back from Chicago to go--get ready to go to school.  And my--I remember my grandmother saying God, I'll be glad to get you out of here, you know, because this is, you know this was a traumatic time because it was painful for all the parents in, in that area, in Mississippi because where he was assassinated, murdered, was actually about I guess about thirty-five or forty miles from where I, where my grandmother lived.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was Money, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: That's right, it was, you know in effect right down the road.  So yeah, that was, that was a, that was a traumatic thing, absolutely, absolutely yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did you see the picture in the Jet Magazine?
Speaker 2: God yes, absolutely yeah, absolutely yes, absolutely yeah.  We saw all the, the photographs.  My uncles when I came back, showed me the church where he was funeralized and the whole bit.  So we, you know we were in--we were given the tour of you know, later.  As an adult I met Mrs. Till-Mobley and all of her friends and the people involved in setting up her tour.  Because she went around the country talking about it.  And yeah that--but those were traumatic--that was a traumatic period.
Speaker 1: Now you met her after the fact.
Speaker 2: After, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: It was long after that, yeah.
Speaker 1: And not, okay.  So but during the--you were in Mississippi when it happened?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you can imagine the trauma.
Speaker 1: So your grandmother was really telling you how to avoid--
Speaker 2: Of course, of course.  All grandmothers, all parents, fathers and mothers and grandparents, were constantly telling their children, particularly their boys, the danger of being in a place like Mississippi at that particular time.
Speaker 1: Now what were your specific instructions?  What did they tell you to do?
Speaker 2: Well specifically we were told just you know, not antagonize as much as you possibly could not.  Don't antagonize white people, you know because they were, they were mean, they were cruel, they were racist and you know, if you go into a store, obviously you don't whistle because that was the myth, that he whistled.  Which again, the story--the reality is he, his mother--he was a stutterer.  And his mother taught him to whistle as a way of overcoming his stuttering.  So he wasn't whistling at her, he was whistling as a way of overcoming his stuttering.  And so we knew that that was not the, the proper thing to do as, even as a ten- or eleven-year-old, sure.
Story_ID: 131273
Speaker 1: What were--did you have many opportunities to encounter white people in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you'd go to the store and, you know and buy things for your grandparents.  You would go shopping, but you know and, and on occasion you might run into a white kid.  Because in, in Mississippi, people lived in the same neighborhood.  So you'd encounter kids and you know you play with them.  But it was never a close relationship.  And then on occasion you might even mow a lawn or something for a white person and get, you know, make a few bucks.  But not any real close relationship.  My grandparents made sure that that did not occur because of the danger.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did you really feel at that time a, a sense of the contrast between--or was there a big difference between, between Chicago [Illinois] and Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely yeah.  You understood it even at that age you understood the contrast.  And your parents and your grandparents constantly drummed that into you, that there was a difference, you know.  Yeah absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So what kind of things did you really like--what were your favorite things to do when you were in school in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well I guess I was somewhat of a, a showoff.  I liked to, to read and I loved--I absolutely loved news and I, I constantly read the newspapers and books and was to some extent a showoff of, you know, knowing current events cause that was, that was one of my favorite things.  If anybody asked anything about any current event, I would you know, know something about it.  That was always one of my favorite things, and was a showoff on current events.  So when we had the section on current events in grammar school, I was the guy who knew who Emmett Till was and knew his mother's name, knew who, who the, the President of the United States, the Cabinet members, all that kind of little trivial stuff.  That was my--one of the favorite things that I always knew, yeah.  And knew all the Civil Rights leaders.  And always prided myself on knowing some of the leaders in Africa, that was one--you know cause I had read Ebony and Jet and they always featured people like Kwame Nkrumah and you know you mispronounced the names, but at least you knew who they were.
Speaker 1: What'd you call him in those days, and what did people call him?
Speaker 2: God, probably Incroma [ph.] or something, something crazy, but--
Speaker 1: Dacruma [ph.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you knew those names.  And believe it or not, much of that same thing was reinforced in Sunday school because you had little, little period in Sunday school where you would do current events.  So yeah, I was somewhat of a showoff.  That was, that was one of my favorite things, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 131274
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: It was, it was Willa Wilson I think it was, Willa Wilson Elementary School [(ph.), Grenada County, Mississippi], Willa Wilson, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay was that named after somebody who--
Speaker 2: A lady named Willa Wilson.
Speaker 1: A teacher who founded it?
Speaker 2: Willa Wilson, yeah absolutely.
Speaker 1: How big was this school?
Speaker 2: Probably four hundred people, kids in the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, they came from around the area.
Speaker 2: Around the area and around the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This was a grade school, basically?
Speaker 2: Grade school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And high school was Carey Dodson [(ph.) Grenada County, Mississippi].  Now both of those schools have been incorporated into one school now.  I don't even know what the name of the school is, but after 1968, they you know, they were integrated.  So the names--they probably dropped the names of the black schools and you know, and they picking on, probably one, some other name.  I don't, I don't, I don't recall what the names are.
Speaker 1: Okay, well was Social Studies your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Social Studies, absolute, and politics.  Loved current events, social studies and politics.  Didn't do too badly in math.  But loved current events, politics, just absolutely absorbed them.
Speaker 1: Did, did people really--they--were the people in your hometown really excited about the, the Montgomery Bus Boycott [Montgomery, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: This is '56, [1956], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was probably--it was immense interest, absolutely, absolutely.  But you know what, what really, Crowe, what really struck me if I recall in that same period.  Remember this was around the same time as the, the uprising in, in what was it Hungary, the [1956] Hungarian Uprising, right.  And I remem--I recall listening to elderly people, African Americans at the same time talking about the Montgomery Bus Boycott and contrasting that with the, the Hungarian uprising.  Now white America has always thought that African Americans, particularly elderly African Americans, didn't understand what was going on in the world around them.  But believe me, these old people understood the contrast precisely, right.  They understood that the American government was aiding the people, the Hungarian refugees who were flooding into America, giving them, you know, jobs and aid and homes and everything.  And at the same time denying African Americans the right to just simple civil rights in America.  And that struck me, that always struck me as very interesting that this--that you had this, this contrast.  And these people in the barber shops, in the churches, and people just sitting around, my grandparents sitting around just talking.  They understood the contrast and the difference.
Speaker 1: You know I hadn't thought about this like this before myself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they understood that.
Speaker 1: But you, you're right.  Here's the Hungarians struggling for their rights against the Soviet Union, have a violent uprising and it's supported by United States.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And [President Dwight] Eisenhower making these grandiose speeches and the people in the [U.S.] Senate making these grandiose speeches about you know the poor people of Hungary were struggling for their freedom and the American government is coming to their aid.  And at the same time here are people in Montgomery, Alabama who are having to fight and walk for miles to work.
Speaker 1: And nonviolent--
Speaker 2: Nonviolent, right.
Speaker 1: --Resistance, right.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Nonviolent resistance to oppression.
Speaker 2: Precisely.
Speaker 1: No bloodshed.
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: But they're moving too fast, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 131275
Speaker 1: But you know what the other thing was?  If I recall, it was an immediate love for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  I mean he was for some reason, and I assume it was the fact that he was a churchman, a minister.  He had an immediate contact with, with, with the Southern African American people.  And they absolutely loved Dr. King.  I mean and when he was stabbed by this woman in Chicago [sic, Harlem, New York], I mean they were just absolutely--I mean they, they had prayers around the country for his, you know, the fact that he could, you know would recover.
Speaker 2: This is what, 1957 or '58 [1958]?
Speaker 1: About, '56 [1956], '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: He was at a book signing I think it was.
Speaker 1: He was at a book signing.
Speaker 2: A woman stabbed him with a, stabbed him with a pen knife or something.
Speaker 1: A woman stabbed him.  The other thing, Crowe, if I remember reading and, and having discuss--listening to discussions even in the classroom.  Again this is, this is young, I'm a young kid.  But elders, and again this is really interesting thing.  People assumed that southern blacks were just ignorant, didn't understand anything.  The discussion about communism, because there was this big propaganda, particularly from the southern white legislators, that the outside agitators were communists.  Didn't exactly understand what communism was at the time, but I understood the notion of the outside agitator.  And it always occurred to me why would somebody need an outside agitator to tell somebody that their rights were being trampled on?  That was always--and then I said--then I had to go to read what a sommunist was.  So then you come into--you read the book 'I Wander as I Wander' which was Paul Robeson's book.  And then you read [W.E.B.] Du Bois and you begin to get this notion now they're socialists.  And then you have to figure out what's the difference between communism and socialism and how does that fit into the whole struggle of civil rights, okay.  Now the only library we had access to in--was the school library because the, the white library, the public library was, was off limits.  You could get a book but you'd have to go and petition and, and all that other stuff.  So you didn't, you didn't bother with that.  And they--we had a few books written by African Americans and of course on Black History week you'd have the big display with people like Du Bois and Pickett and you know the cowboy and all that.  But you didn't--they didn't really want you to go into too much detail about that--those big Communists people, or people who were considered radicals or Communists, right.  So that always intrigued me and I always wanted to read about those.  So again, read Robeson, you read Du Bois, you read the stuff that Dr. King wrote.  And you became much more interested, and you began to draw that contrast between, between what the white propagandas was saying and what African American people were saying.  And interestingly enough, one last thing.  The ministers if I recall on Sunday in those churches, were very crafty and very subtle in their analysis of current events.  Many of them talked about the differences, the way in which African Americans were treated.  But they wrapped it in, you know, these parables about Joshua and, and all this other stuff, which was rather, rather interesting.  And when you go back and think about that, they, they understood.  I mean they weren't raging radicals, they weren't Malcolm X.  But at the same time, they were not Uncle Toms for the most part.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 130993
Speaker 1: What were some of your other activities in school [Carey Dodson High School, Grenada County, Mississippi]?  What else did you like?  I asked you your favorite subject.
Speaker 2: Speech making.  We, we--on the debate team, did participate in drama and in band, but not really that great.  I played the clarinet.  I remember one concert, I think I was horrible.  But anyway I thought at the time I was good, but I think I was pretty bad.  And I haven't really played the clarinet since, really.
Speaker 1: This was in grade school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, it was in high school.
Speaker 1: High school, okay.
Speaker 2: Played the clarinet.  Didn't play football, but I was the statistician for the football team, so traveled with the football team and wrote stories about them in the school newspaper.  So had fun, had a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: So this is at Carey Dodson High School, right.
Speaker 2: Carey Dodson High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did you ever run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact I think I was, yeah I was president and vice president at one point, yeah.  Always in the, in the leadership, you know.  At one point I think I even was a fund raiser for, you know the school, the school council, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had an experience growing up really when you look at it is just the opposite of a lot of kids in Chicago [Illinois] who spent their summers down South and then come back.  You know like Emmett Till did, the summer there and he was kind of coming back North.
Speaker 2: Right--
Story_ID: 130994
Speaker 1: Okay, now we were, we had you in [Carey Dodson] High School [Grenada County, Mississippi] I believe and you were playing the clarinet and you ran for president.  You were president once.
Speaker 2: President once.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wrote for the school newspaper, statistician for the football team.  Went out for football, but didn't really make you know, I think I was too small.  I was like probably 110, you know soaking wet, and you know that's why my grandparents and my mother always tried to make me eat vegetables to fatten up.  And then after I got probably around twenty-five, I start putting on weight, you know.  But when I was a kid I was very thin, very thin.  So at any rate, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's interesting; you have a son that became a football player.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  And yeah Bobby's, Bobby played with the--played at the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] and then transferred to Western Illinois University [Macomb, Illinois] and played there too.  And then played arena football and wanted to go to the NFL [National Football League], but decided that you know, it was, he was not going to make it.  So he went on back to, to school and is now finishing up his MBA [master of business administration].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is what I wanted him to do anyway.  I didn't particularly want him to go to the NFL, but you know you have to let young people do their own thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You can't tell them what to do.
Speaker 1: Now when you were, when you came back to Chicago [Illinois] in the summertime, did you--now Chicago, the South Side in those days as it is now to some extent, but I think especially in those days, was a very rich place to be I mean in terms of the cultural atmosphere.  It's easier to find then I think in some ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah well remember now I spent most of the time--well I had--one of my aunts lived on [Martin Luther] King Drive.  And this was--
Speaker 1: You, I know what you're getting ready to say.
Speaker 2: I was on the West Side.
Speaker 1: You said you were on West Side.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which is the stereotype of the West Side.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  But one of my aunts lived on, on King Drive.  So we used to--well at that time it was South Parkway, right.  So I would go to my cousin's--remember, my mother came from a family of twelve children who had all these cousins all over the place.  I'm an only child, but they adopted me like a brother, right.  So we would go--they would take me to the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  We, we'd go and they, they'd come to the West Side, I'd take them to places.  And I had cousins live in Gary, Indiana.  I'd go over there and you know, and spend some time with them.  But the West Side was interesting.  We lived in, on, in, in, around--in the Lawndale area.  And at the time, you know we moved there in the '50s [1950s].  It was a Jewish area, right.  So the Jews were leaving and blacks were coming in.  So you had these enormously rich Jewish institutions.  The big church on Independence Boulevard that is now Stone Temple, was a big Jewish temple [synagogue].  A very beautiful, rich, but you know they left so they turned it into a, a Baptist church, right.  You had on Roosevelt Road you had the Palatine Meat Company where you would go and get good, I guess Bratwurst, Polish sausages, you know hot dogs, etc., right.  And you would go and watch the, the Jewish--what they call it, the Kosher ceremony for the killing of the chickens and all that.  And then I actually worked at a place called--on Roosevelt Road, it was owned by a Jewish man.  And I used to go and get matzo ball soup for him.  And he was a former concentration camp and he showed me, he used to show me his, his number that he had when he was in the concentration camp.  And he would constantly tell me the stories about how his family was killed and, and the whole bit.  So yeah, that was, that was interesting.  And that was at the time believe it or not, the, the beginning of the street gangs because I was there when the Cobras, the Egyptian Cobras were founded on the West Side in that same little neighborhood.  And I remember when I was very young my uncle took me to a place that I had read about in the Jet Magazine where a man had cut his wife's or his girlfriend's head off and took the head to a bar and set the head on the bar and ordered a drink.  My uncle took me in the car and showed me the bar and the alley where the lady had, had, had, had died.  And God, I think one of the places was called The Bucket of Blood or something like that, it was just gruesome.  But anyway--
Story_ID: 130995
Speaker 1: Yeah that was, that was the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  It was very--I had friends, many of them ended up unfortunately going to the Vietnam War, and that was interesting because when I went to--I was forced to go to, as we all were in the draft.  I had written a letter to General [Lewis Blaine] Hershey who was the, the head of the draft department [Selective Service System] for the U.S. [United States] government.
Speaker 2: This was when you were a senior in high school, or--
Speaker 1: No, this was right after I had gotten out of high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I think it was my first year in college or something.  And I said you know I'm a conscientious objector.  They said we don't believe that stuff.  Anyway I went to the Draft Board and I was--these old white guys sitting up in there, you know, you guys come in and you sit down and talk to them.  So they said what are you doing?  I said I'm at Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois].  And they looked and they talked amongst each other.  And then one comes back and says since you're the only kid in this community that's in college, you stay in college and that's it.  I never will forget that.  They said you know, so I--even though I was a conscientious objector, probably wouldn't have fought if I had been forced to go, they said well you stay in college, kid, you know, go on.
Speaker 2: Okay, now let me go back a little bit to high school.  Now you graduated from Carey?
Speaker 1: Carey Dodson High School [Grenada County, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Okay, and what did you do--I mean did, did you graduate with honors or anything or did you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But before that, let's go back a minute.  I, I--it was interesting enough, in junior high, junior, when I was a junior, they had a program at Tougaloo College [Tougaloo, Mississippi], right.  If you remember Tougaloo, Tougaloo's one of those schools that were established right after the Civil War I think by the Presbyterians, and was a fairly decent school but it--the advantage Tougaloo had was that Tougaloo had these relationships with schools like Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] and, and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and other schools.  And they had this program where you could actually go to Tougaloo in your junior year.  So I qualified for the program, but I didn't want to--somehow I didn't, didn't choose to go.  But anyway we went to this visit and I remember an old Jewish historian, yeah he was a historian, Russian.  And he--we were talking to him and he said to me something I will never forget.  He said--now this is, remember this is in the--probably 1960, '61, [196], somewhere around in there.  He said to me now language, a current language to know is Russian.  He said I'm Russian, but if you want to really get ahead, you should know Russian.  He said but twenty, thirty years from now the language will be Chinese.  Now this was an old man saying that in the 1960's and I never will forget that 'cause he's absolutely right.  The language of today is Russian, but they were--I mean I don't know why I didn't take the chance because you had the, the, the idea of studying I think after you take two years at Tougaloo, you could then transfer to Brown or Yale or one of those schools.  But I always wanted to go to DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois], I don't know why.  I think it was because of the basketball, cause I always had--you know, DePaul had this good basketball program.  So I wanted to go to DePaul.  I come one--the summer after graduation I go down to play ball with some friends of mine at Holy Family, which is where Ignatius High School is, right.  And I run into these Jesuit priests.  And they said, "Well where are you going to school?"  I said, "I'm going to DePaul."  Said, "No, you don't want to go to DePaul, you want to go to Loyola.  Loyola's a better school than DePaul."  So I signed up to go to Loyola.
Story_ID: 130996
Speaker 1: Now you knew you wanted to go to school in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right now before I get you completely out of [Carey Dodson] High School [Grenada County, Mississippi], who were some of your favorite teachers in high school?  Or, or did you have any?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I had one teacher who was a historia--history teacher.
Speaker 1: This is an all-black high school.
Speaker 2: All-black high school.
Speaker 1: All black teachers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, it was two brothers.  Nathaniel Boclair, and his brother.  Nathaniel was the math teacher and I loved him; he was absolutely fabulous as a math teacher.  And I remember I was in a, I was at the time and all through high school I was a member of the Book Club, this Book of the Month thing.  And I used to buy all these, you know, get all these books, novels, books and, and one of the books I got I remember was a book on the history of math or something, something and I've forgotten what it was.  But anyway he, he and I talked about math and Pythagoras and all this.  And then at one point we talked about some--an African who was a famous mathematician, the name escapes me.  But he was one of my favorite teachers.  The other one was of course his brother who was his--history teacher.  And we talked about current events in his class, loved him.  And his wife was a drama teacher, so I loved her.  So we had a good time with all three of them.  Very, very fun times.
Speaker 1: How do you spell their last name?
Speaker 2: B-O-C-L-A-I-R, Boclair, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were very, very excellent teachers.
Story_ID: 130997
Speaker 1: All right, so you graduated was it, was it in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961], okay, 1961.  Then you went to Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois].  Now was it hard to get money to go to Loyola?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was hard.  I got a little stipend.  And at the time this was just the beginning of the, the [Federal] Pell Grants.  So you got the grants and, and so it started I was--I started out going part time.  I didn't go, you know I had to work and, and went to school.  And then eventually full time.  But I, you know the Jesuits had this myth that they were the greatest of all the Catholic schools and the greatest academics.  And I always wanted to follow, and this is really propaganda, I wanted to follow the Oxford Method [Oxford University, Oxford, England], which was taking philosophy, economics and political science, okay.  And they offered that.
Speaker 1: Now where did you learn the Oxford Method?  Who, who told you about that?
Speaker 2: I somehow read it somewhere and I don't remember where.  But I, I, I always wanted--so I took--I actually did take equal number of courses in political science and, and philosophy.  Because of course as you know the Jesuits were always in philosophy, but it really wasn't philosophy, it was more theology that, you know, proffered itself as, as philosophy.  But it was basically theology.  And of course at that time I had just converted to--well I actually converted around age fifteen or so, to Catholicism from AME [African Methodist Episcopalian] cause my friends on the West Side were Catholic, so I converted to Catholicism.
Speaker 1: How did that strike your family as--
Speaker 2: Yeah they, they were somewhat upset, but okay as long as you go to church, fine, okay.  So--and I made the mistake of declaring that I was Catholic.  And some of my friends laughed because they, when they made their applications to Loyola, they said they were atheists.  So they wouldn't have to take--'cause at that time if you declared yourself Catholic, you had to take at last one theology course every semester in college.  And I, I made the mistake of doing that.  But anyway it, it was not, it was not all in vain.  I, I learned quite a bit about the history of the church and, and all that.  'Cause they, they pushed that on you.  And of course as I said, Saint Aquinas was the, the great hero.  And they proffered him as a great philosopher when in fact he was more theologian than philosopher.  But Aristotle again was a hero for them.
Story_ID: 130998
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you were at Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois] during the era, if I'm not mistaken, that Loyola won the NCAA [National College Athletic Association]--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Basketball championship.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: The Jerry Harkness and Rolfson, Dick Rolfson and all of them.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I saw it on TV in Dayton [Ohio], but you were, you were around, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  That was, that was quite an era.  Everybody was absolutely on a high when that happened.  And I mean that was, that was quite a, quite a time.
Speaker 1: This is--they won it what, in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was quite a time.  And of course that was the time when they played the, the--I think it was the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi] or one of those southern schools.  And they had the, the white school had to disguise the fact that they were playing an integrated northern school.  The people at Loyola knew about it, but somehow they squashed it in, in the South.  Very interesting.  And that's so-called historical.
Speaker 1: They would have been condemned for actually playing a school with black players.
Speaker 2: Exactly, precisely, precisely.
Speaker 1: And wouldn't be able to show their face in the South.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And this was again the same time that the express was, was happening, well a little bit later because the express from Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York], football.
Speaker 1: Ernie Davis, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ernie Davis was, he was maybe a couple years earlier.  And of course he had had the same--they had had the same problem with him because their school did not want--I mean the southern schools didn't want to play him because he was on an integrated team also.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: This was during the the--that, that period when white coaches in the South said we'll never have a, a "Negro"--Nielen [ph.] from the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee], that he would, he would die and go to hell before he had a African American playing on his team.  And the guy at the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], I've forgotten his name.
Speaker 1: Bear Bryant.
Speaker 2: Bear Bryant said the same thing.  Yeah, we'll never have a black on our team.
Speaker 1: Adolph Rupp of [University of] Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky], same thing.
Speaker 2: Adolph Rupp, that's right, you got it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are the icons.
Speaker 2: Those are the icons, and they said they would never have blacks on their team.
Speaker 1: Right, so that was like a era when [University of] Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] won before it was almost all black team and Loyola wins.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: I think that's--those are the first of a string of black teams that will win the--
Speaker 2: And of course they realized that they really were not competitive without black players.  They understood it, but they were just so racist until the image of having blacks on their team, and this was of course at the same time that you had the entrance of blacks in the profession, professional basketball and football also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Around the same time.
Story_ID: 130999
Speaker 1: Now, okay so were, were you involved in any political activities at Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's interesting, that's very interesting.  I was one of the founders of the Loyola Friends of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and also LUASA, which is Loyola Afro-American Student Association.  And I never will forget this was when we had the Selma, the march in Selma [Selma to Montgomery March].  Some friends of mine and I were going around in--'cause I was down on, on the downtown campus, 800 North Wabash [Avenue] in the lounge, student lounge.  And we were running around collecting money to help send money to the, to SNCC and to the, the marchers in Selma.  So I went up to this one white kid at this table, a white kid and said, "Give some money to help Selma."  So this one little smart-ass white kid said, "I didn't know she was sick, ha, ha, ha."  And what did he say that for?  We had a fight in the cafeteria.  We swung at, we beat--but anyway, the--you know the dean called us in and you know, "What are you doing?"  We explained the situation.  He said you know, "We're gonna forget about this."  But it was--I mean they, they were smart alecks at that time.  Later of course, well yeah it was later, the--we had [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] came to Chicago.  And of course--
Speaker 1: This was like '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: No, no, '66 [1966] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-six [1966], yeah when he came to stay.
Speaker 2: And his buddy on the--one of his lead people was of course Jim Bevel [HM James Bevel].  And we loved Bevel.  Bevel was one of the most--I can't tell you how--I mean Bevel was one of the smartest guys you ever want to meet.  He was in fact, he was Dr. King, one of Dr. King's best strategists.  And Bevel was like the guy who took the SNCC kids and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] kids and college kids and he would give us workshops on how to be nonviolent and all this.  And so we had this--our little SNCC group.  We would go out on protests with them.  We would march against the board of education because they were, you know we had to fight over integration of Chicago Public Schools.  We did all kinds of little, little demonstrations and stuff.  And it was integrated of course.  This was before the black power move.  And we hosted over at the packinghouse, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] when he came to Chicago.  And at this time, this is when I met [HM] Fannie Rushing and of course--now let's go back to '63 [1963], the March on Washington, and of course the, the March on Washington headquarters in Chicago was at the packinghouse and that's where I met Lawrence Landry.  And Lawrence would--you came in and Lawrence would give you an assignment.  My assignment was to go around and collect money to help send people to the March on Washington.  So we went door-to-door.  And then secondly, to set, to set up support and set up the Freedom Schools because we took kids out of schools 'cause we had the, the so-called Freedom Schools.  And we were in contact at that time with students up at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois] and the City Colleges [City Colleges of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  So at that time that's when we met people like Stan Willis [HistoryMaker Standish E. Willis], Earl Jones who was Amiri Baraka's cousin 'cause he was at Loyola.  He had come in--he was from the East Coast and he was Baraka's cousin.  And we--he was a part of our little group.  We, we had--I mean just, just a bunch of really enthusiastic young people who thought everything was you know, gung-ho.

Speaker 1: What we didn't realize it--at that time that we were being watched by you know the FBI and the, you know later the COTELINPRO [sic, COINTELPRO] and all those groups.  And I guess it's interesting if we had known that we were being watched, 'cause we always ran around telling people you know they watching them, opening our mail, you know.  That was sort of cool to say.  We didn't realize that that was actually happening, that was actually, because we had, we had a couple of front groups.  One of our front groups was Students Against Apartheid which gave us, put us on the mailing list with the anti-apartheid movement and we'd get mail from, from the anti-apartheid groups in Europe and in New York.  We had another group, Students for Freedom and all kinds of little, little mailing lists we were on.  And--but SNCC was our major group and we were, we were really in touch with a young lady who later becomes my, my mother, I mean my sister-in-law, Ethel Minor who wrote, who edited the book 'Stokely Speaks.'  My wife's [Judith A. Starks] sister.  And she was in Atlanta [Georgia] at the time, so we corresponded with her.  And--
Speaker 2: I guess you knew Diane Nash too I guess.
Speaker 1: Diane, abso--absolutely.  Diane was you know a very good friend, knew her.  And of course [HM] Fannie Rushing, Lucy Montgomery.  Lucy was the, the, the philanthropist who years ago her house--Silvia Fisher lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] who was one of the, the sort of coordinators if you will, between the national SNCC, SNCC group and Chicago SNCC group.  Lawrence Landry, very much in touch with--Tim Black [HM Timuel Black] who was with the, the black voters.  Bill Barry who was over at the Urban League.  At that time Matt Andy and Andy Thompson and [HM] Harold Pates and you know so, so that whole group just coming together.  And then in 19--we sat at the table in the lounge, Earl and I, and hooked up with Stan Willis [HM Standish E. Willis].  And we planned a student conference that we held at 64th and Sangamon at Reverend John Porter's [HM Kwame John R. Porter's] church in 1967.  And which we had speakers like [HM] Dick Gregory came to speak, Jim Bevel [HM James Bevel] spoke.
Speaker 2: Christ United Methodist [Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's right.  We had all these people come.  And that's, that was the impetus for the, the formation of Communiversity.  And Andy and Pates and the rest of us had gotten together and said look, this is not working.  We're not teaching black studies, we're not teaching black history in the schools, high school or college.  So let's put together a, a Communiversity so we can learn what we're not learning in the formal school system.  And that was the impetus for--
Speaker 2: Was it that push for black studies hadn't started yet or it was--
Speaker 1: It, it was in its infancy at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because it starts around '66 [1966], '67 [1965], when we began to hear the rumblings of it.  And remember these were--kids were actually leaving high schools and forcing schools, high schools to, to implement black studies and lengthen the time of the so-called Black History Week.  And you know eventually by 1969 Andy and his cohorts introduced the idea of Black History Month at the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [later Association for the Study of African American Life and History], and that was adopted by the Association (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, yeah--prior to that it was a week, right?
Speaker 1: Prior that.
Speaker 2: Negro History Week.
Speaker 1: And prior to that it was actually a day.
Story_ID: 131001
Speaker 1: Let me just tell you about that, that was a, that was a fantastic period.  Stan Willis [HM Standish E. Willis] at the time was at--it was not Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois] at the time, but it was, I think it was Crane Junior College at the time.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, he joined our little group.  We had our little--people from Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], from IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois], from Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois], DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois], right.  And we all sat--we met at my house on several nights planning this conference, right.  So on--it was a, it was basically a three day conference, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, right.  So we get--and it was in the basement of the church, right.  So Jim Bevel [HM James Bevel] and his wife Diane were going through some, some problems.  Jim Bevel, I mean just absolutely brilliant, but I think a bit out of his gourd.  Some, something--
Speaker 2: Wait a minute now, he's passed, now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he was in tremendous trouble; he was in jail before he passed.  He was somebody that people had talked about as being as, as losing his mind I guess.  So was it a gradual process?  'Cause you also described that he was brilliant like you said at first, he was brilliant, right.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  And could preach.
Speaker 2: Heroic man.
Speaker 1: Could preach his self.  I mean he and, and I met Bevel by--I mean not Bevel but--God, what's his name?  God, what's his name?  His name will come to me.  But anyway, all these people at that time.  So he, he comes and he speaks.  But really was interesting, now remember the Olympics was 1968, right, 1967 [HM] Dick Gregory stands in the basement and makes an argument for the boycott of the 1968 Olympics.  And he talks about it and he's in touch at that time with the people who actually ended up doing the fist thing [1968 Mexico City Olympics demonstration], right.
Speaker 2: John Carlos.
Speaker 1: [HM] John Carlos and all that, right.
Speaker 2: And Tommie Smith, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now all right let's go back a little bit further.  It was Dick Gregory ran for mayor if I'm not mistaken in '67 [1967].  Did he run?  He run in '63 [1963].  Anyway--
Speaker 2: So he ran against Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, it was the first--was this the first--
Speaker 1: It was a write-in candidacy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I worked in that campaign with him.  It was one of the first campaigns I worked in.  One of the other campaigns I worked in by the way, was, was [Richard H.] Newhouse.  Newhouse ran at--as the first African American to run in--and he won--in the state, for the [Illinois] State Senate, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In that Hyde Park-South Shore area cause we lived in, in South Shore [Jackson Park Highlands].  And by the way, guess who lived across the street from me on 67th [Street] and Ridgeland [Avenue]?  Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson [HM Jesse L. Jackson], okay.  So we moved to 67th and Ridgeland in 1962 and he was, I think he was already there.  No, he came later.  He had--previously he had lived at 48th [Street] and Woodlawn [Avenue], somewhere around in, in there.  But yeah he moved and the house was--the place--the building was owned by A.R. Leak.  And [HM] Spencer Leak [Sr.] who is now the, the, the one who runs the funeral home after his father passed, he was married to Mavis Staples.  Did you know that?
Speaker 2: I actually interviewed him and he, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yes, he was married to Mavis Staples.  And that was before he married his, his former, his, his present wife [Henrietta Leak].  Not Mavis, not Mavis, I'm sorry.  The, the sister that is older than Mavis, the first sister [sic, Leak was married to Mavis Staples].  God, what is her name?  I've forgotten, but anyway--
Speaker 2: Okay, it was one of the Staples sisters.
Speaker 1: But remember the Staple family and the Leak family were very close because they were both from Mississippi, as were the Bishop Ford family.  They were all, they all came to Chicago from Mississippi around the same time.  So they all stuck, stuck together.  But any way so I remember Santita when she was a baby, Jesse Junior [HM Jesse Jackson, Jr.] and all the other kids before they moved to--further into South Shore.  But, but, but anyway let's--so I got off the, off the, off the whole subject.  But at any rate this conference was, was extremely successful.  We had everybody who was anybody came and spoke at that conference.  And, and the students then sat down with [Matt] Andy and [HM Harold] Pates and we formed the Communiversity, that's how it got started.  But the idea was germinated at that, at that conference.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 131002
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So at this time now what were you, were you out of undergraduate school at Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was--
Speaker 1: You still in?
Speaker 2: I was still in, in, in graduate going into the, the master's program.  'Cause I got both the master's and the undergraduate at Loyola, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And that, that was, that was quite a--and, and--
Speaker 1: So this is 1960--
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] when that, when the conference took place in '67 [1967].  And another young lady who helped us organize was named Ernestine Jackson.  Now I don't know where Ernestine is now, she was a fascinating young lady who helped us pull the whole thing together.
Speaker 1: Let, let me go back a little bit to the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] support group.  Did any of your friends and colleagues, or did you go to Mississippi in '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: No, I--my mother [Lula Ella Starks] died, blessed her.  Just absolutely put her foot down.  You're not going down there, no, she wouldn't--I, I didn't, I didn't go.  So I mean they, they--my aunts, my uncles, my mother, no.  Stay away.
Speaker 1: I know Fannie Rushing and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fannie and, and--
Speaker 1: She has a story about being in a house that's surrounded by the [Ku Klux] Klan and her mother calls to see how she was doing.
Speaker 2: My wife's sister was involved in that.  My wife's cousin, who by the way is Lorne Cress Love, who is the sister of Frances Cress Wellsing.  They were all involved in that, in that whole thing.  And of course their, their whole story is you know, written in, in, in--and that's when they hooked up with, with Stokely [Carmichael] and all became involved in, in--with, with the, with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Council] and SNCC and CORE [Congress on Racial Equality] and all those folks.  And of course Ethel later becomes Malcolm [X]'s secretary.  But prior to going to, to work with SNCC, she had been secretary, no, not really a secretary.  She was a translator for Elijah Muhammad because she was a Spanish major in college.  So she translated his Spanish letters that he got from Mexico and South America, into English for him.  And that's--that gave her connection to Malcolm, and then later she, you know joined SNCC.
Speaker 1: Now did you have the opportunity to meet Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: Met Malcolm one time at a speech that he had made at the--what was the, the theater, I mean the ballroom [Grand Ballroom].  The--God, what was it, 63rd and Cottage Grove.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I know what you--
Speaker 2: God, what was the name of that ballroom?  But anyway, he was--listen, he was fantastic, fabulous.  And [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--I mean you talk about a fabulous speaker.  Dr. King was just fabulous.
Speaker 1: Now did your group march with him on the West Side?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Downtown, West Side.
Speaker 1: To Cicero [Illinois]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't go to Cicero for some reason.  Now you know who else was at the conference?  It reminds me, Bob Brown of course was there, you know.  But--god, from CORE.  God--
Speaker 1: National leader from CORE?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Local.
Speaker 2: Local.  Who led the march in '66 [1966] to Cicero [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Well I know that Cage was in CORE.  I'm trying to think who else was--
Speaker 2: Cage was one, okay.
Speaker 1: James Cage.
Speaker 2: James Cage was involved.  But the CORE people were involved in that.  But, but yeah that was, that was quite a, quite a time, yeah.  Quite a time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now my wife was at, at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and in '68 [1968] when King was killed, she, she and her little friends led protests at, at Cornell.
Speaker 1: They, they the students that took over the [Straight Hall] Administration Building?
Speaker 2: That's right, took over the administration.
Speaker 1: Made the cover of Newsweek at the time?
Speaker 2: Right.  And, and she knew the guy who had the rifle.  Yeah, they were all friends.  But she said he really wasn't--
Speaker 1: Now did you know your wife then?
Speaker 2: We had met once earlier, but we really hadn't, hadn't been in contact until--we really didn't get, didn't really get in contact with each other until about 1969 or '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 131003
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well did you ever have a chance to meet Bob Moses [Robert Moses] of SNCC [Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 2: I think I might have met Bob one time.  But he was always a hero of mine.  Very bright man and as you know he started with the Math Project [Algebra Project] after leaving SNCC going back to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] where he had quit and gone in '64 [1964] to the Mississippi Project that summer, Mississippi summer.  And came back to the whole Math Project, yeah, very bright man, yeah, yeah.  And of course met many of the, the people who were in SNCC and you know always liked my buddy Stokely [Carmichael].  Stokely was a dynamic speaker.  And H. Rap Brown, met him.  Met the man who is now the president of a college in the South [Voorhees College, Denmark, South Carolina], god, what's his name?
Speaker 1: Cleve Sellers [Cleveland Sellers]?
Speaker 2: Cleve, yeah Cleve Sellers, right.
Speaker 1: Now was there a, a--that's one of the--did, did anybody go down in '65 [1965] to you know, Alabama for all the activities there?
Speaker 2: We sent, no we actually we sent, sent money more than anything else.  We raised money to send.  Many of these white kids that were in SNCC, their parents wouldn't let them go either.
Speaker 1: It was integrated, yeah prior to--yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, SNCC was integrated at the time.
Speaker 1: Up until about '60 [1960], mid-'65 [1965] or '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: That's when, when the whites were kicked out, right.
Speaker 1: There were some white students that were--was Reed from Loyola, James Reed?
Speaker 2: No, Reed was from the West Side if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was from the West Side.
Speaker 1: But there were quite a few of them that--who, who were beaten up on the, on the Freedom Rides.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was, that was interesting period, very interesting period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you remember the transition in terminology from Negro--now when you all formed Communiversity, we were still Negroes, right?
Speaker 2: But let me give you a story.  Again, you know I told you my, my grandparents and my mother [Lula Ella Starks] and my aunts and uncles were absolutely enamored with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], right.  So in 1966 I was at the time working at the--at Prudential Life Insurance Company part-time, going to Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois], right, and I get home that night and my mother tells me this story.  She says my aunt who was still in Mississippi at the time, called late that, that night and said the Savior has come.  Now remember this was--the march to Mississippi with James Meredith led by Dr. King.  And they go into Mississippi, into this little town called Grenada [Mississippi], and that's where they make the declaration black power.  Right in this Confederate Square in the heart of town.  And she--my aunt was--went to the rally.
Speaker 1: This is 1965, right.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty--and they were enamored.  I mean they just--they, they were just absolutely jumping up and down that they had a chance to see Dr. King and Stokely Carmichael and the whole Civil Rights Movement come to Mississippi.  Joan Baez had just left leading a boycott on the schools and trying to integrate the schools in that little town.  And so--and Lena Horne had just left Mississippi, Jackson, Mississippi because they had big fights down at Jackson State [University].  The whole state of Mississippi was just absolutely up in, in arms at that time.  So it was really, it was really something.  She says--my aunt wakes her up at like twelve o' clock at night.  Wake up.  We, we had the, the Messiah has come.  Really that was Dr. King.  I don't think people really understand the impact of Dr. King on that area of the South at that particular time.  Now obviously Dr. King by 1968 had, had--many people had condemned him and he had lost some of his public support.  But amongst that--those people in the, in the heart of the Deep South, he was still very much a hero.  Northern blacks had somewhat turned away from him.  But he had a solid support in the American South amongst African Americans.
Story_ID: 131004
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what did you pursue in graduate school [Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well I always interested as I said in politics.  But in the undergraduate--I mean in the master's program, went into urban studies because I was interested in cities.  And urban studies interdisciplinary program, politics, economics and sociology.  Some little geography, especially if you wanted to be a planner.  But I was always interested in the political side of it.  So got the master's in urban studies with the, the emphasis on urban politics, okay.  And then left there--
Speaker 1: Before you leave, were there any influential instructors, or incidents that took place that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of my teachers in the, in the master's program was a man named Banovetz who was a, an urban, urbanologist. And primarily economics.  His emphasis was politics and economics.  He then left and went to Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois], right.  But he was very--James Banovetz was, was the teacher.  And, and James was--he and I were, were pretty close in terms of learning the, the big, big names in urban politics.  And he supervised my master's paper and, and the--and another guy named--an old guy who was more a practitioner than a, a scholar, named James Doocey [ph.].  Now the interesting thing about Mr. Doocey was he was an old Irishman.  He was a member of the, the, the consulting firm that was put together by the man who wrote Chapter 17 if I'm not mistaken, of the, the, the report, the Riot Report of 1968.  And god, what is the man's name?
Speaker 1: The something commission, the Kerner Commission Report.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Kerner Commission Report.  But anyway the man who wrote that, big man, he's called--god, what is his name?  But anyway he writes this, this famous book called Economics and Politics I think it's called.  But anyway Doocey was a big proponent of his.  And when he wrote this piece on the dispersal, the theory of dispersal of the city in, in which he said you know with--the only way you can really solve the problem of the inner city is you got to disperse the African American population throughout the, the metropolitan area rather than allowing them to cluster in these little, little pockets inside the cities.  Because remember, 1968, 1970, the 1970 census showed that you had what commonly were called chocolate cities.  You had you know, many of the major cities across the country were either approaching a black majority, or had black majorities, Washington, DC, Detroit [Michigan], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], etc., right.  So his solution was in order to prevent riots and have these, you have to disperse the black population.  Doocey was a big proponent of that notion.  And we always argued about that.
Speaker 1: You, you were trying to think of [John Kenneth] Galbraith or--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not Galbraith.
Speaker 1: Vallor [ph.].
Speaker 2: The other one, the other guy who we fought about, god what was his name?  Can't remember these names, who wrote the book on city--these are all books on--talking about how blacks had in effect messed up.  We were the problems.  That the reason the cities had gone bust.  And it was--the only way to solve the problem is to move blacks out of the city and redevelop the inner core of the city, bring whites back in. Well that was always a big, big fight.  So--
Story_ID: 131005
Speaker 1: We leave [Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois] there and we go, I go to work at the Urban League after the master's program.  Well actually during the last months of the master's program.  Because I was also before going to Urban League, I worked at Booz, Allen and Hamilton [sic, Booz Allen Hamilton], it's a consulting firm, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this was during the--right after the riots they had this program called the Concentrated Employment Program, CET, right, which was one of these patch-up programs to help, you know, keep blacks busy and, you know which is not really--giving a Band-Aid on a, on cancer.  And so the guy who gave me, helped me get the job, was, was named Adams.  And he was a, he was a full time worker there.  And I think I was like the second or third person to work in this consulting firm.  Young guy just coming out of graduate school.  And prior to that I had worked at the--what was called the Urban Education Center at--which was on the West Side.  The, the forerunner of Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois].  In fact in that same area before they built that building.  And he was a--one of the fellow teachers there.  And this was right during the riot and that's when again I came in contact again with Andy Thompson and [HM] Harold Pates because they were planning a National Black Teachers' Association conference.  And they introduced me to the famous Harold Cruz in the book, 'The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual.'  And so we go from the Urban Education Center to the Urban League, from the Urban League to Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois], okay?
Story_ID: 131006
Speaker 1: Anthony Downs is the person.
Speaker 2: Anthony Downs was the person.  And, and Anthony Downs was the guy who came with the idea of dispersal, racial dispersal of blacks to suburban areas.  And believe it or not, that notion was pretty much adopted by HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] and we see the results of it as we speak.  Washington, D.C. is probably the best example of that.
Speaker 1: I'm just curious if you could just kind of outline for us how that dispersal takes place.  What happens first?  We're, we're in inner city messing it up according to the economist Downs, and then to get us to disperse, what did he do?
Speaker 2: Well first of all they, they destroyed the--they--after the riots of 1968 and the destruction occurred in the inner city as a result of the, the riots, and they simply said well look, we won't redevelop it.  We'll let it lay foul like what happens on the West Side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the community groups, they're calling for the government to do something to rebuild the place.  No matter whether they're promised it or not, it doesn't get done and what happens, they--
Speaker 2: Second point.  They allow the public housing to deteriorate to the point where the, the inner city residents themselves are begging to have it destroyed so they can get out.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's an interesting point because the people we've interviewed in the past and people I talked to say that when public housing was first established, it wasn't that bad.
Speaker 2: It was considered you know, yeah absolutely.  People, people absolutely loved it because remember these were people who had previously lived in really shacks.  In some cases in the area that we call you know, the Maxwell Street area [Chicago, Illinois], in the--all the way up to the 19--early '60s [1960s], some of those houses in that area didn't even have running water.  And they had wood stoves, right.  up and down State Street prior to the building of Robert Taylor and the public housing, many of those houses were really lean-to shacks and if they were brick, they were, you know really tenements more than, than, than the apartment houses.  So people who actually moved into those new buildings along State Street had, you know, heat, they had air conditioning, they had all the amenities that they did not have in those houses.  And remember now in addition they had organized play for the children, they had gardens, they had activities.  So it was really a big step up from what they had accustomed, been accustomed to, to living in.  Yes, absolutely.  And the politicians loved it because they had a captured vote.  They could turn out that vote and win every time.  And that's why they insisted on having those houses stay in--within a confined area as opposed to spread out around the city.  And, and so that, that made a difference.  But again after--they just sped up the whole deterioration after Harold Washington was elected in 1983 because the, the concentration helped to elect Harold Washington.  So after they said well, we can't have this happen again, so let's break up this concentration of African Americans, disperse them so that this won't ever happen again.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is something that you, you saw in, in this developmental stage in school and have seen it acted out in life.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We, we you know fought about those questions all the time, sure.
Story_ID: 131007
Speaker 1: So yeah, so I leave, I go to the [National] Urban League after Booz Allen Hamilton and I remember the experience at Booz Allen Hamilton was just eye-opening because my assignment, one of my assignments, my major assignment, was East St. Louis, Illinois.  And my brother, you talk about a shock.  East St. Louis was, it was, it was very--it was eye-opening and it was pleasurable on the one hand, but it was also shocking on the other because East St. Louis even at that time, and this was like '69 [1969] was still--it was in, in a state of deterioration.  And they had people on, on welfare.  Many of the people in this town were on welfare.
Speaker 2: Now when, when you--I have to ask this because--but were you involved in Model Cities at all?
Speaker 1: No, no this was, this was strictly--
Speaker 2: Cause I know there was a Model Cities region four conference.
Speaker 1: There was a model cities program going on around the same time, exactly.
Speaker 2: They, they, they had the Region Four Model Cities Conference in East St. Louis in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I was in it, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you know what I'm talking about in terms of the, the state of deterioration, right?  So I was the expert.  Now here I am, this young kid coming out of you know, out of graduate school don't know very much of anything.  I got my instruction; they tell me what to do.  So I go into this meeting and the, the leadership says everybody sit down, we sat at a big table.  Starks is going to tell us what to do.  I'm sitting there and I go through this whole thing about how we going to organize to get people jobs and the fact that we're going to go across the river to McDouglas, Douglas--what is the big aircraft company?
Speaker 2: McDonald Douglas.
Speaker 1: Yeah, McDonald Douglas, right.  And how the hotel companies and all these people going to cooperate.  And they sit there and they listen.  And then an argument ensues.  So the leadership take out a gun, put it on the table and said shut up.  So, I mean it was, it was really very funny.  It's funny on the one hand.  So toward the end of the duty we had everything organized.  And they said well now we're going to have somebody to run the program.  Said Starks we want you to come down and run the program.  And I said no way would I come here and run this program because I didn't, didn't want to deal with that level of, of confusion--
Story_ID: 131008
Speaker 1: Now you know who was from there, don't you?  Pharoah Sanders' top man, Leon Thomas.
Speaker 2: Right, he's from Cairo [Illinois] and East St. Louis [Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.  And his, his brother, I met him at the time and didn't know who he was at the time.  But later come, you know, began to really understand Leon.  Now Leon passed by the way.  But absolutely fell in love with his, his singing and his collaboration with Pharoah Sanders.  And interestingly enough, I go to Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois], the first Director of the Black Studies Program at Northern.  And have this cultural program where we have a speaker at the beginning of the, the evening program.  And then we follow it with a concert.  And one of the first people that we line up is Pharoah Sanders.  And the students who did not know who he was, was sitting there saying who is this guy?  But when he finished, they were absolutely enthralled with Leon Thomas and Pharoah Sanders.  We brought them in and of course we had Nina Simone, we had all these people.  And, and the speakers we had were just fabulous also because we bought in Jerome Bennett, we brought in, you know all these high, high-level speakers.  And, and the way I would get them to, to listen to the speakers, I would close--bring them in, listen to the speakers and then have a concert with the, with the, with the big--Osibisa, we invited Osibisa.  Now where is Osibisa these days?  I haven't heard from them.
Speaker 2: I, I don't know if they're still performing together or not.
Speaker 1: But they were, they were fabulous.
Speaker 2: But they were like a group from Ghana primarily.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But they had Ghana--people from the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  We had--and one night I will never forget.  This was like '72 [1972], just before I came here to Northeastern [Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], we had a concert and we had--god, the movie had just come out about the dope dealers.  What was the name of the film?
Speaker 2: 'Super Fly'?
Speaker 1: 'Super Fly', right.  And so the, the guy who--the musical man who had, who had done the music for--
Speaker 2: Curtis Mayfield.
Speaker 1: Curtis Mayfield was performing, right.  On--in the theater on, on the, on--in our theater.  Now across the way in the stadium was Elton John.  Can you imagine on one night.  So the students were just--
Speaker 2: This is in DeKalb.
Speaker 1: This is in DeKalb, Illinois.  The students were in heaven.  They would go from--they went from, you know, hearing Elton John to coming over to hear Curtis Mayfield.  And then we had the guy who was the speaker that night was if I'm not mistaken, John Ali [sic], not John Ali.  God, he was a, he was the editor of 'Muhammad Speaks.'  God, what was his name?  John Wood, Woodford.  I think he was named John Woodford.  Anyway sort of a young guy.  But anyway we had, we had this whole mixture.  It might have been Woodford if I'm not mistaken.  Anyway, but that was the way we got them in.  But that, but can you imagine having that much talent on one campus in a little small town on one night?
Story_ID: 131009
Speaker 1: So you had, you had a busy, busy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And by the way, I just went back to Northern [Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] back in October to talk about the anniversary of that, that program coming together.  And, and the guy who, who--interesting, I was working at the [National] Urban League at the time.  And they called the Urban League, we need somebody to come out and speak on Black History Month.  And so I was in the research department at, at the Urban League.  Guess who worked with me at the Urban League?  Zakia Williams [ph.].  You know Zakia?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Zakia worked for me.  And she said, I never will forget.  She said I got a friend that I want you to meet.  And I said who is it?  She said Arnetta Bush.  So I met Arnetta Bush [ph.], right, cause they were best buddies, right.  So anyway, so I go to Northern and make the speech.  And one of the student leaders, Gerald, Gerald Durley [ph.] heard me and Frank Walker.  Frank was, was working at the time.  He had just gotten his master's and he was working in the program called the Chance Program.  Which was at that time run by a man named Deacon Davis.  And they said we want to start a black studies program.  This is our man.  So they--after the speech they took me down to the little, little meeting room and said we want you to be our director and I didn't think much of it.  So I got back to, to Urban League and the next week they called me and said we want you to come out and, and interview.  Now [urban economist James] Banovetz had just gotten there from Loyola [University, Chicago, Illinois].  So when he heard about it, he said no problem, I'll vouch for you.  So they--we pushed through the Black Studies Program and I became the director, the first director of the Black Studies Program.  And then of course I got married in, in '71 [1971], and my wife got pregnant and I decided I did not want my child to be raised in DeKalb, Illinois where at the time there was probably five permanent black families in the whole town.  And it--at the same time I, I wanted to finish, you know the Ph.D., so I came back to Chicago.  Now at the end of the master's program I had applied to [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] for a law degree and decided--I don't know what made me want to do it.  I switched from, from law to the Ph.D. program in, in political science.  But anyway, came back to Chicago and was invited by Carol Adams who was running a program here [Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] dealing with veterans and also there was a combination of working in that program and, and teaching in the undergraduate program, which had just gotten started cause you know this program started as a graduate program.  This was the first undergraduate cohort that was started here and I taught in the program, been here since.
Speaker 1: So this is 1970--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 2: August '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Carol Adams who invited me.  And I had met Carol prior to that in this building, by the way, when we were working with some programs dealing with, with gangs, dealing with the Blackstone Rangers and all--and that was during the time that the building was beginning to be renovated.  And of course I knew--heard who was the architect that, that let--actually renovated the, the design and renovated the building.  So [HM] Carol Adams was one of the people who, who, who was working here at the time with Andy and we all, you know, sat around and talked about stuff.  Then I went away to Northern, but we stayed in touch.  And then when, when this job came available, I, you know I said well hell, I want to go back to Chicago anyway, so I might as well go and take the job.  So took it.
Story_ID: 131010
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're teaching undergraduate courses here [Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: And going to school in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And going to school at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Determined not to have my daughter--now the irony of all of this is my daughter was conceived in, at, in DeKalb at Northern [Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois], right.  Guess where she's living right now?
Speaker 1: In DeKalb.
Speaker 2: DeKalb, Illinois.  We always tease her about that.  The fact that she is a, an ocular surgeon and after she finished her fellowship in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], one of her mentors said there was a job in, in Sycamore, which is next door to DeKalb.  And they need, you know a, a surgeon.  So why don't you go out there?  And they offered her a decent salary, so she's, she's out there now.  But she's determined to get back to Chicago, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right so--well what was the cen--who was here at the center when you got, when you got here?
Speaker 2: At that time Nancy Arnez was the director, [HM] Jacob [H.] Carruthers [Jr.] of course was second in command.  Don Bailey was on the staff.  Bill Smith, Elkin Satoli, Anderson Thompson.  Later comes, in 1975 comes good old [HM] Conrad [Walter] Worrill, right.  And we had some people who were doing part-time stuff like Lorenzo Martin was doing a part time course.  I think [HM Harold] Pates might have done a part time course here and there.  [HM] Carol Adams was on staff working.  But that was the basic group.  Dr.--good, what--Joseph Pentecost was our statistician.  Fabulous, I mean the man knew everything about statistics and he taught a statistics course for our mas--and I was--when I first came--my first duties was supervising the master's papers.  And you know--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, so all the while like Comm--Communiversity is going on here on Saturdays.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you got the undergraduate program and the graduate program.
Speaker 2: Undergraduate program, graduate program, right.
Speaker 1: Had the building been renovated by that time?
Speaker 2: No, it was in the process of being renovated.  And eventually we had to move out of the building and we went down to 4500 on Drexel [Avenue], to that--which was the old Singer mansion, the Singer sewing machine people built the mansion. And at one point was a juvenile home for, for boys.  So, so they built this extension on it.  Now of course it's a condo.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it became--is that the same building that became a black log college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--Charles Knox.
Speaker 1: Charles Knox is the, yeah--
Speaker 2: Right, right, absolutely yeah, yeah, absolutely yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, that's the exact, exact place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was when Conrad was, was invited to the faculty as a member, and he was just finishing his Ph.D. at [University of] Wisconsin [-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I heard they, they had the choice between Conrad and Colby Cambon [ph.], Joseph Baldwin.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, and we chose Conrad.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: And Cam--Cam Baldwin of course went, subsequently went to Florida.
Speaker 1: Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], yeah.
Story_ID: 131011
Speaker 1: So well in '72 [1972], now were you involved in--I know a lot of things were going on nationally then.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: The African Liberation--
Speaker 2: Yes, African Liber--
Speaker 1: --Support Committee.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  The first African Liberation Day.  The naming of the park, the Malcolm X Park, remember?
Speaker 1: Right, yeah what we call--now yeah in [Washington] D.C., the Malcolm X Park in D.C., right.
Speaker 2: Right.  And now let's go back to '69 [1969] when the, the Panthers were murdered.
Speaker 1: Right, Fred Hampton.
Speaker 2: Fred Hampton.  I was working at the [National] Urban League at the time and one of my coworkers was John Higginson who is now at Amherst University [Amherst, Massachusetts].  And history teacher; we were both in the Research Department.  We were both in graduate school at the time.  And John and I after the murder, we walked into Mr. Bill Barry's office, crazy as we were.  And we said to Mr. Barry, Mr. Barry, why don't the Urban League adopt the ten point program of the Black Panther Party?  And I can't tell you on camera what he told us.  At the end of the, this cursing us out, he said get out of my office.  He said I haven't taught you all anything.  And of course we were half--I guess we were half sincere.  But I guess we knew he was not going to do it, but we just, I guess we were sort of wanted to provoke him a little bit at any rate.
Speaker 1: Now where, where was--who did--was, was Al Raby a part of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], or what was Al Raby doing?
Speaker 2: Al Raby was a part of CORE at the time I think.  And he was sort of--well his, his big job was head of CCCO, the Coordinating Council of Community Organizations, which included by the way, Jorja English [HM Jorja Palmer] who was no longer--at that time not married to Lu Palmer [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II].  She later becomes, I think she marries Lu in about '70 [1970] or '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I met her when I was working at the Urban League when she was Georgia English.  Met Lu Palmer around the same time because Lu was working for the [Chicago] Defender and later starts working for the Chicago Daily News if I'm not mistaken.  Interesting thing about that; I again, you know read newspapers and was quite involved.  So I write this crazy letter in calligraphy by the way, 'cause I had taken calligraphy.  Couldn't write well, flunked penmanship in grammar school.  So I said I'm gone take a, a calligraphy course to learn how to write, right.  So I write this letter in calligraphy to the editor of the Chicago Daily News and say you need a black columnist; I am your man, right.  So of course they write me back and say you are young, don't know what the hell you're talking about.  But they hired Lu Palmer, right.  And of course Lu quits later and forms the Black Express in about 1971, '72 [1972] forms the Black--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he quit over articles he wrote about the Black Panther, the murder of Fred Hampton.
Speaker 2: Precisely, precisely.  But yeah that was, that was interesting.
Story_ID: 131012
Speaker 1: And I was--there was a guy named, at the Urban League in '69 [1969], probably '69 [1969], named Hamp McKinney.  Hamp McKinney was an assistant to Bill Barry.  And he said to me one day we want to put together, he said we got some money to put together an urban, what do they call it, urban research inst--what was the--urban, god, but anyway, this, this thing.  So anyway he, he said I want you to go to the meetings with me.  So I would go to all the meetings with him and I remember him appealing to the, the only black senator at the time, the, the Urban Institute, that was what it was called.  The, the Black Strategy Center.  The Black Strategy Center, that's what it was called.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And of course it was--he and I used to go to these meetings downtown with all the big white folks and I'd sit there--
Speaker 2: This one--Conrad referred to this--Archie Hargraves.
Speaker 1: Archie Hargraves.
Speaker 2: [HM] CT Vivian.
Speaker 1: CT Vivian, right CT.  I remember now CT got in trouble when he read this, this press release that Georgia Palmer had, Georgia English had written in which she said all the white people should get out of the black community at sundown.  But he--he got off the plane, she handed him the, the press release and he read it without having proofed it, right.  But anyway, yeah CT, Archie Hargraves, Bill Barry, all of them were involved in the, the--setting up the Black Strategy Center.  And Conrad of course worked for them; he was one of the--also--
Speaker 2: He was an intern I think.
Speaker 1: As an intern, right.  I never worked for them, but I was in the, in the group that helped to plan the whole thing.  I was--I would go to the meetings with Hamp McKinny and take notes and come back and discuss it.  But it was really fascinating to me that these people were giving these just all this money to the black group to put this thing together.
Speaker 2: It was like nine hundred thousand dollars or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was interesting.  And that was a lot of money at that time.  Yes, that was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it might be now too for some.
Speaker 1: Right anybody I guess.  But anyway that was, that was very interesting.  So you could see that given that reality why Mr. Barry would have the reaction that he had to, to us about adopting the [Black Panthers'] ten-point program.  At the same time I meet this character that I will never forget.  My, my, my good friend who was not Abdul Alkalimat at the time, he was Gerald McWorter.  And Gerald was at the U of C [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] doing his Ph.D.  I was at, at Chicago and at the [National] Urban League working.  And we'd meet and he, he comes over and he lectures me about what the Urban League should be doing, right.  And of course you know I, I agree with him but there was nothing I could do because I was only a little research specialist.  And you know the research we did was primarily on demographics, the changing demographics of the city, of, of Chicago.  The, you know the, the work patterns, etc.  So it was sort of mild level research; nothing very you know, intense.  And he was jumping up and down about what we should be doing, and I agree with.  But you know I said look Gerald, if you want to change, go talk to Mr. Barry.  And of course he didn't.  But anyway so I met, met him.  But Gerald, very bright young man, very, very bright.  And very reasonable at the time, but later he becomes Abdul Alkalimat.
Story_ID: 131013
Speaker 1: He [Abdul Alkalimat] becomes in some ways I guess the nemesis of the Black Nationalist forces in the city.
Speaker 2: Down in Atlanta [Georgia].  Cause he leaves and goes down to Atlanta and has a run-in with the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] family and, and the leadership, the black leadership in Atlanta, yeah, yeah.  Now when I go to Northern [Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] interestingly enough, John Bracey was on the faculty.
Speaker 1: Who wrote 'Black Nationalism.'
Speaker 2: There you go, had just finished writing that.
Speaker 1: August Meyer, yeah.
Speaker 2: Which we use in our classes at, at Northern.  And Christopher Reed came on staff with us.  And Chris of course as you know has written all these books on, on black Chicago [Illinois].  Another man, young man who died I guess maybe in the '70s [1970s], Randy Evans I think was his name.  Randy was a theologian and he had written--he was, he taught our religion courses in the Black Studies Program at Northern.  But yeah we had a, we had a good, good faculty and, and did good things.  And later Nelson Stevens was also a member of our, our faculty.  Nelson of course was in art.  And Nelson was a member of AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists], which included as you know, [HM] Jeff Donaldson.
Speaker 1: Calvin Jones.
Speaker 2: Calvin Jones, all that, that whole group.  So we had a very good little round group of people.  And it was at that point that we come into the knowledge of, and I keep hearing this name, of [HM] Maulana Karenga.  And I said now who is Maulana Karenga?  So we finally get around, he comes to Chicago and we see him on television--
Story_ID: 131014
Speaker 1: You know whites were being pushed out of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  CORE [Congress on Racial Equality] is dying because people consider it not radical enough.  [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had been killed.
Speaker 2: This is '66 [1966], '67 [1967]?
Speaker 1: Sixty, '67 [1967], '68 [1968], right.
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1966], '68 [1968], okay.
Speaker 1: So we--you know I go to see him, I see him and fascinating, absolutely fascinating.  And so later we hook up and, and become friends and, and the whole bit.  But it was, it was an exciting time, very exciting time.
Speaker 2: Speaking of [HM] Maulana [Karenga], did you remember the first Kwanzaa in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to remember who put it together.  I can't even remember.
Speaker 2: I heard rumors over the years that Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran] had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Phil was--
Speaker 2: Tiamba [ph.].
Speaker 1: I'm so glad you mentioned Phil.  You know where I met Phil?  Believe it or not, nine--this must have been '63 [1963], '64 [1964] and I met Phil at the same time as I met Abena--Joan Brown [HM Abena Joan P. Brown], right.  Now remember Abena at the time was writing the show 'The Bird of the Iron Feather,' right.  And she and Benny Arnez, now I don't know where Benny is at the moment, put together a restaurant called the Algiers Club on Stony Island [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] and I lived just two, three blocks east on 67th [Street] cause the, the Algiers Club was at 60, around 68th and Stony.  And I saw these people fixing this place up and I knock on the door and I said you know, what's happening here?  Saw Benny Arnez, introduced myself to him.  And Joan of course ever smoking, what's your name?  And she been--we been fighting and loving each other ever since, you know.  She--and so she introduces me to Phil Cohran.  Now Phil at the time was the first guy that I know that introduced the thumb piano to Chicago.  Actually to the nation cause I had never heard anybody--the thumb piano.  He was a musician that--
Speaker 2: He electrified, that's one thing.
Speaker 1: Electrified, absolutely, and he was the, the house band for the Algiers Club.  Didn't last very long, but it was an excellent idea.  It was a, it was based on the idea of bringing African, authentic African culture to the Chicago inner city, right.  Because they had the Alhambra Club which was down on Michigan [Avenue], around 13th and Michigan, didn't last long.  But the Algiers Club was supposed to be the--you know the real thing.  And then we had the Bird Cage which was over on Stony down around 71st Street.  And that's where you saw people like Grover Washington.  And then if you went to 63rd and Cottage, you would see people like the organist, god, what was the--McKie Fitzhugh's place [Disc Jockey Show Lounge] was the name of the place.  McKie, you would sneak in.  Even though you weren't old enough, you would sneak through and lie and say you were twenty-one when actually you weren't and get in, 'cause they had good jazz.  And of course down at, down on, in, in Old Town they had the Plugged Nickel where you would go and hear good jazz.  But I was introduced to jazz by my aunts and uncles and my mother's [Lula Ella Starks'] friends from ten, eleven, twelve years old.  They would make me sit down and listen to Dinah Washington.  I was introduced to Dinah Washington's son cause he, you know Dinah's mother lived on the West Side on Trumbull [Avenue].  And her sisters taught at, at Whitney Young, taught my son at Whitney Young High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: She came out of [Wendell] Phillips [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] didn't she?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  And so I knew her son.  And he's a, he's a drummer.  But anyway, so we used to listen to Dinah Washington, Miles Davis and Coltrane.  And they just there and you listen.  I was immersed in, in jazz from a very early age.  Obviously end up to, you know, James Brown and everybody else.  But also knew, knew the jazz thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Loved it, absolutely loved it.
Story_ID: 131015
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay now while we're in '72 [1972], the Center for Inner City Studies [Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: August '72 [1972], right.
Speaker 1: So you said--we were talking about African Liberation Day at one point and now you--
Speaker 2: Again, I don't remember who put it together, that's a good question.  I have to go back and search in my mind to find out who put the first one together.
Speaker 1: Well they had something called African Liberation Support Committee, National, Ron Daniels was involved in it and some other people too.
Speaker 2: But I remember us having the, the first ADL [sic ALD, African Liberation Day] march was with Bob Brown.  'Cause remember now Bob and I were in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] together.  I met Bob when he was high school, in high school as a teenager, right.  And he and I met [HM] Fannie Rushing and Sylvia Fisher, Lawrence Landry, all these people who were SNCC people, right.  And we had a, had a office right here on--at the end of, of--
Speaker 1: Drexel [Avenue]?
Speaker 2: Drexel, and, and Oakwood Boulevard, right.  And then later they moved further south and of course everything sort of disintegrated.  But yeah we were members.  And god, who else was that, involved in that.  God, what's his name?  I'm drawing a blank.
Speaker 1: African Liberation Day in seven--
Speaker 2: Yeah, African Liberation Day.
Speaker 1: The, the one here--
Speaker 2: Arnetta Bush.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill], Andy [Thompson], [HM Harold] Pates, Stan Willis [HM Standish E. Willis], John Higginson, all of us were involved in that, that first ADL [sic ALD] march on African Liberation Day, absolutely.  And remember now this was around the same time that Conrad and the rest of us were picketing the [South Africa national rugby union team] Springboks 'cause Springboks came to Chicago shortly after that and we were picketing the Springboks.  And that's why it's very interesting that right now we have the Springboks movie 'Invictus.'
Speaker 1: Right, Invictus, right it's about the same rugby team.
Speaker 2: Anyway we won't even go into that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I did the flyer for that, boycott the Springboks in the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yes you did, exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 131016
Speaker 1: So we, we mentioned [HM] Phil Cohran and just reminded me that there was a--the artists and the political activists had a, seemed to have a common cause in Chicago [Illinois] in those [days] and worked together.  I thought about the Afro-Arts Theater was--
Speaker 2: Afro-Arts Theater right down the street, right.  And, and [Anas] Lukeman, I remember Mr. Lukeman.  Mr. Lukeman, I met Mr. Lukeman back in the early '60s [1960s] 'cause he was a, he was a--he used to sell suits and clothing.  And he would come around with his suitcase and to people's houses and show clothing.  And Mr. Lukeman was very interesting 'cause he always had a story to tell you about his travels to Africa and in particular, South Africa.  So we would all be interested to hear him talk about his travels.  Course Mr. Lukeman passed away about ten years ago or so.
Speaker 1: It's Lukeman, describe him for those who are--
Speaker 2: Mr. Lukeman was maybe Kamau's complexion, tall, sort of, sort of muscular build.  Actually could probably pass for an Arab to be very frank about it.  Very dignified man.  Spoke, you know, different languages, the whole bit.  And he was one of the people--cause he, he formed the Black Hand Society, right.
Speaker 1: Did it, was it formed as the Malcolm X Black Hand Society, or just the Black Hand Society?
Speaker 2: I think it was the Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: I know it became the Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: He was a good friend.  I think he was a friend of Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: Sure, the first color picture of Malcolm X I ever saw was--
Speaker 2: Exactly, absolutely, right.  And he had his little coterie of followers that, that, that helped him run the Afro Arts Theater.  And remember the Afro Arts was--used to have just excellent jazz musicians coming in to perform at that theater.  And that was the headquarters of the, the Black Hand Society.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I didn't realize that.  Cause I've heard about it in relationship to Phil Cohran running it, but was Lukeman there first?
Speaker 2: I think they might have come around the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not absolutely sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's after--you had Lukeman there, Malcolm X Black Hand Society.  There, there's a photo that was--appeared in 'Ebony' of Sammy Davis, Jr. with a shirt that said Malcolm X Black Hand Society and Mr. Lukeman grabbing his hand and Sammy Davis looks perplexed in the photo.  Now I don't know what that's about, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that was, that's absolutely true.
Speaker 1: Now he, he'd wear the brimless fur hat like Malcolm.  And he looked like, to me he looked like [W.E.B.] DuBois which he wore spats and everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very formal, very formal man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a rumor that he's actually the illegitimate offspring of W.E.B. DuBois.  Now I, I heard that from one of your colleagues, but I won't--I did hear it.
Speaker 2: Well I tell you what.  In that same vein, one of the people that I absolutely admired and didn't know a lot about, I only met later, was Sister Christine Johnson.  Now remember Christine was a contemporary, not really contemporary, but--well she was a contemporary of Kwame Nkrumah, right.  Had gone to Ghana way back, you know and, and actually nurtured Kwame Nkrumah when he studied in America cause you know he went to Jeff City, went to Jefferson--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Lincoln University, Jeff City, Missouri.  And lived in Chicago [Illinois] back and forth, and she entertained him when he came to Chicago, and actually introduced him to W.E.B. DuBois, right.  Sister Christine was the first principal of the--well the, the Nation of Islam University.  It was Muhammad University.
Speaker 1: Claire.
Speaker 2: Claire Muhammad University, right.  And of course there was a big controversy about the school, whether it was legitimate.  They didn't want to license it, didn't want to accredit it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it eventually became Muhammad's University of Islam.
Speaker 2: That's right.  But Sister Christine, Sister Christine was also--she knew Lukeman also.  And they were, they were, they were tight.  The sad thing about Sister Christine is that by the time she passed away, many of her papers and her belongings had been scattered.  And we don't know what happened to the bulk of them, but she had a rich, rich history of--and probably the last real direct link to people like Malcolm and DuBois, Lukeman and those folks, and Nkrumah because she was very close to them.  She was at Nkrumah's inauguration.
Speaker 1: Yes, I remember her here in the early '90s [1990s] in this very room.
Speaker 2: Right, and talking about that, right, absolutely.  She was, she was quite a lady--
Story_ID: 131017
Speaker 1: Now what about--
Speaker 2: And Ishmael Flory.
Speaker 1: Ishmael Flory, right, and, and his wife [Cathern Davis Flory] too.
Speaker 2: And his wife, right.  But Ish--Ish met him when I was--again, teenager, first year in college.  Ish was always, I mean Ish obviously an avowed Communist member, never veered from it, never ashamed of it.  Was always giving you advice and telling you about the Communist party, Soviet Union, what the Soviets were doing in Africa; and giving you a book to read or a pamphlet.  Margaret, met her when, you know when I was young.  Margaret had the, the, the museum, right, even before they moved into the building where they are now.  And again--
Speaker 1: [HM] Margaret Burroughs.
Speaker 2: Margaret Burroughs, right.  So and Jim Black.  So you met all these people who had influences on you.  And you know, constantly teaching you, giving you-[HM] Abena Joan [P.] Brown, you know, talking about you, beating you up, you know.  And then hugging you after she talked about you.  But absolute love with all of them.  And, and that was a very enriching thing in my life.
Speaker 1: What about [F.H.] Hammurabi?  Did you know him?
Speaker 2: Yes, Mr. Hammurabi, I didn't meet Mr. Hammurabi until I, I had seen him but didn't really meet him and become close to him until I start working here at the Center [for Inner City Studies, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago].  He used to come almost every week and bring us books, discuss ideas with us, tell us about his life.  His name was Mr. Rob, Mr. Rob was at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] back in the '20s [1920's].  And one of his teachers was Bronisław Malinowski.  And he was a very bright man.  Mr. Hammurabi was, was just a jewel, absolute jewel.
Speaker 1: Founder of the House of Knowledge, the calendar books and such.

Speaker 1: All right now well tell us about the Gary [Indiana] convention, National Black Political Assembly.
Speaker 2: Right, I was at Northern [Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] at the time, you know in the Black Studies Program and at Chicago.  And two of my very close friends in [University of] Chicago were intimately involved 'cause they were back in Chicago [Illinois], and they worked with [Richard H. Newhouse] Newhouse.  And Newhouse asked them to, to work as the, as assistant to them.  Linda, what was Linda's last name.  God, at any rate, so they went, they went to Gary.  I was, I--I think I might have attended one session during the whole thing, but I sent students to Gary and was in touch with all the people.  Now I had met Strickland, who wrote 'The Black Agenda' for Gary.  I had met him down--when he was working in Atlanta [Georgia] at the Institute of Black World.  Now remember now--
Speaker 1: Bill Strickland, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bill Strickland.  Ron Daniels adopted the name later.  But the original Institute of Black World was [HM] Vincent Harding and Bill Strickland was working in the Institute along with Dodson, [HM] Howard Dodson who is now at the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, Harlem, New York].  So we met all of them a year earlier.  They then come with people like man at the University of Maryland, my buddy Warren Walters and all of them helped construct the, the, 'The Black Agenda' which was very famous in, in the '72 [1972] convention.  I knew [HM Richard] Hatcher for instance, because as I said I've always had this relationship with Gary, Indiana.  And in the--when I worked in the CEP Program, the Concentrated Employment Program, one of my sites was Gary, Indiana.  And Hatcher had just gotten elected as the mayor of, of Gary.  So we had this relationship and I was heading the program, so I knew him.  And, and then of course I knew [HM] Jesse [L. Jackson], Jesse lived across the street from me on, on Ridgeland.  And knew him and all his family.  Had met [HM] Harry Belafonte, cause all these people would come to Jesse's house and I would--
Speaker 1: Was Jesse--this is '72 [1972], so he was pretty known.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--we had the, you know later we had the, the, the Black Expo in which I would bring my students from Northern.  The black choir, we had a black choir at Northern, we had a black drama group, we had a black combo, we had a black, you know all these different groups.  And we would bring them to the Black Expo and they would perform, they thought they were really doing something great, and they were.  I mean it was really a big thing.  So I had the connection to Gary.  And I knew of course Newhouse, Newhouse was a, was--I had worked on the Newhouse campaign when he ran for the state senate.  But for some reason I only come, came to maybe one session or so.  But that was, that was quite, quite an impactful thing.  It changed the whole course of black politics because this was the beginning of the emphasis on electoral politics for African Americans.  Prior to that, we didn't have the, the numbers in the cities to elect mayors, etc.  Cause this was right on the heels of the election of the mayor of Cleveland [Ohio], then the mayor of--
Speaker 1: Carl Stokes.
Speaker 2: Carl Stokes, and then of course Hatcher in Gary and of course you know we had the upsurge and for the black president, [HM] Dick Gregory had run for mayor of the city of Chicago [Illinois].  So we had this, this whole forum going.
Speaker 1: He had write me in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: With the book, you know.
Speaker 2: With the book, right.
Speaker 1: Write me in.
Speaker 2: So--and, and he, and remember Benjamin--the baby doctor, Benjamin Spock and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had run before President of the United States.  I think that was, was that, that was '68 [1968] I think.  Was it '68 [1968] or--but anyway they were, they were write-ins.  But anyway so we had all this, this format.
Story_ID: 131019
Speaker 1: After that [National Black Political Assembly] comes the National Black Assembly which Andy [Thompson] was, Andy and [HM Harold] Pates were involved in.  The National Congress with Imamu Amiri Baraka.  And here's the, the thing about Baraka.  Interesting enough, when I was at Northern [Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois], I bought Baraka in to speak.  And my office right now would have a sketch of Baraka because Dale Spann, very famous artist in Chicago [Illinois] was a student, a graduate student at, in art.  And when Baraka spoke, he said I'm a sketcher, so he sat there and sketched him.  Baraka of course had just published his Blues People book.  And he spoke, you know became very, you know close to him.  We corresponded you know, and told him of course that I had met his brother, I mean his cousin and we were close and all that.  So Baraka of course was at the convention in Gary [Indiana].
Speaker 2: He was representing the Congress of African People, the CAP.
Speaker 1: There you go, there you go.  And of course Andy [Thompson] was involved in the Congress of African People, so was [HM Harold] Pates, so was Lorenzo Martin.  I don't think [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill] was involved in that, but, but Andy was, right.  And of course we were very--we were also in touch with Sam Patch.  Sam Patch of course was an assistant to Harold Washington.  Harold was at that time in the [Illinois] state, state senate.  And you know we bought Harold in to speak at the university all the time.  And at both Northern as well as here [Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois].  And Harold was sort of on the fringe of the national movement, but he didn't, he never dissed it, but he was still pretty much attached to the regular Democratic party.  He only later fell out with them.  But--
Speaker 2: Seems like Sam Patch was kind of like a, a link between Harold Washington and--
Speaker 1: And the National Committee.  Yeah, absolutely you got it.  So yeah, we--that was an exciting time for us.  So from '77 [1977], I mean '72 [1972], '73 [1973], '75 [1975], '75 [1975] was another key year because that was when Conrad and Tom Todd and the rest--Sam, I mean Al Sampson [HM Albert Richard Sampson], all of us put together those, those conferences on, on black violence that were held at churches around, around the city in which we presented Harold Washington, okay.  Now this is going back a little bit further, 1970 Harold and Patch put together the first time I can remember, a--they, they began to talk about redistricting, something that most people never even thought about, right.  But this was on the heels of the federal courts demanding redistricting in which people were involved.  So I was on the fringes of that, and that was with [HM] Miss Jorja English [Palmer].  Now Jorja of course was very, very involved in almost everything.  She was a big person with Sam, with Al Raby in CCCO [Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors], right.  And of course Jorja absolutely brilliant.  One that she was--actually Jorja was a genius.  She had very high IQ [intelligence quotient].  Could write flawless, read everything, right.  Many of the pamphlets and leaflets that we, we put out from that point all the way up to--and through the Washington campaign, were authored by Jorja English.  But any--she and Reverend Mack, Reverend James Mack, were very involved in CCCO and they, they were the people that helped to bring Dr. [Martin Luther] King to Chicago in 1966.  And they were the ones who, who, who coached King when he got here and pushed him as far to the left as they could.  Cause he, he went as far as he, he wanted to, but they were insistent that he, he be more aggressive than, than he was.  The other side, the moderate side was being pushed by people like Bill Barry and Al Raby.  But James Mack and, and Jorja Palmer were pushing him further to the left.  And [HM] CT Vivian and those folks, okay.  So meet all these people.  And all these people have very profound effect on, on my political development, right.
Story_ID: 131020
Speaker 1: Now, now didn't you, you wrote something that--you, you challenged the, the apportionment of the--yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now that was 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay, you--okay.  But seeds are being sown now for that I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.  Here's the interesting thing about that.  Nineteen eighty [1980], we--it was Lu Palmer [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] 'cause I was--me and--Lou and I, you know hooked up at that point.  Lu and I had a meeting in which we said--there was a dispute between Harold Washington and [HM] Gus Savage.  And both had drawn a map of the, the way they wanted the district to be run.  Now Lu didn't tell anybody, but I think Gus pretty much understood that [HM] Jorja [Palmer] had worked with Sam Patch to put Washington's version together.  And so, so we--Lou and I called this meeting at the [National] Urban League in which we were going to bring in, let both sides present their, their map.  And so the first map was presented by Luanna Peters, former deputy to Rod Blagojevich, right and Paul Davis.  Paul Davis of course is a PR [public relations] young man who also worked in the Harold Washington Administration.  They come in and they do a brilliant job.  Then comes Sam Patch, and Lu and I pretend to be neutral, right.  And then we vote that the Harold Washington map was better and we go to PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] the next Saturday and present our map at the PUSH meeting.  And, and then I get this call from Gus Savage and he says I mean I can't repeat the words that he said.
Speaker 1: I can imagine.
Speaker 2: And he says I told people on the national radio show and a professor at the university is going against me, pushing me out of the suburbs.  He said you--I said Congressman Gus, don't, don't, don't do that.  But anyway Gus and I were still friends but he always talked about me for that.  But anyway Gus and, and, and, and Harold had this love/hate relationship going for all of Harold's life.  They genuinely loved each other, but they always--they were rivals from, from college cause they both went to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], right, along with what's her name, the real estate man--
Speaker 1: [HM] Dempsey Travis?
Speaker 2: Dempsey Travis, right, and then the Johnsons, right.  So this is all gearing up for the race in '83 [1983] for mayor because we had already been talking about that.  Now at the same time Crowe, believe it or not, I, I stopped at--let's go back to 1980.  My good friend who I'd known from college, Joe Gardner, right.  Joe at the time was working for a place called the--what was that place called?  It was a West Side, it was on the Near West Side and it was called the, the--God, what was the name of the place?  But anyway, anyway interested in housing.  And one of the problems--
Speaker 1: Not, not the Center for Neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Center for Neighborhood Tech--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no it was not Center for Neighborhood--it was something close to that.  But anyway I was at--here at the center and he said we need a research director for this project that we're doing because we're going against--going out against housing, I mean redlining.  So I took a year off from here, went over to be, direct this program.  And when [President Ronald] Reagan was elected, they cut off the money because they didn't want--the insurance industry, they didn't want an attack on redlining.
Story_ID: 131021
Speaker 1: But anyway after that program died, it, it was too late to come back to the university [Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], to the university to teach for the rest of that semester, so I came--Joe [Gardner] was also working for PUSH [People United to Save Humanity].  So I renewed my relationship with [HM] Jesse [L. Jackson] and I started working for PUSH.  So we set up the PITB, which was called the Push International Trade Bureau.  One of the people who wrote the document that set that program up.  And also worked for the--Jesse's education program, which was PUSH Excel.  And also worked as a consultant to Jesse on his issues.
Speaker 2: Now were you working as an advisor to Jesse when he went to Israel that--took that group?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Here's the thing now at the same time that we're talking about electing a mayor of the City of Chicago, the PUSH staff is sitting around talking about Jesse running for president.  And my argument was I'd like to see him run, but I'm afraid for his life.  And I'm saying no, no, no.  And he's saying well, I'm a--I'm concerned obviously.  But you know we need to push this agenda.  And he goes of course and asks other people to run and he would back them.  Nobody took the bait.  'Cause remember now, in '76 [1976], Ron--what's his name, Ron Dellums [HM Ronald Dellums], we had pushed him up to run and he backed up.  [HM] Andrew Young, pushed him up, he didn't want to do it.  So Jesse decided after Harold was elected, that gave Jesse the momentum to, to move.  So them I'm back, now back at, at the university.  So I never will forget in November '82 [1982] there's an election, off-year election.  And we get the results of the election and so Harold [Washington] is in the [U.S.] Congress, so is [HM] Gus [Savage].  And Lu Palmer [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] and Tim Black, Conrad, Al Sampson, all of us meet at Robert's Motel to discuss the possibility of somebody running.  And we had already had what was called a, a--
Speaker 2: Plebiscite.
Speaker 1: A plebiscite.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: To decide who was to be the best candidate.  The names that we had on the list was [HM] Roland Burris, Congressman Washington, who else did we have on there?  A couple other people, but anyway the name the people most wanted was Harold.  But Harold kept saying no, give me fifty thousand new registered voters, a hundred thousand dollars, all this other stuff.
Story_ID: 131022
Speaker 1: So we had this meeting, [HM] Dorothy Tillman was there, all of us, and remember we had just had the boycott on Chicago Fest.  Harold [Washington] participated in that, so did my girl from the West Side, God, I'm really--
Speaker 2: Nancy Jefferson?
Speaker 1: No, no, Stamps.
Speaker 2: Mary Stamps.
Speaker 1: Nancy was a part of it, Mary Stamps.  But Nancy Jefferson was also one of our persons involved in that too.
Speaker 2: This was about the lack of black contracts for anything in the Chicago Fest.  So fest for everybody except black people.
Speaker 1: And we wanted to get rid of [Chicago mayor] Jane Byrne.  Jane Byrne had insulted--had Lu Palmer [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] and, and Dorothy Tillman locked up, remember?  For protesting against the appointment of people on the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] Board and the Board of Education, cause we had a big fight over about, about the Board of Education.  And remember that's when Scott, Mr. Scott who just was, was--
Speaker 2: [HM] Michael Scott [Sr.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Michael Scott has committed suicide, got on the Board of Education.  So at any rate--and [HM] Reggie Robinson, [HM] Renault Robinson was put in as the head of the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority], right.  So we call this meeting and again right after the November election in '82 [1982].  And we dared Harold to run and [HM] Monroe Anderson, God bless him, setting up in the meeting, and just taking notes and Reggie--Renault Robinson.  Now they knew Harold had already decided, but they gone let us sit around and argue and fuss.  And it was Al Sampson who came up with the idea of if Harold runs, we should have a parallel organization and a parallel campaign.  And Conrad said well what should we call it?  Al Sampson said I don't know.  And I think it was Conrad that comes up with the idea of the Task Force for Black Political Empowerment.  So then they look around and say well who can run this?  So now this, this is what they tell me now.  [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill] and Sampson, they said we decided to let Bob run it cause he wasn't running anything.  We were--we already had organizations.  Cause remember Conrad had already formed the Black United Front.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, Sampson had a group, God I've forgotten the name of his group.  But anyway he had a group.  Mercedes Mollette and I were assigned to go out and draw up a plan for Harold's parallel organization, and to come back that Tuesday after this meeting with a plan.  And we met in Room 401 in this building [Northeastern Illinois University Center for Inner City Studies, Chicago, Illinois] and presented it to Harold.  And what we came up with was what was called the 80/80 Plan.  That is we could win if 80 percent of the black community came out to vote, and if that 80 percent gave us 80 percent of their vote, okay.  At the time, we did not know but we had heard, that Richard [J.] Daley was going to run.  And of course that was the ideal situation for us.  Cause remember this time we were still, we still had a primary, okay.  And of course subsequently soon as Richard Daley gets into office, he goes to the state legislature, change the law and eliminates the primary so that he could have a run-off situation, right.  So we come up that Tuesday night and we present this to Harold, he's pleased.  And he from that point, names us the Mau Maus because we were going to be the street people.  Conrad puts together the Blitz Team.  My co--and the Blitz Team of course the people who worked the streets, put out things, and included Oda Mingi [ph.] by the way.  Bob Brown comes in later and he's one of--a part of that Blitz Team also.  But my duty was to run the meetings on Tuesday nights, right.  And God knows I did not know what I was getting myself into.  One of my coworkers, co-chairman of that, at that time, at the beginning at least, was Danny Davis, right.  And of course we knew Danny and we pushed Danny for alderman on the west side, right.  And we also pushed--well not initially but later, we pushed Bobby Rush for alderman of the 2nd Ward, right.  And Lou Jones for state rep, right.  All these came out of the, the Task Force, right.  And of course Bobby later becomes congressman.  But all this stuff comes in the basement every Tuesday night at the Task Force meeting.
Story_ID: 131023
Speaker 1: And as you know, I was, you know I had, I had to get some fortitude to, to endure all these different, you know various fights that went on in the basement.  But at any rate, Harold [Washington]--we unveil Harold at this big meeting in the auditorium that next week.  And from there every Tuesday night from that point through the election up to very recently, we had a Tuesday night meeting in the basement as a Task Force [for Black Political Empowerment], and we endorsed candidates, we worked for candidates, we helped Harold get elected, the whole bit.  That included you know, [HM] Carol Moseley Braun, the whole bit.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We gone--
Speaker 1: All these people.  Anybody who wanted to run for office in the black community, including white folks, came to the basement, made their presentation, and we decided whether or not we were going to support them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause we had the troops.
Story_ID: 131024
Speaker 1: Eddie Reed was a part of our group.  Of course he was an assistant to [HM] Jorja [Palmer] and Lu Palmer [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II].  We helped elect many of those aldermen that are sitting in the [Chicago, Illinois] City Council right now.  But at--and now here's the interesting thing about the, the--sort of same time that Harold [Washington] was elected, we're thinking about [HM] Jesse [L. Jackson] running for the presidency, right.  So '83 [1983] Harold comes into office.  That next thing we got, you know we were going to the presidential campaign.  And the big fight was whether or not Harold was going to support Jesse for president because remember Harold is a national figure and there was a lot of pressure on him to support [Walter] Mondale, right.  So--and of course I was, you know, knew Jesse, worked as an issues, as an issues consultant to Jesse.  One of the people who helped set up his presidential campaign and close to, to Harold, right.  So I--there was some fight as to, as to whether Harold or Jesse was going to have police protection from the City of Chicago.  So we go to Harold and said you got to do this, got to put him down, make sure he gets--old Harold said okay.  But there was a little tension there, right.  There was also a little tension between Harold and some of the more radical groups in the city.  And we had to, you know go to Harold and talk about those things too.
Speaker 2: Well Lu, Lu Palmer for this--
Speaker 1: Yeah Lu.  Well one of the things [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill] and I went down on many occasions and talked to Harold about hiring Lu.  Now remember Lu ran--we fought with Harold to have him support Lu for--to replace him in the [U.S.] Congress.  And he of course chose [HM] Charles Hayes rather than Lu Palmer because he said he needed the support of labor.  Because Charlie Hayes was a labor leader and the first black labor leader that's going to the Congress, right.  And Lu was extremely upset about the fact that Lou, that he had helped Harold set, set Harold in motion to run for mayor and help him get elected and then Harold would not support him for--to replace him.  Some of the people who, who argued for Lu were very, very upset, we were upset, Conrad and I.  But some of the other people said Harold was reluctant because if he supported Lu and Lu became a Congressman, Jorja would actually be the power behind the throne.  And, and of course Jorja, Jorja was always the power behind him.  I mean she would, she would as I say, she was a brilliant writer, read everything, understood, you know she was a genius.  She would write letters to Harold and I would go see Harold and he would say let me show this letter.  I mean she would go line-by-line telling him what he did do and what he did not do and what he should do, what he should not do.  And Delores Woods his secretary, would always escort us in the room and, and we'd talk to Harold.  And Harold of course you know would love--have Conrad and I come and, and talk to him about what was going on in the streets, right.
Story_ID: 131025
Speaker 1: So it comes--now Jesse's [HM Jesse L. Jackson] about to run.  So we petition Harold [Washington] to support Jesse.  Jesse's reluctant.  I was elected as an alternative delegate to the Democratic Convention in '84 [1984], which was in San Francisco [California], right.  So it was in San Francisco that we had he, the floor fight in which we booed Coretta Scott King because Coretta was supporting [Walter] Mondale against Jesse, right.  And Jesse pretended he was telling us to be quiet, but in fact he, you know.  At any rate that was, that was quite, quite interesting.  Anyway we had a big fight with [HM] Roland Burris because Roland had made a deal with the, the DNC [Democratic National Committee] to support Mondale because they gave him the vice-chairmanship of the DNC.  So we called him in the room and dressed him down about that, right.  And we negotiated with Harold till he finally came around and said okay I'll support him on the floor.  We went to Harold and--went to Jesse and said Harold is ready to go.  So we go down on the floor because we lost, so I guess Harold figured, you know, what the hell; he's not gonna win anyway because we didn't have enough delegates.  So you know to keep unity and he's a Chicago [Illinois] man, blah, blah, blah.  So we'll have this, the, the Chicago delegation support Jesse.  So that's exactly what happened, but--
Speaker 2: One of the favorite sons.
Speaker 1: Yeah and, and we--you know I was a part of the negotiating team that, that helped to put that together. So I was, I was quite pleased with that.
Story_ID: 131026
Speaker 1: So then we come back to Chicago [Illinois] and of course Harold [Washington]--people start getting upset about Harold's appointments and the fact that some of the things he was not doing that people were displeased with and they didn't like his--how many people that he had around him and all that.  And [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill] and I and the Task Force people were constantly mediating some of that.  Because some of the people that he didn't--his people didn't want to deal with, they would send them to us down in the basement to deal with.  So we were constantly mediating that.
Speaker 2: You're really talking about the activist community in Chicago being upset.  The black activists.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: But on the other hand, the rank and file--
Speaker 1: The business community was pretty much satisfied with him.
Speaker 2: You know most of the folks in the city adored Harold Washington.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, my mother [Lula Ella Starks], my aunts.  They, they absolutely adored him, absolutely you are correct.
Speaker 2: He represented black people so well in the media and stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You know he had charisma and all that, so--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So that's a--so he had two different, you know, he had a--some of the black politicians didn't, weren't excited from the very beginning if I remember.  Guys like Beavers and (unclear) and, and they were trying to--
Speaker 1: Well they were in the machine, many of these guys were already in the machine.  And then we were also petitioning him at, at this time to support Danny for the aldermanship.  And once Danny got, became an alderman, we were pushing him to support Danny to run against Cardiss Collins for [U.S.] Congress.  Lu of course, Lu [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer] and [HM] Jorja [Palmer] were always close to Danny Davis.  And Ed Smith, we supported Ed.  Got Ed elected to the, the [Chicago, Illinois] City Council.  We supported [HM] Carol Moseley Braun and got, helped her get elected.
Story_ID: 131027
Speaker 1: But you know, so it was always this tension.  Now remember Harold [Washington] dies in '87 [1987], November of '87 [1987] just before Thanksgiving.  And we had had a, a real fight, Lu [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer] and I, had had a real fight with, with him because he had named what he called the Dream Team, which was a ticket that included Aurelia Pucinski, God knows.
Speaker 2: The daughter of Roman--
Speaker 1: The daughter of Roman Pucinski who was adamantly opposed to anything black people did, right.  And Richard [M.] Daley for [Cook County, Illinois] State's Attorney, right.  And we said why would you, you know, support those two, right?  Especially since you had some qualified black people running against Aurelia Pucinski.  And--but we said why of all the people you want to support Richard Daley?  We just got rid of him; you're going to bring him back into, into power.  But he, he argued and Lu and I, remember Lu was at that time the host of, of a radio show on WVON and he--
Speaker 2: 'On Target.'
Speaker 1: 'On Target.'  He and I talked about it and said it was the wrong thing and blah, blah.  Harold of course did not like us criticizing him but we, we did.  And then shortly after that he passes away and all hell breaks loose, right.  And of course again, the Task Force is torn asunder because Lu was very upset with the fact that [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill], immediately Conrad and we had a meeting.  I think like maybe a day or two after Harold died in the basement where we had all the activists and Lu Palmer asked one single question.  He said is this really a move to push Tim Evans for mayor?  He asked that of Conrad.  Slim Coleman was in the meeting.  And of course Slim, Slim and Conrad and all the others were pushing for, for Tim Evans.  And of course they were against [HM Eugene] Sawyer.  So you had the Sawyer/Evans fight, which went on, on all the way up to 1989, from '87 [1987] to '89 [1989], which tore the community asunder.  We were there that night.  Conrad was with Jackie Grimshaw, Tim Wright and all those folks, behind the scenes.  I was actually in the City Council chamber along with Nancy Jefferson and I was there when the alderman [Richard] Mell stood up on a table and said Sawyer is our man.
Speaker 2: We got us a mayor.
Speaker 1: We got us a mayor, right.
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: Which went all over the whole world.  And that was like twelve, one o' clock at night.
Speaker 2: The meeting wound up (unclear) by thousands.
Speaker 1: Thousands of people, right.
Speaker 2: With thousands in the streets saying don't take this.
Speaker 1: Don't, don't take it, right.
Story_ID: 131028
Speaker 1: And I remember one incident was I was, during all this time, I was approached by a white alderman, the fifth ward, God, later indicted.  What's his name?  Who said, Jewish guy who says what about a--Bob, what about--since you can't settle on anybody, what about you know, a Jewish guy for mayor?  I said fine.  I said okay let's go to the window here and you tell those five thousand people out there that you want a Jewish mayor and see how far we get.  And of course that, that idea died.  And of course later--
Speaker 2: That, that was the thinking behind the, the white City Council faction pulling the, the six blacks over with the promise that they would give them a black mayor if they came over to that side?
Speaker 1: Well from what I understand, the, the President of Cook County Board actually sat the, some of the white committeemen down and said look, the town would be torn up if you select a white mayor.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I thought they could have just immediately pulled the six black aldermen and wanted to go back to the good old days if they vote for Vrdolyak (unclear).
Speaker 1: No, I think they understood very clearly that the town would have been torn up if that had happened.  And so the compromise was [HM Eugene] Sawyer.  And of course that ensued a, what ensued as a result of that was the division within the black community, which played out every Tuesday night in the basement.  Sawyer, Evans, you know I was called on the carpet.  You're supporting Evans.  You should be support Sawyer.  And I was, I was trying to be neutral.  But you know the fights ensued and, and Sampson of course was fighting, screaming Sawyer, Sawyer, Sawyer.  And we were trying to be neutral but there was no way that we could be neutral cause you either was one or the other.  So we get to 1989 and I knew very clearly that we could not win that one because you had two blacks and one white and there was no way that we could win that situation.  And it seems to me and if we had, simply had the two of them sit down, work out an agreement, a way in which the whites had done it back in--when old man [Richard J.] Daley died in 1975 where one would take the City Counc--the you know, a major position in finance and the other one would be mayor, and you would, you wouldn't have that problem.  But they didn't do that.  They, they, you know went through all these crazy things.  Lu Palmer [HM Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer] had staged rally after rally in which he would bring Tom Todd in and Tom Todd would talk about the need to have unity, but nobody listened.  And that's how we got the disaster that we now have, which is Richard [M.] Daley.

Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Now what, what's your assessment of Harold Washington years and what do you make of his--did we make any gains?
Speaker 1: We had made tremendous gains.  But the problem was we were unable to sustain the gains because I think we spent too much time investing too much energy into one person rather than sustaining the organizational, institutional support that we had built up.  Because as soon as he came into office, many of the organizations and the institutions that we had built up to that point to bring him to, into office, started retracting.  'Cause I remember clearly the, the number of organizations that we had on the list that supported Harold exceeded fifty organizations in the city.  West Side, South Side, North Side, southeast side, these were black organizations.  But as soon as Harold came into office, many of those organizations began to diminish in their influence because you know the idea was why should we have all these organizations, we got a black mayor, right?  And that was the, the key fault.  Now in the meantime in '84 [1984], we--[HM] Buzz Palmer, [HM] Alice Palmer, myself, Mark Durham sit down and then later we bring in [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill].  And we formed the Free South Africa Movement.  We got arrested in the consulate office in--and this was around the same time that they began the Free South African arrest and, and movement in Washington [D.C.], right.  When Transafrica with Randall Robinson had begun the whole thing, right.  So we formed--I became the, the Chairman of that group and we used to meet right up in the, in, on--in Room 408 in this building.  I think it was every Thursday night we met.  And we, we had every Thursday without a, a--without a doubt, we marched in front of the consulate on North Michigan Avenue.  And I--believe it or not, some of the same people who were jumping up and down once [Nelson] Mandela was released, used to walk past us when we were demonstrating, and we would ask them to join the demonstration.  They'd look at us like we were crazy, right.  And some of those same people once Mandela was elected President, were the first to get on the plane and go to South Africa and, and you know.  Interesting, very interesting dynamic.  So in '91 [1991], it was '93 [1993] when Mandela came to Chicago [Illinois], well we held, held rallies, Free South Africa Movement had rallies in downtown Chicago, the whole bit.  So when he was preparing to come to Chicago, [HM] Jesse [L. Jackson, Sr.] asked me to head up the committee to, to, to plan for the, the, the--his introduction in Chicago.  So we put that together.  And of course it was held--the main thing was at, at PUSH and that's when all these people who had, who had not participated in the marches all show up, want to have a picture with Mandela.  And I just, I was just--I just shook my head; I was just absolutely--but that's, that's, that's the nature of the game.  You know you have to get over it.  But these were the same people, we begged them to join the line and help us march on those cold, cold days when we were being arrested, when we were being--we were sitting in, we were marching, wouldn't have anything to do with us.

Speaker 1: One of the, one of the instructors, or people here at the Center [for Inner City Studies at Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois], Professor Elkin Sithole.
Speaker 2: Elkin Sithole.
Speaker 1: He--
Speaker 2: Absolute gem, absolute gem.
Speaker 1: I remember the--when he was killed in the plane crash, in '93 [1993, sic 1994] I guess.
Speaker 2: No, probably '95 [1995], probably about '95 [1995].  Elkin Sithole was--I think his wife was Zulu, but he was, I think he might have been Xhosa if I'm not mistaken.  But anyway, he was very close and we didn't even know the extent of his involvement in the Liberation Movement.  For instance, one of his, his best friends was [Ndabaningi] Sithole of Zimbabwe, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was related to him (unclear).
Speaker 2: Exactly, there you go, there you go, there you go.  And he was corresponding with everybody in the Movement in the ANC [African National Congress], right.  And I mean he had letters and every time any one of them came to Chicago [Illinois], he bought them here, right.  'Cause remember now I hosted as the head of the Free South Africa Movement, I hosted Bishop [Desmond] Tutu, Alla--the old man, Tambo, Oliver Tambo.  The, the, the President of Namibia before he became the President of Namibia.  We hosted all here at the--
Speaker 1: Bozak [ph.], was he here (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Bozak came, yeah, Bozak was he interesting.  But anyway, so between PUSH and the Free South Africa cause I was the sort of--the Chairman of the, the Africa Committee at PUSH at the same time as the, the head of the Free South Africa Movement.  So between [HM] Jesse [L. Jackson] and, and the Free South Africa Movement, we had touched with all of the, the leaders from South Africa who had come through Chicago with the help of Sithole.  So it was--
Speaker 1: Do you remember when the leader of the Zulus came (unclear) and there was a (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: (unclear) [Mangosuthu] Buthelezi.
Speaker 2: Buthelezi, Buthelezi came to--he came to [Anas] Lukeman's funeral.  He was, he was one of Lukeman's body--I mean pall bearers, and he spoke at the funeral.  And I think if I, if I'm not related--he had some relationship with Sithole's wife.  'Cause I think she was Zulu.  But anyway yeah, yeah, absolutely yeah.  So that was, that was an exciting time you know.  And very interesting, very, very interesting--

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Let me, I'm gonna move us on to the Million Man March [1995].
Speaker 1: Oh, God, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: You played an interesting role in the Million Man March.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you know one criticism that some people had on the March was that there was no political statement attached to or formal statement issued by the March.  But there were, there were two statements from what I understand.  One was written by yourself [ph.].  They did not give wide distribution or [ph.].
Speaker 1: Not to mine, not to mine.
Speaker 2: At all.  The people asked like why go to the seat of power and not have a political agenda?
Speaker 1: That is correct.  Well the people who helped plan the whole thing was of course [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill] was one of the major planners, along with Minister Farrakhan [HM Louis Farrakhan] and his people.
Speaker 2: Bob Brown.
Speaker 1: Bob Brown was, was the, the logistics man.  I mean Bob worked his heart out putting the logistics together.  And it was--and, and so was Al Sampson was one of the people who helped raise money and put the whole planning together.  And my first thing was you know doing research and writing.  So I did a--several pieces in 'Indigo' cause I started working for 'Indigo' in 1991.  And I wrote a--things, a couple of articles, maybe about three or four articles justifying the March because people were criticizing why you want to have this march?  It's not going to result in anything, blah, blah, blah.
Story_ID: 131141
Speaker 1: So my job is to, to, to do some of the preparations to justify it [the Million Man March, Washington, D.C.], and also to coordinate with some of the national press.  So I get in the, on the radio and I'm arguing with 'Manchild in the Promised Land', what's his name?
Speaker 2: Claude.
Speaker 1: Claude, God, Claude Brown.  He and I have a big fight on National Radio, NPR [National Public Radio].  Just--he's against it, said it's crazy and you know.  Cause I remember he goes from the left all the way to the right, right, okay.  So I write these articles.  And then it comes to my mind, I say now we need a--some sort of political statement.  So I construct what is called a Million Man March Manifesto, right.  Now I don't know what the, the details were in terms of the internal operations, but my manifesto was never promulgated.  I did not have a speaking role, although I was on the stage like as close as two of us, to the Minister [HM Louis Farrakhan].
Speaker 2: Well was the manifesto accepted by the committee as something that [unclear].
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was--for some reason it was not promulgated.  I, I don't know.  And then of course I was not totally pleased with the fact that it was not promulgated, and the fact that there was, as you stated, no political statement that came out of the March.  We had two million people [sic, estimates range from four hundred thousand to over eight hundred thousand] standing in front of us and a worldwide audience of almost a billion people watching this thing around the world.  And it seemed to me that, that, that the statement would have been a lot, you know, would have given some meat to it.  And then when the final book was published by Third World Press, it was not mentioned either.  So I don't know.  I, I, you know, I was obviously disappointed, but I don't know what the, the, the reason why it was not--
Speaker 2: [Unclear] that's like the [unclear] nut show.  Once you crack in there, you're looking for the kernel wherever, you know, what do people want?  What do they, they think they want?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: Instead of a--the--so did you disagree with the overall tenor of the tone, the theme?
Speaker 1: No I didn't disagree with the atonement so much, but I disagree--cause you remember Bevel was the one who pushed the whole idea of atonement.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: [HM] James Bevel, yeah, yeah James at the time was living in Chicago [Illinois].  And James at that time also believe it or not, was hooked into LaRouche cause he was a part of the LaRouche group, right.
Speaker 2: [Unclear].
Speaker 1: And I mean I, I didn't--I, I would not have chosen atonement.  But that was the Minister's, you know that's what he wanted to do so you know.  But I said in addition to that, he should have some overall political statement.  And in the manifest that I wrote, I talked about South Africa obviously.  Talked about you know, black ownership, black businesses.  Talked about the Crime Bill cause remember you buddy Mr. [Bill] Clinton had, had you know, passed the ominous Crime Bill.  All those different issues, and called for a, you know, political unity, right.  Didn't, you know--so at any rate, it's a document that's now in the public domain and anybody who wanted to look at it, it's there.
Speaker 2: Were, were copies printed?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had copies printed, the whole bit.
Speaker 2: They weren't dispersed.
Speaker 1: They were, they were--some were dispersed, but most of them sat in my office.
Speaker 2: Now did you read the statement?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's a good statement.  But it seems to me that my statement would have, would have added to that greatly.
Speaker 2: So you, you two had [unclear] wrote political statements.  Did, did you talk to each other about it?
Speaker 1: Not really because I, when I got, I got there early in-[HM] Maulana [Karenga] I think came a, a day--cause I was there, God I must have been there like five days or something.  I think Maulana came the day before the, the March and spoke and I don't think he stayed over.  But I stayed over and for a day or so later.  And was also involved in that failure on--you know the thing that was supposed to follow-up with the money and the setting up the, the whole thing.  That, that petered out too.  And I was a part of trying to help put that together.  Had some suggestions, but didn't work out.
Speaker 2: Now you, have you had enthusiasm for any of the other march efforts, the Million Woman March [unclear].
Speaker 1: No, after that I just said no.  I just after that.
Story_ID: 131142
Speaker 1: Do you have a, I guess a summation of, of what you think these are about, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, I think we--the problem to me is follow-through.  We've got to have some more concrete follow-through because the answer is, is a twofold answer.  Unity and organization.  And if we don't have those two, everything falls apart because the idea of having a national African American bank came out as one of the ideas that came out of the, the, the Million Man March.  Never got off the ground.  Another idea which did get off the ground was Father Clements' idea of black adoptions.  And as you know, adoptions in the black community went up, at least briefly after that.  So that was a good idea.  But those are the only two things that I remember concretely that came out of that.  It was a, a, a diminish in crime for that week.  But after that, it went--things went back to, to usual, unfortunately, yeah.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about another thing I guess that you, you know, we have some of the political analysts.  You definitely should ask about this in the city of Chicago [Illinois].  Can you talk about the rise of [HM] Barack Obama here in the city and what, what interactions you had with [unclear] in terms of the rise?
Speaker 2: Well I first met Mr. Obama when he was a professor at the University of Chicago.  Impressed with him, very bright young man, well spoken, very much into his Constitutional law.  And met him with one of my former university teachers, William Julius Wilson.  And I said but you know he might make a good, you know, a state's attorney or attorney general or something you know.  And it was later when he first ran for the [Illinois] State Senate that we had our first run-in.  What happened was Adolph Reed who of course now teaches at, at The New School [for Social Research, New York City], formerly at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and at the time working at U of I [University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]; no, he was at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], I'm sorry.  He and I, along with Lou Jones and other people, were upset because first of all [HM] Alice [Palmer] ran for Congress.
Speaker 1: Alice Palmer.
Speaker 2: Alice Palmer.
Speaker 1: She was the sitting Senator.
Speaker 2: She was the sitting Senator.  And she and--she ran against Jesse Junior [HM Jesse Jackson, Jr.] and lost, right?  She had given up her seat and said to Barack you take my seat in the state Senate, right.  After she lost, she said--we persuaded her to go to Barack and say look Barack, move back.  Let me run for my seat again in the state Senate.  And he refused.  And we had a big meeting at Lou Jones' house.  It was Lou Jones, it was Tim Black [HM Timuel Black], myself, Adolph Reed and believe it or not, Mark Aller and some other people, okay.  So we go to, to Barack after she had gone to him and we make a plea again.  He says no, I refuse to do it.  And of course we write, I write 'Indigo' pieces condemning him for it.  He gets elected and at first he refuses to, to say he would join the Black Caucus in the state legislature.  He changed his mind a little later.  The next run-in we had with him is when he runs against [HM] Bobby Rush.
Speaker 1: Why did--what was the reason for not joining the Black Caucus?
Speaker 2: Well he, he, he eventually did.  But I mean initially he said, his statement was that I am, I represent the, the people, all the people rather than just simply black people.  Because remember he comes from a district in Hyde Park.  So you know he wants to appeal to his, his consti--now remember this is the old Newhouse district, which had been redrawn to include more of Hyde Park and much of South Shore.  So it was a fairly integrated district.
Story_ID: 131143
Speaker 1: So when he [HM Barack Obama] runs against [HM Charles] Hayes, we were also very upset because Hayes was on the verge of getting enough time to get a, a pension.  He had said in effect that if you, if, if you--no, [HM] Bobby Rush.  Of course we, we got mad at Bobby cause he was running against Hayes.  Then when he turns around and says I'm running against Rush, we were upset with that.  And he of course lost to Bobby Rush.
Speaker 2: Now what was the--I'm not clear about exactly--did, did the Task Force endorse Donny Trotter or was it just kind of another--?
Speaker 1: Well you know that was another fight that we had because we had a big fight in the basement as to whether or not we should endorse Donny Trotter or--Barack was never in the picture, right.  But--or stay with, with Bobby Rush.  And I wrote a column in which I said both were qualified.  And of course I won no friends as a result of that.  But I condemned Barack, right.  And then after the election I went to Barack and said you know Barack, we had lunch.  I said why don't you run for the attorney general of the State of Illinois?  I'm not interested in being--or state's attorney of Cook County?  He said he was not interested in being a prosecutor.  And this was like 2000, maybe 2002 or so.  What I didn't understand at the time that he already had his, his antennae directed toward the [U.S.] Senate.  Because the rumblings were already going on that [HM] Carol [Moseley Braun] was not going to be you know, electable, right.
Speaker 2: She had lost to Peter Fitzgerald.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Earlier and she was trying to get [unclear].
Speaker 1: There you go, there you go.  So he said he wasn't, was not interested.  So then of course he runs in 2004 and Hermione [ph.] was quite impressed with him.  Wrote a big front page--the first newspaper to feature him on the front page.  And I wrote several columns supporting his, his candidacy for the Senate.  And so you know we remained, you know on good terms.  And then when he ran for [U.S.] President, again we wrote several stories on him and remain fairly good friends.
Speaker 2: Now what do you think about his run for the Presidency?  Did you think that was, at the time did you think it, it made sense that he should run, you know [unclear]?
Speaker 1: I, I thought he was--I don't think I was convinced that he could win when he announced.  I don't think anybody was convinced that he could.  But as he--after he won the Iowa Caucus, I think most of us began to become believers.  And by the time he got to about halfway, the halfway point in the primary season, I think we were all convinced and began to really join the bandwagon.  But we never saw him as a, a Malcolm X by no means.  I don't think we ever--at least I didn't 'cause I understood very clearly his--what he had done in the Senate campaign.  And I saw him repeating pretty much that same tenor in the presidential campaign.  Which was taking the William Julius Wilson position, which is a non-racial perspective on policy and legislation.
Story_ID: 131144
Speaker 1: Now Dr. William Julius Wilson down at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], is the author of a book called 'The Declining Significance of Race.'
Speaker 2: Of Race, exactly, exactly.  In which he articulates the notion that if you really want to get anything done in American politics, it cannot be done on the basis of race, it has to be non-race specific, right.  And that's the, that's the basic approach that Mr. Obama [HM Barack Obama] has taken.  He took it in, in 2004 when he ran for the senate.  He took it again when he ran for the [U.S.] President in 2008, and he's continuing that process, that basic philosophy as it relates to domestic policy and in his presidency.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you--what's your analysis of how he actually got elected?  I mean it was people--you said nobody seemed to think he--people [unclear] politics, didn't think he [unclear].
Speaker 2: Well at the moment a political scientists at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Haynes Walter, wrote the book 'Black Politics' in 1972 and I--in the process of writing a book on, on Obama's election in 2008.  And what we discovered is that he really did have solid support within the white community for an African American.  I mean well let's look at it this way.  He had solid support from young white voters, okay.  He had solid support from northern urban white middle class voters, right.  Now when you add to that, that all--approximately 78 percent of the Jewish vote, voted for Barack Obama.  98 percent of the black vote, voted for Obama.  And more than 70 percent of Hispanics voted for him.  So that was a combination that got him over and, and made him the President.  So he had solid support.  Now the problem is that if he does not improve his relationship to the African American community because some African Americans are becoming disillusioned with his policies of non-racial, non-race specific policy and legislation, to the extent that they are going to become disillusioned, they will not denounce him.  What they will do is what I call, give him what I call the Mel Reynolds treatment.  Because when Mel Reynolds got in trouble, the African American community just simply turned him off.  They said nothing for him, nor against him.  They simply shut him out.  Now if that happens to Mr. Obama, if the African--if those primary African American voters or any significant segment of them become disillusioned, that might happen to him.  If that happens, now remember he's losing the white vote in droves.  Okay never had that white South, right.  But the northern white voters are becoming disillusioned and his numbers in the white community is, is fading as we speak.  So if those black voters become disillusioned and turn him off, 2010 could be a real disaster for him.  Because those African American voters in those districts outside of the primary black districts where blacks are 25 percent or more of the, the voting population in those districts, those are the districts that have pulled the liberals over.  Those white liberal senators and, and Congressmen over.  If they stay at home and just simply say I'm not voting, that would be a disaster and he would lose much of his majority in the [U.S.] Congress, both in the Senate and the house, which would get disastrous for him, which will then set the stage for him to be defeated in 2012.  So in my opinion now, and this is my, my humble analysis, is that he has got to shore up his support within the African American community because I don't think that he can re--rely on the support of the white community that he had in 2008 in 2010 or in 2012.
Story_ID: 131145
Speaker 1: Now you are writing a book on the Harold Washington years.
Speaker 2: Exactly, Harold Washington and another one on, on [HM] Barack Obama.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So where, where are these projects now?
Speaker 2: They're in process, let's put it that way.  Busy doing a whole bunch of things so we have to just take some time and, and finish them, the projects out.
Speaker 1: And so you've written a ton of articles for journals and, and magazines and you got a weekly column and you're on television a lot, you're on, you were on a panel discussion just this past weekend; a pre-Kwanzaa event with [HM] Al Sharpton and some other people.  So you, you stay pretty busy.
Speaker 2: Stay pretty busy, absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right, and what--so you got the two books coming.  How will your book on Harold Washington be different from the ones--
Speaker 2: Well you know I want to look at that--primarily at the period after he died and look at that crucial two-year period between '87 [1987] and '89 [1989] when the whole internal African American coalition just absolutely collapsed which sets the stage for the problem we're in right now.  You know again as I said, when we start off in '83 [1983], I mean '82 [1982] with his election, we had more than fifty grassroots organizations in the city of Chicago [Illinois] that were viable.  You know some were stronger than others.  But none of the--not none, but most of those organizations are defunct now.  And we have this disunity.  Everybody wants to go their own way.  [Richard M.] Daley, you know in a shrewd way, has bought off much of the leadership, right.  And there's no longer a Harold Washington movement or and, and, and I think some of that came as a result of Harold Washington people being enamored with him and, and saying in effect we don't need the organizations.  We, you know we invest all of our energy, our hopes in him instead of saying now that we've got him elected, we need to strengthen those institutions and organizations in order to support him as opposed to standing back and saying now that he's in the, in the, in the office, we don't need to do--have any organizations anymore.
Speaker 1: Do you think they're--
Speaker 2: That's a lesson that we need to understand about, about Barack Obama.  I will never forget the fact that--and again I was involved last year this time with the support of [HM] Roland Burris to go to the Senate, right.  Now again that was the old coalition coming back into, into, to force.  It was me, it was Al Sampson, it was led by Congressman Rush [HM Bobby Rush].  It was Eddie Reed, Tim Wright was our lawyer.  Tim Wright of course was in Harold Washington's administration.  All of us sitting down with [HM] Dorothy Tillman and others for two weeks planning and plotting to make sure that Burris went to the Senate, right.  And we, we pushed that, that whole idea because we wanted to make sure that there was at least one African American in the Senate.  Because that was--without him, we would have none.  But I remember, recall very interestingly Lynn Sweet who writes for the Chicago Sun Times, was on CNN [Cable Network News], and in the midst of this fight, she was being interviewed.  And she said something to the effect--well the reporter asked her well why are they, why are African Americans so insistent on Burris?  I mean he's got all this baggage, blah, blah, blah.  And her response was they've got--they've elected a president, a black president.  What else do they want?  Can you imagine that?  Now that's the attitude I'm convinced of a significant proportion of the white community.  And unfortunately I think some African Americans may feel the same way, that you need--there's no more need to struggle.  No more need to, to, to protest.  No more need to agitate because we have an African American elected president.  So again, we have to learn the lessons of Harold Washington in this period.  Because if we don't, we'll suffer.
Speaker 1: How much time--
Speaker 2: And we'll be worse off.
Story_ID: 131146
Speaker 1: How much time do you think he [HM Barack Obama] has to deliver--
Speaker 2: About a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About a year.  I mean the Health Bill [Affordable Care Act] is obviously crucial.  He's got to talk about education which is dismal.  I mean education of our children inner city--jobs, you know.  African American unemployment is dismal.  I mean you talk about the, the official statistics, 15 percent.  Believe me, in inner cities across this country male unemployment is approaching 50 and 60 percent depending on the cities you're going in.  Foreclosures, African American community across the country, 20, 30, 40 percent.  Detroit [Michigan] is dying.  Do you hear me?  Dying.  Detroit may be the first American city to absolutely die in the twenty-first century.  Baltimore [Maryland], sky high foreclosures on mortgages.  Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] trying to turn it back, turn it around.  That's got to be addressed.  Banks will not lend to African Americans.  So small businesses which depend on loans and credit, are not receiving it.  And, and the president has just gotten around a year later, to asking the banks to open up and lend to small businesses.  Families are drowning from loans of twenty, thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollars for loans where the interest is continuing to grow, for student loans for their children to go to college.  While at the same time the president cuts back eighty-four million dollars to black colleges and universities [HBCUs] when he comes into office.  He's got to do something about those things.

Speaker 1: Now when, when you look back at everything you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I guess I would have, I guess I would have spent more time being I guess--doing the writing.

Speaker 1: Is there anything I should ask you about before I ask my final question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so; I don't know of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Now that's an interesting question.  I don't think I've ever thought about that.  Probably a guy who tried to do his best and tried to make a difference.  Simple as that.
