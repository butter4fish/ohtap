Speaker 1: Before we get into the formal interview, we have a few, what we call, People magazine type questions--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Just to give those who will do your interview, certain slants on your personality.  And what is your favorite food, Attorney Budd [HistoryMaker Wayne Budd]?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  I hadn't thought about that.  You caught me off guard.  Let's see, what do I like?  I love clam strips, I love pasta dishes, pasta and grilled chicken is a favorite of mine, Lobster Fra Diavolo I enjoy, so those would be among my--
Speaker 1: Very diverse menu.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd say so.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is the fall.  I love the fall.  I love the crispness in the air that we have here in New England.  And then I'd say that's followed by the spring, which is the coming out of the winter and into the warmer weather.  Summer would probably be my third favorite and the dead of winter my least favorite. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I would say green.
Speaker 1: Green?  Okay.  Your favorite vacation destination, do you have one?
Speaker 2: Maybe Italy, maybe the island of Nevis, and maybe taking a cruise in different parts of the world.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying, something philosophical that you use every day or from time to time with your colleagues or friends?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Geez, that's thought provoking.  You mean something I can say on camera? (Laughter) Let's see, always keep your eye open for opportunity.  Always keep your eye open for opportunity.  Don't turn a deaf eye or ear--don't turn a deaf ear or blind eye toward it.  It's been the story of my life (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sure, I'm sure you will give us some examples of that as we take a look at your life.
Speaker 2: Alright. That's fine.
Story_ID: 380301
Speaker 1: As I said earlier, before we started the interview that we'd like to talk about your family; your family history, your family background, so that those people who view and use your interview over time will have a context in which to view your growing up years and your adult life and so on.  And so we're going to start with your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Would you give me your mother's full name, where she was born and where she grew up?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Springfield, Mass- excuse me.  She was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts.  Her name is Octavia Peters Budd, and she was born and raised in Greenfield; Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: In what year?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1921.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her growing up years in Greenfield, her early childhood years?  Did she share stories with you about her early life?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.  She comes from a family of eight children.  Her family goes back in Greenfield to the days of the Underground Railroad, the mid-19th century.  So when she was growing up in the town it was a place that where the family had been for a long time.  In--Greenfield, Mass is of about eighteen thousand people, it's in northern Massachusetts, very close to the Vermont border.  And apparently, her family originally settled there on their way to Canada from the South during slavery times.  And for whatever reason, they stayed in Greenfield, Massachusetts instead of continuing on to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, these would be great-grandparents then, right?
Speaker 2: No, it would be even more than that.  It may be three greats, at least two, probably three that may be tied into that.  So she had a--I think her parents were ve- and her family was a very, very, very modest means, but they all worked.  All of her siblings and self, they all graduated from high school.  Which, during that period of time, in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] was considered a big deal that they all completed high school and--
Speaker 1: In Greenfield?
Speaker 2: All in Greenfield.
Speaker 1: All in Greenfield?
Speaker 2: Everybody in Greenfield, yeah.
Speaker 1: What stories has she shared with you in her growing-up years as a child and a teenager?  Did she--
Speaker 2: Well, one story that she shares frequently is the idea that there's a fair amount of musical talent in the family.  And, which by the way, bypassed me.  I have none.
Speaker 1: So far (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have no musical talent in any phase or by any description.  But they would have a family show and they would do professional entertaining, minstrel shows.  Her dad [Warren Peters], her brothers, my mom was a dancer, a tap dancer in these performances, that would be throughout that part of the State of Massachusetts, up in the Greenfield area.  And was something she looked on as very enjoyable.  Everybody in the family was involved.  Her mom [Bertha Hall Peters] played the piano, her father played the drums, she had a couple brothers she called--were sidemen, whatever that means.  I think they're comedians or something.  But they sang, danced, and made a few bucks [dollars] out of that, as I understand it.
Speaker 1: Your mother is still living?
Speaker 2: My mom is living, yeah.  She's eighty-four years old.
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is she like as a person, her personality?
Speaker 2: Very giving.  Always sees the glass half full rather than half empty.  Very, very, very devoted to her children, her grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.  Very, very important part of her life.  She loves to play bingo, she loves to play bingo.
Speaker 1: Does she win?
Speaker 2: Only occasionally.  I'm sure she would say not enough (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --not often enough.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 380302
Speaker 1: Tell me about her [Budd's mother, Octavia Peters Budd] parents.  Your maternal grandparents.  Their names--
Speaker 2: My maternal grandparents?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Her mom and dad were Warren Peters, who was born in Connecticut sometime in the 1890s.  Who was a good part Indian [Native American] and a good part Irish, believe it or not. You can't tell it by me, but he was half Irish and half Indian, as I understand it.  Her mother--
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about his work, his occupation, or what he--
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  He was the--he worked in a small machine shop, and he was also a bellman at a hotel.  Small hotel in Greenfield [Massachuetts].  And my grandmother, my mom's mother, Bertha Peters [Bertha Hall Peters], was of course born and raised in Greenfield, lived there all of her life and died actually, very early.  She died when she was maybe in her early to mid-fifties.  Had been at home, raised a wonderful family and just left us too soon.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know your maternal grandfather, grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: What were they like as individuals, how do you remember your maternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: Very, very loving, very supportive of the grandkids, including me.  Always there for you.  What you'd think of as the quintessential grandparents.  Loving, caring, supportive, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share with you about her growing-up years in stories that she--
Speaker 2: A little bit, a little bit.  Apparently her grandfather was also in Greenfield, and he may have been the original.  And his name was John Putnam.  And he was the town barber in Greenfield, a left handed fiddler, had his own orchestra, and called contra dances up in the Franklin County [Massachusetts] area.  Now, this is mid to late 19th century.  In fact, recently, his name was John Putnam-- they called him Old Put--recently in Greenfield, maybe six, seven years ago, they dedicated a park to people from that town over the years who've made contributions.  And I'm proud to say my great-great-grandfather, I think that's what he'd be, was one of those recognized.  And I had the opportunity to speak on behalf of the family to, you know, accept the recognition for my grandfather.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: And every year they have a fiddling contest, believe it or not, in Greenfield, Mass, and they call it the Old Put Fiddling Contest [sic. John Putnam Fiddler's Festival].  So, so he's still remembered in an interesting way, although he's been gone well over a hundred years.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 380303
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Attorney Budd [HistoryMaker Wayne Budd].  What was his name?  Where and when was he born?
Speaker 2: Okay.  His name is Joseph Anthony Budd [Joseph Budd], born in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1918.  Lived virtually all of his life in Springfield with the exception of two stints in the [U.S.] Armed Forces.  He went into the [U.S.] Navy right out of high school, which was on the tail end of the Great Depression in the '30s [1930s], 1936.  He spent four years in the Navy, which of course was a segregated Navy where the only rates or opportunities available to sailors of color was working as stewards in what they call the steward's branch.  It gave him a chance to do some traveling.  I can't tell you he was crazy about the work he did in the Navy, but he did four years, came out, came back to Springfield, worked in the old Springfield Armory [Springfield, Massachusetts].  He met my mom [Octavia Peters Budd], they married, I came along, World War II [WWII] came along, and he enlisted in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  And he was among the first people of color to serve in the Marines, because the Marines only started taking, as I'm sure many know, started taking black people during World War II, and then only after--
Speaker 1: This was after your birth then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was after my birth.  He went in after my birth.  So he served in the Marines.  In one of--of all the blacks in the Marine Corps, most were in what they call labor battalions.  Just doing stevedore work, loading, unloading, whatever.  And he found himself in one of two combat groups.  And he was attached to an all-black Marine Corps artillery unit.  He completed his service, always wanted to be a cop.
Speaker 1: Where did he serve during--
Speaker 2: He was over in the Marshall Islands and Guam.  Before he went overseas he was in North Carolina.  My mother and I joined him down there.  And it's kind of interesting, you know, because coming from the North, when my mother, and I came down to join my father at Camp Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina] in North Carolina, in those days it was required segregated travel.  And for whatever reason, my mother's light complected and maybe I looked--I had something of an Asian look when I was a little kid.  So they said--they didn't bother us, and she sat pretty much where she wanted.  But she remembered that obligation of having to sit in a particular place on the bus and/or train as we travelled south.  But--so my dad served, came out of the Marine Corps as a corporal.  Always wanted to do two things in his life, one to become a police officer and the other was to go to college.  And he accomplished both objectives.  He was the first African American cop in Springfield.
Speaker 1: The first?
Speaker 2: The first black cop.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-seven [1947].  He went on the police force in 1947, and by the time he retired he had worked his way up to captain, which was fairly extraordinary.  He had a wonderful career and established a wonderful reputation.  During the course of time, while he served as a police officer, and very active in various community things, he also went to college and he got his bachelor's degree.  I'm proud to say, a little bit later in his life, in fact, it was eleven years after I had graduated from college [Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts].  My dad graduated.  He went on and got a master's [degree].  Did some teaching at some of the local colleges in the Springfield area, AIC, American International College [Springfield, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did he get his first degree?
Speaker 2: He got his bachelor's from Western New England [Western New England College; Western New England University] in Springfield, and his master's degree from American International College, also in Springfield.
Speaker 1: What motivated him and influenced him to be interested in a career as a police officer?  Do you know where he got that notion from?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I'm not sure why he wanted to be a cop.  I only know that throughout his whole life, he wanted to be a police officer, and he achieved that objective.  I don't want to make it sound like he just walked down there one day and put his hand up and said, "I'd like to be a cop."  There was--he had to, of course, passed the tests, and I'm sure he was put under special scrutiny being the first person of color to apply to be a cop in the community.  But once he got that job, he truly established himself as a leader on the police department and a person in the community that I'd say was highly respected.  Highly respected among people of color, among white people, just up and down and throughout the community.  He spent a good deal of his time working with juveniles.  He headed up the--what they called the juvenile or Youth Bureau [Youth Aid Bureau].  At the time of his death in 1986, you would be amazed how many people came up to me at the funeral home or at the funeral and said, "Hey, you know, I'm here to pay my respects.  Your father gave me a break when I was a kid.  I was on the wrong track, he made sure I was on the right track."  I and members of my family took great pride in that.  In fact, there's a police, Springfield police building [Joseph A. Budd Assessment Center, Springfield, Massachusetts] that's named for him.  Yeah, one of the buildings used by the police department bears his name.
Story_ID: 380304
Speaker 1: Let me go back to his [Budd's father, Joseph Budd] childhood and growing up years.  What stories did he share with you about his growing up in Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, he grew up in a section of Springfield where eventually, I grew up.  It was sort of toward the outskirts of the city.  He didn't have an easy life at all, that was a quasi-rural area.  I'm sure there are some would argue all of Springfield is a rural area, but he--his dad worked for the Department of Streets [Department of Streets and Engineering] in Springfield, worked in the sewers.  You know, worked for the sewer department.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: His name was Richard Budd, Richard Budd.  And my dad had it kind of tough, as I'm sure any kid growing up anywhere a person of color, growing up anywhere, in particular during the '30s [1930s], the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] when he was going to school.  But he completed high school, and as I say, there weren't an awful lot of opportunities.  There certainly was no encouragement to further his education, and getting into the [U.S.] military, into the [U.S.] Navy was seen as a pretty good move at that time.
Speaker 1: What about your paternal grandmother?  What did you know about her?
Speaker 2: Very little.  She died when my dad was fairly young.  I know she was from Jamaica and was a mix of Japanese, I think, and Jamaican.  Came to Springfield as a domestic and met my grandfather there.  Her name was Theresa Young [Theresa Young Budd], I think it was her maiden name.
Story_ID: 380305
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that several of your great-great-greats were arrived in the Greenfield [Massachusetts], western part of Mass (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, on my mom's [Octavia Peters Budd] side.
Speaker 1: --through the Underground Railroad?  Can you say a little bit more about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something to that.  You know, the house where my mother grew up in Greenfield, had been a stop on the Underground Railroad, because she still tells us stories of there being hidden cellars where fugitive slaves would stay on their way up to Canada.  And she remembers going down there on one occasion, just being curious.  And tried to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Down where?  Down in the--
Speaker 2: Down into one of these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) cavities, or caverns or tunnels?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was like the--I don't want to make it bigger than it was.  It was a very small area.  A sep- a part of the house, but with sort of a separate entrance so that people could surreptitiously be brought in and out under cover of darkness.  And as a little kid, she said she would go down there just to try to imagine what it had been like for people to stay down there, you know, because it was kind of dark and wasn't pleasant (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, how did she happen to be living in that particular house, do you know?
Speaker 2: Somehow that house came into the family.  And I guess her mother [Bertha Hall Peters] had grown up in the same house, and I think, even her grandmother had grown up in that same property.  It was an older house in Greenfield, Mass.  Nothing very fancy about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that site designated on the New England Underground Railroad trail today, do you know?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, the house was lost.  I'll tell you that story very quickly.  Somehow, many, many, many years before, somebody took out a small mortgage on this house.  And it just stayed into adjustee.  I mean, it was a very small mortgage, and people, they paid, perhaps, just the interest on it.  Then at some point, it got foreclosed on and was lost for pennies on a dollar.  Somebody could have picked it up.  And it was knocked down and made a parking lot for a company that had a small office next door to the home.
Speaker 1: I see.  So you never had the chance to be in there, did you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I grew up there too.  During the war [World War II, WWII], that's where my mother and I lived while my dad [Joseph Budd] was overseas.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. So it was still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so we went back to Greenfield.  So I lived up there for a couple years.
Story_ID: 380306
Speaker 1: Remembering your father [Joseph Budd], what was he like as a person?  What was his personality?  How do you remember him?
Speaker 2: Tough.  He was a very disciplined guy, very tough.  Very demanding in terms of, he was determined to see his kids go to college.  So in his view, in order to accomplish that objective, he thought he had to be very, a strict disciplinarian.  Always pushing you, always trying to keep you on the right track, so that's my memory on the one hand.  On the other hand, some of the things that, every now and then, he would sort of lighten up and he would take me on an excursion.  I can remember going to see--travelling by train from Springfield [Massachusetts] to New York [New York] to see the New York football Giants [sic. New York Giants; San Francisco Giants] play and going down and seeing the baseball team play in New York.  One memory I do have, my father was trying to teach me that gambling wasn't a good idea.  And it came about in kind of--it kind of backfired on him.  Going back to 1951, he was a great gian- Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] fan because of Jackie Robinson and Campanella [Roy Campanella] and all them guys.
Speaker 1: Me too.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So was a big Dodgers fan.  And for whatever reason, I can't tell you, I became a Boston Braves [Atlanta Braves] fan.  I loved the Braves and they always lost, always ended up in the basement.  But it was sometime in August of 1951, I was maybe nine years old.  And I said to my father, "You know what, the Giants are going to win the pennant."  And he said, "No, that's impossible.  The Dodgers are so far ahead."  He took me to the standings in the paper, he said, "This is the number of games, the season ends in September, it just can't happen."  I said, "I'll bet it does."  He said, "All right.  I'm going to teach you about betting.  We'll bet, but you're going to pay off if you lose.  What do you want to bet?"  And we bet a quart of fried clams.  A quart, which to me was a stupendous amount of these clams.  And the season, of course, continued on.  The Giants started to make a run at the Dodgers, and everybody remembers Bobby Thomson's shot heard round the world when he hit the home run for the Giants, and the Dodgers went down in defeat to the Giants, and I won the bet.  And as soon as that was announced, my father said, "Hey, come on, get your coat on."  I did.  We drove up to a local fried clam place, he bought a quart of fried clams.  He said, "You won the bet, I have to pay up."
Speaker 1: I bet you can still taste them can't you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, he didn't make me eat them all.  We, we all shared them.  But I never forgot that, I never forgot that little story.
Story_ID: 380307
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your siblings.  Would you tell me how many siblings you have, would you give me their names, and where they are and what they're doing today?  Oldest to youngest?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have three siblings.  My oldest sister's name is Rose Budd Grayer.  She's about five-and-a-half years younger than I am, and she lives in North Andover [Massachusetts] and she teaches at Bunker Hill Community College here in the Boston [Massachusetts] area.  My next sister is an assistant superintendent of schools in Springfield [Massachusetts].  She's about fifty-five.  Her name is Celeste Budd Jackson.  And my brother is a--his name is Steve Budd [Steven Budd].  He's also Springfield born and raised and lives in Northampton [New Hampshire], and at the present time is back in school, he's a student.
Speaker 1: What is he studying?
Speaker 2: He is interested in human relations, assisting people who run into problems life and being a counselor, that kind of thing.  That's what I think his interests are.
Story_ID: 380308
Speaker 1: You're married?
Speaker 2: I am married, yes.
Speaker 1: Your wife's name?
Speaker 2: My wife's name is Jacqueline, Jackie Simmons Budd [Jacqueline Simmons Budd].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you have children.  Could you tell me the names of your children, their ages and where they are today?
Speaker 2: Certainly.  I have three children, three girls.  My oldest is Kimberly [Kimberly Budd].  She was born in 1966 in Detroit, Michigan.  She's an attorney, and she lives in West Newton, Mass [West Newton, Massachusetts].  My middle daughter is Kristi [Kristi Budd].  Kristi lives in Decatur, Georgia.  Kristi is thirty-seven, she's a teacher.  And my youngest daughter is Kerri.  Kerri Budd Evans.  She lives in Athens, Georgia; she's trained as a nurse.  And so they're all doing very well, I'm very proud of them.  Each of them has two children.
Speaker 1: Nice. So you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We have six grandchildren.
Speaker 1: That's great.  Well, we'll take a look at the grandchildren through the pictures a little later on.
Speaker 2: Sure, fine.
Story_ID: 380309
Speaker 1: Attorney Budd [HistoryMaker Wayne Budd], what are your earliest memories of growing up in Springfield [Massachusetts]?  You've talked your father [Joseph Budd], and taking you to New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and winning the bet with him on the baseball, but what other early--how far back can you remember?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I can remember spending time while my dad was in the [U.S.] military in Greenfield [Massachusetts], and, you know, I enjoyed that because I was just a little kid, three, four years old.  I remember starting school in Springfield.  And, you know, it's interesting, because as I started school in a pretty mixed neighborhood, pretty much 50/50, I think, in terms of racial mix.  So the school was pretty much like that.  There was one or two black teachers in the school, which I never had.  But interestingly, we had a black principal.
Speaker 1: This was elementary?
Speaker 2: Elementary school in Springfield, yeah.  The William Nelson DeBerry School [William N. DeBerry Elementary School, Springfield, Massachusetts].  And so I grew up going to school there, and it was a good experience.  I did well in school.  My grandfather, who was a great collector of things, collected pictures of all the presidents of the United States and thought it would be a terrific idea if I memorized the names of all the presidents.  And so at five years old, they made me memorize all of these presidents, and that was considered to, you know, it was considered to be sort of unusual, which I suppose it was.  We did go--but it did spark in me a life-long interest in the presidency, in terms of learning various facts and things about the presidents, and I'm always trying to listen to more obscure and lesser-known presidents.  It's been a life-long hobby, something that I took up as a kid.  I enjoy sports; I played baseball, and football, and basketball.  None particularly well, but I played at it.  Did pretty well in school, and I have mainly pleasant memories growing up.  You know, enjoyed a--we lived in a modest, but comfortable environment.  My dad worked as a police officer, my mom [Octavia Peters Budd] was, worked at a factory [United States Envelope Company] in Springfield as a regular factory worker.
Story_ID: 379983
Speaker 1: Would you describe the home in which you and your two sisters [Rose Budd Grayer and Celeste Budd Jackson] and brother [Steven Budd] grew up in?  And the block that you lived on, your neighborhood, a little bit for us?
Speaker 2: Well, originally we lived on Quincy Street, which is in the Winchester Square area.  Now, called Mason Square section of Springfield [Massachusetts], which was a largely African American, but a sprinkling of others--whites.  There weren't any Hispanics or Asian folks that I can recall.  But, we lived in a pretty modest triple decker that my parents eventually bought.  We then--but it was small, very small.  We then moved out to the Pine Point section of Springfield, which is more of a suburban--still within the city lines, where my dad [Joseph Budd] happened to grow up.  And my mom [Octavia Peters Budd] still lives in the home that they bought there over fifty years ago.  So, again, it was a small house, but comfortable.  My parents were--spent wisely, spent well, sought to save.  And so we made sure that their kids had plenty in terms of food, clothing, all the necessities alive for.  More than amply provided.  We lived reasonably comfortably, but not extravagantly by any means.  We didn't do fancy vacations or anything like that.  That wasn't available, but there were--we did have nice surroundings.
Story_ID: 379984
Speaker 1: You mentioned that Winchester Square [Springfield, Massachusetts] is now called Mason Square [Springfield, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that transition about?
Speaker 2: Yeah. There was a gentleman back in the end of the 19th century--I learned this history long after I had left Springfield [Massachusetts].  His name was Mason [Primus Mason].  And, however he acquired it, he had an awful lot of land in the Springfield area.  And he gave a good portion of it to the city to be dedicated as a park.
Speaker 1: He was African American?
Speaker 2: He was African American.  And, you know, it's interesting because growing up in Springfield, I remember very well a Mason Street.  I remember growing up with a Mason family.  Indeed, one of the Masons, in my father's generation served on the city council for a number of years, Paul Mason.  Grew up with the Mason boys, but never realizing what that history was until I was an adult.  Which goes to show, you know, it's interestingly enough, growing up, we didn't have much exposure to African American history.  Very, very little, so you may have heard a little bit about a Benjamin Banneker, for example.  But there's no focus on it.  Or about Carver--was it George Carver [George Washington Carver]?  And some of his accomplishments, and Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois], but there was no focus.  In a very sad way, we missed out a little bit.  You know, I can remember growing up thinking--and you were taught this implicitly, if not explicitly--how tough it was for people in the South, living in the South, and how they had to go through certain rigors, and face certain obstacles, and segregation, and poor opportunity for education and no access to public accommodations.
Speaker 1: No high schools, for example.
Speaker 2: No high schools, no true employment opportunities, or few good employment opportunities.  And that's how we were brought up, to kind of, feel badly.  You know, you'd feel badly that your brethren in the South weren't given these opportunities, and it's just so interesting to see the twists today where, in the South, in many, many ways have surpassed in terms of opportunities.  Things that have certainly surpassed people of the North, so to speak.  To that point, I've often thought--when I was getting ready to go to college, I wouldn't have thought, and if I'd thought about it, it would have been a folly, to go to the University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi], or the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] or the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].  One generation later, my son-in-law [Damon Evans] and my daughter [Kerri Budd Evans], they live in Athens, Georgia.  My son-in-law is thirty-six years old, he's African American, and he's the athletic director at the University of Georgia.  He replaced Vince Dooley, who is a legend in Georgia, at the university, and throughout the South.  At that age, for that kind of an accomplishment, even when I was his age, you'd laugh at somebody who said, "Oh, I'm going to become the athletic director at the University of Georgia and I'm African American."  You'd take humor in that.  But to see it realized is really something.  I'm very proud of all of my kids, and all of their husbands, but it's just interesting to--that little footnote in history.  To see that, what he's been able to accomplish.

Speaker 1: Say a little bit more about your family life--mother [Octavia Peters Budd], father [Joseph Budd], siblings.  What are some of the holidays and special events that you remember that were family?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Christmas was a big deal.  We certainly celebrated Christmas in a family fashion.  Easter, I remember being kind of a big deal.  My parents insisted that we go to church, we were raised Catholic, so we celebrated the appropriate religious holidays that are celebrated by the Catholic church.  The home environment, of course, my mother was the center of the home, and--but my dad participated because she worked, and he worked in some parts of his career, midnights and afternoons, so they kind of made sure the kids were looked after and provided for (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What work did she do?  What was her--
Speaker 2: She worked in a factory, the United States Envelope Company [Springfield, Massachusetts], on a machine.  She operated a machine.  She did that for any number of years until she retired.

Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up in Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Sights (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What sights, sounds, and smells?
Speaker 2: Geez, that's a tough one.
Speaker 1: Well, pick any one of them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know what I remember?  And it's about this time of year.  The smell in the air that spring is coming, because it meant you start playing baseball.  The ground, the grass.  I remember those smells.  Those stick out in my mind, and I associate that with sports.  I also remember my dad [Joseph Budd] and my grandfather [Richard Budd]--we had a fairly large yard at our home, and they liked to work outside.  That wasn't something that I particularly loved to do, but I was co-opted into it.  And I remember the smells of spring and the leaves in the fall, raking them up in the fall, helping to rake and plant stuff and cut grass in the summer.   I remember the biting cold in the morning, shoveling snow off the driveway, so they could get out and go to work, and there was a kid doing that kind of stuff.  My parents--my father was one that you didn't sit idle.  If you're sitting around, there's something wrong.  We gotta put you--keep you busy.  It's something that's lasted with me through all my life, so I very rarely sit around.  I'm sure it comes from that home training.
Story_ID: 379987
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that you attended the DeBerry Elementary School [William N. DeBerry Elementary School, Springfield, Massachusetts] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes I did.
Speaker 1: That there were two African American teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, co- yeah, yeah there were two that I can remember.  An African American principal, Rebecca Johnson [Rebecca M. Johnson], for whom the school was named, now it's Rebecca.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Her name again?
Speaker 2: Rebecca Johnson.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: You mean, in terms of--
Speaker 1: Well, were you a good student?  Fair?  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I did like school.  I was a very good student and anything other than very good would not be tolerated by my father [Joseph Budd], so (laughter) I was motivated from home to make sure I behaved myself, which I didn't always.  But I behaved myself.  And he always had in mind the, the longer view.  That you're going to go to college, so if you ever screw up in school, I don't care what grade it is.  It could be the second grade, if you screw up, that's gonna be off the table, going on to get a further education.  So, therefore, you cannot, you can only do your very, very best and you're going to put in the maximum effort to accomplish that.  But I'd say I did well in school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 379988
Speaker 1: How many grades did you spend at the DeBerry [William N. DeBerry Elementary School, Springfield, Massachusetts]?  Did you go to a middle school from there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we called it junior high school then, so you went on after sixth grade to junior high, which I attended initially attended Buckingham Junior High [Buckingham Junior High School, Springfield, Massachusetts], which was right in that Winchester [Winchester Square]/Mason Square, right there.  Happened to be a school my dad [Joseph Budd] went to, yeah, earlier on.  And about that time, we moved to another section of the city, and so I attended Myrtle Street Junior, Junior High School [Myrtle Street Junior High School] out in the Pine Point section of Springfield [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Would you spell the name of the school?  It's Myrtle?
Speaker 2: Myrtle, yeah.  M-Y-R-T-L-E.  Myrtle, yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you. What do you remember about the junior high years?  Anything stand out in your memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember the first report card I got in the seventh grade.  I remember that because I got two Cs, which I did not qualify for the honor roll.  And I was really upset about that.  I'd gotten a C in math and a C in shop. Shop class.  And I remember dreading taking those marks home, which, of course, I had to, to get the report card signed.  And I remember the principal, I was standing outside, out in the corridor of the school looking at the honor roll, seeing I wasn't there.  First marking period, seventh grade.  And the principal happened to come out, and he said, "What's wrong with you?" And I said, "Well, I didn't make the honor roll."  He said, "There'll be bigger honor rolls than this one.  And there'll be bigger opportunities than this one.  So hang in there."  And frankly, the next time, I made the high honor roll, the very next marking period.  I don't know what I did with that shop class.  (Laughter) But I somehow did.  But I pretty much was an honor student throughout.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers during the junior high years that were influential with you and you sort of remember their presence with you?  Anybody stand out?
Speaker 2: Actually, the teacher that stands out was a sixth grade teacher, Mr. O'Malley [ph.].  He was a rarity in one sense that he was a male teaching in elementary school.  I think he was the only one in the school.  And he was one of those, while my dad pushed from home, he pushed from within the school.  He was very good in working with kids and getting kids involved.  And he was very good to me in terms of pushing me.  Always saying, "Hey, you're not doing your best work.  Oh, no, you can do better than that."  And he would continually push me, so I was getting it from both ends, and frankly, it was helpful.  Frankly, it was helpful.
Story_ID: 379989
Speaker 1: Even at the junior high level, did you have any notions or ideas about what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  No I can't say that I can remember wanting to--I always wanted to go to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York].  That's true, all the way from junior high through high school [Cathedral High School, Springfield, Massachusetts].  I did and I applied, and the congressman who was favorably inclined to appointing me didn't have any appointments for the year that I would be getting out of high school.  And I remember him asking me, "Well, would you like to go to the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado]?"  And I said, "Not really."  And (laughter) so I never pursued it further.  But, West Point was something I wanted to do.  So maybe being in the [U.S.] military had some appeal.
Story_ID: 379990
Speaker 1: What high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Cathedral [Cathedral High School], a Catholic high school in Springfield [Massachusetts].  It's in the cathedral (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, so you weren't in the public school then.  You were not in public school?
Speaker 2: For high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the years at Cathedral?  What were they like?  How do you remember those years?
Speaker 2: Well, looking back at it now, I think it was part of a very good educational process that went beyond the classroom.  Let me explain why.  When I started at Cathedral in ninth grade, I also started with my closest friend.  Came, joined the high school in the tenth grade, that's Tom Reilly [Thomas Reilly], who's a well known politician here in Massachusetts.  But he and I, we've been best friends since we were twelve, junior high school.  But when I went there, there were--I think I was the only person in my class of color, out of around four hundred or so people.  Eventually, two kids transferred in, so we graduated with three.  But, I was saying that this was part of my education because it taught me to operate in an environment where I might be the only person.  And to kind of get comfortable with that, to not be intimidated by it, to--where you start to see people assuming that you may not have what it takes to do well.  And, yet, you can take that underestimation and turn it around to your advantage.  So I did pretty well in the high school, finished in top ten in the class, played football, basketball, ran a little track.  Again, I wasn't a star, but, you know, I played--
Speaker 1: But you were on the first team?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I played.  Graduated high honors, was a class officer for the last two years in the school.  And I only say that because those were adjustments that had to be made, and through it all, my dad [Joseph Budd] was continuing to push.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: History?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Loved American history.
Story_ID: 379991
Speaker 1: What extracurricular activities were you involved in outside of high school [Cathedral High School, Springfield, Massachusetts] and during the summer?  What--how did you spend your out-of-school time?
Speaker 2: Work. Working.
Speaker 1: Where did you work?
Speaker 2: Always worked.  Always had a job.
Speaker 1: What kind of job did you have?
Speaker 2: Oh, starting with--very popular in the Springfield [Massachusetts] area, in what's called the Pioneer Valley, the Connecticut Valley [Connecticut River Valley, Massachusetts], to work on the tobacco farms.  They grew the cigar tobacco in that area.  And, so, a lot of the kids, particularly kids of color growing up, you would work on the tobacco farms and I remember doing that, and being absolutely persuaded I wanted nothing to do with agriculture. (Laughter) It was not a fun job.  I spent a summer working at Camp Atwater in East Brookfield Mass [sic. North Brookfield, Massachusetts], which I was a waiter.  You know, I cleaned stuff up and stuff like that.  But it was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Where was Camp Atwater?  Was it a private camp?  Public?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, a private camp.  African American camp founded by William Nelson Deberry.  Many, many, many years ago, and as you travel around the United States and you run into people of color, from wherever in this country, they know of, or attended, or worked at Camp Atwater.  It happens to me all the time.  You always have a ready Atwater reunion almost any spot you go to.  It's always a common point of conversation.
Speaker 1: How many summers did you work there?
Speaker 2: I only worked there one summer.  I only worked there one summer, but I was able to work there in the girl's season as well as the boy's season, and that was a definite plus. (Laughter) It was a lot of fun. But I've worked in factories, I've worked at a special needs camp one summer.  I've been a janitor, been a waiter, been a farmworker, landscaper.  I've gotten a little dirt and grease under the nails from time to time, yeah.  But it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 379992
Speaker 1: The stage had been set early on through your father [Joseph Budd] that you were going to college--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So upon graduation, what year did you graduate from high school [Cathedral High School, Springfield, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did you select the college that you selected?  Where did you go to college?
Speaker 2: I went to Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts].  In the summer between my junior and senior years in high school, I was working at this special needs camp, and a couple of people came to the camp accompanying the brother of one of them who was going to attend the camp.  They were black women--well, girls, from Boston [Massachusetts], and they started talking about what a great place--you know, they lived in Boston and it was this, it was that, and I was listening to this.  Sounds a lot different from Springfield [Massachusetts].  And at the time I had been thinking of going to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], and I had a pretty good shot of going up there and there was a number of people from our community who had gone to Dartmouth.  And so I was thinking about that and also at the camp, the same summer, was a fellow who was handicapped, who had just graduated from Boston College Law School [Newton Centre, Massachusetts] and gone to Boston College undergrad.  And he was talking about Boston College.  These girls that I'd met with were talking about the City of Boston.  And I kind of put two and two together and said, "Geez.  Maybe, you know, maybe going to school in Boston's a good idea."  Boston College, I was Catholic, going to a Jesuit school wouldn't be all bad.  And son of a gun, it turns out, it was the only school I applied to.  And my dad and I came down, we did an interview, you know, we met people at the school, I was admitted and there I was.  Again, at BC [Boston College] in my admissions--in the class that I came in with, there were two African Americans, one of whom ended up graduating with me, so there were two in our class out of maybe fifteen hundred people.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: The person I graduated with was Marie Rouseff [ph.] whose dad was a professor at BC actually.  I never had him, but he was a professor there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 379993
Speaker 1: I remember when you came to Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: I remember meeting you. (Laughter) You were a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: What was that first year like for you as a freshman at BC [Boston College]?
Speaker 2: Actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you remember that first year?
Speaker 2: I remember it pretty favorably.  It was good to be away from home.  You know, learning, being on your own, so to speak.  I got myself elected president of the freshman class.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did.  I met--there were a couple of guys in the school.  Some of whom you remember, Harry Hall, who was in your fraternity, the Kappas.  A guy by the name of Louis White [Louis J. White] who was an Omega, in the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity.  I ended up going into the Omega Fraternity, largely because of the example of that guy who was at BC, Louis White, who in later years I became a law partner with.  But, BC was a good experience, again having similar to Cathedral [Cathedral High School, Springfield, Massachusetts], taking it onto the next level, being one of very, very few in that environment, I saw, again, as a part of the educational process.  Being pretty much on your own in an environment where you are one of very few, and, you know, making a go of it in that environment.  And that's by the way where being in a fraternity, predominantly black fraternity, all black fraternity, was helpful.  Because it gave a nice balance to, you know our, as you remember, the chapters were city chapters and not college chapters, so you met people from different schools.  Yeah, and that helped balance on the social side, and the academic side, and the school side.  I was active at the school, very active, did well academically.  The first year, all four years, they were just positive (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were at Boston College, '59 [1959] through roughly '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], right in the middle of the peak of the intensity of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did the Civil Rights Movement impact your life and life at Boston College?  Were you involved in any civil rights activities, or--
Speaker 2: Somewhat.  Somewhat, but not as active--looking back, if I had the benefit of hindsight and apply it, I would have done things a little differently.  I think I may have taken a more of an active role in some of the things that were going on in the South, because that's where the focus of the Civil Rights Movement was at that time, and I didn't do that, for whatever reasons, I didn't do that.  And if I had it to do over, understanding the significance, the historical importance, I think I would have done it a little differently, but I did not.  I was around the edges, but not deeply involved.  And I'm the kind of guy who, if I'm gonna do something, I get deeply involved.
Speaker 1: What did you major in at Boston College?  What was your--
Speaker 2: Economics.
Speaker 1: Economics?
Speaker 2: I went in with the idea of being a history major, and decided that I thought economics would give me a broader overview of things.  And at that point I time, I just decided, not that I wanted to be a lawyer, but that I wanted to go to law school.  So I thought that economics would be very helpful in going to--in getting myself lined up to go to law school.
Speaker 1: You said not that you wanted to be a lawyer, but you wanted to go to law school.  What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I'm not a prophetic guy at all, but what I was thinking was--I always knew you needed more than one degree, I always knew that.  And I was thinking of getting the degree that would get me the most options in life.  I thought with a law degree you could go into government, you could work in a corporation, you could do business, or, if all else failed, you could become a lawyer.  And--
Speaker 1: And you've done all of that, which we're going to talk about. Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But when I did go off to law school [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan], I did have the idea in mind of becoming a--not becoming a lawyer.
Story_ID: 379994
Speaker 1: Did you go directly to law school after graduating from Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sort of a circuitous route, but it happened that way.  I was in Army ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], and I was, you know, on the path to being commissioned.  I thought I was going to take the deferral, military deferral, go to law school, and then do my [U.S.] military service when I had completed law school.  That was a common practice, as you may recall.  What happened to me was, just before graduation and commissioning, maybe this time of the year, April, the [U.S.] Army called me in for a physical examination.  I'd complained about a bad knee all along, I was doing good while in the ROTC, but I said, "Oh, by the way, I have a bad knee.  I had hurt it one time playing football."  And they pooh-poohed it.  But finally, there was something in the record that said you go down and get this physical exam.  I went down, the orthopedic guy took some x-rays, says, "You got a bad knee.  You've got to get that fixed."  So we went back to BC [Boston College], the colonel said, "Get your knee fixed.  We can't commission you."  I said, "What happens if I don't, sir?"  And he said, "Well, you can't be commissioned.  You know, you can't go."  I said, "Can I be drafted?"  Which was one of the things you were concerned about in those days.  He said, "No, you don't understand.  You can't be commissioned, you can't be drafted, you can't enlist."  I said, "I think I do understand.  Thank you, sir."  And I was out.  And that--almost simultaneously with that, came the opportunity on the campus, to interview with Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].  The recruiter from Ford Motor Company was on the BC campus, and with instructions from whoever he worked for back at Ford, to look for Negroes.  And the guy in the placement office, who's still a friend of mine to this day said, "Geez, this one guy I know here, who fits that description, who would be a good candidate for you, but he's going to law school.  So forget about him."  "No, let's talk to him."  I talked to them, went out there for an interview.  I mean, it was my first time further west than New York State, and decided why not go to work, and gain some experience?  Live in a new environment?   And I could go to law school at night?  I didn't plan to be a lawyer, what difference did it make where I went, what I did, how I got it?  But if I--as long as I did it. And that's what I did.
Story_ID: 379995
Speaker 1: I graduated from BC [Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], went out, worked at Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan], met my first wife there.  My first daughter [Kimberly Budd] was born there.  I worked there for four years, and during that period of time, went to that law school [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan] at night, five nights a week for the four years.  I started in a class of about 125 night students, we graduated twenty-three.  Most people deselected, you know, going to school for four years, every day of the week got old.  So the law school experience was a very difficult one, and I'll tell you if you don't mind, I'll tell you a little story about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Go right ahead.
Speaker 1: Turns out the first black teacher I ever had, was at law school.  And, actually, I had two in my second year.  One was for constitutional law, guy by the name of Charles Quick.  African American guy who was originally from Boston [Massachusetts].  To make this story short, I had also my property teacher happened to be black.  It's totally unusual, but it happened, 'cause there were only three of us in this whole class, African Americans.  Two or three women, I mean, no black women, so it was very much a white--again, another white experience in a very black city, Detroit [Michigan].  Anyway, when I took this constitutional law class from this guy, Professor Quick, we took the course with these conditions.  A, September to June, no tests, no exams, no papers, no class participation counted, the only thing that's going to count on your grade in June, and he made this announcement at the beginning, was your grade on the final exam.  That's the only thing.  Attendance was obligatory for the night school, so you always sat in the same spot.  You sat alphabetically, so my name, B-U-D-D, B-U, put me right in the center of the front row.  So I was always sitting right in front of him.  Or he was standing right in front of me.
Story_ID: 380310
Speaker 1: Actually, it was the last class before the final exam.  And he's telling everybody he pulled a big surprise on us.  He said, "Oh, by the way," you know, we were studying American constitutional law, the whole year was about that.  He said, "I'm sure that all of you have been studying the Michigan Constitution [Constitution of Michigan] on your own, so of the four questions on the exam, one will be on the Michigan Constitution."  And everybody, "Aw, geez.  Where'd this come from?"  And then he dismissed the class.  And as everybody was leaving, he said to me, "Hey, you, come here."  I said, "Yes, sir."  He says, "I'm gonna do you a favor, but you may not think it's a favor now.  But one day you'll appreciate what I'm gonna do for you."  And thoughts going through my mind, you know, this guy's from my home state, Massachusetts, we're out here in Detroit [Michigan], he's probably going to offer me the final exam in advance.  And how do I handle this?  This is an ethical issue, you know.  My mind's running like this.  I don't--what do I do?  Then he continued.  He said, "I've decided I'm going to flunk you out of law school."  And my first reaction was, "You just told us that--I mean, all year-round--long that the final exam is what everything goes on, and the final's next week!"  And he said, "Well, you know, I've been watching you, and I've decided you don't have what it takes to be a lawyer.  So, you know, I'm going to save you some time, save you some money, save the school some space, because you're not going anywhere with this."  And he said, "So I just wanted you to know that's what I'm going to do."  So, you know, it's an interesting predicament to be in.  I was about to get married that summer, I didn't feel like I could go to the dean and say to the dean, "You know, my black professor just said that he's gonna flunk me out of law school."  And if you go back, this was in 1965.  If you go back to that era, you remember there was a certain authority that was attached to a teacher or professor, that their word was pretty much law.  You couldn't do that now-a-days, but he could get away with that.  I told the guys in my study group.  They said, "Hey, hang in there."  You know, blah, blah, blah.  And I did take the exam.  And I passed.  But not through any doings of this professor, and I'll tell you why.  Wayne [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan] marked on a curve, and I somehow made the curve.  But how I know what his intent was, he went off as a visitor to Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  And at Howard, he had a--I had a friend who was attending Howard law school.  And the guy called me up in September, he met Charles Quick, established again the Boston [Massachusetts] connection, and said, "By the way, you're at Wayne State.  Do you know my friend [HistoryMaker] Wayne Budd?"  And the guy said, "Know him?  Yeah, I remember that guy.  I flunked him out of law school."  So, I know that because my pal called me and said, "Sorry to hear you're out of law school."  I said, "No, I'm very much in law school."  "But," he said, "Well I was told by Quick that he flunked you out."
Story_ID: 380311
Speaker 1: Jump forward again.  He came back, now I'm in my fourth year, in last year.  And to be honest with you, whenever I'd see him coming, I'd go the other way.  I had no, I had nothing to say to the man.  You know, he was out to do me in.  I didn't have him for any course.  Finally, within two weeks of graduation, I ran into him in a way that you couldn't help but avoid passing each other.  He was a short, bald, fat guy.  Always had a cigarette dangling out of his mouth, then in those days you could smoke wherever you wanted to.  So he had a cigarette dangling out of his mouth.  And so I'm walking by him, and I hope I can get by without saying anything, but again, I'm two weeks from graduation.  He stops and he said, "Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.  I know you."  I said, "Yes sir.  You may know me.  You had me a couple of years ago.  I had you for constitutional law."  "Yeah, but didn't I get rid of you?"  I said, "Apparently not.  I'm still here."  He shakes his head like the one that got away, you know?  So he's shaking his head, and said, "By the way, what are you doing here?"  I said, "Well, I'm graduating in a couple weeks.  You know, I'm just about through."  And he shakes his head again.  He says, "Then what are you doing?"  I said, "Actually," I brightened up a little bit, because I'm talking about my future.  I said, "Actually, I've decided to go back to Massachusetts, and I'm going to practice law."  Well, that set off in him this laugh that I remember to this day.  This was in June of 1967.  I mean, this guy is laughing in such a way that--you ever standing with somebody and they start to laugh and you don't know what the joke is?  You feel a little foolish?  So that's how I felt.  So finally, he's going through this laugh routine, and I said, "I'm sorry, I don't get the joke."  And he's trying to--he's a fat guy, he's got a cigarette cough--he's trying to catch his breath.  And he says, "You know, you just don't get it, do you?"  He said, "Look, first of all, you'll never pass the Massachusetts bar exam, okay?  That's not gonna happen.  But if, through some quirk," these are his words, "through some quirk you pass the exam, who do you think would ever come to you with a legal problem and hire you to resolve it?"  And with that, he was so taken with his own humor, he continued on his way and to this very day, I remember that laughter trailing behind him as he went off.  Jump forward again to 1980.  Thirteen years later, I was invited back to the law school to be the commencement speaker for the law school.  I was the sitting bar president for Massachusetts, Massachusetts Bar [Massachusetts Bar Association] president.  And they thought that was a pretty big deal out there at Wayne [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan], and they invited me back to receive an alumni award and to be the commencement speaker.  And they were saying, "Oh, what a great student this guy, [HistoryMaker] Wayne Budd, was."  Which wasn't true.  I was fine, but I wasn't great by any stretch.  And this and that, and which brought me to mind of Charles Quick.  I asked for Professor Quick, because I would have liked to have seen him and shared with him some of the things I was able to do, not withstanding his own view of my future.  And lo and behold, he had died six months earlier.  And I didn't have the opportunity to say to him what had happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was behind this attitude that he had with you?  Flunking you out, and you were never going to be a lawyer.  What was behind all that?  What was his--
Speaker 1: Well, I think, and frankly, I've asked people that.  In fact, I've enquired after it.  And I've been told that there were people a few years back who saw themselves as the gatekeepers.  And they would decide, "Well, you two guys can come through, but this one, you don't."  And they just gave themselves the authority to do that.  And in so doing, they could toy, or determine, or destroy your future.  Now, to be honest with you, I'm not sure what I would have done if I had flunked that course.  Because it would have meant I would have had to repeat a year, at least at a minimum, and he knew this.  And when you were there, all you wanted to do was get out.  You know, four years, five nights a week.  It was--it was a burden (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was that the only course you were taking, though?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no.  But you were taking just enough courses that it would throw you back a year.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Sure, I passed, I would have passed all my courses except his, but it would mean that in order to graduate, I'd have to have spent another year there.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: And he knew that.  And so he knew that would be akin to flunking you out.  I'd have to repeat a year, and not likely, I don't know what I would have done, but I sure as heck would have been discouraged from becoming a lawyer. Or if I had to repeat a year and all that sort of thing.  And I may have just continued working at Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 380312
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your position at Ford [Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan]?  What were your responsibilities?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: I was in what they call the Ford Graduate Training Program, or the Ford College Graduate Program, in the field of industrial relations.  Which meant that I had regular assignments, on the job assignments, in various areas of industrializations.  Labor relations, personnel, recruiting, benefits, that kind of thing, safety.  And you'd work in a plant on a day-to-day job, and then you'd have periodic and planned moves.  Interesting, Ford in those days, had maybe three hundred thousand employees.  And you could count, if you used all of your fingers, you could count the number of African Americans who wore ties to work.  It's incredible.  It's come a long way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you manage working full time in this position, and going to law school [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan] at night.  How did you manage all that?  Your time?
Speaker 2: You didn't have a lot of spare time.  You were either engaged in working--
Speaker 1: When did you study?  When did you do your reading?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you would do it after school, at night, and then you would do it on the weekends, because in the work environment, they expected you to give them everything they could ask for--
Story_ID: 380313
Speaker 1: You know, it's interesting.  When I was near the end of law school [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan], and I was virtually certain I was coming back to Massachusetts, I did have an inter- a  discussion with a fairly senior guy at Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan], which at that time, just cemented my plans.  I asked him for some career advice, which he just granted.  You know, he sat down with me.  And I had asked him, how I'd done for the four years that I had been at Ford, and he said, "You've done just fine.  Done well.  You know, we're very pleased."   I said, "Am I doing as well as my peers, who are likewise in this program [Ford Graduate Training Program]?"  "Oh, absolutely.  You're doing fine.  No problem."  I said, "What are my chances to get a supervisory position?"  He said, "Ah, that's different."  He said, "For you to get that, we'd have to hand pick something."  So I said, "That puts me at a distinct disadvantage with my peer group."  He said, "I guess you could look at it that way, but that's how we would see it."  So I said, "Geez.  I'd be wasting time around here."  So that just cemented my inclination to come back to Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: What did your father [Joseph Budd] say, how did he feel, and your mother [Octavia Peters Budd], about your law school completion?
Speaker 1: They're very proud.  They're very, very pleased.  Very pleased.  And at the time, I was thinking of setting up shop at Springfield [Massachusetts].  And I came here because I needed to take the bar exam, I had a child [Kimberly Budd], a family, and I needed to have a base, you know, while I studied for the bar.  So I took a job, I took a job with General Electric in Lynn, Mass [Lynn, Massachusetts].  That's how I ended up living in the North Shore, in Peabody [Massachusetts].  Studied for the exam and was fortunate enough to get by it, and I moved on.
Speaker 2: So you passed the Massachusetts bar within the next year?
Speaker 1: Yes, I took the December 1967 bar exam and was admitted in May of '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 380314
Speaker 1: And then what happened next?  How did your career begin then?  You've now passed the bar, and you're in Boston [Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --what was the next step?
Speaker 2: Well, I decided I needed some legal experience in GE [General Electric].  I was at GE, working as a professional recruiter in that department.  Recruiting engineers, actually.  And it was a good experience, and it was going well.  And they said, "Well, maybe you'd like to work in our law department."  And I said, "Yeah, maybe that would make sense."  And they said, "Well, it would be out in Evendale, Ohio."  Which is Cincinnati, Ohio.  And I said, "That doesn't make sense to me.  I'm not interested in making another move."  So I was offered the opportunity to join the office of the corporation counsel in the City of Boston as an assistant corporation counsel.  Interestingly at the time, my then wife was pregnant with our second child [Kristi Budd] and taking that job meant I would be giving up my health insurance, and we wouldn't have coverage for the birth of the child, and I would be taking a 40 percent cut in pay.  No, 50 percent cut in pay.  But I did, we did it and I started working in the city as a trial lawyer, learning how to be a trial lawyer for the, in the City of Boston.  And opened up a little office, modest enough that, you know, you hear of people sharing offices, well, this guy and I shared a desk.  So that I was on one side of the desk, he was on the other side.  If he had a client, I'd step out in the hall, if I had a client, he'd step out in the hall.  And I didn't have many clients.  And for the first month of my private practice in law.
Speaker 1: So you were able to do private practice and be a counsel for the city (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they permitted you to do that and as lawyers you did it on your own time, and you did not do anything that conflicted with the City of Boston, or conflict with the city.  And, yes, so they let you do that.  And my first case was to do my [paternal] grandfather's [Richard Budd] income tax.  Now, my grandfather was a retired city worker and the income tax wasn't that complex, so I had this little file drawer, and one file that rattled around in it.  That was my grandfather's tax return, for which he paid me ten dollars, and it was the only income I had for the month (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where was the office that you shared?
Speaker 2: 11 Beacon.
Speaker 1: 11 Beacon Street.
Speaker 2: 11 Beacon Street.  Yep, 11 Beacon.
Speaker 1: And, who was the person you shared the--
Speaker 2: David Lampson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: David Hinkley Lampson.
Story_ID: 380315
Speaker 1: From there, I was with the city [Boston, Massachusetts] a year or so, got the opportunity to become an assistant attorney general, which I accepted.  I was head of the civil rights division.  And I went to the attorney general one day and said, I wanted to hire somebody else to work with me, and that was Tom Reilly [Thomas Reilly].  And Tom came in and was an assistant attorney general in the civil rights division, as well.  Again, I continued to do some private practice, it was permitted in those days.  I joined a small firm that was just starting out.  Not as a member of the firm, but doing my own thing in the firm.  And my practice started to grow.  You know, it started to get cases (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, what was that firm?
Speaker 1: The name of the firm was Hamilton and Lampson [ph.].  The same guy, Lampson [David Hinkley Lampson (ph.)] with another fellow who had also worked at the city by the name of Jim Hamilton [James Hamilton].  Both of these guys are still my friends to this day.  Tom Reilly came in to the office, and after a couple of years with the attorney general's office--Flash Wiley [HistoryMaker Fletcher "Flash" Wiley], by the way, was one of the--Flash Wiley was a student intern.  He was a Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], under the Joint Center for Political Studies [Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.].  He was assigned to--you know, given the opportunity to do some work in this area.  And I heard about him from Tom Atkins [Thomas I. Atkins] who was at the time a black Boston city councilor.  So Flash came to work for me.  That's how I met Flash.  When he got to Boston, when he first got here in 1970, and we've been friends ever since and law partners for a number of years and we're like brothers, he, Tom and I.  So it was an involvement.  The practice started to grow little by little, little by little.  Do whatever, you know, people--black community in Lynn [Massachusetts] was very supportive of me.  I lived in the--that community, general community in Peabody [Massachusetts], very close to Lynn.  I had a lot of friends in Lynn, and they would give me their legal work, and they gave me a base to start from.
Story_ID: 380316
Speaker 1: Now, you went on and developed with Flash Wiley [HistoryMaker Fletcher "Flash" Wiley], and Tom Reilly [Thomas Reilly] a larger law practice (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Sure, happy to.  While I was practicing law, I got involved in some teaching, so I taught for fifteen years as a member of the adjunct faculty at the Boston College Law School [Newton Centre, Massachusetts].  I did that.  I became a civil service commissioner.  I did that on a part time basis.  Again, from my night school, Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan] experience, you wanted to juggle more than one thing at a time.  So, Tom and I finally put together our own office, just he and I.  And we set up at 3 Center Plaza, and had a lot of fun.  We didn't make a lot of money, but we were able to support ourselves and our families.  At this time, I had three kids.  I think he had two, going on three.  He was just about ready to have his third.  And we decided, "Geez, we're doing pretty good.  Let's--."
Speaker 1: So you were doing this full time with Tom Reilly then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were virtually full time.
Speaker 1: At this point, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Virtually, full time.  You know, I had a couple of side things like the commissioner's job with the state, but it was part time.  Designed as part time, and I taught part time.  And, anyway, we were moseying along and things were going pretty well and we decided, you know, maybe we can hire somebody, you know?  A new associate.  Then we thought more and thought, "Geez, maybe we can't afford to hire somebody full time, let's get a co-op student."  And we did.  We got a co-op student from Northeastern [Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts] by the name of Ralph Martin [Ralph C. Martin, Jr.].  Ralph Martin is a historical figure in his own right, and he subsequently became our associate after graduating from law school.  But more importantly, he became a district attorney for Suffolk County [Massachusetts], an elected district attorney, which we're all very proud of that accomplishment and other accomplishments in his life.  But we were all there together.  Then we joined up with Flash and Flash Wiley, and Tom, and I, and Ralph in 1979 over here at 47 Winter Street, and we established what became the largest minority law firm in New England.  That's, of course, not that big of an accomplishment because there aren't very many minority law firms in New England.  But we had a fine firm, did well.  Then Tom had a chance to go off to public service, as did Ralph, and they both left and we were joined by a fellow by the name of Dean Richlin, a fantastic guy and a good friend and the firm became Budd, Wiley and Richlin, from Budd, Rilley and Wiley.  It went to Budd, Wiley and Richlin, and we practiced law together for a number of years until I left the firm in 1989.
Story_ID: 380317
Speaker 1: While you had this law practice, Budd, Wiley and Richlin, what other community and citywide involvements did you have in business or legal work?
Speaker 2: Very, very active counsel for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at one time.  I was a lawyer assigned to restart an Urban League chapter in Boston [Massachusetts], which I did and was active with for a number of years.  We represented a number, and mainly pro bono, a number of entities in the community; Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center [Boston, Massachusetts], Harvard Street Health Center [Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center, Boston, Massachusetts], Whittier Street Health Center [Boston, Massachusetts].  So we did a fair number of health centers, as I think about it.  But other community groups, we got involved a little bit in politics.  I became the president of the Massachusetts Bar Association, kind of working my way up through the chairs.  And when I was elected, I was the first African American to be elected to any state bar association.
Speaker 1: In the country.
Speaker 2: In the country, yeah.  And I was elected in 1979, and it's a one-year term, so that was a great--
Speaker 1: What were your responsibilities as president of--
Speaker 2: Oh, oversee the state bar.  You know, you had a full-time staff, but you were the bar leader.  You were the designated lawyers of the lawyers statewide.  It was a career changer.  It was one of those things that, at least, for my own career, kind of took me a little bit apart from other lawyers of whatever color or stripe.  You know, because if you're the state bar president, you're seen to be different.  Not that you are, but you're seen that way.  And that opened me up to opportunities to serve on boards, to, to, to get in line for other things.  To work on task forces, for this governor, or that mayor, and, you know, and on, and on, and on.
Story_ID: 380318
Speaker 1: Well, the next big move for you, I believe, came in 1989; is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: When you moved away from your law firm [Budd, Wiley and Richlin] and entered, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is correct.
Speaker 1: Tell me, what happened in 1989?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Actually, I became the United States attorney.  I was named by the first President Bush [President Herbert Walker Bush] to be U.S. attorney for Massachusetts and, actually, you know, to say that I became U.S. attorney is an interesting, but it wasn't the first time that I tried for the job.  I had been considered twice before without success.  And on the third occasion, I pretty much said, "Geez.  This isn't a field that I'm going to be successful in."
Speaker 1: Was this under the first President Bush that you had the early opportunities--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I was, actually, I was the first U.S. attorney he happened to appoint because my predecessor resigned under some pressure.  So shortly after he came in, Massachusetts needed a U.S. attorney, so because of that, I was the first one that he named.  Of those that were named subsequently during the course of his administration.  But I'd been considered before and was not successful, and on the third occasion, others were saying, "Geez, you know, you got a good shot at this thing this time.  You ought to do this, you ought to try."  I said, "Why?  It's not in the cards for me."  But we did try, and I had a lot of help, a lot of support, a lot of guys that--African Americans by the way too, like Judge Ed Redd [Edward Redd], Richie Taylor [Richard Taylor].  Guys like that who got behind my candidacy.  See, you had to convince the Republicans in Massachusetts to appoint me.  To recommend to the president to appoint me.  It's like, if we had a Republican senator, then that senator would have made the nomination through the president.  Without a senator of the same party as the national administration, then it's, kind of an open field.  Paul Cellucci actually was the guy who was very instrumental in me getting the nod.
Speaker 1: Now, you served as U.S. attorney of Massachusetts, for about three years?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Three years, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were your responsibilities?  What was the range of activities that you were responsible for?
Speaker 2: Actually, it's a statewide responsibility.  You're the chief federal prosecutor within that district or state.  In my case, the State of Massachusetts.  You're also the lawyer for the federal government, wherever it wants to bring a civil lawsuit or wherever it is sued.  You oversee an office of, I think, ninety assistant U.S. attorneys.  Maybe that number again in various support staff.  Frankly, I still consider it the best job I've ever had.  It's similar to being a--if you think of the [U.S.] military--similar to being a ship's captain at sea, where you have some tie back to the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] or the [U.S.] Department of the Navy.  But you are pretty much at sea, you run the show.  You determine what the priorities are going to be at that office.  Are you going to go after drug dealers, are you gonna go after pornographers, whatever it is, you can determine what the priorities are.  And we came up with the idea of going after--using the federal tools to go after people in the urban areas that were causing a lot of stress on the lives of people in neighborhoods.  That really was not a popular concept.  Some people would say that's none of the fed's business, but shortly after I became U.S. attorney, a group of people from various communities in Boston [Massachusetts], but to include black communities, Hispanic communities, Asian communities, so-called white communities, all saying, "Geez, why can't the feds help us out?  We've got drug dealers on our streets, we got people running weapons, we know the feds can do this, why don't you help us?  Would you help us?"  And I thought about it, and I talked a lot about it, "Yeah, that's what we're gonna do.  We are gonna do that."  And we did it in a way that we were able to foster cooperation with the state law enforcement people, the local law enforcement people in Boston, Worcester [Massachusetts], Springfield [Massachusetts], and Bedford [Massachusetts], around the state.  And frankly, we had a pretty successful time, and I simply loved the job.  Best job I ever had.
Story_ID: 380319
Speaker 1: And then there was another turning point.  Another step up--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 1992?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was that?
Speaker 2: Actually, the fellow who was named as attorney general, his name was Bill Barr [William P. Barr], and he had been the deputy attorney general previously.  And we became somewhat friendly.  He used to visit our district here in Massachusetts, and he kind of liked what we were doing here and, you know, we became friendly.  I was on what they call the attorney general's advisory committee.  It's like a group--a board of directors or advisors among U.S. attorneys.  About ten of us, and I was the vice chair of this group.  And so I got to see him quite often.  And one time he called me up, and to make a long story short, he called up and said, "How would you like to come to Washington [D.C.]?"  And I said, "To do what?"  And he said, "Well, I don't know.  Keep an open mind.  Maybe there's something down here that you could do some work with us here at the main [U.S.] Department of Justice."  A few days later, although it's a presidential appointment, he said he would like to offer my name to be the associate attorney general.  Which is number three in the department after he and the deputy, and that's what I did.  I went down there to D.C.  I enjoyed the experience.
Speaker 1: And your position?
Speaker 2: Associate attorney general.  I oversaw five of the litigating divisions within the Department of Justice.  I had five assistant attorney generals reporting to me; the Civil Rights Division, the Civil Division, the Environmental Division [Environmental and Natural Resources Division], Antitrust Division, and the Taxation, Taxation Division [sic. Tax Division].  As well as, I oversaw the Bureau of Prisons [Federal Bureau of Prisons].
Story_ID: 380320
Speaker 1: One of the key things when I was there, I was put in charge of the Rodney King investigation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was going to ask you about that--
Speaker 1: --you remember back in Los Angeles [California], yeah.  That was in '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: So you went out to Los Angeles (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: I remember reading about that in the paper.  Tell me about going out there.
Speaker 1: Scary. (Laughter) It was scary.  I mean, there was a full-fledged riot going on, and I was there as a representative of the [U.S.] Department of Justice and the president of the United States [President George Herbert Walker Bush].  All with the idea in mind of determining whether or not there should be a federal prosecution, offer up the help of the federal government to the City of Los Angeles.  The mayor at the time was Tom Bradley--Brady--Bradley--
Speaker 2: Bradley.
Speaker 1: Bradley.  So I met with him, I met with a number of people, and we put together a prosecutorial team.  Decided to prosecute these cops in the federal system, because they'd been acquitted in the state system, and there was a successful prosecution.
Story_ID: 380321
Speaker 1: Tell me about the process of becoming the associate attorney general of the United States.  What was that process for you?
Speaker 2: Actually, it was interesting because, but for Bill Barr [William P. Barr], the then attorney general, I never would have gotten through the process.  Apparently, when I went to the White House [Washington, D.C.] for my interviews--I never met with President Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush], but the personnel people and the staff people who vet these things--I was deemed not to be conservative enough.  So I was rejected.  And they said, "Look for somebody else," to Barr.  And Barr came back with, "Look, you gave me--you told me this was going to be my department, and I could pick my own people, and I want this guy."  So, they yielded to him, and as a result of that, I became the associate attorney general.
Speaker 1: What was the highlight of that experience?  You served there three years; is that correct?
Speaker 2: No, no actually, I was only there a year.  I was there for the last year of the first Bush administration, '92 [1992], '93 [1993].  And so as--the moment the new administration, the new president raises his hand to take the oath, you're gone.  You're fired.  Your resignation--well, you don't even resign.  You're terminated.  So I got out--if the inauguration was on Tuesday, I was out on Friday, and finished up and came back home.
Speaker 1: What was the highlight of your tenure in this position?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, there was a couple, one of which was to oversee the prosecution and the prosecution team for the Rodney King case, the prosecution of four police officers in the federal court system.  Although technically, the case wasn't completed by the time I left office.  And the other was to revive the office of the associate.  It had been, kind of, put on hold for a few years.  And this attorney general decided it was important to have the position activated again.  It's established by law, but to have it activated again.  And so to organize that, to put together the team, and to make it work was a great experience.
Story_ID: 380322
Speaker 1: You had another appointment by President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Would you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was appointed by President Bill Clinton to be on the United--as a commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission.  So that marked my third presidential appointment and the first by a non-Republican.  And I was appointed to a Republican seat on the sentencing commission.  And what it does is oversees the sentencing guidelines that apply in all the federal courts.  I served on that, so I think three or four years.
Speaker 1: That wasn't a full-time position?
Speaker 2: Oh, no. No, no, no.  That was part time with occasional trips to Washington [D.C.], but not required to be in residence there.
Story_ID: 380323
Speaker 1: Well, in 1993, you came to this law firm, Goodwin Procter, and it was called Hoar at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Goodwin, Procter and Hoar [Goodwin, Procter and Hoar LLP] at that time, it's now Goodwin, Procter [Goodwin Procter LLP; Goodwin LLP].  I did.  When I was getting ready to come back to Massachusetts, as I knew I would when I completed my service in Washington [D.C.], I decided to, this time, go into a large firm as opposed as to going into a smaller firm.  I thought I could do well in a larger platform.  And my former partners at the Wiley, Richlin [Budd, Wiley and Richlin] firm had since merged with another firm, and frankly, in a very, very, very friendly way, did not encourage me to rejoin them.  That firm later imploded, and they had a sense of it, I think, that that might happen. So I decided to talk to firms around the city, large firms, that I'd never had an affiliation with.  All with the idea in mind of whether or not it would be a good fit for them and for me.
Speaker 1: How large is Goodwin, Procter?
Speaker 2: Well, now it's about 650 lawyers with offices in California, New York [New York], Boston [Massachusetts], and Washington.  The lion's share of the team is here in Boston, about four hundred lawyers, I guess.
Speaker 1: Now, what were your responsibilities when you first joined this firm?
Speaker 2: I was a full equity partner, senior partner, came in laterally as a senior partner in the--both the litigation and the corporate areas.  I came in without a book of business because I'd been away from the private practice of law for about four years.  So with a lot of help and support here, I had a lot of help and support, I set out to build a practice, which I did.  However, I did leave the firm in 1996.
Speaker 1: When you say, litigation, how can we explain that to a lay person?  What is litigation?  What do you do as a litigation lawyer?  What is the nature of that work?
Speaker 2: In and around trial work, appearing in court, in and around conflict, as opposed to a transactional lawyer who's doing deals.  A litigation lawyer is involved where there's a lawsuit, usually.  Where conflict has arisen between parties, and they're before some third party, a tribunal, a court, an arbitrator, a mediator for the resolution of that conflict.  And I was in the litigation area, mainly because that's been my background throughout my years at the private practice and my public work.  And corporate, because there were aspects of what I wanted to do in building a practice here that would call more on the business law side as opposed to the litigation side.  So they were good enough to permit me to be in both areas.  That's what I did.
Speaker 1: Were you pleased with your work here in those early years?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  I really like this firm a lot.  I like the chemistry here, I like their approach, I like their leadership.  Incidentally, we're the first firm in the country, a large firm, to be led by a woman.  Regina Pisa [Regina M. Pisa] became our chairman and managing partner back in the late '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: Spell her last name for me?
Speaker 2: P-I-S-A, Pisa, as in the Leaning Tower [Leaning Tower of Pisa, Pisa, Italy].  Yeah, so, she's our firm leader and she has a great vision for this place and, interestingly, the partners follow that vision.  They have adopted her vision.  So it's a good place to be.  They--like most law firms, have to work very hard to make sure that the compliment of lawyers and support staff are diverse.  They reflect the area, they reflect the client base, and that's an issue and that's something I work on now, but and have my prior iteration here.
Story_ID: 380324
Speaker 1: You left Goodwin, Procter and Hoar [Goodwin, Procter and Hoar LLP; Goodwin LLP] in 1996.  Why did you leave and what was the next step for you?
Speaker 2: Okay.  How it happened is sort of funny.  I received a call from the then president of NYNEX [NYNEX Corporation], which is the regional Bell company, later became Bell Atlantic [Bell Atlantic Corporation], and now is Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.].  But at that point in time, 1996, it was NYNEX.  And the president called and left a really cryptic message through his secretary on my voicemail.  "I'm Don Reed [Donald B. Reed]," the fellow's name, "I'd like to meet with you for fifteen minutes."  So I immediately assumed it had to do with joining a dinner committee, or a task force of some kind or another.  And in point of fact, he came over and as soon as he got off the elevator, this guy I knew.  As soon as he got off the elevator, he says, "Hey, I asked for fifteen minutes, this may take fifteen seconds because you may throw me out of here."  "What's that?"  He said, "We want you to come work for us."  And, you know, he said, "Do you want to talk?"  And I said, "Of course."  You know, we talked, and we talked about it.
Speaker 1: Did you have any inkling this was going to happen?
Speaker 2: Absolutely not (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It just came out of the blue.
Speaker 2: Totally over the transit.  And, you know, I was thinking, "Here I am, a tenured, senior partner in a major law firm.  Been there three years and building a practice, getting it going, and it took a while to get it started.  And it's going well, like the place, why would I want to go work for a phone company?"  And, you know, talking to friends, and, of course, my wife [Jacqueline Simmons Budd], who always gives the best advice, she mentioned, "You know, you've managed a large number of people in the public sector, but you really never have in the private sector.  That experience might well be worthwhile."  And I thought more about it and decided it would be a good opportunity.  So I joined them in 1996 as a senior vice president, and through some happenstance, subsequently received the title of president for New England for, what was then, the NYNEX, subsequently, Bell Atlantic, now Verizon.
Speaker 1: And your responsibilities then, as you moved into this position, what--
Speaker 2: I had responsibilities for the New England states in terms of policy, in terms of government relations, in terms of community affairs.  I had everything but operations.   That was run out of New York.  So everything else in the business that was conducted in this region, was my responsibility.
Story_ID: 380325
Speaker 1: You, I know, were involved in community activities--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --serving on various boards during the time you were with Goodwin Procter [Goodwin Procter LLP; Goodwin LLP], and I suspect when you went to what became Verizon [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], what were some of the community involvements that you had beyond your full-time legal?
Speaker 2: Well, I was on the board of Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], a trustee there for sixteen years, preceding and during this period.  I served on the board and served as chair of a group called The Partnership [The Partnership, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts], which Bennie Wiley [HistoryMaker Benaree P. Wiley] was the executive director and president of, or CEO and president of.  Which had as its goal to build a critical mass of people of color for leadership positions in Greater Boston [Massachusetts], as among other programs it runs.  I was very proud of that affiliation.  I did a number of community activities and that kind of thing.  Got active with the Kennedy School [John F. Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in terms of the Institute of Politics serving on the advisory board there.  Now, out at the Kennedy Library [John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Boston, Massachusetts], I became a real Kennedy person, I suppose, but served on that board for a while.  Did a number of things along those lines.
Story_ID: 380326
Speaker 1: What were you doing for personal recreation?  'Cause you were very busy--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --as a lawyer and with Verizon [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], what were you doing for yourself at that time?
Speaker 2: I always enjoyed reading, always enjoyed physical activity, fitness, squash, or racquetball, or basketball, that kind of stuff.  I've given up on the basketball now, for very good reasons, and obvious ones.  But still play squash, and I still believe in--then and now--in, in physical fitness.  I believe that's very important for the body and mind.  And I loved reading historical novels, that's my thing.  Going to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  I loved going over there.
Speaker 1: Do you have a home on Martha's Vineyard?
Speaker 2: I do.  We have two homes, actually, my wife [Jacqueline Simmons Budd] and I, over there.
Story_ID: 380327
Speaker 1: Your daughter, Kim [Kimberly Budd], she was a lawyer, I guess, at this time.  Was her decision to go into law was influenced by you in any way, or did you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  You know, that's interesting because when we had our own small law firm, all of the partners had their kids work in the firm doing things like filing and miscellaneous tasks around the office, cleaning up here and there, running errands and all that.  So all three of my daughters spent time in the law firm.  And the two younger daughters [Kristi Budd and Kerri Budd Evans] had absolutely no interest in the law, and when my oldest daughter, it was just something she wanted to do.  And I think having her dad a lawyer may have had something to do with it, knowing a lot of lawyers, being around.  Something about it influenced her, and excited her, and so when she finished her undergraduate at Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], she went off to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and has had quite an interesting career.  Very, very proud of her as I am my other girls.
Speaker 1: What type of law is she practicing now, or is she practicing now?
Speaker 2: Well, she's been in the large firm, she spent some time as an assistant United States attorney, she was at the general counsel's office at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and is now functioning as the ethics officer at the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 380328
Speaker 1: You were at, what is now Verizon [NYNEX Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], for approximately four years--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you moved to another giant corporation--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the next big move for you?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's interesting, I joined John Hancock [John Hancock Financial Services Inc.], and I was on the board of directors of John Hancock.  And I knew that there was going to be an opening in the general counsel's job, but had no interest in it personally, and Hancock had traditionally grew their general counsel from within their law department.  However, one day, I got a call from David D'Alessandro, who was about to receive the role as CEO and chairman of John Hancock.
Speaker 1: Could you spell his last name for the record?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's D-'-L-E-S-S-A-N-D-R-O [sic.].  D'Alessandro.
Speaker 1: Thank you, thank you.
Speaker 2: And he called me up and said, "You know, we've decided to part from our usual way of selecting general counsel.  We're not going to go with somebody inside, we're going to go outside."  So my first thought, as this conversation's going on is, you've been around for a long time, you know lawyers--
Speaker 1: Who do you recommend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, who do you know?  He said, "This isn't going to be a world wide search.  We want you."  And I said, "Geez." You know, I started thinking to myself.  He said, "Can we talk?"  And I said, "Of course, we can talk."  But I started thinking, why would I give up being president of something to be a general counsel at a company?  And when we sat down to talk, he said, "You'd retain your board position, so you and I would be the only two inside board members.  You'll have, in addition to being general counsel and overseeing the law department, you'll oversee all of our compliance work, all of our government relations, our community relations, human resources, corporate secretary, you'll have all of that.  You'll be on the top management team in the company."  And, you know, I was thinking about it and my wife [Jacqueline Simmons Budd], again, being my advisor said, "What's to think about here?  That's a terrific opportunity."  And frankly, it turned out to be just that.  It was a wonderful job, I enjoyed it very much and next to being U.S. attorney, it's my favorite job.
Speaker 1: What did you like about it?
Speaker 2: I liked the wide-ranging activities.  I liked the kinds of things the company was involved with.  It went from being a mutual insurance company, to demutualizing, and being publicly owned as opposed to being mutual and owned by it's policy holders.  I liked the fact that--going public, all that that entails.  The company did a lot of purchasing of other activities, or entities while I was general counsel, and ultimately in 19- in 2004, it was acquired.  So going through that process was a tremendous learning experience.  But, as important as anything, the most challenging thing was serving as a, not just a legal counselor, but a consigliore, if you will, to the CEO.  In all matters; legal, business, political, community.  And David D'Alessandro is a very, very smart guy, and to serve as his counselor was a very, very--an honor, but was also very challenging.  Very challenging.  So it was good times.
Speaker 1: Now, you say John Hancock was acquired, what was that about?
Speaker 2: Manulife [Manulife Financial Corporation], a company based in Toronto [Canada]--
Speaker 1: What's that name again?
Speaker 2: Manulife.  M-A-N-U-L-I-F-E, based in Toronto, but had a significant presence here, made an offer to buy John Hancock, and they did just that.  And the sale was completed in April of 2004.  And like all of the executives at John Hancock, the senior executives, you're afforded an opportunity to, with a change of control, to depart the company.  And that's what I did, along with my peers and my boss, David D'Alessandro.  We all left in the fall of 2004.
Speaker 1: Were you, quote, sad about that?  Or did you, were you upset about it in any way (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I'm not laughing--not at all.  It worked out quite well.  Yeah, quite well.
Story_ID: 380329
Speaker 1: What were your major accomplishments with John Hancock [John Hancock Financial Services Inc.] as you look back?  Any initiatives that you started?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, there was one thing--we did a couple of things that I'm very proud of--but one thing that stands out in my mind.  We started a pro bono program in our law department.  They had never had one there before.  Wherein our lawyers volunteered to give legal services, free of charge, in various areas.  One of which would be serving as arbitrators and mediators for the courts.  Another, in doing simple estate instruments, such as wills for people, for elderly people.  A third was doing lectures in some schools in the inner city community, talking about various aspects of the law with younger kids.  Culminating a mock trial with these kids.  Very, very impressed with the response of the lawyers who were wanting to engage in these kinds of activities and very proud that we were able to do that during the course of my administration.  We were able to build up the diversity in the law department.  And what I mean by that is, not just with people of color in the department, and we did do some significant hiring and promoting in that regard; but beyond that, in doing business with outside law firms of color and making sure that we gave people opportunities that they don't always get.  And we were recognized by the Minority Corporate Law Association [sic. Minority Corporate Counsel Association] for that particular activity.  We were awarded a--we weren't awarded, honored, I should say, for that involvement.
Story_ID: 380330
Speaker 1: And so you returned to Procter--
Speaker 2: Goodwin Procter [Goodwin Procter LLP; Goodwin LLP] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Good- Goodwin Procter.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: In 2004?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, what's life been like for you since then here?
Speaker 2: Not bad. (Laughter) Not bad.  I came back in October of 2004, this time not as a partner.  I was offered a partnership, but I decided I wanted to be part time here, and so--because there were other things I wanted to do in addition to being involved in a law firm.  So I come back part time, I'm senior counsel, get involved in various special projects around the firm, all of which are interesting.  Do mentoring here, help with recruiting.  I do help them with marketing, opening doors for potential new clients or strengthening relationships with existing clients.  I and one other partner involved in something called the incubator project.  Where he and I listen to partners within the firm who have different ideas, as new areas of practice.  And we make a determination as to how they can develop these things, whether or not the firm will supply the resources behind them.  I do a lot of work with that.  I do a lot of work with the diversity efforts here in the firm.  I work with a number of other lawyers in that regard.  And it also affords me, I took up a new hobby recently, and a part time basis affords me the opportunity to pursue that hobby.
Story_ID: 380331
Speaker 1: You said that you wanted to be--have time so that you could pursue some other things--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you hadn't been able to do up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --until this point.  Could you share some of those with us?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing is I'm learning to fly.  I'm a student pilot.  My wife [Jacqueline Simmons Budd], kind of, laughs at that, but it's something I've always had in the back of my mind to want to do, and give it a shot and that's what I'm doing.  And I do some board work.  I serve on some--
Speaker 1: So, you're taking flight lessons now?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Are you up in the air?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Absolutely.  The key is not just to get up, but to get down in one piece.
Speaker 1: Where do you have this training?
Speaker 2: Out of Hanscom [Laurence G. Hanscom Field, Bedford Massachusetts].  I'm involved with a school called Executive Flyers Aviation [Bedford, Massachusetts].  And I'm in the early stages.  At this point, I haven't soloed.  I'm looking forward to doing that as soon as they decide I've learned enough to be able to do that, and we'll see where it goes from there.  But it's very, very challenging.  To people who fly, and this is something I didn't know, but a good friend of mine told me, who is a pilot, told me that the first couple of times that you go up, you know, in this role, in this capacity as a student, it's a lot of fun.  Then it becomes a lot of work and a big challenge, and that's exactly what it is.  Some simple planes, single engine, Cessna, overhead wings.  But it's--because it's counterintuitive to other things that you do in life, like driving a car, counterintuitive.  It's fun and challenging.  Keeps you on your toes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any other ventures besides, this is full time, any other ventures of this nature that you are now able to involve yourself with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm doing a little more mentoring than I've been able to do in the past.  My best friend is a candidate for governor of the state.  I co-chair his campaign.  I'm very much involved in--
Speaker 1: And that is your--
Speaker 2: Tom Reilly [Thomas Reilly].  The fellow I grew up with in Springfield [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: In Springfield?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We've been friends over fifty years.  So, I'm deeply involved in that.  And I'm sure if I'd been full time engaged in work, I wouldn't have quite the same amount of freedom.
Story_ID: 380332
Speaker 1: And as I said, do some board work.  We have a new African American president down at Wheaton College [Norton, Massachusetts], a fellow by the name of Ron Crutcher [HistoryMaker Ronald A. Crutcher].  He invited me to serve on his board and the board of trustees.  I decided if I could be helpful, he's new in town--
Speaker 2: You know, I met his wife last summer on the Vineyard [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Betty Neal Crutcher.  Yeah, and they live down in Norton [Massachusetts], and they're just--they came here from Miami of Ohio [Miami University, Oxford, Ohio], and he asked if I would try to be helpful to him on the board, which I am serving on that board now.
Speaker 2: I receive, fairly regularly, a publication from the American Auto Association [American Automobile Association]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And I opened it up some months back, and there's [HistoryMaker] Wayne Budd.  (Laughter) You are on the national board of AAA [American Automobile Association].
Speaker 1: Yes, I am.
Speaker 2: What does that involve?
Speaker 1: Well, I serve on the regional board.  The AAA, or the American Auto Association of Southern New England.  And was recently elected to be on the national board.  Oversees the policies of the AAA organization throughout the country, throughout the world actually.  And it's a very interesting board.  Again, an opportunity that I might not have undertaken, were I engaged full time in work.  I also serve on the board of a company called McKesson Corporation based in San Francisco [California].  A public company, I serve on the board.
Speaker 2: Any of the local boards that are, kind of, highlights for you right now, besides the two you've mentioned.  In terms of local boards in the Boston [Massachusetts] area?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still serve on the Institute of Politics [Kennedy School of Government, Cambridge, Massachusetts] advisory board of directors.  Actually, until Thursday, I wont be--I've been a trustee in the condo where I live, where we live.  I've been on that board for the last year-and-a-half.
Speaker 2: Looking at your resume this morning, I see that in 2005, you became on the executive committee of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases lab [National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: You're very diversified.  Tell me about that appointment, that work.
Speaker 1: I think it's a level four lab that's being brought to Boston, been approved to be built in Boston.  And what it does, is study some of the more esoteric diseases that are developing.
Speaker 2: This is the biolab over at DeBusk University and Medical School [ph.]?
Speaker 1: That's exactly right.  That's exactly what that is.  It should be an interesting experience, it's a very controversial project, and my thinking was this:  I think it's good for the city, good for the economics across the board for people, on the one hand.  On the other hand, I know it's brimming with controversy.  So if it's going to be, we ought to make sure it's done right, and the executive committee will oversee to make sure that the security systems are in place and are operating.  And it's a very, very, very complex, but thoughtful security system.  Make sure that the economic impact is fairly shared, as among the various communities in the Greater Boston area.  That the jobs that are being promised, are in fact made available.  That kind of thing.  So it doesn't make you the most popular person in the world because a lot of people don't like the concept of this lab.  But in as much as I think it's a fait accompli, that if I could lend a hand in making s- helping to make sure that it's done the right way, then I think it's time well spent.
Story_ID: 380333
Speaker 1: We're coming down to some final wrap-up questions--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --that we ask all of The HistoryMakers.  Is there anything else that you would like to add to your interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: One thing that strikes me as being very important as I've gone through life, and that is trying to make sure that I do everything possible to, kind of, pass the torch on.  I think that coming along here in this community, coming from the family that I did where people made sacrifices, so that I could move on.  The people in this community who reached out to me, the [HistoryMaker] Harry Elam, the David Nelsons, the Barry Martins [ph.], many, many people who helped me.  I need to now, kind of, reach and help others.  I think it's very important that folks are able to come to, come to where I am and well beyond it.  I think that's extremely important.  So I can't think of the things that I do and have been able to do, none of them are more important to me than making sure that there is a continuing trend.  A continuing movement that people continue to get opportunities.  I sometimes worry that we don't have enough people in the pipeline, so we've got to make sure they're there.  We got to make sure that people succeed in law, and medicine, and the other professions.  Frankly, I'm very much interested in the community where I was, the state where I was born, raised, and lived virtually all my life, Massachusetts.  I want to make sure that folks here have chances to be successful.  That's important to me, very important to me.  So those are kinds of things that I like to focus on and try to make time to, to do.
Story_ID: 380334
Speaker 1: Attorney Budd [HistoryMaker Wayne Budd], how do you feel about the way you have lived your life so far?
Speaker 2: To be honest with you--that's the only way to be--I feel pretty good, and I'll tell you why.  You know, people talk about success, you know, what does success mean?  And, oftentimes, they point to me and say, "Geez, you're a successful guy."  And I've always been a little hesitant to accept that title of success until I started thinking about it a little bit.  And, I've determined that a person is successful if they have a good family life, if they've got their health, and they do everything possible to keep their health in good shape, mental, physical.  They have good friends, they have a job that they like, they have respect in their community, that they, in the job that they're doing, that they're making a contribution with it.  And last, and least, that they've done well financially.  That's last.  And to some fair degree, I have good relations with family, very good; I have some good friends; I have good health; I've had good jobs; I think I've made a contribution; I think I have respect, generally.  And I'm not necessarily living hand to mouth.  And so on that basis, I suppose I have been successful, using that as a criteria.  So I feel pretty good about it.
Speaker 1: Good.  Is there anything you've done that you look back and think that you might have done it differently?  Any regrets?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have one.  The only regret that I can tell you that I really have, is that when my kids were younger, I wish I'd figured out a way to spend more time with them.  I was engaged in developing a career, I was engaged in doing all of these networking things and giving time in the community, and I enjoy, I'm very happy to say, great relationships with all three of my daughters.  But if I had it to do over, I would have come up with some way, I would have figured out how to strike a better balance in that regard.  So I notice that my sons-in-law seem to be more actively engaged with their kids, than people, frankly, in my generation.  The taking care of the kids, that was for the mother to do.  My involvement wasn't minimal, but it could have been much more.  And I think from a personal level, I would have enjoyed it more. So yeah that's--but that's the only regret I can think of, Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden] off-hand.
Story_ID: 380335
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American communities today across the country?
Speaker 2: Start with concerns.  I, I think it's very unfortunate, that particularly with black men, that so many are being diverted and distracted to areas that really aren't positive areas.  That we're not--we're not taking--we have at risk, a fair percentage of that population.  To not being able to leverage upon things that the prior generation had been able to accomplish.  I see a swing back in the other direction in terms of opportunities.  I think that things are going to get tougher again for people of color.  I don't think the opportunities are going to be, and I hope I'm wrong on this, but as widespread or as enthusiastically made available.  So things are going to get harder and not easier, and we have to be ready for that.  I really am truly concerned about the quality of education in many of our urban areas.  Not all, but many.  And wonder if that puts our folks that mostly populate these educational institutions, I wonder if they're going to be put at such a disadvantage, that it only compounds the environment and their opportunities for success.  That troubles me, it troubles me, and to the extent we can, we have to continue to push to keep these opportunities open.  To push and make sure these kids are, kind of, lined up to be successful.  But those are some of my concerns, and those are some of my hopes that we can accomplish this successfully.
Speaker 1: The Springfield [Massachusetts] public schools, particularly elementary, through the junior high and high school, and you went through part of that system, has been facing very critical times.  And you have a sister [Celeste Budd Jackson] who is an assistant superintendant and--
Speaker 2: She is.  She had been a principal for a number of years, and very effective at Central High School [Springfield Central High School, Springfield, Massachusetts], and she just went over to this new position recently.  You know, I think back on going to school in Springfield.  The schools were very, very adequate.  We had four major high schools, each focusing on a specialty; commercial, technical, engineering, classical, college prep and then vocational.  And then the Catholic high school [Cathedral High School, Springfield, Massachusetts].  They were all, could hold their own with anybody in Massachusetts.  The public schools were fine, I got a good education there.  The junior highs, and Springfield is afflicted with the same things we find in our major urban areas, urban centers.  It's too bad, because, we, as African Americans, and people of color are the ones who are losing out at the end of the day.
Story_ID: 380336
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: I--I guess I go back to that old adage, those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it.  And we can learn an awful lot by seeing how things were done in the past, and either adopting or disavowing methods, procedures, approaches in the past.  And I'm truly one who believes that there's nothing new under the sun.  And some of the very same problems, basic problems, concerns, fears, that have taken place over the course of time as we know it to now, exist today.  So problems with power, lust, money, greed.   So it's important from my perspective, that people learn from others and how they've done things and decide, "Gee, that's a good approach."  Or, "No, I'll reject that and try something else, because I can see it didn't work there."  That kind of thing.  I think history's very, very important, plus, it's fascinating.  It's always interesting to me to read about historical figures, and we don't have to go way back, to see how they overcame challenges.  Particularly people of color, because I'm of the mind that if you're African American, for example, you've got a much tougher road to haul.  So I'm always interested in seeing how people were able to overcome the obstacles, and to achieve objectives or goals.  And to salute them for that.  Because just having lived for the sixty-four-and-a-half years that I've lived, I know that it's not easy.  I know that it's very, very hard.
Story_ID: 380337
Speaker 1: In that vein, what advice do you have for young men and women, especially, African American men and women who are now in high school and college and are thinking about going to law school and having a legal career?  What advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: You know, when I talk to young people, particularly in groups, I talk about what I call the four Rs.  The four Rs, and they are respect, respecting yourself and other people, respecting other people and demanding that respect in return.  I talk about, and think about, risk, you have to be willing to reach out, to go beyond yourself, or go beyond what you think your capabilities are.  I think of resiliency.  If you fall, you gotta get up again.  You've got to be willing to take responsibility for your actions.  If something doesn't go your way, instead of saying first thing out of the box, "Well, I was black.  What do you expect?"  Kind of, look at yourself to see if there was someway you could have done it better to achieve the objective.  And last thing I think of in the Rs would be return.  So I guess you would call them the five Rs.  Respect, risk, resiliency, responsibility, and return.  Give back.  You've got to give back to the community.  You can't pull up the ladder behind you if you've reached some plateau and say, let the other guy figure out how to get up here.  Throw the ladder down, help him up.
Story_ID: 380338
Speaker 1: Last question.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: That [HistoryMaker] Wayne Budd was a person of integrity, maybe not the smartest guy, certainly not the best looking or the most charming guy, but his word was good.  If he said he was going to do something, you could rely on him.  You could depend on him.  That he was going to treat you fairly, and that if he could help you, he would.

Speaker 1: Here's a picture of my old law firm [Hamilton and Lampson (ph.)] that was taken probably ten or twelve years ago at the bar mitzvah of one of one of the old partners.  The people in the picture from the left is Tom Reilly [Thomas Reilly], our current state attorney general and leading candidate for the governor's job here in Massachusetts.  And I'm on to the other side of him.  In the middle there is Dean Richlin, one of the members in the old firm.  Currently, a partner at Foley Hoag [Foley Hoag LLP] in Boston [Massachusetts], and former first assistant to Tom Reilly at the attorney general's office.  Next to Dean is Ralph Martin [Ralph C. Martin, Jr.].  Ralph was an associate in the firm and at one time, was the district attorney for Suffolk County [Massachusetts], elected district attorney.  What's unique about that, is he was an African American Republican from Brooklyn, New York, who got himself elected in Boston.  Which is quite something unto itself, but then, quite a guy.  Last, but not least, pictured there on the far right is Flash Wiley [HistoryMaker Fletcher "Flash" Wiley].  Flash was our named partner in the firm and former chairman of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce as among his other accomplishments.  And just a leading light here in the city of Boston.
Speaker 2: This is my office, when I served as the United States attorney, the District of Massachusetts back in 1989 to 1992, and this is the assembled team made up of all of the lawyers on the team.  And I'm very proud of a lot of the folks who are pictured here, because many of them, black as well as white, have gone on to hold judicial offices in various courts throughout the commonwealth of Massachusetts.  We had quite an office, and I'm very proud of it.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is a picture of some of the African Americans who had leadership positions at the then Bell Atlantic [Bell Atlantic Corporation], subsequently, the Verizon company [Verizon Communications, Inc.].  I'm pictured there as the New England group president for the company as I was at that time.  I'd call attention to the person in the first row right, far right.  His name is [HistoryMaker] Bruce Gordon, and Bruce was a senior executive at Bell Atlantic and Verizon, and now holds the position of head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  This is a cover from the magazine of the minority corporate lawyers, and pictured on the front page of their publication in addition to myself are two others who were likewise honored for the work that they've done in not only diversifying the law department, their respective law departments.  At the time, I was the general counsel for John Hancock [John Hancock Financial Services, Inc.] here in Boston, but we were all honored for the work that we've done in diversifying our departments, as well as, for making sure that minority law firms had the opportunity to do business with our respective companies.
