Speaker 1: I want to start out by asking you about your mother.  And if you could give her name and what you know about her growing up.
Speaker 2: Sure, her name is Emily [Wintersmith] Patrick.  She is in her early seventies.  She's living.  She grew up--she was born in Chicago [Illinois], where I was born, grew up there, went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois], where she met my father [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick].  She is--she didn't finish high school.  She left high school to marry my father, in fact, and start her family.  She was and is a hard worker, good person.  She was, she spent some time after my parents split at about the time I was four years old, she spent some time on welfare, we did as a family.  She then got a job in a cleaners, I think, a dry cleaners in the neighborhood and eventually at the post office in Chicago.  And then not long after my wife [Diane Bemus Patrick] and I were married in New York [New York], she got sick.  And she had had lupus, the discoid kind, not the systemic kind, for many, many years, but eventually she developed something which was never really adequately diagnosed, but she was completely incapacitated for a time.  She couldn't walk or feed herself, and she was losing a lot of weight and having these sort of muscle spasms.  So my wife and I moved her to New York, where we were living at the time, and had her see another neurosurgeon who, again, couldn't quite diagnose it but gave some medication to control the muscle spasms.  She began to get stronger.  And she's lived with us or near us for the twenty years we've been married.  She now is in her own apartment near us in Boston [Massachusetts].  Is that what you were--
Speaker 1: Yes, and there are no right answers with this, so.  I want to ask you, did you mother ever talk about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not much, not much.  You know, we, we grew up with my grandparents, her parents.  And my grandmother [Sally Wintersmith] was a little bit more forthcoming about, about the family history and so on.  But we were generally in a generation and in a culture where detailed questions about, and certainly detailed answers, about the family history were considered inappropriate.  So people would pass away and you'd ask why, and that was considered rude.  She didn't talk a lot about growing up.  She and her brother [Sonny Wintersmith], my mother has one brother who's older.  He's now passed away.  They had a very tumultuous relationship.  And my uncle was, had a serious drug problem for most of his life and was very close to my grandmother.  And my mother was sort of the good kid, if you will, but never felt I think as close to my grandmother as she wanted to.  And I think there were--but I see that, saw that more than I heard about it; you know, I observed that in that relationship more than my mother ever really talked about it.
Story_ID: 226983
Speaker 1: Now, was it your mother's [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] side of the family that was from East Moline [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: My father's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Father's, your father's.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, tell, give me your father's name--
Speaker 2: Full name?  My father's name was Laurdine Kenneth Patrick.
Speaker 1: So the story about Laurdine, but is that your, the middle--
Speaker 2: That's my middle name.
Speaker 1: --middle name.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So can you tell the--
Speaker 2: It's my father's first name and my grandfather's first name.  Now my father was a jazz musician.  My grandfather was a jazz musician.  And neither of them used that name professionally.  They used the name Pat Patrick.  But the name (laughter) apparently, according to my father's father, my grandfather on my father's side, apparently came about from a long time ago in Colorado Springs [Colorado] when my great-grandparents had a, apparently a farm.  And their closest neighbors and very best friends were a couple named Laurence and Nadine.  And they had promised this couple that if the, the first child, if a boy, would be named Laurence, if a girl, would be named Nadine to honor this friendship.  And then my, my great-grandparents lost pregnancy after pregnancy for a time.  They finally had a boy, and they thought, let's not take a chance.  Let's, let's create this name that conflates the two, so they created this name Laurdine.  They gave it to my grandfather.  My grandfather gave it to my father, and my father gave it to me.  It stops here, I'll tell you that (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know what's amazing is that they didn't use it.
Speaker 2: No, yeah, after all that, right.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know, did your father--I know you said your parents split at four, but do you know much about his growing up and--
Speaker 2: I know a little bit about his growing.  I knew my grandmother [LaVerne Williams] and great-grandmother on my father's side.  I knew the family in East Moline, Illinois, that we visited very periodically.  My grandmother, my father's mother, was living in Chicago [Illinois] when I was a child.  But occasionally she would take us out to East Moline to visit my father's family.  My grandparents on my father's side had also split up when their children, my father and his sister, were young.  And my grandfather, as I said, was a jazz musician, and his father worked on the railroad.  And the railroad came through the Quad Cities area [Illinois and Iowa], and that's apparently how my grandfather in some way was introduced to the family in East Moline, which is where my father's mother's family lived.  But there are lots of cousins and aunts and uncles and so forth there.  I think they were, my grandmother had six or seven brothers and sisters.  And I, we don't really have a relationship today.  We did tenuously when we were little.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name Patrick, where it came from, or--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: You don't, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Story_ID: 226984
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick and Emily Wintersmith Patrick] met?
Speaker 2: They met in high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], I think.  My father was a year or two ahead of my mother.  I don't know exactly the story, because there's not a lot (laughter) of romance there, probably more, more bitterness and frustration than not.  My parents married soon after my sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh], my oldest sister was coming.  And then I was born eleven months after she was born.  And then my mother lost a number of pregnancies after that.  And then my, as I say, my parents split up.  My father was traveling a lot with his music and his principal band moved to New York [New York], and he wanted to move to New York.  And they had a fairly--I'd say not a fairly--they had a very bitter breakup, which I can still remember, and then my father left.  And I didn't really hear from or see him for years after that, for a number of years.  And then eventually he started to look us up and get in touch when he would come through on concert tours and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Now, what did he, what did he play?
Speaker 2: He played primarily baritone saxophone.  But he was skilled at all of the--I mean he could handle all of the reeds, most of the winds, and some of the keyboards as well; he played just about everything.  And he really, he really loved music.  He loved--and he had a way of listening, which, you know, in an otherwise tumultuous relationship with my father, I think of as a real gift from him, a way of thinking about not just how to listen to music but how to listen to people, how to listen to the world and so on with a sensitivity, which I think was really special about him.
Story_ID: 226985
Speaker 1: How did you know that gift about him [Patrick's father, Laurdine "Pat" Patrick] though?
Speaker 2: You know, as I got older, and particularly when I was in school in the East, and he was living in New York [New York] at that time, we began to develop a relationship, as I said, a tumultuous relationship, but it was a relationship.  I think you always save space for your parents, even if they are, even if they frustrate you and make you, you know, nuts.  And in that time, as we were getting to know each other, I began to appreciate him differently.  I don't think we ever really appreciated each other in a kind of a classic son and--father and son relationship.  But as two individuals I think we really came to understand each other and respect each other.  We got particularly close after I got married 'cause he was mad about my wife [Diane Bemus Patrick], really, and I, understandably, so am I.  But I think, you know, going with him to his gigs when I was a teenager and an early, and a young adult was a different experience than going with him to his gigs when I was eight and nine years old, and it just seemed loud and like he was paying attention to something else other than me; and watching how he interacted with the band and with music and then listening to him talk about listening, I think were all ways in which I began to appreciate and really respect that particular dimension of him.
Speaker 1: What would he talk about in terms of listening?  How would he talk about listening?
Speaker 2: You know, there's a--I hate to refer to pop culture, but there's a commercial, a television commercial that used to be on that Volkswagen would do and--I think it was Volkswagen--and you'd see the couple in a car driving down the street.  And they were wat- all the windows were up, but they were watching the people on the sidewalk walk, and the other sort of movements on the street.  And they were seeing a harmony or a syncopation, in particular, about those movements and how they all kind of connected for just a moment.  And then they come to the end of the block, and they turn.  And one, they turn the car, and one passenger turns to the other and says that was weird and drives off.  My father often was like the drivers in that Volkswagen.  You know, he would--you'd be on the bus with him, and he'd say, listen to the sound of the engine and listen to the rhythms of the, of the other passengers on the bus and how they connect.  I'll never forget once he was playing in this little club on the Upper West Side [New York, New York].  And he brought in one of these toy monkeys, you know, the monkeys that do like that with the cymbals and so on.  And he brought that in and turned it on, and they played a gig to the rhythm of this, of--I mean it was a gimmick, but it also was about how that all these things connect if you're willing to be open to the connections.  And that's how he talked about it.  And it's a very sort of a metaphysical idea.  But there's a--there are some lessons in there I think.  It's a lot of food for thought.

Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory.  Well, I have some--you know, my--I remember growing up with my grandparents [Reynolds Wintersmith and Sally Wintersmith].  I was born in my grandmother's bed on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And then after my parents [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick and Emily Wintersmith Patrick] split up we moved in with them at 54th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].  And I remember my grandparents' routine.  In particular, my grandfather worked for a bank on the South Side of Chicago.  He was a custodian and worked long hours.  He was probably the kindest man I've ever met and also one of the most humble.  And I remember that he would go off very early in the morning, come back around five o'clock.  And my grandmother would, who would, stayed at home, would turned everything upside down to make sure it was right for him when he came home.  He, he was--there wasn't a lot of food.  He always got the biggest portion.  My grandmother would talk about a man's portion of dessert and so on.  I've never seen so much dessert in my life, these pies, heaped with ice cream.  And he'd have his chair, his particular chair and a little black and white TV that he would eat in front of.  And I remember that whole ritual of making him the center of her attention.  And it was--so I remember that.  I remember also, frankly, the day that my parents split up.  And they had a huge fight after my mother got a call at home from a woman saying, asking after my father.  And when she said he wasn't there, the woman said well, tell him that our baby needs shoes.  And my mother confronted my father with that when he came home.  And that was, they had a huge blowup, and he left.  And I remember chasing him down the street to find out where he was going.  And in his rage, he turned around and hit me.  And I fell, and I, and he walked off.  And that was the last time I saw him for many, many years.  And it was a very vivid memory and probably had a lot to do with how much effort it took for us to bridge the gap we bridged as we both got older.
Speaker 1: That was pretty traumatic.  That was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're four at that point?
Speaker 2: I was about four at that point.
Speaker 1: And you have that vivid memory.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you even knew what was going, you remembered?  You knew what was going on--
Speaker 2: Well, what I remember--you know, it's interesting when you say what I remember.  I filled in details with facts.  I knew they had a fight.  I didn't know what it was about.  I didn't know that I had a half-sister [LaShon Roberts] for years, and that that's who the woman who called was referring to.  I didn't know that they were splitting up at that point, and my mother didn't really talk about it then.  I'm not sure she believed that that was the final split at that point, but I know that now, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think that-- do you remember life afterwards and it being different, you know, because your father wasn't, you know, they had split up?  Do you remember any of that or--
Speaker 2: I do.  I remember that, I remember my mother's loneliness, and I remember how bitter she was for a long time.  I think that, I think it really marked her.  I remember moving in with my grandparents and what a blessing that was for us, but what an injury to my mother's pride that was.  And so my mother, and sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh], and I shared a room in this two-bedroom apartment.  And we had a set of bunk beds, and we would rotate, top, bottom, floor, top, bottom, floor, so every third night you'd have the floor.  And I think that those circumstances for that period of time really had an impact on my mother's sense of self-reliance and pride.  And I think my grandmother didn't always make that easy because they had their own thing, so.
Story_ID: 226987
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember the street that you were living on where your grandparents [Reynolds Wintersmith and Sally Wintersmith] lived?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what was the address?
Speaker 2: Wabash, it was 5346 Wabash Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], yeah, right--
Speaker 1: And South Wabash--
Speaker 2: --across the street from--South Wabash Avenue, right across the street from the fire station.
Speaker 1: And where--do you remember the bank that your grandfather worked at?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  It was called South Shore Bank [ShoreBank, Chicago, Illinois], and it's on 79th [Street], well, then it was on 79th and Jeffery [Avenue], I think.  And you know, what's interesting is that bank--you may know something about the history of that bank.  That bank, in those days, in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], the area around the bank was very white.  And sometime around the '60s [1960s], mid-'60s [1960s] I think, it began to integrate, and it began to integrate relatively successfully, relatively successfully, meaning, there wasn't total white flight at that time.  And then the bank was taken over by some black investors, which in my, you know, my grandfather--I--you know, notwithstanding my grandfather's incredible understatement, was a huge source of pride for him.  He worked there for forty-five years.  They tried to retire him, and he kept--any number of times.  He just would keep coming back to work well into his seventies.  And when my grandfather died, the chairman of the bank came to his memorial service.  And I remember him saying that at a different time in a different set of circumstances my grandfather would have been chairman of that bank.  He was that beloved and that respected.  And you can imagine how I felt about four years ago when I was asked to join the board of that very bank by the same investors who had known my grandfather.  I wasn't able to do it, but it was a, it's a wonderful way of the circle being completed.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the chairman's name?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Oh, I think I know.
Speaker 2: --I, I wanna say Bill Davis [sic.], but I'm not--
Speaker 1: Okay, I think Bill Davis was one of the people there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --too, I think.  And then there--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --was, and I'm forgetting his name.
Speaker 2: There's a name, there's a fellow named Ron, I think his name is Grzywinski [Ronald Grzywinski].
Speaker 1: Right, right, that's one--
Speaker 2: --who is--
Speaker 1: And then there's another one--
Speaker 2: And there's another--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There's another investor as well.
Speaker 1: Right, right, who--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Ron I have met--[HistoryMaker] Milton Davis, that's--
Speaker 1: Milton Davis.
Speaker 2: Milton Davis.  I think Milton has passed away now, just recently.  He was very sick, and I think he has since passed away.  I think that's right.
Story_ID: 226988
Speaker 1: Your grandfather [Reynolds Wintersmith]--were you still living at home when the bank [South Shore Bank; ShoreBank, Chicago, Illinois], do you remember the bank changing hands?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  And I, that would have been sometime in the mid-'60s [1960s] I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you may have been in junior high?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I was in--
Speaker 1: No.  Elementary?
Speaker 2: --elementary school.
Speaker 1: Elementary school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause if--okay, '52 [1952], '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Right.  We lived--so I said I was born in '56 [1956] in my grandmother's [Sally Wintersmith] bed at the apartment at 54th [Street], South Wabash [Avenue].  But my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] and father [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick] were living in a basement apartment at that time on, at seventy--I think it was 71st [Street] and Calumet [Avenue].  Then after my parents split, we moved in with my grandparents, my mother, and sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh], and I, at 54th and Wabash.  So, that would have been 1960 maybe, '61 [1961].  And I lived there until I left home.
Story_ID: 226989
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the community or the block that you lived on [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And I--can you sort of describe it, and then I'm gonna ask another question after that.
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was a neighborhood of two, and in some cases, three-story buildings with small apartments.  It was a working-class neighborhood.  There were some very poor families and some not as poor families.  It was, you know, it was like a lot of effectively segregated neighborhoods of the time.  You had a whole range of people.  There was a doctor down at the end of the block.  Across the street was a fire station, which makes a kind of racket that you just can't believe (laughter) when the trucks head off to an emergency but that you become quite numb to after a while.  Down at the next, in the next block going south was a huge block-sized commercial bakery for, they used to make Wonder bread there and other white breads.  And then a block, at the end of that block was Garfield Boulevard, which ran east and west and over into the Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] area and through Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].  We went to the Cosmopolitan Community Church [Chicago, Illinois], which was at the corner of 53rd [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], just on the other side of the street, and at the time, interestingly, had a woman pastor [Mary Evans].  This is in the '60s [1960s], was a very, you know, sort of quiet and reverent church, not your sort of typical church for a black neighborhood.  My grandmother [Sally Wintersmith] sang at the Baptist church up on 56th [Street], I think it was, and Prairie [Avenue].  And that was more in the tradition of black churches.  But the Cosmopolitan Church was much more, much more quiet, very--it's not now, but it was then--lots of church ladies, as we'd say, who, you know--and it, and in fact, I'd say of the church ladies and of the whole neighborhood, these were the days when you were under the juri- every kid was under the jurisdiction of every adult on the block.  So if you messed up down the block, you could get yourself straightened out by Ms. Jones [ph.] just as if you were in front of your own stoop and your grandmother caught you.  So there was a sort of a, that was a kind of a governing principle of the neighborhood at the time.  And I remember the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] going up just on State Street, the block behind us and really all along State Street.  And there was a small factory that made--right behind us, across the alley--that made metal parts I think for cars.  And so you had this light industrial; you had this residential neighborhood on the Wabash side; and then you had these huge public housing projects going up, and the density of that and the stress on the schools, the stress on the neighborhoods, the, you know, all the issues that come with concentrated poverty and too many people in one place.  And the gang activity began to build up.  So it was rough, it was sometimes mean, but we had good friends.  And we spent most of the time outside and running up and down the block, and you know, running away from the gangs, and playing stickball, and you know, riding bikes when we could.  Sometimes one person would have a bike, and everybody would get a turn, that kind of thing.  There were little backyards in most of these buildings, and they were usually fenced.  And they were little refuges, you know, little green oases amid a lot of concrete and so on.  And I remember in particular my grandmother was a gardener, and she liked to grow roses.  And she would get up early in the morning when the, when the weather permitted, I mean, just at the break of day.  My grandfather [Reynolds Wintersmith] would go out, and she would go off in the backyard and tend these roses.  And I remember that she had one climbing rose that she brought from my grandfather's father's house in Louisville, Kentucky, and she replanted.  And she cultivated this rose, and it grew all the way up the two stories of this tenement.  And I remember thinking, and I thought about this, and I've spoken about it, that it was improbable, you know, in that soil and in that place.  But she really tended her garden, and, and it, I think it was sort of a miracle in some ways and again, a lesson about what can come from tending your garden, from paying attention, from investing in, in something that you want to thrive.

Speaker 1: What sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up [in Chicago, Illinois]?
Smells: pig feet or chitterlings cooking, and how you just wanted to be someplace else (laughter) until they were done.  Whenever I'd get that smell I'd think of growing up.  Sights: children playing with nothing, you know, making their toys out of nothing, out of old bicycle rims or sticks, or you know, a stick became a sword, and an old tire became a fort and so on.  This is--you know, my kids have Nintendo and all kinds of other gadgets, but we had imagination.  And that was--so when I see kids, and I see kids all over the world frankly, you know, playing with some little castoff thing and turning that into a whole world, that makes me think about my own childhood.  Sounds, is mixed.  I mean some of the sounds are the sounds of people arguing.  We had a lot of arguing.  We were very loud in our household.  I remember once going, when I was working for a different company we went on a hunt at this ranch out in Wyoming.  And we were birding and so on, and they were showing us how to use the shotguns and so on.  And I remember saying to the CEO, I said, "I've never heard this much gunfire since the old neighborhood."  So when I hear gunfire, I sometimes think about, about growing up, 'cause there was a lot of it, particularly during the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s].

Speaker 1: You said elementary school, you went where?
Speaker 2: I started at, I went to kindergarten at [Martha M.] Ruggles [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois] out on the, out at, I guess it was 71st [Street] and Calumet [Avenue].  And then--
Speaker 1: Now why did you--
Speaker 2: --at 79th [Street] and Calumet.  I take that back.
Speaker 1: Was that--now why did you go to Ruggles?
Speaker 2: Because we were, we were still living in that basement apartment--I said 71st and Calumet.  I meant 79th and Calumet--then.  And so I started kindergarten there.  I finished--yeah, we had half-day kindergarten in those days.  And then for first grade, by that time we had moved with our grandparents [Reynolds Wintersmith and Sally Wintersmith] at 54th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], so I started over at [Mary C.] Terrell [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois].  And I went there through sixth grade, and then to junior high, what was then called DuSable Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois], which was essentially in the classes at the high school.  And then I went away to high school.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember your elementary school and any particular teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  I remember most of my (laughter) elementary school.  It was--I loved school.  I was--I mean there were big classes and all that.  And a certain amount of it was just maintaining order.  But I was good at school.  I, and as a result, I got attention from the teachers, and I loved the attention 'cause I, you know, didn't always feel like I got it at home.  And some of those teachers have remained important to me and involved in our lives.  My sixth grade teacher, who was just an incredible person, just incredible, she was at my wedding; she was at my graduation from [Harvard] Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]; she was present when I was sworn into the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] post.  She passed away a couple of years ago.  She was very involved in our lives.  And she introduced me to things that, you know, they just--I wonder if she even appreciated what horizons she opened for us.  But I think she was purp- I'm sure she was purposeful in opening those horizons, but I wonder if she appreciated just what an impact it had on us.  For example, she taught us German in sixth grade.  She taught us how to--her son had lived in Germany.  She had visited him in Germany.  She came back and taught us how to count up to twenty and how to say the greetings in German.  She took us to my first opera at the Civic Opera [House, Chicago, Illinois].  I remember it was the year also that the movie, 'The Sound of Music,' came out.  And we went on a field trip to see 'The Sound of Music,' started a whole conversation about the Holocaust, which is a, for a, whatever we were, ten, eleven-year-olds, is not the theme that jumps out at you in 'The Sound of Music,' but it's very much the context of the story, all kinds of things like that, that were so foreign, if you will, from the environment where we grew up.  But she made it seem possible to imagine yourself a citizen of the world.  And as I say, I think that is just a huge gift.  And I have been thanking her over and over and over again through our lives together.  I still very vividly remember her.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Deval [Patrick], what was her name?
Speaker 2: Eddie Quaintance.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, how do you spell the last name?
Speaker 2: Q-U-A-I-N-T-A-N-C-E.
Speaker 1: And were there other people in school that influenced you or that you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember Mrs. [Theresa] Threet, T-H-R-E-E-T, who was our third grade teacher.  I remember there was a Mr. Kilpatrick [ph.].  I think he was my fifth grade teacher, again, people who, who raised, who had high expectations of us and so raised our expectations of ourselves and with whom I developed personal relationships as I got older.  There was a seventh grade teacher, Mrs. [Darla] Weissenberg, who, over at DuSable Upper Grade Center, and she's the person who introduced us when I was in eighth grade to a foundation in Boston [Massachusetts] called A Better Chance [ABC].  And it was through A Better Chance that I ended up at Milton Academy [Milton, Massachusetts] in 1974--1970, excuse me, 1970.  And that was a whole other and very different chapter (laughter).
Speaker 1: Experience.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed--
Story_ID: 226992
Speaker 1: I wanna ask what the young [HistoryMaker] Deval [L. Patrick] was like.  But before I ask that question, can you tell me the origin of your name?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a certain amount of lore in the family about my name.  My parents [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick and Emily Wintersmith Patrick] apparently had a deal that the first child would be named--but they couldn't agree on the name for my sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh], so my father said, "Well, you name the first child, and I will name the second child."  So my mother went to a Rhonda Fleming film while she was pregnant, soon before she gave birth to my sister.  And she liked the film, and she liked the name Rhonda, so she gave the name to my sister.  And then I came along, and my father, who was then working for a very avant-garde jazz band called Sun Ra and worked for them for decades, played with them for decades, he apparently consult--so the story goes, consulted with the band.  And they said "Well, you should name him something really shocking, like devil."  So that's what my father proposed to my mother.  And my mother said it's not gonna happen (laughter); it's just not gonna happen.  So they ultimately compromised by dropping the "i" and adding an "a," so the story goes.  And you know, I've spent a lot of years explaining to people that that is not my last name.  That is my first name, and this is how it sounds, and anyway.
Story_ID: 226993
Speaker 1: But, describe myself as a kid, I was very, very shy, painfully shy, very withdrawn, spent a lot of time alone or in--you know, I had buddies in the neighborhood but not a lot of 'em.  A lot of people we goofed off with and so on, but I was pretty--you know, I had my little cowboys and Indian [Native American] toys and so on.  I would spend hours playing alone with them.  I was--I liked school.  I liked to read.  I was not particularly popular in school.  I was not particularly athletic.  My (laughter), Mrs. [Eddie] Quaintance used to tease me as I got older about showing up in school [Mary C. Terrell Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] with these, you know, too tight brown pants and too tight, too high, and so on, 'cause you know, we didn't go, we didn't shop too often, maybe once a year for school clothes.  I would say I was an absolute menace to my sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh], particularly when she started, when she started dating I would just make a nuisance of myself with the boys who came around.  I had a terrible crush on a girl in the third grade I think.  And her name was Karen [ph.], and she was in my class up to and through the sixth grade.  And she lived on, on Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], and I would follow her home and stand across the street and watch.  And I remember I saw a woman at a nephew's graduation a couple of years ago who I thought must be the grownup version of this woman, and I just stared at her.  And I told my wife [Diane Bemus Patrick] why I was staring her.  I never quite got up the nerve to go say, "Are you the Karen I used to follow around?"  You know, and I--that was it.  I studied--I was, I was fascinated by things that, you know, in some respect I didn't feel were appropriate for a little kid to be fascinated by, you know.  I mean I mentioned that trip to the [Civic] Opera [House, Chicago, Illinois].  I thought, wow, this is--I didn't know what they were singing about.  But the whole pageantry, I mean, the spectacle was so extraordinary, and I remember being really fascinated by that.  I used to love these Bugs Bunny cartoons.  And it was years before I fully appreciated that one of the things I liked about Bugs Bunny was that there was all this incredible classical music used the soundtrack, and so, you know, things like that.  I studied percussion for years.  A friend of my mother's [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] was a timpanist, actually, for--he was a jazz musician, but he was a timpanist in his sort of day job for the Chicago Symphony [Orchestra, Chicago, Illinois].  I think he was the first black timpanist.  And once he had, he got tickets in the balcony for my mother and me to go to a performance at the Chicago Symphony.  It was just wild, you know.  But there were, there are ways in which in that community at that time other kids sometimes made you feel like intellectual interests were being white.  You know, that wasn't for us.  And in some respects, as I look back on it, I think that may have been why I spent so much time with adults, because adults in that black community at that time remembered a tradition where intellectual rigor was very much the expectation of young black people and of young black adults.  And so, I felt like I got some support, if you will, from the adults that I didn't get from the kids, if you know what I mean.  And, and so I'd say I spent probably an inordinate amount of time when I was young with people who were older than me, and I've always felt quite comfortable with people who are older than me.
Story_ID: 226994
Speaker 1: What was going on inside of you?  I mean what were you thinking?  Your, you know, you've described yourself very much as an introvert, so what were you thinking, and what were you imagining, or even, you know, what worlds were outside the world you were living?
Speaker 2: That's a great question and a tough one.  I was missing my father [Laurdine "Pat" Patrick], and I was missing the, the order that I thought characterized an intact family.  I was imagining what it would be like to live in my own house and have my own room.  And I, in fact, the first thing I ever wanted to be was an architect.  And I would spend a tremendous amount of time with the Sunday papers.  You know, they'd have these layouts for new houses that were for sale.  And I would take them and imagine different ways of organizing the rooms and organizing the space.  I'm still very interested in that.  My wife [Diane Bemus Patrick] and I are building a house now in western Massachusetts.  And I made a complete nuisance of myself with the architect, 'cause I keep trying to help him do his job.  I was imaging what it would be like to have the chance to join and to be, as Mrs. [Eddie] Quaintance would describe it, a citizen of the world, what it would be like to travel, and so, you know.  And in some respects, I think my--I've been so blessed because I've been able to live the life I imagined and then some.
Speaker 1: How did you become aware of, I mean like, I can't--you're talking about wanting to be an architect.  Are you in third grade, fourth grade, if--are--
Speaker 2: Probably at this point in fourth or fifth grade [at Mary C. Terrell Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and it was because my--you know, that drum teacher I told you about was also a draftsman.  And he had a great big drafts table in his apartment and which is where we would have my lessons.  And I would--and he'd show me what he was working on, the different tools he used, the different ways of thinking about space.  I'd frequently run from him when it came time for the drum lessons.  But I was always delighted when I got there because we'd spend as much time looking over his drafting as we did on the music.  And I also think that, you know, having spent as many years as I did sharing space with my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] and sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh] in that one room and each of us having our little corner where we could stack our things or store our things, I think made me particularly conscious of space and how it could be used and what have you.  We had a window that opened into the airshaft, so you looked across at a brick wall basically and a part of the window of the neighboring apartment building. I've sort of gotten, I mean I traced my interests today in views and in space and so on to that feeling.  And I don't wanna give the impression that my childhood was by any means all misery and isolation.  It wasn't, but I remember feeling very uncomfortable because I had interests which included, you know, the latest Motown hit but also--and in that respect, were shared with others in the neighborhood--but were also sort of outside the acceptance of the culture I was immediately in.  And that's a--you know, a lot of us are learning how to speak more than one language, live in more than one world, but fewer of us I think have really gotten comfortable with that.  And I think over time, I've decided, look, this is what feeds my soul, all these things.  And I don't have to starve my soul in order to feel, in order to be accepted or validated or so on.  And this is about what I need, and about contributions I wanna make, and about things that stimulate me, and that's perfectly okay.  And we've, my wife and I, have tried to impart that to our kids [Sarah Patrick and Katherine Patrick].
Story_ID: 226995
Speaker 1: Now, I just, I'm trying to understand, though, the environment that you describe is, you appear to be such a quiet, contemplative person.  Now that may come from being a shy person.  Okay, that's mature (laughter).  But where were you--and I know that you had this teacher [Eddie Quaintance] who taught you, you know, taught German and you went to the Civic Opera [House, Chicago, Illinois].  But how are you becoming aware of the world outside you, and who else is sort of nurturing that, in a community that you say, Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] are being built, and that created a lot congestion I'm sure.  And people are moving, wherever they were coming from, which I'd like to ask you if you knew.  But what is feeding that, and who--you know, because you describe--you could say I was a nerd, you know.  Were you, sort of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I--
Speaker 1: Okay, quiet (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) would say I was kind of a nerd, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, what is giving you that exposure?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Are these adults in the church--I mean I'm just--
Speaker 2: Nah, it's a little of all of that.  You know, certainly there are things you pick up on television; there are things we got from exposure from our teachers who talked about--you know, in some ways, when they talked about themselves, and where they had come from, and that they had gone to school, not just where they went to school, but that they had, you know, that they had bachelor's degrees and in some cases master's degrees, and all of that was a world you didn't get at home, or, you didn't get in our apartment but was a part of, of our community.  And you know, we'd take (laughter), we used to ride the State Street bus downtown once a year to go to the Sears on State Street to get our school clothes.  And sometimes when we finished shopping, we'd walk around that area around Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] that's over, just off Michigan [Avenue] and around by the public library [Chicago Public Library Central Branch; Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] and so on.  And they're just, they're images you pick up about, about the scope of the world, about--you know, you look at people, and you wonder what do they do for a living?  What is that like?  Why is that person wearing a uniform and that person over there is wearing a suit?  Why are there so few women wearing suits and who seem professional?  In those days that was a very unusual sort of sight.  I don't know.  I just opened to things like that.  And my grandmother [Sally Wintersmith], who was a simple person, a modest person that never finished school beyond the third grade, had grown up in Kentucky, she was quite encouraging of our thinking about the larger world, and having ambitions, and not saying, you know, that's beyond your reach.  No one in my family had ever been to college and indeed no one had finished high school before my sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh] graduated the year before me.  But I always expected to go to college, and nobody ever said that was out of reach.  When I did finally get into college, I remember I applied to five schools.  And I wanted one in particular, and I got into that one, and I called home.  And I got into all of them, but I got into that one.  I was really excited, and I called home and I said, "Grandma, I'm going to college next year.  I'm going to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]."  And she said, "Oh, I'm so proud.  I'm so pleased."  And she paused for a minute, and she said, "Now, where is that anyway?"  And I think the beauty of that story, the impact of that moment for me was that it was not about the prestige.  It was about the opportunity.  It was about--it was not about the sort of competition for being first.  It was about the opportunity to expand yourself and to think broadly, to be broad.  And I think my grandmother allowed for that.  You know, she didn't make me feel, and my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] didn't make me feel funny and weird for being interested in the music that was being played behind the Bugs Bunny cartoons or wanting to see 'The Sound of Music' over and over again or what have you.  I think they worried a little bit that I spent as much time up under the back porch with my little cowboys and Indians by myself.  But that was all right.  We got past that.
Story_ID: 226996
Speaker 1: Can you describe what happened with Robert Taylor [Homes, Chicago, Illinois], being aware of that, you know, or what you heard discussed or what age you were when Robert Taylor was being built?
Speaker 2: You know, it's funny you say, I have a memory of Robert Taylor Homes really always being there from the time that we moved in with my grandparents [Sally Wintersmith and Reynolds Wintersmith], because when--I think I remember this correctly.  The Mary [C.] Terrell [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois], where I went for grammar school, was built as a part of the Robert Taylor Homes project, and it was right there in the, it was right next to one of the buildings, sixteen-story buildings.  And well, you know what they were like, just--we, well, when we were on welfare and my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] was looking to move out of my grandparents' apartment, she went over to look at one of the apartments at the Robert Taylor Homes 'cause there was one that was available.  And she remembers.  I don't remember.  I think I was with her.  I mean I think she says I was with her, but I don't really have a memory of it.  But she remembers these apartments with really thin walls and curtains instead of doors, and just a, not a very attractive place to live.  And this is when they were new or newish.  The whole South Side [Chicago, Illinois], in those days, in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], was largely populated by people moving up from the South, from the southern United States.  And it felt like the South.  I mean people spoke with a southern accent.  I did too.  They, they talked about going down south in the summertime.  People would go back to help plant in season, or they'd go back to big ma's house and what have you for the summer, particularly when it got rough on the South Side, you know, in the '67 [1967], '68 [1968], '69 [1969], when the Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] riots and so forth were, were happening.  And people would send their kids off to the South for safety's sake.  The food was all southern, you know, the little cafes and what have you.  There were still guys who would come through the neighborhood with a horse-drawn wagon full of watermelons in the summertime and yell out for watermelons and people who would push carts to, to sharpen knives and stuff.  So it was very town-ish if you, rather than city living, except that you'd have these sixteen-story buildings behind, and they were incredibly dense.  And I think that there was, for a time--I should say, I think we sensed--I'm not sure it was reality, but that's how we felt about it--that there was a real division between life in the projects and life on the other side of the street.  Now we were all broke, but it seemed like the gang activity was, and the gang recruiting, was a lot more active in the projects than in the neighborhood one block over, and that there was sometimes a certain amount of clashing that, that went on.  But of course I went to school with kids from Robert Taylor Homes.  I had pals, and we'd visit them, and they'd visit us, and--
Story_ID: 226997
Speaker 1: So now do you remember what gangs were predominant at that time?
Speaker 2: Remember the Disciples were predominant.  I can't remember now whether they morphed into the El Rukns [Blackstone Rangers], but I remember the Disciples.  And let me think.  There was another gang.  If you mentioned the name--
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, okay, I'm drawing a blank, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the Disciples yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you, did they ever try to recruit?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: --oh yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --can you describe that?  What was the recruitment process like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there was a kind of a conversation that would first happen.  But it was a conversation where you weren't really meant to say no.  And if you did, you know, stuff would stop--start to happen.  I mean I got beat up more times than I can count or got chased more times than I can count trying to stay out of their way.  My grandparents [Reynolds Wintersmith and Sally Wintersmith] sent us to a Bible camp, my sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh] and I, a couple of summers, much as, you know, other families sent their kids in the summers to, back down south, just to stay out of the way of the, of the gangs.  There was one particularly vicious spate where, when the gangs were really active in drugs.  And they would chase down kids and then give them an injection of something that was addictive, and that was a way of claiming them.  So it was ugly; it was ugly for a time.
Story_ID: 226998
Speaker 1: Do you remember some events that made you aware of the world outside you?  You know, I wanna say like, you know, sort of early teens, or that ten, eleven--things that happened around the '60s [1960s] or--
Speaker 2: I remember a couple of things.  I remember [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] came to town during the garbage strike or what I now believe was the garbage strike, and there was a rally out on the, at a park on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I'm not sure where.  And my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] took my sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh] and me to, to listen to him.  There were huge numbers of people.  And frankly, I don't have any memory at all about what he said, but I do remember the feeling of that setting.  I remember the reverence.  I remember the incredible quiet in that crowd while he spoke.  I remember the incredible sense of hope.  And you know, my sister and I, even to this day, were very attuned to my mother's feelings, because she's had so much unhappiness, and she's been unhappy for a long time.  And I remember how lifted up she felt, and I remember how that made us feel, lifted up.  And it's again a lesson in the power of hope.  I remember that.  I remember the Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] riots after King's death and what a mess it made of the South Side, you know, the amount of destruction and the violence.  We couldn't use our living room, which was in the small room at the front of the apartment on the street for fear of stray bullets coming in.  It was just a war zone.  I remember that.  And I remember the incredible tension each of those hot summers, wondering whether the city was gonna burst into flames again, and that made us conscious of the news.  I remember also, you know, like so many people, where I was when I learned that [President] John [Fitzgerald] Kennedy had been killed and the shock that people felt.  You know, you'd go into people's homes on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], there were always three pictures, maybe four, up on the walls, right, both Kennedys, Martin Luther King, and Jesus (laughter), and usually from somebody's calendar, right.  And I remember sitting in that living room I described with that little black and white TV watching the, the Kennedy funeral and seeing my grandfather [Reynolds Wintersmith] cry for the first time, and again, just trying to process what that meant and what that meant for him and for his generation.  Yeah, so I remember events like that that made me conscious or began to make me conscious of the world outside.  And then there were those other, you know, high points like the opera or going to the movies at one of the downtown theaters, going to the [Chicago] Symphony [Orchestra, Chicago, Illinois] that first time.
Speaker 1: Was church a part--it was a part, a--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --a, big part.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So around--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we couldn't have, we couldn't have breakfast on Sunday morning unless we (laughter) went down to church first, yeah.
Story_ID: 226999
Speaker 1: Describe how you got to Milton Academy [Milton, Massachusetts].  What was that whole process?  Was it the teacher, the sixth, who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventh grade teacher.
Speaker 1: It was the seventh grade teacher?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  In Chicago [Illinois] in the eighth grade you had three choices you can make: you could go to a technical high school; you could go to a vocational high school, or you could go to the general high school in your school district.  And at that time, I was really interested in architecture.  And I'd done well; I was a good student.  The guidance counselor was very supportive.  You know, I was a nerd, but a good student.  And I was interested, I thought, in drafting and learning about that, so it was suggested I go to a technical school.  At that time there were only two in the city: one on the North Side and one on the South Side.  And the one on the North Side was a much better resource than--I mean it was just a better equipped school.  But at that time they wouldn't take any South Side students.  And they tried hard to get them to waive that, but they refused to do it.  I think they've been sued over that since.  Then there were vocational schools that taught trades, you know, auto mechanics, and tailoring, and things I now wish I knew but which were not thought of as college preparatory.  And I wanted to go to college even though, as I said, no one in my family had ever been.  But it, I wanted to go.  And that left the general high school in the school district, and that was DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And at that time, this is now '69 [1969], you know, the school had gotten caught up in all of the turmoil and unrest the neighborhood had experienced in those years.  We had forty, forty-five kids in every classroom, 'cause remember, we had our junior high classes in the high school.  There were policemen at every intersection in the corridors.  You had to--if you went between buildings, you had to have a pass during, you know, the periods during that class time in between the changes in period.  And you had to slide the pass under the door, and then you'd hear the, the policemen undoing the bicycle chains on the, that they kept on the doors.  I mean I'm sure it was a fire hazard, but it was all about security and order.  It was not about education and that kind of learning.  There were--there was hardly any glass left in any of the windows.  They were either covered over with plywood, or they had the Plexiglas put in, the unbreakable stuff put in.  It was chaos, in a way, and it seemed as if that's where I was gonna end up going to school.  And then this seventh grade teacher, Mrs. [Darla] Weissenberg, knew about this program called A Better Chance [ABC], and she asked to--and she had been my English teacher the year before.  And she asked my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] and I to come in and talk to her about it.  And I remember she gave us these pink application forms.  We, we filled them all out and sent 'em in, took the test.  I still didn't know what I was getting myself into.  My mother didn't really either.  And then I got a letter that spring from Milton Academy outside of Boston [Massachusetts] saying I was admitted, and here was the scholarship, and please come.  And again, still not really knowing what I was getting into, but my mother said, "You know, you might as well try it.  You know what's here.  You can always come home."  So, I went off in the fall of 1970 by myself to Boston, got picked up there by the school and driven out to the town of Milton [Massachusetts].  And I saw the school for the first time the night before classes began.  And they had a dress code then requiring jackets and ties for boys for classes.  And I remember a jacket in our neighborhood in those days was a windbreaker.  So my grandparents [Sally Wintersmith and Reynolds Wintersmith] had splurged on a new windbreaker for me to take to school.  And the next morning all these other boys were putting on their blue blazers and their tweed coats and so on, and there was I in my windbreaker.  And I thought, oh, no, I have (laughter) a lot to learn, but I figured it out.
Speaker 1: Now, with--tell me, when you say you were a good student up to that point, A's?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was, and you had a good guidance counselor who, along the way, who were not limiting?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you the only memory I have of any of the presence of, of a guidance counselor was in eighth grade when someone was calling the technical school on the North Side--I think it was Lane Tech [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois]--to ask if they would take me and to say, look, we've got somebody who's, you know, he's our top student.  He's, he can do the work; he's ready.  And they said no.  And I remember being in the room while they pleaded, and they said, no, they wouldn't take me.  But other than that, I would say that my educational guidance, if you will, my educational encouragement came from a few teachers who helped make me feel okay about being interested in things intellectual.
Speaker 1: Now, in that, were you in competition with anyone in your high, I mean in DuSable Upper School [sic. DuSable Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], I mean in terms, you know, academically?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I'm sure I was, but I wasn't conscious of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Story_ID: 227000
Speaker 1: So we get to Milton [Academy, Milton, Massachusetts], you're saying sight unseen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you--and a whole new world is opening up at that point--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right--
Speaker 2: --yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: --so to speak (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you describe Milton Academy--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and its history?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Milton Academy was founded in 1798 in the town of Milton, Massachusetts, right outside of Boston [Massachusetts].  Its original charter read that this school is instituted to prepare young boys for Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And until the 1960s, I think, everyone who graduated went to Harvard College, with maybe one or two exceptions, never to be heard of again.  You know, if you went to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] that was just not done.  It was a kind of a classic boarding school once upon a time for families of elite New England generations of--you know, I always talk about how schools of that kind the graduates never die.  They just turn into buildings.  So you'd go to school with a Cabot, or a Forbes, or a Hallowell, and they would be living in Cabot Hall, or Forbes Hall, or Hallowell Hall, that sort of thing.  By the time I got there, the girls' school, which was independent but coordinate in the sense that in the upper classes you had classes together, but they were across the street.  They had their own headmistress.  By the time I got there, the school was probably--I don't--not quite half-day.  A lot of the families in the greater Boston area chose Milton 'cause it was easy to get to and so on.  There was a fledgling population of minority kids, most of us on scholarship.  I can think of one who wasn't, but not many of us.  And the school, if you will, had a campus life that, that mimicked that of a small college.  I mean they'd shut the school down over protests over the Vietnam War the spring before.  When Harvard suspended all the exams over at Harvard, Milton suspended all the spring exams at Milton, that sort of thing.  It is--you know, I remember driving up, down Centre Street, which is the main road, and you can imagine the scene, 'cause you've seen it a million times, old red brick Georgian-style buildings with ivy growing up the side, and more lawn than I think I had ever seen in one place before, just carpets of lawn and great big old trees turning color in the early fall.  It just seemed extravagant in a way.  And I lived in Hallowell House, one of the boys' dorms.  It's not a boys' dorm anymore.  It's now a girls' dorm, but.  And in those days, the fourth and fifth classmen, who were the ninth and eighth-graders, had lived in the alcoves, as they were called, up in the top floor.  And this was essentially one big room with partitions, so walls that didn't go quite up to the, to the ceiling, and curtains for doors, and, but everybody had one.  And I remember going in here and thinking, wow, this is the first room to myself I've ever had.  I have my own bed I sleep in every day, and my own bureau, my own little desk, my own little tiny closet.  We had a communal bathroom, of course.  But there was something, you know, for most of the other kids, this was roughing it.  For me, it was, as I say, just extravagant.  It was a very, very different environment.
Story_ID: 227001
Speaker 1: Did it take you much to adjust [at Milton Academy, Milton, Massachusetts]?  And I wanna go back to, did you know much at that point about A Better Chance [ABC], I mean except that you had applied?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know anything about A Better Chance.  There was an orientation in the summer before where they brought the new students out to Williams College [Williamstown, Massachusetts] actually for a couple of weeks' time to have the experience of living in a dorm and to have the experience of taking some courses that would be like the courses we were going, we would be in, in independent schools.  And they also did some evaluation of us academically so they could figure out how to place us.  School had been so easy for me up till then.  I never felt dumber (laughter) than that orientation program.  I thought to myself, I am so far behind mathematically and grammatically.  Kids were talking about the great books they'd read in the eighth grade, in the seventh grade.  And I thought, my, I just, I've heard of those books, but I've never read any of 'em.  So it felt like there was gonna be some catching up to do.  But I hadn't heard anything about it, A Better Chance.  I've been involved with A Better Chance ever since.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that since we're talking about it--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --what the, how the program originated?  You were, you played a role on the board--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: I have in recent years.  I'm not on it anymore.  But, A Better Chance was an initiative created, a foundation created probably, I don't know, four decades ago, maybe more, whose objective was, as the euphemism at the time went, to recruit kids from non-traditional prep school backgrounds for prep schools.  And it was essentially a talent search program.  And they, through a network of teachers mainly or guidance counselors in New York [New York], and in Chicago [Illinois], and, and in Boston [Massachusetts], and a couple of other cities would identify motivated, mostly black kids, who showed some leadership skills and who might be suitable for an opportunity in a prep school, in most cases, then, boarding schools.  They now do both boarding and day schools.  And ABC would identify the kids, sort of shepherd them through the application process.  And then, at that time you would apply to ABC, and ABC would then, together with the schools, place you, and you usually got one placement.  You didn't, you know, they didn't say okay, here's a kid who could be at these three schools.  And the three schools would each send a, send an acceptance.  In those days, ABC would place you where they thought made the most sense.  And through a combination of the school's resources and ABC's resources, they'd cover the cost.  The, the program has evolved since then.  It now includes day schools.  It also includes really strong public schools, usually suburban schools.  And it's life changing; it's life changing.
Speaker 1: And so, what was your adjustment?  I mean this is, you are going from a totally different environment--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and not--and how old are you?
Speaker 2: I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Fourteen, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and this, and how many--you said there was a small group of other black kids--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --boys.  How many?
Speaker 2: There were probably eight of us.
Speaker 1: And how large was the student body?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I think in our class there were, I think there were ninety boys.  I think that's right.
Speaker 1: And so this is your freshman, what would be freshman year?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, ninth grade?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 227002
Speaker 1: And I mean you say okay, I spent those two weeks I think at Williams [College, Williamstown, Massachusetts], but, and realized, I had a lot of catching up to.  But what is--okay, you know you want this opportunity [to attend Milton Academy, Milton, Massachusetts], right?  It opens up a new world, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you sort of--this is the first time, you said, I've had my own room, you know.  But what is the process, I mean of sort of, and I'm talking about the acculturation process--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a sort of fitting in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and being able to sustain.
Speaker 2: It's, you know, it's both, I would describe the process as both occasional shocks and then very subtle kind of gradual adjustment.  You know, there are surprises, like the bit about the jacket, trying to figure out what the dress code is, and things like trying to figure out how they, how and where to get your hair cut.  You know, I ended up with an afro this big.  It was the style, but it was also a lot more convenient than trying to figure out how and where to get it cut; how to learn a new language.  I remember I came from, for the first time at Thanksgiving.  And my grandfather [Reynolds Wintersmith] picked me up at the airport.  I'd been away at this point about three months.  And my grandparents were really excited about this opportunity.  And I came in, and my grandmother [Sally Wintersmith] was meeting me in the hall, and my sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh] said, ooh, he's, she said, "He talks like a white boy."  And my grandmother instantly said, "No, he speaks like an educated boy."  I wish I'd once had the presence of mind to save the day like that.  But that was a very, to me, very vivid encapsulation of what that experience, what the gradual part of that experience felt like, because you were kind of beginning to straddle a wider and wider gulf.  It's like being with one foot in a boat and the other on the dock, and the boat is moving away from the dock.  And it takes a certain determination to continue to straddle the two, rather than to jump in the boat or back on the dock, if you know what I mean.  And so, for example, I was meeting kids.  I remember I met this kid [Robert O. Blake, Jr.] who was the son of an ambassador, an ambassador.  What was an ambassador?  He explained that to me.  He lived in, he'd grown up in Washington [D.C.], but he lived in Mali.  I met his parents.  They invited me to come and spend the summer with them in Mali.  I had to look up where Mali was on the map.  Just being able to have those conversations with people was so, to me, exciting and new.  But I'd come back home, and I'd see my buddies, and I'd try to express to them what the impressions were, and you know, that conversation is very short.  And it's not because they didn't care about me or didn't care about that.  It's just that their perspective was so different than mine was becoming.  And it, there's a lesson in that I think as well, which I have continued to reflect on.  So there, there are some things that I think in the adjustment are, as I say, you know, poignant moments.  But a lot more of it is, it evolves, and you sort it, and I think I still am sorting it out.  Some people say, and I was on the board of trustees for Milton for many years and involved in some of the efforts to sustain and enhance the diversity of the student body and indeed of the faculty.  And some--I remember one person said, "Sometimes that work is about bringing kids to the campus to break their hearts," because it is so powerful to, and so hard to share to have the experience of, as I say, trying to straddle that canoe and that dock by force of will and really against gravity, if you know what I mean.  And you know, a lot of people feel forced to choose, and that choice can be heartbreaking, whichever choice you make--
Story_ID: 227003
Speaker 1: I think that the secret, again, for me was that adults paid attention to me. I had a ninth grade teacher in particular, A. O. Smith, who was as powerful in my life as Eddie Quaintance was, and with whom I continued a relationship right through the time of his death.  And he was an old school, Mr. Chips, Yankee kind of guy who took an interest in me in his English class the very first day I was at Milton Academy [Milton, Massachusetts] and who encouraged me.  He'd gone to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He's the person who sort of taught me about Harvard and nurtured me in that direction.  I got to be very close to his family while at Milton and since.
Speaker 2: What did he see in you?  Did he ever say that?
Speaker 1: Well, he said--you know, it's interesting.  He told me I was smart, which is not something I was feeling in the early days at Milton for the reasons I said.  It just seemed like everybody else was better prepared.  He was, he had a real love of the English language, I mean just a love of and a command of words but also believed that you should express yourself in writing and in speaking so that anyone can understand you and that that was the real measure of intellectual strength, not that you can dazzle people with a multisyllabic word, but that you could get a point across.  He also, you know, he had this way--it was a very small classroom.  Remember, there were forty or fifty of us in the classes back at DuSable [Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois].  There were ten of us in his class, so you couldn't escape.  And it was very interactive.  And when you'd ask a question--you know, someone should recite a passage from the text and talk about it.  And when you started to kind of prattle on or filibuster, he would make this sign like this (laughter), which was the bullshit sign (laughter).  And you know, he had these other tricks.  He'd say--these other little devices.  He'd, if we didn't know the answer to something, he would stand up.  He'd make us stand up and say, Mr. Smith, I am ignorant.  You couldn't say--you couldn't pretend.  If you didn't know the answer, you had to stand up and say, Mr. Smith, I am ignorant.  And his point was, let go of pretending that you know something.  Open yourself to what you don't know, and you become a vessel that all kinds of information and experiences fill, and I think he saw that in me.  I mean he talked about seeing that in me, my being very, very open.  And I think he also appreciated that it was a little risky for me to be as open in that environment, you know, that people didn't entirely understand my own circumstance.  They were very interested in my assimilating to theirs, and curious, but in that sort of New England way, and not all that comfortable discussing my own circumstances, but kind of relieved that I was interested in theirs.  And I think he saw all of that.  We spent hours and hours over many years talking about a whole range of things including just how to be in the world, and how to love people, and how to love books, and how to try things.  And he taught me about, he taught me about great American novels, and French red Bordeaux, and Cape Cod [Massachusetts], and old waspy [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] New England families and their traditions, and you know, the know the clash between the Brahmins and the Irish Americans, and all kinds of things about his experiences that he was willing to share with me.  And then he asked me questions about my own experiences, and not everybody did that.  And you could talk, and he listened well.
Speaker 2: And you felt that he understood when you were talking?
Speaker 1: I thought that he was open to understanding.  I don't know that he always got it, but he listened very empathetically.  He listened actively.  It wasn't just conversation, and he cared about me.
Story_ID: 227004
Speaker 1: For holidays and summers, are you going back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was going back home.  I--which is, you know, its own--it's a much longer trip, if you know what I mean, than people always appreciated.  I would move back in that room with my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] and sister [Rhonda Patrick Sigh] and went back to my old summer job, which was on a snowball truck.  One of our neighbors had a snowball machine mounting on a truck he would take around in the summertime out to the projects and back around in the neighborhood.  I worked with him first couple of summers, and then I got a job at a machine shop downtown on the Near North (clearing throat)--excuse me--on the Near North Side.  And I did that for, for a couple of summers.  But yeah, I was back, back home and working every summer.
Story_ID: 227005
Speaker 1: I want to talk, have you talk about in that four-year period [at Milton Academy, Milton, Massachusetts], four years, right, your sort of transition, when you sort of--I mean what were the things, you had this teacher [A.O. Smith], so that made you interested in English--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And were there other things that in terms of your growth as a student, a pupil exposed--did you make that trip to Mali?
Speaker 2: I never did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I eventually did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't--
Speaker 1: At that time.
Speaker 2: --to visit the--
Speaker 1: Them.
Speaker 2: --the family, right, right.
Speaker 1: But I'm just wondering, what were the key sort of moments then?  And this is 19--we are in 19--
Speaker 2: This is 1970 to 1974.
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974], okay.
Speaker 2: And we graduated in June of 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, I think it was probably, it was a typical adolescent experience with layers, meaning, you know what adolescents do.  They try on different personalities.  They--I wrestled for a while, and then I wasn't--and then I ran track a little bit, and then I wasn't all that interested in sports.  I learned how to play squash.  A little squash (laughter).  There was, being invited into the homes of some of these kids whose ancestors' names were up on the walls of the, or on the names of the buildings and so forth and what that whole experience was like and being able ale to discern what was a genuine welcome from just your being a kind of a curiosity and so forth.  I made, I learned how to make friends across differences.  I'd say probably my oldest and dearest friend [Will Speers] is the friend I made from, from Milton days who is, you know, from an old Yankee family.  He was the best man at my wedding.  I was the best man at his wedding.  He's our oldest daughter's [Sarah Patrick] godfather.  I'm his youngest son's godfather.  We might as well be blood.  We've traveled all over the place together.  And one of the things that binds us is our fascination with each other's differences, and frankly, through that, our fascination with how much we have in common.  I would say that I've been sorting out my relationship with Milton over the years.  Our kids went there.  My daughter graduated from there last spring, which was huge.  And I served on the board for many, for many years.  I helped select one of the headmasters, in fact the first black headmaster.  We live in the town, within walking distance, in a house to which I delivered newspaper when I had a paper route at Milton.  But I think there are also ways in which, as important as that milestone was and is, that sometimes, and I say this affectionately, 'cause I have a lot of affection for the school, but sometimes the school I think behaves as if it was the milestone that meant the difference between where I was and where I am.  And I have sometimes a little reluctance around that because I want to honor the contributions and the inspiration of Eddie Quaintance, and Darla Weissenberg, and my grandparents [Sally Wintersmith and Reynolds Wintersmith], and the pastor at the church, the bus driver who showed an act of kindness and, and offered a word of encouragement.  All those things predated Milton, and there have been lots of similar blessings since Milton.  So I'd like to think that, I think like anybody's life, you know, you are being composed as you go along.  And Milton was a part of that and an important part, but it's not the only part.
Story_ID: 227006
Speaker 1: Did they indoctrinate you?  Was there something like the Milton [Academy, Milton, Massachusetts] man or Milton boy?
Speaker 2: Well, no, not exactly.  It's a great question though, not exactly.  In those days, they used to talk about the importance of educating the whole child.  And that was about the classroom, about the sports field, but above all about character.  It was, but you know, the school motto was: "Dare to be true."  There was a tremendous emphasis placed on integrity and on honesty and candor.  And then as a sort of methodology, if you will, there was a tremendous emphasis placed on expression.  So, there was a very active arts program.  There was a very active speech program.  You had to write a lot in all the courses.  You had to write in, and compose essays in math and science courses as well.  It was a tremendous emphasis on expression and not expression with a particular point of view or with a particular style.  In fact, there was a tremendous emphasis on trying to find your own voice.  So, in that sense I would not say it was one style.  Now any environment, you know, particularly any prep school environment in the early '70s [1970s], responds, if you will, to, to some styles more than others.  You know, I was a--I figured it out.  You know, I didn't know anything about jackets when I first got there, but I figured out ultimately the whole line of Brooks Brothers' merchandise, and so in some respects was a kind of a nonthreatening character in and around the place.  And I was interested in some of the things that old Milton families were interested in, where I lived, where I live now, the kind of job I have, being a professional and that sort of thing.  I also think that there was an emphasis, and there has been historically at Milton on public service not necessarily elective office, not necessarily public office for that matter, but public service, that you have a role to play in your community and a responsibility for that.  And I'm sure that's sort of old fashioned Brahmin noblesse oblige.  But call it what you will.  There's a certain honor in that, and they taught us that, and they encouraged it.  So you find that if you look at the Milton bulletins and so forth, the things that people are talking and that the alumni are talking about, and that get attention are the ways in which they have contributed to the society in either writ large or writ very small.
Speaker 1: Now you say your best friend, what is his name that--
Speaker 2: Will Speers--
Story_ID: 227007
Speaker 1: Now, you said at that time, did everyone, you're saying, go on to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at that time?
Speaker 2: No, no, not by the time I got there [Milton Academy, Milton, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, that had ended.
Speaker 1: So what--
Speaker 2: Although there were I think eighteen of us who went to Harvard from our class, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you had--what made you decide that you wanted to go to Harvard?  Why was that the prize jewel?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I really loved the environment around Boston [Massachusetts].  I mean this is a very interesting time in Boston.  The busing crisis was happening.  The, so the--and you'll remember, that's the federal order to desegregate the schools in South Boston.  And Milton was itself, the town of Milton [Massachusetts], was itself coping with the integrate--now, Milton's right on the edge of Boston, so you, you can walk across the Boston city line from the town of Milton.  And just across Boston was a neighborhood that was very much in transition, is pretty much a black neighborhood now, but it was very much in transition in those days.  And, but Milton itself is a very leafy, almost rural community, still has a lot of land and reservation and still has a couple of working farms.  And in those days, the town itself was coping with integration, and such integration as there was, was largely coming from Milton Academy.  So, if you took a walk from Milton Academy to the subway, you could almost be certain that you'd be pulled over by the Milton police and ask to show your identification.  I always took a particular delight in pulling out my Milton Academy identification because it was such a novel thing for them, for the police.  So you had, you had the adjustments that the town of Milton was making to black and brown people at that time; you had all the turmoil in the City of Boston at that time; but you had this rich intellectual tradition.  And it's not just about Harvard by any means.  There were I think a hundred and something different institutions of higher learning in the Boston area.  And Boston had been welcoming to me, even though there were all kinds of issues about where you couldn't go and who was gonna--you know, I can remember once we used to have these burger runs as a treat from the faculty every once in a while.  And, and you'd take orders and call it in to the local McDonald's or the, or Burger King, go in and they'd have racks and racks of Big Macs or what have you to take.  And I remember we went, and one kid would be responsible for all the orders and collecting the money.  And I did it once and went with one of the faculty members to the local McDonald's in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts] just across the line in Boston.  And the parking lot was full of these white kids hanging out, and they did not like it when I showed up with this faculty member.  We went in and they had--you know, then the names started being called and the threats and all that stuff, and we went inside. There's this great big plate glass window, and, and all these kids are out there banging on the window, making the window rattle.  And the manager was understandably nervous, and the faculty member was nervous.  And we got all the stuff and started hustling out to the car, and the kids are trying to throw their cigarette butts into my afro and what have you.  It was a pretty scary, scary scene.  And poor faculty member--I say now poor faculty member--couldn't even find the words to comfort me.  He was embarrassed and afraid, and I appreciated that, but you know, I was also just a kid.  But even so, so many of the people who had bothered to try to understand, and there were not a lot, but some who had bothered to try to understand what my own experience was like transitioning from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] to Milton Academy were there in the Boston area.  And they had become gradually but deeply dear, dear friends.  And so I was interested in staying in the, in the neighborhood, first of all.  And then A. O. Smith, this English teacher I told you about, had gone to Harvard (laughter) in a very different time, in the '30s [1930s].  He talked about going from--he was at St. Paul's School [Concord, New Hampshire].  He said his recommendation from the school consisted of a handwritten note from the headmaster, which read, "A fine boy" and the initials of the headmaster.  Our application process was a little bit more convoluted.  But he had gone to Harvard.  It meant a lot to him.  He encouraged me to think about Harvard.  He encouraged--he explained to me the Ivy League.  I didn't even know what that was.  And I went around, and I liked it, and so, and it worked out.
Story_ID: 227008
Speaker 1: Now, you're coming in, in 1974, right--
Speaker 2: To Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: --to Harvard, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now this, what is it like?  It's, is it, it's not really the transition that you had going from DuSable Upper [Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois] to Milton [Academy, Milton, Massachusetts].  So you are, you've been acculturated already.
Speaker 2: Ye--well, I, you know, it's, there are some, there are aspects of that which are moments of poignancy and others that are gradual.  And I would say that in terms of my acculturation, yeah, I was well on my way.  I'll tell you, it was, I was having--I was watching others have an experience that I had had four years before.  And, and you know, I've--it's interesting, 'cause I have, I have been in that kind of experience many times in my life now, and I always recognize it for what it is.  I'm also unafraid of it because I recognize it, and I know I can adjust and indeed even thrive.  I loved Harvard.  I had a wonderful time, a wonderful time.
Speaker 1: And so was, because, now, what did the black studies department [Department of Afro-American Studies; Department of African and African American Studies], was that, had that--
Speaker 2: It was happening.  I mean they were, it was trying to be born during that time.  It was a tremendous amount of controversy about it.  It was in the news all the time in the student paper [The Harvard Crimson].  It hadn't, it--I'm trying to remember now.  I think it became an institute while I was there, didn't turn into a department until some years later.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who--
Speaker 2: I think I've got that right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who the key players at the time were?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember Lani's dad, Ewart was, was central to it.  I didn't know Lani at that, [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier, at that time, but her dad, Ewart Guinier, was very much involved.  And he's probably the name that was most prominent at the time.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know she had said that there was a lot of trauma to him over that, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yes, and you could, over the years, you could really see it in his, you could see it in him; you could see it in his face.
Speaker 1: Now, so, you got active with Dunster House.  Can you talk about that a little bit and you--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a--you know, after freshman year where you live in Harvard Yard, which is the oldest part of the campus, you move into residence halls either on the river, on the Charles River up at Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and my roommates and I moved into Dunster House, which is one of the original river houses.  And there was a--you know, the residence hall becomes the center of your, of your college life in many respects.  Your academic tutors are there, and advisors are there.  The headmaster organizes social life around the dining hall and, and other activities.  We had a beautiful library in the dorm.  We had six or seven squash courts in the basement of the dorm.  There were house teams and so forth.  And I got active in all of that.  We had--I worked in the library.  I played on the Dunster House squash team.  I tried the Dunster House crew team, but I ultimately decided this is not for black people (laughter).  And, and I got close to, again, to some of the adults there.  The headmaster and his wife, Jim and Betty Vorenberg, are probably the two people most responsible for my thinking about law school.
Speaker 1: And so he was a headmaster before--okay, Jim Vorenberg [James Vorenberg] taught at the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right, so--
Speaker 2: He was headmaster.  He was on the faculty at the law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was headmaster at Dunster House while I was there.  And he and Betty I guess were co-masters.  And we had a little, you know, sort of form of student government.  It was called the, I think it was called the house council.  And it had two chairs, and I became one of the chairs.  And so we worked very closely together and became fast friends.  And so he was, he had a lot to do with trying to get me to think seriously about law school.  I loved his life, you know.  I loved--I'm not quite sure what he did, but I liked his life.  He seemed to be so engaged with interesting things, policy debates and public issues.  And you know, he'd served on the Watergate Commission.  He talked about that.  He was active in civil rights and introduced us to Jack Greenberg, and he would bring people in to talk about what they were doing in the law.  And he made the law seem so versatile, and so vital, and also helped me appreciate I think how in this particular democracy, law is uniquely important, really what the cliche of the rule of law means.  So it was a--he was terrific--
Story_ID: 227009
Speaker 1: I left college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] not knowing I was gonna go to law school.  I wasn't sure what I was gonna do.  I went and lived in Africa for a year.
Speaker 2: I was wondering what you did in that year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you, so where did you go in Africa?
Speaker 1: I lived in Sudan for most of the year, in the region you've been reading about a lot now, the Darfur region out by the Chadi [Chad] border.  It's a long story how I got out there, but--
Speaker 2: What program was that part of?
Speaker 1: I'd got a, something called a [Michael C.] Rockefeller [Memorial] Fellowship, which is a, it's an endowment that the Rockefeller family set up in memory of Michael Rockefeller, who was the daughter--I mean son of Nelson [Rockefeller], who was lost in New Guinea.  And it didn't have--it was a traveling scholarship.  They gave you essentially enough money to get where you were going and get home.  And the only real requirement was that you live in a distinctly non-Western culture.  The idea being that when you have all of your typical support systems removed, all of your familiarity with the language, with the customs and so on, there's another resource you have to go to, to make your way.  And I remember when I was in the interview with the selection committee, they were asking questions about my background and so forth.  And I told them about the experience of coming from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] to Milton [Academy, Milton, Massachusetts].  And they, I remember one of, the chair of the selection commission said, "You know, in many ways you've already had your Rockefeller experience," and I had a--then I got the award.  And I was interested in Sudan because I had spent a couple of summers working in banks in New York [New York] and in Boston [Massachusetts] in their international lending program, where they were doing development lending in Africa.  And I'd learned about and done some work on Sudan but never been there, never been out of the country for that matter.  So, I wrote to everyone I knew or who knew someone anywhere in Africa to try to figure out some kind of project so that I could get there.  And I got one response back from one guy on this U.N. [United Nations] project in Sudan.  And he said, "I'm not sure what you'll do, but come on, we'll find something."  And so I got to Cairo [Egypt].  This would be the summer of '78 [1978].  I got to Cairo.  [Anwar] Sadat had just come home from Camp David [Catoctin Mountain Park, Maryland], so it was a pretty good time to be an American in that part of the world.  And then I took the train and hitchhiked and walked and otherwise from Cairo down the Nile [River] to Aswan [Egypt], up the river, Lake Nasser, and then down to Khartoum [Sudan], the last ten days of which without a bath and looking like a piece of the desert I'd just come through.  And I found my way to this little office where this guy who'd written to me worked.  And I asked about him and learned that he had left the week before for two years in Long Beach, California (laughter) and had said nothing to his office about my coming or what I was gonna do or anything like that.  And they said "Look, you know, we don't have anything for you, go."  So, eventually, I figured out how to, I sort of talked my way onto a project.
Story_ID: 227010
Speaker 1: --And they sent me out to the western part of the country [Sudan] with a Sudanese fellow about my age who had just graduated from the University of Khartoum [Khartoum, Sudan] and spoke English.  And our job was to sit in the souk, in the marketplace, and interview young men who were the target for the project that was underway in that part of the world.  It was a jobs training project, and it was failing.  And they were trying to figure out why it was failing.  So, we--the way you traveled in those days--there was no air or rail service out there then--you went into the marketplace, and you found a lorry, a market lorry that was going where you were going.  And, and then you bargained for space up on top of the cargo.  And you, and you know, they would leave when they got everything loaded, so it could be a couple of days.  And the bargaining often took a long time to sort that out.  And then you got enough food and water for the trip, and climbed up on top at the appointed time, and took off.  And the distance was probably about the distance between Boston [Massachusetts] and Cleveland [Ohio], but it's all tracked through the sand.  It took about, takes about five days then.  I remember we started out, and we went about, we went that night.  We went well into the night, and there was a freak rainstorm.  Of course, everything just turned into mud, and we sank down to our axles, and we just sat there (laughter) and got wet for the rest of the night.  And then when the rain finally stopped the next morning, we rocked it free.  We got going again.  We went probably four or five miles.  Mind you, at this point, you see nothing but sand, and scrub, and the occasional ostrich.  We went a few more miles, went into a skid, and the whole thing flipped over.  And there were a couple of broke, people with broken bones and what have you.  And we were out there for about three, four good days before there was any help to get us back in that--well, and what happened was, they took us then to the next village, people who were injured and the visitor to the next village.  And we waited there for a couple of days until they got the truck righted again and reloaded.  And then it kind of came wobbling into the town, picked us up, and we started off again, still, mind you, these people with broken bones, no medical care; they're just made comfortable.  And we went to, we got to a wadi, which is a normally dry riverbed.  And you have to kind of, there's a way to cross wadis in this part of the world.  You have to kind of coast to the bottom, and then gun it to get up the other side.  And we started up the other side, and the whole thing started to flip the other way, so everybody jumped off.  And then they tried to rock it steady, and the battery died, so we spent another night out there.  And finally, the next day we hailed a couple of lorries that were going back in the other direction.  And we back to Khartoum [Sudan] and started all over again.  And eventually, after the next five-day trip, got out to the western part of the country where I spent several months, you know, no mail, no phone service, living in this little concrete square building and sleeping on a sort of a rope-type bed learning Arabic, eating in the marketplace, making fast friends with the guy I was with and with others.  It was an amazing experience.
Story_ID: 227011
Speaker 1: You spent time more in Sudan.  Did you, that experience traveling in Egypt, was there much about that--did you see any of the pyramids--
Speaker 2: I saw it all, yeah.  I saw it all.  I saw the--I took a public bus out to Giza [Egypt] and rode a horse around the [Great] Pyramids and the [Great] Sphinx.  On my way down, I stopped off in Luxor [Egypt] and viewed the Valley of the Kings and the old temple there.  In Aswan [Egypt] I looked around as well.  Now, when I was going down on Lake Nasser on the--there's a big barge.  It's actually been in the news from time to time because it sinks every once in a while, but big barge sort of latched together with other barges.  And it floats down Lake Nasser to Sudan.  And it's an overnight trip.  You buy space on the deck and so on.  It was nighttime, so I didn't see the temple [Abu Simbel] that had been reclaimed from the rising waters.  It was a very famous temple in southern Egypt that was going to be flooded when Lake Nasser, when the [Aswan] Dam was built and Lake Nasser was created.  So I didn't, I never saw that, but I did see a number of the antiquities.  And there's--I was in Cairo [Egypt], actually, for the first time since that trip last week, and my wife [Diane Bemus Patrick] was with me.  And we had, they had a dinner for us at Mena House [Hotel, Cairo, Egypt], which is the hotel, originally palace, across the street from the pyramids.  They had a dinner in the garden with the pyramids rising up behind us across the garden wall.  And again, you know, as I was trying to describe to Diane, you--for me, the impact, I think for anyone, frankly, the, the pyramids are, for good reason, one of the wonders of the world.  But to have seen them first with a backpack totally on my own and then the next time in this incredibly elegant garden at this beautiful dinner in our honor, and the pyramids as a sort of a backdrop, it just continues to remind me of the wonders of my life experiences.
Story_ID: 227012
Speaker 1: You took this year off.  You get back, right?  And--
Speaker 2: I decided while I was over there that I wanted to go to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in the true, sort of, you know, Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] keeping all your options open behavior, I had brought in my backpack one application to one law school (laughter).  And when I knew that, that we were going out to western Sudan, and there would be no mail or phone service, I decided to, that night, the night before we left Khartoum [Sudan], to go out and fill out this application and send it in.  So I went out behind this little hostel where I was staying, and I made a big--and there was no electricity--made a big mound of sand.  And I took my fat flashlight and put that on top of the mound of, of sand so I would have, you know, light on my work surface, which was on the ground.  And I filled out this application by hand.  It was a mess.  I'm (laughter) sure it was covered with bugs I swatted and all that.  And then I gave it the next morning before we left to somebody who knew somebody who was going to London [England] where they would mail it, because the mail service thing was a little more reliable from London.  And in fact, I mailed it to Jim Vorenberg [James Vorenberg], and I said, "If you think I should, then please submit this application."  And when I got to Khartoum months later, and I collected all my mail from the poste restante, there was a telegram for me saying, and it was from my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick] actually saying congratulations, you've been admitted to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 227013
Speaker 1: So now, you go, and tell about that experience, because--
Speaker 2: At Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was--people talk about law school as a period of misery (laughter) in their experience.  I had a ball.  I, we had a terrific section.  You know, the first-year class is divided into sections.  And I can remember; there may have been 120 in our section.  A number of us had had some experience between, some life experience, between college and law school.  So we had a certain perspective on the experience of being back in the academy.  A lot of people had just a wonderful sense of humor.  And we were always sort of making fun of each other and making fun of the teachers, and they in turn made fun of us.  In fact, every, once a semester, we would commandeer the class and do a skit where we would spoof each other and the professor.  And the professor would have a whole lesson plan, but we would just say you're not doing it today.  We're taking it over.  And our first year professors I think--well, at first we were worried that they were, you know, gonna take umbrage from this.  But we knew by the end of the semester that, in fact, they loved it because I had one class, one property class near the end of the semester, they all got together and spoofed us.  And they just, they took the class over.  They acted out the behaviors they saw in us.  It was hysterical.  We had so much fun, and we worked really hard.  So that was, the first year was, was great, and then I got involved in the [Harvard] Legal Aid Bureau [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Who were your professors the first year?
Speaker 2: Let's see, we had--
Speaker 1: For property?
Speaker 2: For property we had [Lance] Liebman.
Speaker 1: And civil procedure?
Speaker 2: For civil procedure we had Abe Chayes [Abram Chayes].  And well, we, actually, they shared the--Abe Chayes and a professor who had to take medical leave, David, I wanna say David [L.] Shapiro.  For criminal law we had Lloyd [L.] Weinreb.  For contracts we had Todd [D.] Rakoff, who was, it was his very first class.  You know, he's now wizened and, and a senior professor.  But, let's see, have I got everybody now?
Speaker 1: I think that's--properties, civil procedure, contracts, criminal law.  I think that's--
Speaker 2: And torts we had--
Speaker 1: Torts, torts.
Speaker 2: --Professor [Henry J.] Steiner, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now, you are, do you have a sense at this point--I know [James "Jim"] Vorenberg, you know, was sort of a mentor even beforehand, but do you have a sense of what you want to do with the law?
Speaker 2: No, no, I'd say I'm still developing a sense of what I want to do with the law.  What I loved was its versatility.  I loved that, and I loved about Jim, that you could practice a profession with the concept of justice in mind and that lawyering was not exactly the same thing as justice.  There was still a place for judgment and for restraint.  I was very interested in and remained very interested in civil and human rights, but I also, I'm interested in the whole problem-solving discipline that comes from, from legal training and from lawyering.  And I'm interested in applying that and have applied that to a lot of different settings.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you had won the Ames Moot Court Competition [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the first year, okay.
Speaker 2: --I did--no, in, in--
Speaker 1: That's, is, is it--
Speaker 2: --in the third year--
Speaker 1: --third year?
Speaker 2: Third year.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking--
Speaker 2: Third year.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.  Oh, you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The upper one.
Speaker 1: Yes, see, okay.  I, never mind, I'll explain.  But there's an international one, and I think I did, right--
Speaker 2: Ah, okay.
Speaker 1: --but it was in the first year--
Story_ID: 227014
Speaker 1: Did you want to practice at that point or do--
Speaker 2: Civil rights work?
Speaker 1: Civil rights work, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Well, no, I knew I wanted to practice.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to specialize.  I wanted to--you know what I--the model that Jim [James Vorenberg] set and that I wanted to emulate and still think is the unique opportunity of a legal education is this notion of being a citizen lawyer.  That is that your professional skill enables you and might even obligate you to move in and out of public issues if not public life.  And, I liked that about Jim's practice, and I've been fortunate to have some of those same kinds of experiences.  I spent my summers in large corporate law firms, as did so many of us in law school, at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] at the time, in Chicago [Illinois], in Washington [D.C.], and in San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: What firms?
Speaker 2: Winston & Strawn [LLP, Chicago, Illinois] in Chicago, still have dear friends there, had a wonderful experience, and I lived at home with my mother [Emily Wintersmith Patrick].  It was the first time I had in a lot of years.  And then the next summer I divided between Heller Ehrman [LLP, San Francisco, California] in San Francisco and Squire, Sanders & Dempsey [Washington, D.C.; Squire Patton Boggs, Cleveland, Ohio] in Washington.  And at the end of all that--and I got an offer to join Winston & Strawn permanently after my first summer, which they kept open until it was time to make up your mind for real.  At the end of all that, I said I was gonna go to Heller Ehrman.  And then I got a clerkship out in California with Judge [Stephen] Reinhardt on the Ninth Circuit [United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco, California], so I moved to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and planned to go to San Francisco at the end of that year.  But proving once again that life is what happens while you're making plans, I met Diane [Bemus Patrick], my wife, in Los Angeles.  She was practicing with O'Melveny and Myers [LLP, Los Angeles, California], had grown up in New York [New York].  They asked her to move back to New York and help them open their New York office.  And it's something she really wanted to do.  And we were still trying to figure out what our future was.  And ultimately, I said look, if you want to do that, I'll follow you.  So, we went off to New York, she with the job, me without one, and it turns out I got my dream job, which was working for the NAACP Legal Defense [and Educational] Fund [Inc.].
Story_ID: 227015
Speaker 1: Who was in charge [of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF)] at the time?
Speaker 2: Jack Greenberg, yeah.
Speaker 1: And he, had you met him previously through [James] Vorenberg?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had, I had, yeah, and that was, that was a wild experience.  It's, it was, you know, LDF is, obviously has a storied past and I think a very vital present.  It's still astonishes me how much that small under-resourced staff is able to get done--and, and I worked at the time there with [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier, who was doing voting rights work.  In fact, she and I sued [President William Jefferson] "Bill" Clinton together in a case in Arkansas when he was still governor of Arkansas.  And she had known him since law school [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], and they were good friends.  And I spent most of the time out there doing the depositions and then ultimately negotiating the settlement, so I got to know the governor a little bit.  And then, of course, our paths all crossed again years later when he came into the White House [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now were those the issues that intrigued you at the time, voting rights--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the things that you were doing?  You worked on voting rights and what other types of--
Speaker 2: And death penalty.
Speaker 1: And death penalty.  What--
Speaker 2: Right, I did some housing work as well, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, was there any preference, one over the other?
Speaker 2: I mean they were vital in different ways.  I mean the death penalty work was uniquely draining because you'd get a call that someone's execution date was at hand.  And you'd have to file--I can remember going from state court up through the state system and up to and including the [U.S.] Supreme Court in one case in the course of an afternoon.  And you'd have to have all your papers ready and people in different cities and so forth and ready, you know, and sort of be at the airport but not sure which flight to get on, because it wasn't clear where you were gonna get the hearing and what have you.  That was incredible work, and it revealed a lot about the way the death penalty is administered in the United States and I think has left me with a lasting skepticism about the death penalty as a law enforcement tool.  The voting rights work was vital in other ways.  I remember Lani and I and others participated in a criminal case that was tried in Selma, Alabama, within sight of the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama] and the federal courthouse there.  It was a federal prosecution in the '80s [1980s] against some of the people who had helped organize the Selma and Montgomery march.  And they were being charged with voter fraud, for the use of absentee ballots.  And it was an absolutely nasty and deeply ironic prosecution.  And the whole idea that these people who had dedicated--I mean they were old people at that point--who had dedicated their lives to trying to bring access to the ballot to poor black people in rural communities would be responsible for trying to steal their ballots was preposterous.  Just spend any time with them and you'd understand.  We had a, we had quite an experience defending that case.  We had some local counsel, some of whom were just incredibly colorful and interesting.  We spent weeks and weeks on dirt roads in Perry County [Alabama] trying to find witnesses and trying to make them comfortable with telling us their stories and preparing our defense in the wake of what felt at the time like very much a hostile U.S. attorney and a hostile judge.  We tried that case for about three weeks' time.  We got a not guilty verdict on all counts.  And when the jury announced their verdict, the courtroom was absolutely packed with people from the community who had found their voice in the course of this defense.  And people just burst into song.  And the judge kept trying to get order, and they were just singing hymns at that.  I'll never forget it.  So we came downstairs singing and, and crying and, and whatnot.  We gave the last interviews to the press (laughter), and then we got out of town as fast as we could.
Speaker 1: Now, how--
Speaker 2: It was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: --how old was that case?
Speaker 2: How old--
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, had--
Speaker 2: --was that case?
Speaker 1: --it gone, the case was originally, I mean--
Speaker 2: The criminal prosecution, let's see, I think we would have tried that in maybe '85 [1985].  So it would have been filed I think in '80--maybe '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Now, at the point that you're in the Legal Defense Fund, I mean, what is the organization like at that point?  I mean how many lawyers?  What was--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  There were probably about twenty of us, but I'm not sure, between the New York [New York], and there was a [Washington] D.C. office.
Speaker 1: And how were cases handed out?
Speaker 2: The--frequently it was a kind of an over the transom thing, but there was a network of cooperating attorneys around the country.  And they kept their eye out for--well, indeed, these lawyers were themselves involved on a day-to-day basis with civil rights litigation, primarily in the South but not exclusively, and they would call in LDF when they need resources.  So, through that network, cases came in usually to the head of the practice group.  So for the voting rights practice group they came into Lani.  For the housing practice group they came into someone else.  And then, and then cases would get assigned.  And you know, frequently we were looking to develop a particular legal concept to deepen it or to get some clarity around it.  It was a very strategic program.
Story_ID: 227016
Speaker 1: Now you wouldn't consider your, would you consider yourself an activist at this point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: No, I'm just--
Speaker 1: --no, but you were--
Speaker 2: --a lawyer?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, but you were committed to social causes.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You saw that, okay.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, why did you choose the [NAACP] Legal Defense [and Educational] Fund [Inc. (LDF)] versus a law firm?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the Legal Defense Fund still is probably the preeminent civil rights law firm.  And it's not a--you know, one--you say why did I choose LDF?  It's more that I was fortunate that LDF chose me.  It's hard to get a job there, didn't pay very much money.  I would (laughter) say of that time in our lives, Diane [Bemus Patrick] was working at a big firm [O'Melveny and Myers LLP, New York, New York] downtown.  She had money, and I had funds, so we had a wonderful combination in that sense.  And also the training was extraordinary because you got so much experience so fast.  I was out of [Harvard] Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] a year and a half I think when I had my first appellate, federal appellate court argument.  I had appeared in, I'd tried cases in federal district court.  I appeared and written any number of briefs in federal appellate courts.  I'd been in the [U.S.] Supreme Court and so on.  By the time I left LDF after three years and joined a private law firm [Hill and Barlow, Boston, Massachusetts], I had considerably more practical litigation experience than most of the associates and some of the partners at that firm.
Story_ID: 227017
Speaker 1: Now you had clerked for Judge [Stephen] Reinhardt, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And how did the clerking, how did that experience, clerking, differ from the experience?  'Cause you're in the court, I mean court there, but how did that experience differ from working for LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well, the clerking experience is much more, particularly at an appellate level, is much more isolated.  I mean what, the beauty of working with Judge Reinhardt is that he is keenly aware of the human dimension of the problems that come before him.  And so he is constantly challenging us as we were thinking about and helping him think about the cases, about what is happening to the people whose names are listed as litigants in the case.  And again, there's a tremendous lesson in that, not to over intellectualize the role of courts.  At LDF, we were right there with the litigants, you know, elbow to elbow with them.  We weren't in the role of making the decision.  We were in the role of advocating for a particular individual or a particular group of individuals and for a particular cause and frequently under-resourced in doing so.  So it was a different kind of effort, required a different kind of skill.  But I think the thing I learned from Judge Reinhardt, one of the things I learned from Judge Reinhardt was how important it was, even though we were working in, as it were, at LDF in the cause of civil rights to remember that there were human beings who were looking for the resolution of some problem and for some sense that they had been heard and that there was a justice in the outcome.
Story_ID: 227018
Speaker 1: What did you learn about lawyering also at LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc.]?  Did you--you know, because it's one thing to, you know, textbook and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, another thing, as you said, working as a clerk.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I learned at LDF, and I think probably most trial lawyers would say this once out in practice, that there's a lot more creativity that you can bring to the task than you might think.  There is precedent, and that is important, and indeed, we know from the training how important legal precedent is.  We also know how fundamentally conservative the practice of law is because it's so backward looking, because you're always looking to what's been done before.  But sometimes when you engage with an adversary, sometimes it's really about sorting out a problem.  Sometimes it's about realigning the power relationship between the adversaries.  And precedent enables you to start that engagement perhaps.  But sometimes the solution lies outside the precedent, and it's a more lasting solution for those parties.  Now, there are other cases where you need a decision on the record books for precedential reasons, so solving the problem doesn't lend itself to the same range of creativity.  But I think that the, I learned at LDF that there were some wonderful things you could do if you could get the other side to sit down with you, and hear you, and reflect back that you hear them, and try to find a place where the interests overlap.
Story_ID: 227019
Speaker 1: Now, what was the case that you were most proud of that you worked on or was the most interesting at LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, well, there are three (laughter).  I remember once there was a case in Alabama where I was asked to represent a fellow who was on death row.  He had an execution date by the state.  They were in a great rush to get on with it.  We found local counsel in Montgomery [Alabama] who was able to file in the state court a habeas corpus petition to try to get a hearing and to question really some questions about, some issues about the quality of the defense representation, including a defense lawyer who had been asleep at the lawyer's table during some of the trial.  That flew through the Alabama courts.  They just weren't interested in it.  And it got to the district court, federal district court, and there was a famous old, mean district judge who agreed to have a hearing.  And I couldn't get there for the hearing, but he was willing to let me participate by phone.  I remember he got on the phone, and he said, "Now, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Deval L.] Patrick," he said, "don't you just think there are some people who ought to die?"  And I said, "Your Honor, more than that I think we're all gonna die sooner or later," I said, "but that's not what this is about.  This is about whether his trial was fair.  Let's talk about that," and so he gave him a stay.  And at this point, mind you, this individual had had his head shaved, had been given his last meal.  He was in the holding cell about to go into the chamber for, into the death chamber.  So it's probably within an hour and half of execution that we got a stay.  We did some discovery, and we were, and again, because we persuaded the judge to let us do some discovery, we got a hold of the prosecutor's file.  And there in the file was a sworn statement by a witness positively identifying someone else as the killer.  And you know, either that statement had never been turned over to the defense attorney, in which case it was prosecutorial misconduct, or it had been turned over to the defense attorney, and he never used it, in which case it was ineffective assistance of counsel.  Either way, there was a constitutional problem here.  And that judge vacated not just the sentence but the conviction.  And this from a guy who was within, you know, as I say, minutes, maybe ninety minutes or so of being executed.  I felt very proud of that outcome and again, also very sad about what it said about the administration of the death penalty 'cause we saw that over and over again.  The voting rights case [Bill Clinton et. al. v. M.C. Jeffers et. al., 1989] in Arkansas that I refer to, where Governor Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was a named defendant, this was a class of, a defense class of county clerks, had to do with access to registration.  And we settled that in, on terms that ultimately turned into the terms for the Motor Voter Act [National Voter Registration Act of 1993] when President Clinton became president.  So, some of the features of how to simplify registration were then imported into federal legislation later on when, when Clinton moved up, and that was, I feel very proud of about that as well.
Speaker 1: And the third one?
Speaker 2: And the third one was that criminal prosecution I told you about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and some--
Speaker 1: Now, how did you end up--you spent three years there, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And in the meantime, in that process, you have one daughter, right?
Speaker 2: While we [Patrick and Patrick's wife, Diane Bemus Patrick] were there--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --we had one daughter--
Speaker 1: One daughter, okay.
Speaker 2: --our first daughter, yes, Sarah [Patrick].
Speaker 1: Sarah, okay.
Speaker 2: Right--
Story_ID: 227020
Speaker 1: How is the decision made to go to Hill and Barlow [Boston, Massachusetts]?  Who's pushing that at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, we both [Patrick and Patrick's wife, Diane Bemus Patrick] were.  We had, when Sarah [Patrick] was born we were both working like crazy.  And we just couldn't figure out how to stay in New York [New York] and be the kind of parents we wanted to be.  It was so expensive, and there was--and the pace of professional life in New York was so extreme it felt to us that we wanted to try something else.  And we didn't want to move to one of those suburbs in New York and have a forty-five-minute commute into town.  But we didn't want to be too far from New York because Diane's family is there.  So we looked in Washington [D.C.] and at Boston [Massachusetts], decided on Boston, reconnected with some friends there who said you really ought to look at Hill and Barlow, it's, including the Vorenbergs [James Vorenberg and Betty Vorenberg], who thought that it was the firm whose personality was most welcoming for someone like me with my interests and was able to get an offer and stayed there through becoming partner.  And it was a good experience.  And then I had--the firm was supportive of my pro bono work.  I spent about a third of my time on pro bono work.
Speaker 1: Was that unusual for the firm, or did they pride themselves on that--
Speaker 2: The firm had a real tradition of public service and pro bono work.  I think it was unusual to spend quite as much as I did but certainly have been a number of people who had distinguished themselves in the bar through their public service and pro bono work.
Speaker 1: Had you negotiating that going in?
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean just that, you know, the firm sort of boasted about its public interest past, and so I undertook to hold them to it.
Speaker 1: Were there any other African Americans at the firm at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact, one of my best friends was a partner when I came in as an associate.  He's now a federal judge, Reginald [C.] Lindsay.  And he was--you may, do you know Reg from--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --law school days?
Speaker 1: --I have never--
Speaker 2: He would've been ahead of you.
Speaker 1: --met him, but I've talked to him on the phone, and I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's somebody you ought to interview.  Yeah, he's a very special guy.  And we spent a lot of time together on matters and also as friends.  And I think he was the first, I'm sure he was the first black partner.  He may have been the first black associate.
Speaker 1: So were there, was it just the two of you, or how many (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there were others.  There was another associate.  I mean there were others behind me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: There was another associate, Stephanie Lovell, who is now the first assistant to the attorney general in Massachusetts, and other associates who came and went.  There was a man [HistoryMaker Theodore C. Landsmark] who, if you remember from the busing crisis in Boston, there's a very famous photograph of a black man being jabbed with an American flag.  That man was a lawyer at Hill and Barlow, was, well he's not there--
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: --anymore.
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot, but I think--
Speaker 2: I'm having another senior moment.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, no problem.  You've done well.  So, when you got to the firm, this is a difference, I mean a different--so how long did it take you to sort of feel your way?  I mean your--unless your wife was helping mentor you.  Did she--
Speaker 2: No.  I mean we had--I knew firms from my, private law firms from my--
Speaker 1: Your internships.
Speaker 2: --summers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We worked with private law firms as cooperating attorneys at [NAACP] Legal Defense [and Educational] Fund [Inc.].  I think that, you know, the income was different (laughter), that's for sure.  Some of the social stuff was different.  But it was on the whole an environment that was familiar to me from other settings including Milton Academy [Milton, Massachusetts] for that matter.
Story_ID: 227021
Speaker 1: You're at Hill and Barlow [Boston, Massachusetts].  Now, you're active also in the community too.
Speaker 2: Trying to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, but is it, the whole path to partnership?  Was it, did you get there on the first try?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Obviously, it was, the issue, the only issue with Hill and Barlow was how much credit I was gonna get for the experience I've had before I came to Hill and Barlow.  So I came in I guess as a, I would have been a, what, fifth-year associate, something like.  I'd been out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] four years at that point.  And they had just changed from a, I think an eight-year partnership track to a nine-year partnership track, so there was a question about, you know, is there some minimum amount of time I needed to be at the firm.  But I made it, I made it on time, and it was a unanimous vote.  Life, you know, you wanna be a partner because there's a certain recognition in that, and there is a different kind of opportunity, financial and otherwise, in that.  But the transition from associate to partner is a little more shocking than you think, particularly at Hill and Barlow in those days because all of the guaranteed income, the salary is gone (laughter).  And it's, and you start, frequently new partners at Hill and Barlow made less than they did the year before as senior associates.  So trying to figure out how to manage and succeed on the business-getting side of a partnership was a real challenge for me, something I wasn't entirely prepared for, but I did all right; I did all right.
Speaker 1: Well that's good, 'cause I knew a lot of people talk about that, you know, that it's sort of the prized possession.  And they get there, and a lot of people are not necessarily gonna get any clients--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or don't feel comfortable--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in that way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what do you think allowed you to do okay in that?  And how did you sort of figure that out, and--
Speaker 2: You mean the business-getting part?
Speaker 1: The business-getting part.
Speaker 2: I teamed up with others.  First of all, I knew a lot of people.  I wasn't shy about asking.  You know, the shyness I talked about on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] I'd pretty much gotten over.  I had some presence in the community, so matters came to me that way.  But I, you know, the other thing is, you know, I'd team up with others, with other partners.  I knew they were concerned about the same thing, and we'd go in and pitch ourselves as a team.  Reg [Reginald C. Lindsay] and I did it a couple of times, and other partners and I did it.  And I'm also quite easy sharing.  So if there's something that comes for which I don't have or didn't have a particular expertise, I had no problem giving that to somebody who did and trying to bring ourselves forward as a whole firm serving the clients.  I think that was actually one issue.  That behavior was not customary at Hill and Barlow and may have been an issue in its, in the firm's ultimate demise just a couple of years ago.
Story_ID: 227022
Speaker 1: At the firm [Hill and Barlow, Boston, Massachusetts], you're doing both plaintiffs and defendants.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that's a difference.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, because--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --up to this point you've been on the plaintiff's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it's--
Speaker 1: I mean, well, what about--
Speaker 2: Except for the criminal defense work I had done, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but more often carrying the burden rather than not, right.
Speaker 1: So, was there any defendant work that you particularly found distasteful or--
Speaker 2: No, I knew they were out there, but I didn't have the cases that really made me ashamed.  Again, I came to most of the work I did at Hill and Barlow as a problem-solver, and I think that's what my clients appreciated about me.  And for most problems there are two sides to the story.  And again, part of what is interesting and engaging for me about the practice of law is trying to figure out where that overlap is, because a solution really usually lies in where the interests coincide.
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything about the Hill and Barlow experience that you felt changed you or that you learned a great deal from, that prepared you for--
Speaker 2: I think probably I learned--I mean it was a good firm with a great tradition, as I said earlier, of public service.  I think I learned more about institutional or office politics at Hill and Barlow than I had learned before then.  I learned about some of the classic debates around partnership and about hiring associates and some of the comments repeated in all kinds of settings about what's a risk and what isn't a risk, in terms of the, who you bet on, the preference for people who graduated from schools like I graduated from rather than somebody every bit as capable and maybe hungrier from a nontraditional school that might, for example, enhance the diversity of the firm and the notion that you were taking a risk on that person when you'd had any number of people from Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] who turned out to be fools and whom you'd had to let go.  It's just those, there are patterns, those are patterns I've seen replicated in all kinds of institutional discussions.  And I learned, I began to learn about them in that context.
Speaker 1: Now, how did the--so, what I'm wanting to understand about, you were there eight years.  You became partner halfway through that time period, and you continued to be active with the NAACP Legal Defense [and Educational] Fund [Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but you know, in Boston [Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right?
Story_ID: 227023
Speaker 1: How did the assistant attorney general position come into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Come about?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what I think (laughter) happened, but you never know all the machinations behind the scenes.  When President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton was elected, there was a commission set up in Massachusetts to identify a U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts.  And one of the members of the commission said that I ought to throw my hat in the ring.  Senator [Edward "Ted"] Kennedy was to manage this process, and he set up a bipartisan group to identify candidates and send him I think two or three finalists.  I was I think thirty-five at the time, and I thought, you know, I'm too young (laughter) to be a United States attorney.  But a couple of members of the commission said, "No, you should try this.  I think you'd be right."  And I had been, as I, as you said, active in the community.  People knew my reputation as a lawyer and my interest in public issues.  So I threw my hat in, and I got, to the surprise of everybody, through the first cut.  And then they had me back, and they decided to send me forward as one of three finalists.  And the newspaper was reporting that it was really a contest between me and one other guy [Donald K. Stern].  And I was astonished (laughter).  Everybody else was astonished because, you know, the other guy was, probably fifteen years older than I, and very politically connected, a good lawyer, and good person, and here was this upstart.  Well, we, the three finalists then went down to meet with Senator Kennedy.  And I'd never met him before.  I've been near him before, because there were Kennedys at Milton Academy [Milton, Massachusetts], and I would see him come through, but I never met him.  And we sat in the little hideaway, his little hideaway in the [U.S.] Senate.  We had a wonderful conversation, getting to know each other over a couple of hours.  And he was as, he seemed as impressed with my getting to that stage in the competition as I was surprised.  And I said to him, "You know what, Senator," I said, "I can do this job.  I'm ready for this job, but it's okay if I don't get it, 'cause I'll get another turn; it'll be all right."  And I think he was a little relieved with that.
Story_ID: 227024
Speaker 1: In any event, during all this time--this is now through the spring of '93 [1993]--Lani had been, [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier had been nominated for the assistant attorney general position at [U.S. Department of] Justice, which is what everyone expected.  Everyone who knew the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and knew Lani expected that she would get the job.  Now, you know, Diane [Bemus Patrick], my wife, had gone to school with Lani.  I had worked with Lani [at NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  Having now done the job--and Lani and I have talked about this--she would have hated the job.  But she was treated in a shabby way, and so her nomination was withdrawn at about the point that I learned that someone else [Donald K. Stern] was gonna be the U.S. attorney.  But the exposure didn't hurt me at all.  If anything, my sort of stature in the firm [Hill and Barlow, Boston, Massachusetts] went up.  I think what happened is that Senator [Edward "Ted"] Kennedy, after Lani's name was withdrawn, and you know, mind you, a lot of us were furious.  Senator Kennedy talked with Janet Reno about this guy from Boston [Massachusetts].  And by the end of that year, they had tried to nominate someone else, and for various reasons that didn't work out.  And we're coming onto the first anniversary of the president's inauguration, and he still didn't have a civil rights chief.  Right before Christmas I got a call from a former Judge [Stephen] Reinhardt clerk, co-clerk of mine, who was working in the justice department.  And he said we had been told to go back to the drawing board, and somebody said, "What about that guy in Boston with the funny name?"  And he said, "You have to be talking about [HistoryMaker] Deval [L. Patrick].  I don't know if he'd be interested, but let me call and find out."  So he called me, and I said, as many of us, again, who were friends of Lani reacted, I said, maybe, but only if he's serious and only if he's willing to take the heat.  So, my wife and I and our kids [Sarah Patrick and Katherine Patrick] went off on a Christmas holiday, and we came back, and there was a call from the justice department - would you mind coming down and having a conversation with us?  So I came down, and I, we went through the vetting and all that and these hilarious questions they ask you, you know: do you have a housekeeper, and do you pay that person?  Do you withhold for Social Security?  And stuff like that.  Eventually, I met Janet Reno, and we hit it off immediately.  And then, you know, on a subsequent visit or two, they took me around to the, to the White House [Washington, D.C.] to meet the staff, spent a lot of time with George Stephanopoulos talking about it and so on.  And I kept asking the question: what does the president want to do with this position?  What does he want to accomplish?  Because if it's just a placeholder, I'm not, I'm not interested.  And the response kept coming back: vigorous enforcement of civil rights.  And I, and since it came back so many ways, so many times that way, I thought to myself, that's a pretty big opening for me to give it shape.  And as long as they will stand by the vigorous part, I think I can make this work.  So the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] holiday was coming up in January.  This is now '94 [1994].  And the president had an appearance at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] that he was gonna do on King Day, and the White House was closing in on me.  They hadn't committed to me yet, but they were closing in.  They hadn't finished the background check.  And they said we would like to announce our intention to nominate you at this event over, over King weekend.  And the way that--this is a technical distinction, but it's a meaningful one, nomination means that a packet of materials has been taken from the White House and delivered to the clerk of the [U.S.] Senate.  An intention to nominate is when somebody says I'm going to nominate; the president says I'm going to nominate what's her name for such and such position.  And what happens in that interstice is that the press and all the commentators and all of the advocates begin to weigh in.  So there is an impression that is formed fast, even before the actual nomination, which has all the facts in it, shows up at the Senate.  And that's a lot of what happened to Lani.  So, I said, no, I wasn't gonna do that.  I said, "You know, I appreciate it.  I'm interested in the job, I think, but the president needs to decide that I'm it before he says anything publicly."  And they said, "Well, no, you know we, he can't go up to Howard and not have something to say.  It's been a year."  And I said, (laughter) "Sorry, that's not my problem, not gonna do that; finish the background check.  If it works out, it works out."  Around that point, it began to leak that I might be a, a candidate, but it'd been pretty close held, and the whole process was going quite fast at that point.  Early February they said come on down for some more meetings, and I did.  And then they said we'd like to make an announcement two days out.  The president is gonna nominate you.  The papers are ready.  Have your family come down, but have them come by train because the reporters watch the airport.  So, and then (laughter), and George Stephanopoulos said make sure your wife brings your kids because it'll make you look older (laughter).  That was so funny.  So, they came down, Diane and the girls.  And they took all the furniture out of the Oval Office, had the White House press corps come into the Oval Office.  And the president, and the vice president [Al Gore], and the attorney general and I, and my wife and kids came in, and they made this announcement--
Story_ID: 227025
Speaker 1: The next day--and it's, this is more than you asked, but the next day--and it really, it taught me so much about how things work in Washington [D.C.] and how skillful, frankly, [Senator Edward] "Ted" Kennedy is.  It's wonderful to have him on your side.  He called the White House [Washington, D.C.] that afternoon, and he said, "I want [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Deval L.] Patrick in the [U.S.] Senate, in the cloakroom at ten o'clock the next morning."  And he said the reason for that was that they were having a vote, and he wanted me to meet as many senators as possible as they were coming off the floor.  And he said to the White House, "You need to understand it's a lot harder for people to blast someone they've actually shaken hands with and looked them in the eye."  So he brought me up, and the White House took me up there the next morning.  And then he put me in the, there's a ceremonial office for the vice president, right off the Senate floor, and he put me, standing in there on this mosaic floor.  And I must have met sixty or seventy senators for, you know, just a minute.  They'd come in and shake hands and say hello, and good luck, and hope it works out, including most of the members of the judiciary committee.  And the president took me out--I mean then Senator Kennedy took me out into the hall.  And he had called a press conference, and he said nice things about me.  And along comes [Senator] Orrin Hatch.  And Hatch and Kennedy are actually quite good friends.  And so the cameras are running, and Ted Kennedy says, "Orrin, come on over and meet Deval."  All this is happening while the cameras are running.  I shake his hand, and I said I hope I can count on your support.  And he said I've read about you.  You seem, he said you seem like a good guy.  And so the press then reports that as, Hatch gives his tentative endorsement.  And the rest of it, you know, was just making the rounds and going through the--one of the most suspenseful, and amusing, and interesting processes was going through that whole process of getting confirmed.  And I was confirmed, and it was a heck of a ride (laughter).
Speaker 2: How long did it take you to get confirmed?  How long was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) See, I was nominated, nominated in early February, and I was confirmed in mid-March I think.
Speaker 2: Well, that's qui--because what, I mean to put this in historical context, [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton had a lot of prob- you know, because it was a Republican controlled--
Speaker 1: Not then.
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't?
Speaker 1: Not then, not then.  The control changed.  At that time, [Joseph "Joe"] Biden was chair of the senate judiciary committee [U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary].  The control changed at the November elections that year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it hadn't yet.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But had you learned, was [HistoryMaker] Lani [Guinier] at all consulting you?  Had you learned from that whole--I mean the one thing about, okay, don't announce an intent--you know, you have to make a decision?  Was that a learned lesson that you--or that was just you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was me, but it was from watching.  You know, I hadn't appreciated that there was something different between the announcement and the actual nomination, that the nomination was taking this packet of materials up to the Senate, and the amount of effort that goes into preparing that packet of materials, which, again, is fact-based as opposed to all the spin and so forth out in the press.  You know, I wasn't looking for the job, so, and I wasn't looking to make a career of life in Washington.  I was interested in the subject matter.  I was interested in the opportunity.  I thought I had something I could contribute.  I was ready to do something else, something, something new.  But I wasn't so invested in it that I would have been disappointed if it didn't work out.
Story_ID: 227026
Speaker 1: So that happens, and that takes you into a whirlwind--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --[Washington] D.C., you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And can you describe that?
Speaker 2: Well, official D.C., official Washington is different from Washington.  It's its own bubble.  You are always on.  You're really never, never off duty.  And then the particular position I had was, instead of the civil rights division, is because of our past and because some of our, because of our present, a uniquely politically charged assignment.  So I had a tremendous amount of access to the White House [Washington, D.C.] for a sub-cabinet officer.  And I had a wonderful boss in Janet Reno in the sense that she didn't feel like she had to be the buffer between me and the White House.  So, as long as I kept her informed, I was responsible for civil rights enforcement for that government.  And so the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] would call, and he's a night owl anyway.  He'd call in the middle of the night because he had something on his mind and so on.  You know, the symbolic part of the job, what I would describe as my role, as prop, where you had to show up at certain places and just stand behind the president.  And you didn't have a speaking role.  You just had to be there.  That was a part of the job that, you know, had its own set of amusements and so on.  The substantive part of the job was absolutely fascinating, was I had fabulous people to work with.  I learned to respect the talent, and the sacrifice, and the creativity of the career people, the folks at the, a lot of politicians refer to, dismissively as the bureaucrats, just how good they were.  We had some very, very hard problems to deal with.  It ranged from the church arson crisis to the, some of the fair lending work we did, where I think we made a real difference.  We got swept up in the affirmative action debate, and not because affirmative action is on the regular diet of the enforcement, in the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], but as an in itself, but just because it became a political tool.  And they needed some place with some experience with it to help formulate policy.  So we spent a lot of time with, with the president, and the vice president [Al Gore], and the White House staff on that as well.  It was really, really something.  And then, again, there are things that make you, they just make you smile.  They make you, they just seem so improbable.  Every time I walked into the West Wing or sat in the Oval Office, and the president would turn to me and said, "What do you think?"  I'd think to myself, "Good grief (laughter), what--I'm from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois]."
Story_ID: 227027
Speaker 1: First time I rode on Air Force One, I remember it was the night after--oh, this is a, it's a wonderful story.  My first motorcade--I was talking about that part of the job, my life as prop, my role as prop--I got a call saying you have to come and go with the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] to Gallaudet College [sic. Gallaudet University, Washington, D.C.] because he's giving the commencement address there in Washington [D.C.].  And Gallaudet is a school for the hearing impaired.  And we enforced the Americans with Disabilities Act [of 1990] in the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice].  So I was just supposed to be there, that's all.  And so I came to the White House [Washington, D.C.], and I was taken into, I was escorted through the West Wing and into the residence to the, I think it's called the Diplomatic Reception Room, which is the room on the south side, right by the driveway and on the ground level.  And I can see through the glass doors the seal on the side of the president's car.  So I said, wow, I must be riding with the president.  This is gonna be cool.  No one else in the room but me and this aide, and I said, "Do you know where I'm supposed to ride?"  He said, "No, they just said, bring you here and wait."  So, we're standing there.  You know, the president's chronically late.  And there was, suddenly the, the seal on the side of that car begins to glide away.  (Laughter) I think I missed my ride, and so I said, "What's going on?"  So the aide disappears and comes back running breathless and says the president is leaving from the Oval Office rather than the residence, so they've moved the motorcade down.  But you have to get out there right now because he's about to go.  So we go out, outside.  Mind you, no one else has been in this room but the aide and me.  We go outside, and all these cars, they're full of people.  I don't where these people came from, but they're all full of people.  And I said, "Well, where am I supposed to ride?"  And she said, "Well, run up there and ask that guy," she said, pointing toward one of the Secret Service.  And I said to her: "I'm from the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  I don't run toward nobody with no gun," (laughter).  That's not wise.  And she said, "Oh, well, let me go find out," so she went off and tried to sort it out.  And they came back, she came back with a message saying, you were going to ride with the president, but he's gonna be lobbying on some legislation on the way up there on the phone and there's a regulation that no justice department people can be present during political activities.  So I hopped in one of the staff cars and off we go.  It's a great way to get around, you know, no lights; it's fabulous.  We zoom up to Gallaudet College; we come around to the back.  Everybody jumps out of the cars, and they're running.  You know, the press is running, and the staff is running.  The president is strolling into the kitchen door.  And I don't know what I'm supposed to do, where I'm supposed to be, what to do, nothing.  One of the aides comes and grabs my elbow and says, "You gotta get up here with the president so you can be in the picture."  So he hustles me along, so I'm kind of trailing behind the president, pandemonium everywhere--
Story_ID: 227028
Speaker 1: The faculty's all lined up in the kitchen to process out to the graduation [at Gallaudet University, Washington, D.C.].  And the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] starts shaking hands, one at a time, every single faculty member's hand.  Still don't know what I'm supposed to do, so the aide says, "Come stand down here," and she puts me down at the end of the receiving line.  The president shakes the last hand, and then turns.  And the aide says, "Mr. President, here's [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Deval L.] Patrick."  And the president says, "Oh, Deval."  He said, "I hoped you would be here."  And then at just that moment somebody else says, "Right this way, Mr. President."  They hold open the doors to the men's room.  So he strolls, strides into the men's room.  There are two Secret Service on the other side of the door.  And just as the door is closing, he grabs the door, and he looks out at me, and says, (finger motions to come here).  So in he goes and I go; it's just the two of us in the men's room.  He's at the urinal.  He starts talking to me, and he says, look.  He said, "I've got this vacancy on the [U.S.] Supreme Court," he says, "and I've got to fill it."  And I said, "Oh yeah, I've been reading about that."  And he said "Well, I'm down to three finalists, but I'm really only focused on two of 'em.  And I want to ask you," he said, "you know this guy, [Justice Stephen] Breyer, don't you?"  And I said, "Oh yeah, I've known him for years.  I've worked with him.  I've appeared before him and so on."  He said, "Well, what do you think?  Would he do a good job?"  And I said, "Mr. President, I think he'd be a fine, a fine justice.  And I think, frankly, he'd be great on our stuff in the civil rights division because he's fair and because he's respectful of precedent."  And I said, "And I'd be proud to say that publicly if that's what you need."  I said, "But sir, if you're asking me, (laughter) I'd say you've already made up your mind."  He said, "No, no, I've really gotta decide."  So, he said, "But I'd heard you'd say good things about Breyer, but I'm struggling."  And he began to talk about some of the others that he was thinking about, including about a judge from Arkansas, federal judge from Arkansas.  And at that point, the valet had come in with his cap and his gown and was getting him together.  And I said, "Well, Mr. President, I'll just give you some advice."  I said, "If you do choose Judge Breyer, say to the press why you chose Judge Breyer, not why you didn't choose the other ones who are being speculated about.  The press, the public doesn't need to know your whole reasoning.  Just focus on him."  He said, "Well, that's good advice."  Of course, he didn't take it, but that's good advice.  So off we go.  He does the procession.  He finishes the speech.  We all pile back into the cars, get back to the White House [Washington, D.C.], and then I have to hustle off to the airport because I had something in Boston [Massachusetts] that night.  And I'm coming from the airport through the tunnel, and the radio is on in the taxi.  It's about five o'clock, and the, and the announcer says we interrupt the broadcast to go to the White House South Lawn for a special announcement.  And the president says I'm pleased to announce the nomination, my intent to nominate Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court.  I thought, oh my goodness (laughter), this just happened.  So, I had to get back to Washington [D.C.] that night because the next day, the next morning, I was going with the president to I think it was Indianapolis [Indiana].  So, I go out to Andrews [Air Force Base; Joint Base Andrews, Maryland], up to Air Force One.  These are all first experiences for me.  And Air Force One is a series of sort of living rooms.  And I'm given a seat in one of these living rooms, and there are TV monitors all around the walls.  And it's all broadcasting news about Stephen Breyer's nomination.  The plane starts to move, which means the president gets on.  You have to be on beforehand, and as soon as he's on it starts going.  And he comes striding into this living room where I am.  And of course, I'm the only one in my seatbelt with my tray table in its upright position, and my (laughter) seatbelt locked.  Everybody else is walking around.  The plane's moving.  And he comes in, and he shakes my hand.  And he points up at the monitor, and he says, "You see that, Deval?"  He said, "You did that."  And I thought, wow.

Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So we were talking about the church--I want you to talk about the church arsons.
Speaker 1: Well, what we had, and what was called to our attention, in large part by a coalition of black ministers who came to Washington [D.C.] and met with the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] and with the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], was a rash of attacks on mostly small, mostly rural black churches, and mostly in the South, although not exclusively.  And there were, there was concern whether there was a nationwide or least a southern-wide conspiracy.  There was obvious concern that this was, in effect, a terrorist act; it was a way to terrify communities.  And it was having exactly that effect.  There are always churches that catch on fire, but this was a unique spike.  And there was concern about whether local authorities were up to these kinds of investigations and indeed, whether the federal authorities were giving them their due.  So they came to ask for more resources, and they came to ask that it be taken seriously, and that the investigation be robust.  They, we ultimately convened a church arson taskforce [National Church Arson Task Force].   And myself and Jim Johnson [James E. Johnson], who was responsible at [U.S. Department of the] Treasury, among other things, for the ATF, for the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division.  We co-chaired that taskforce, and we assembled through the ATF and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] what was then the largest federal investigation in history.  And we spread out all over the South.  We ultimately included attacks on synagogues as well.  And, and it was an extremely difficult, but I think important investigation because, difficult because, you're literally sifting through ash for clues; important because, some of the churches that were being burned were historic slave churches that still had active congregations.  And in every case they were terrorizing communities.  We did find conspiracies, not a nationwide one, not even a region-wide one.  We found conspiracies where there were attacks on a couple of churches.  We found a range of perpetrators as well, some, ranging from teenage hoodlums to organized gangs of racist thugs basically.  And we had a lot of prosecutions, a lot of prosecutions.  And I think it was an example.  I'm sure that arson hasn't gone away, but it was an example of a problem responding to a concerted federal effort.
Speaker 2: So you were able to bring attention to that too--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Story_ID: 227030
Speaker 1: Now affirmative action, that's a different thing because you were sort of, you were forced, your division [U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division] was forced to handle that, right?
Speaker 2: Well, handle it in the sense that we were forced to help, I mean the administration was engaged in the policy question.  And we were part of the debate, and indeed, some of the intellectual guerrilla warfare (laughter) that was going on even within the [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you talk to us about why that had come sort of, you know, what case had brought that sort of front and center?
Speaker 2: Well, there wasn't a case.  It wasn't a single case.  There was, the, in those days, and to some extent now, affirmative action was one of the bugaboos of the right wing.  And you know all of the cliches around it, you know, preferential treatment and reverse discrimination, and so on.  And the, the attraction of the notion of colorblindness was very strong in the country, I think in some respects, still is very appealing in the country, and was a very clever way I think for the right to couch what many of us felt was an effort to protect privilege.  There were those within the administration as well who were afraid that affirmative action was going to be used as a political bludgeon for the president for the Democratic Party.  And there were people in the party who felt that way and not without reason, because the right had done a lot of polling around it.  The language around affirmative action had been hijacked I think in large part by the right.  And there was some, I think, ambivalence on the part of the left, if you will, to defend affirmative action and to be willing to discern between doing affirmative action the right way and the wrong way.  So we had--that was a very, very intense time, both from an intellectual and a political point of view.  The president--I remember I was in Seattle [Washington], and, and I got a call to come, from George [Stephanopoulos], to come back immediately to the White House [Washington, D.C.] because the president wanted to talk about this.  And I did, got back on the red eye and went directly to the White House and, and sat there with the president, the vice president [Al Gore] and just, there were three of us.  And we began to talk about the issue, about what it was, about some of the definitional problems, about some of the ways in which the trend in the courts was against us or was for us, depending on the context, about some of the political considerations around affirmative action.  And then, ultimately, the president decided he wanted a fulsome review of a federal policy.  And then there was, typically, particularly with an issue as radioactive as this one, all kinds of palace intrigue and what have you.  But we worked our way through that, and he ultimately gave a very strong endorsement for the policy of inclusion for the reasons why it was good for the whole country to pursue policies of inclusion in education, and in contracting, and in employment.  And he gave that at a talk at the National Archives [Building, Washington, D.C.], a terrific setting, after really months of intense debate within the government.  And he landed where he had always been, and he really showed leadership.
Story_ID: 227031
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny.  We went, we went--Chris Edley [Christopher Edley, Jr.] was working in the White House [Washington, D.C.] at the time.  He's written a book ['Not All Black and White: Affirmative Action and American Values,' Christopher Edley, Jr.] since about the development of, about that whole process of developing the policy and so on.  And I tease Chris about the book, because the day of the speech--and again, a lot of effort, a lot of nail biting, late nights, arm twisting and so forth had gone into this, a lot of cultivating of support and re-educating people on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] and in various constituencies.  It's time, the next, this day, to announce where the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was gonna come down.  And I got a call from the White House to come up to the White House and ride with the president to the National Archives [Building, Washington, D.C.].  And I said, "You know, you understand I'm across the street from the National Archives in my office.  I can see it from my office."  They said, "No, no, come back up to the White House and ride with him because that's part of the, you know, that's your role as (laughter) prop, in effect."  So I went up to the White House and was shown into the West Wing.  And there are bits and pieces of this draft all over the place.  I mean there are people huddled.  Chris Edley is huddled over one piece of it over here and somebody else over here.  And there have been--you know, to some extent, controlling the speech was controlling the policy outcome.  And so we had been in round after round after round of this speech, and the night before I thought it was done.  So, but what had happened was the president had stayed up late and put a lot of his own personal experiences into the speech, and people were trying to incorporate it and clean it all up.  And he is bounding around in the Oval Office.  Leon Panetta, the chief of staff at the time, was there.  We were forty minutes late.  And the whole cabinet, and the Washington [D.C.] press corps, and the congressional leaders were all sitting in the National Archives waiting for us.  And you know, and this speech is all over the place.  And the president--and there was nothing to do except wait for, nothing for me to do I thought except wait to go.  So I start walking out by the Rose Garden, and this aide comes and says, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Deval L.] Patrick, the president wants you."  So we rush back in, and the, and I said, "Yes sir?"  And he then tells me a joke, and he says, "And what do you think about that, this joke?"  I said, "Mr. President, do you know what time it is (laughter)?"  I said, "We have all these people waiting up here.  We gotta go."  And he said, "You know what, you're right.  I can read my own handwriting."  So they gather up all this, all these bits and pieces.  They try to get it in order.  And he, and I, and the vice president [Al Gore], and Chris, and this speechwriter, Carolyn Curiel, who now works for The New York Times, all start out, you know, with this flurry of other activity, out toward the motorcade.  And again, I still don't know where I'm supposed to ride.  So, I start out toward one of the staff cars, and he grabs my elbow, and he says, "You know what, you've worked too hard on this."  He said, "You ride with me."  So, I get in the president's car with him, the vice president, Chris Edley, and Carolyn Curiel, and we start off to the Archives, where he gave an amazing and unambiguous defense of affirmative action, done the right way.  Chris Edley writes (laughter) in his book--I tease him about it to this day--he writes a book, which is--and he sent it to me and signed it and so on.  And I said Chris--I called him over.  I said Chris, "I am so glad that you have written a definitive account of the development of the president's policy."  And I said--he said, "What do you mean?"  And I said I--no, first said, "Congratulations."  He said, "But I sense a little irony in your voice."  I said "Well, I loved how you started the book with the account of this ride from the White House up to the National Archives."  And I said, "You remember the passage.  You described yourself as riding in the car with the president, with the president, the vice president, and two aides (laughter)."  I said, "Chris, in the absence of your book, I might have labored under the misimpression that I had something to do with the development of the (laughter) president's policy."  He laughed.  He said, "Well, you know, I have to sell books (laughter)."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) See, that's why it's important to write your own book--
Story_ID: 227032
Speaker 1: Those were three intensive years [as assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --almost four, yep.
Speaker 1: Four, and your wife [Diane Bemus Patrick], she comes at first, right, and then goes--
Speaker 2: Right, she and the kids [Sarah Patrick and Katherine Patrick] were down for a year.  They never saw me.  The kids were terribly homesick, especially our youngest.  And (laughter), and then we had, you know, we were never alone.  Like I told you, we were always on.  There was the occasional glamorous evening dinner at the White House [Washington, D.C.] or something like that, which was terrific, but even that was work; you know, you were still having conferences in corners and what have you.  And I remember once we had, we finally got out.  We went out and had dinner, and we had a babysitter that night.  And just all the accumulated frustration, we had a fight.  I mean, no flying china or anything like that, but you would have known there was tension over at that table.  And it was reported on the next day.  And she said, "You know what, that's enough.  I'm going home."  So, she went home, and I commuted for the rest, for the following year and three-quarters or something like that, every weekend, most of that time driving actually 'cause it was cheaper.
Speaker 1: Now, what was, were you burned out after the end of those--you know, 'cause the public life can be really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --taxing, right?
Speaker 2: There's a lot of wear and tear.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's always on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a lot of wear and tear.  I mean it's very exciting.  And we made a lot of progress, and we had a wonderful team.  And we dealt, I think, honorably with some very difficult issues, but I was ready at the end of the first term.  I was ready for a change, and I missed my family.  You know, the kids were getting older, and Diane was working hard.  And I think the kids were beginning to show some of the strain of not getting all the attention they deserved from us.  So, I left.  The president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was gracious.  He tried to talk me into doing other jobs and staying, but I think he understood, and came home and back into private practice--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and started taking out the garbage again.
Speaker 1: And that was a change, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Because it's probably hard.  That's a very heady experience that you had just come out of--
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: --and running--I mean, you had gone from being a partner, which is, you know, to running a whole department.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right--
Story_ID: 227033
Speaker 1: How could the Texaco [Inc.]--how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, around the time I left [U.S. Department of] Justice, Texaco was settling its own large race discrimination case.  And part of the settlement involved the creation of a taskforce, essentially, special masters to the court who would help monitor the implementation of the settlement terms.  And the district judge called and asked whether I would be willing to be named chair of that taskforce, with the support of the parties.  And I'd met the plaintiff's counsel and then came down and met the CEO [Peter Bijur] and the general counsel at Texaco and then ultimately took on that assignment.  I was in Texaco a couple of days, a month, for about two years' time in a five-year tenure for the taskforce, very diverse group of people, about seven of us.  We pulled together very quickly and worked I think extremely well as a team and really helped the company take its, that particular crisis as a platform for change.  And after I'd been at it about two years, coming down for meetings and having materials sent to my office and what have you in Boston [Massachusetts], the CEO asked me if I'd be willing to come inside as general counsel.  And I reflected on that.  I went to talk to the judge about it to make sure that he didn't view it as a conflict.  He spent about fifteen minutes telling me why it wasn't a conflict and forty-five minutes telling me why I should drop everything and do this job; and then talked a lot with Diane [Bemus Patrick] about it, my wife; and then ultimately with the other members of the taskforce and agreed to go inside.  And I hadn't been there I think two months before I learned that we were in off and on negotiations to sell the company to merge with, with another.  And we spent most of the two years--did a lot of things in that time, but most of those two years trying to figure out who our merger partner would be and then ultimately merging the company with Chevron [Corporation].
Speaker 1: Then what were you going to do at that point then?
Speaker 2: Well, I had, I was asked to come to San Francisco [California], which would be the headquarters of the new company--
Speaker 1: Of Chevron?
Speaker 2: --of Chevron/Texaco and be general counsel of the new company.  And I said no for a lot of reasons.  Diane really wasn't ready to move to San Francisco, and I definitely wasn't gonna commute from there.  The CEO at Texaco, the man who brought me into company, was an effective leader on the diversity issues but a difficult man in a lot of ways.  He ultimately didn't move to the new company either, but at the time I didn't know that.  And I thought that there were, you know, other things to do that would be interesting.  Of course, around about this time, I met someone who knew Doug Daft [Douglas N. Daft], who was then the chairman of [The] Coca-Cola [Company, Atlanta, Georgia].  And we were introduced in London [England] and liked each other.  And he was trying to--he was the new CEO and was trying to figure out what a relationship with the general counsel should be, and we talked about that.  And ultimately, he asked if I would come to Coke.  At that point, it wasn't public that we were going to merge with Chevron.  And I couldn't even talk about anything other until we got that deal done.  But once we did, he said okay.  So what are you gonna do?  And then I said well, I'm thinking about Chevron/Texaco.  And he said well, let's get serious, said you really ought to come to Coke and ultimately talked me into it, so.
Speaker 1: So really, Chevron was not a typical GC [general counsel] position because of so much of the sale, involvement of the sale, or was it?
Speaker 2: Well, Texaco was--
Speaker 1: I mean Texaco, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Texaco was unique in the sense that you could spend twenty years as general counsel for a large company, and maybe once, and maybe never have the experience of dealing with a bet-the-company matter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was there for two years, and in the midst of a bet-the-company matter, and worked very closely with the board and with the other executives to affect that transaction and very closely with the leadership over at Chevron.  The CEO and I worked quite well together, and to some extent, we worked more together than our own CEO did with their CEO, because our own CEO really didn't want to sell the company.  It was the board that was pushing really hard.
Speaker 1: So, in that, how large was the legal department that you were--
Speaker 2: At Texaco?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was about, oh, gee, probably about seventy or eighty lawyers worldwide.
Story_ID: 227034
Speaker 1: Okay, and [The] Coca-Cola [Company, Atlanta, Georgia] is how--
Speaker 2: About 160 lawyers worldwide.
Speaker 1: Okay.  See, you know what is interesting, because you go from really, from being--I mean I'm not--you have the public sector, which is its own sort of law firm there.  And that--
Speaker 2: There are about three hundred lawyers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, three--right, okay, okay (laughter).  And is there a difference?  I'm just trying to understand the progression, in terms of your learning curve--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about things.
Speaker 2: Well, I think there are similar demands and skills required for leadership of a large group of professionals.  And I think there are, there are aspects of the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] which were--I'm sorry--there are aspects of Coca-Cola that were very familiar from the justice department in terms of the amount of bureaucracy and the layers and so on and all this sort of palace intrigue for which we were famous at Coke.  I think that the lawyering is quite transferrable.  I mean it's not as mission-driven in private life as it was at, in the justice department.  And I have been, I have learned a thing or two about what motivates people.  For example, I think much of private practice and corporate life operates on the theory that people are motivated by what you pay them and what their fiscal reward might be.  But, in fact, I think human beings need something that's more intangible than that.  It's not that the money doesn't matter.  It's that they need a sense of purpose that is deeper, richer, and ultimately more lasting than the money.  And how to transfer that learning from justice to Texaco, for example, where I think we had that spirit, and then to Coke, where it's been a greater struggle to cultivate that spirit, is a part of what I've been learning--
Story_ID: 227035
Speaker 1: When you came onto, with Texaco, how many African American general counsels were there in the country?
Speaker 2: Gosh, only, I'd say of the Fortune 100, I'm guessing, but I'd say, you know, two or three of us.
Speaker 1: And who were they?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I won't, I, now I've limited myself to the Fortune 100, I'm sure I won't get it right, but there is and was a black general counsel of The New York Times Company [New York, New York].  There is a black general counsel at DuPont [E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Delaware].  I think he was, I think he was there when I--
Speaker 1: I don't think it was.
Speaker 2: You don't think so?
Speaker 1: I don't--
Speaker 2: Maybe not.
Speaker 1: --think there was.  At his--
Speaker 2: Stacey Mobley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't remember.  I know that the fellow was there at The New York Times Company.  There was a general counsel at Comerica Bank [Comerica, Inc., Dallas, Texas].  I'm not sure how big they are, but a black general counsel was there.  I'm not sure I can remember many more.
Speaker 1: So, what, did you feel any sense of pressure at that point or you know, sense of you being sort of among a small--and what that represented, I guess that's what I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was conscious of it, as I think, you know, the board and the CEO [Peter Bijur] were conscious of it when I was brought in.  On the other hand, it's very important to me not to be only that, if you know what I mean.  I'm not interested in any job for figurehead reasons or for symbolic reasons.  And I'm not interest--I don't limit myself, and I don't expect to be limited.  So I, at Texaco, was engaged in everything, and I was very interested in the diversity of the employment and in the integrity of our employment practices and remain very engaged in them.  But I was also engaged in negotiating a major merger between two Fortune 50 companies.  The same has been true at The Coca-Cola Company [Atlanta, Georgia].  But I, yeah, I think--you know, I talked to, you know [HistoryMaker President] Barack Obama.  I talked to Barack--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --about his [U.S.] Senate race and you know, I'm, we're all hopeful that it's gonna work out for him.  He is wise beyond his years anyway, so he doesn't really need this observation from me.  But I told him that in my experience, frequently black people in jobs that black people don't always get end up having a much wider berth of responsibility than is customary for that job.  And I said he should understand that while he is representing the State of Illinois in the Senate, he will be looked to, to represent a variety of constituencies far broader than the Senate, and surprisingly, far broader than black people in other places.  There are a lot of people who place, who look to his election to affirm something hopeful about the American experience; and his in a big way, mine in a smaller way, I know that that was true about being a general counsel of a name brand company.  There are an awful lot of people inside the company and outside of the legal division, and in fact, outside the company, who look to me and my example as reason to hope.  And that, I think, is not--you know, you could feel that as a weight, or instead, you could feel that as a kind of opportunity.  And I, it's the latter that it's the way I've experienced it.
Speaker 1: And you have had success then weighing and balancing, right, I mean that, that larger responsibility, because you are a symbol, and other people have talked about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if I've had success, and that would really be for other people to say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know--I think I've had success in keeping a consciousness about it; let me put it that way.  And for example, I could spend all of my time on the--giving speeches at banquets and stuff like that and accepting awards and what have you, but I have a job to do.  And it's important that I succeed at that job, that I be good at that job, that I be thought of as good at that job, because, frankly, like it or not, if I mess up, somebody somewhere is gonna say it's because of the risk that we took on somebody with that background, and we never should have taken it.  So I'm conscious of that.  On the other hand, there are young people, students, people from outside the company, kids of people who work in the company who are in and out of my office all the time, because they want to come by and talk about their own future, about their own interest in the practice of law, about their own way up.  And, and whatever I can offer them to think about that, and my door is always open to them.
Story_ID: 227036
Speaker 1: Now how, what have you learned though from the Coke [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] experience at, you know, about sort of running an office like that?  What have you learned?
Speaker 2: Well, I rely on, on other people.  If I've learned anything, it's about the importance of surrounding yourself with people who are smarter than you.  And I've had some success with that in all of my assignments, including at Coke.  Coke is a tough assignment.  It's a company, rather unlike Texaco, in the sense that it's been bulletproof for a long, long time, profound changes at hand in the marketplace.  And it's been slow to react.  Now, the marketplace know that, knows that; the investors know that; and frankly, the employees know that, but the leadership has been slow to accept that.  And there's a certain unusually powerful sense of nostalgia that exists at Coke, remembering what I describe as the eighty dollar a share days, and how easy it was to be successful and expand the business and so forth.  And now, you know, tastes have changed.  The populations and our markets change.  We are active in more countries than there are members of the United Nations [U.N.].  This is a truly global business, but it's only been that way for a little while.  We make 70 percent of our money outside the United States, but we still have a very US-centric, in fact, I'd even say Atlanta-centric headquarters.  So how all those issues play out, how you think about success in the future as being fueled by something other than just the fumes of the past, how you come in laterally in a senior position in a company that is historically, whose executive ranks have historically been quite closed and whose culture is quite inward looking, those have been enormous challenges at, at Coke.  And I leave with many, many friends and allies some important accomplishments--
Story_ID: 227037
Speaker 1: So what next?  What are you, what are you thinking of next?
Speaker 2: Well, we'll see.  I'm talking to a couple of companies about going inside either as general counsel or CEO.  I want to be closer to home, either back in Boston [Massachusetts] or at least back in the Northeast.
Speaker 1: I do want you though to talk about what makes a successful general counsel.  What do you, what are the skillsets, because it's not an area that we have, you know, we're still learning in that.  And so, what makes that--I think you alluded to, it's very important to have a good relationship with your CEO.
Speaker 2: It's very important to have a good relationship with the CEO.  It's also very important to remember that your client is not the CEO.  It's the shareholders, and you ultimately report to the board of directors.  And so managing all of those relationships is important.  I think the other thing that's important is to think of yourself not just as a technician but as a counselor, which is to say you can buy expertise on any given legal problem.  But the choices that a corporation makes with those legal options has an awful lot to do with judgment.  And the best general counsels are the ones whose judgment is sought about which choice to make.  And in my case, I think it's very important, and I feel this way about all my assignments, is not to forget what to do and indeed, what is the right thing to do.  We learn, I think, fundamentally, you know, when we're kids a sense about the difference between right and wrong.  And I'm not just talking about the obvious things, rape, pillage, and murder and so forth.  I mean there are a whole variety of situations where your gut tells you that's the wrong way to go; this is the right way to go.  If I'm making these choices, even though that one might be the most immediately valuable, it might be the most immediately rewarding, the right way is a different way.  And I think being willing to say of the choices, the best choice is the right choice, and this is the one, being able to appreciate that you don't have to leave your conscience at the door just because you go inside of a corporation.  I think those are the kinds of attributes that make, that distinguish between good general counsel and really great general counsel.
Speaker 1: And there are different types of general counsel.  There are the ones that, the, maybe the institution thinks that they should be just technicians.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then there're others where you are sort of not line, you know, I won't say line item, but you are more involved in the business making.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, and frankly, I've never been in or seen a situation where a general counsel who wanted to be a business partner wasn't let in.  You know, it's a--so I wouldn't accept that whatever the pattern is before you become the general counsel has to be your pattern.
Story_ID: 227038
Speaker 1: Can you comment a little bit about--well, first, I should ask about the minority business, Minority Corporate Counsel Association [(MCCA), Washington, D.C.].  Is it, how do you, MCCA?
Speaker 2: Okay, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you, were you involved, you weren't involved in the startup of that, but--
Speaker 2: No, I've been, I've been kind of, I mean I've, I was there when it started.  I've participated around the margins.  But I'll tell, you know, as I, the older I get, the less interested in conferences I (laughter) become.  My time is so precious, and I contribute when I think I have something to offer.
Speaker 1: But then, can you tell me then--let's look at blacks.  You know, we've talked about blacks in corporate law firms just a little bit, you know, that--I don't even know if we're camera--but that things have changed some.  But you know, we're talking about what, a twenty-five, almost going on thirty-year period.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you know, I was thinking about the time that you were in--what, '70 [1970], '70 [1970] to '74 [1974] you were at--
Speaker 2: At Milton [Academy, Milton, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: --Milton.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And when you look at that period in the business arena, a lot of blacks were getting hired into corporate America, and there was, you know, a lot of feeling of possibilities.  And there have been studies done where people hit the glass ceiling.  There is excitement in looking at your track, I mean 'cause we always are ever hopeful.  So I'm just wondering, what do you feel in this current environment will make someone successful from a long-term standpoint?  You've talked about that blacks in your position often, they're just a lot called upon.  You know, you have--and that's right, and it happens all the time.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So what do you see as, what would be staying power and it's not an anomaly?
Speaker 2: Well, there's an chicken and egg issue here, because at, on some level, the more of us there are, the more, the longer our tenure will be.  Because it is, there is something to be said for not being alone, not being the only one.  And some of the groups that convene African American or other minority and women general counsel are extremely important from the point of view of giving us a place to take some of the experiences where you just want to say to somebody: did I really just hear that?  Or, (laughter) did this, did anything like this ever happen to you?  I think that our self-confidence as a group of professionals is growing.  And I think that that grows, in part, from seeing other people in jobs like this and seeing a sense of possibilities.  And I think you'll see and have seen--I mean I've only been at this for five years or so, six years or so as a general counsel of companies, and I've been in two.  But you see others who have been general counsel of companies for long periods of time and I think are fully on track to retire in those positions or have retired in those positions and have served with distinction until their retirement.  I think that there is a grounding that is quite personal but very important to sustain yourself in almost any position of responsibility and scrutiny, particularly leadership positions.  I think it's important to know who you are, what it is you're trying to accomplish, how to be yourself no matter what the setting is, and how to recognize when the setting is causing you to be false, and to reverse that.  And I think that comes from practice.  I think, for me, having experienced lots of different settings, having learned to live in many different cultures in the United States and elsewhere, and to, not just to respect them but really to enjoy them and those, and those differences, and finding out that there are certain attributes about the way I approach people and the way I approach problems that feel right to me and are successful in all of those settings is part of the grounding for me.  And I think that probably there's something like that, which is a key to professional success for others like me who are interested in positions of the kind I have and hope to have.

Speaker 1: What is your feeling though about the, sort of the state of black America, and I mean in the area that you've been dealing with, and what its prospects for the future?  I mean all we hear talk about is that, you know, Hispanics are the largest growing, and you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we will become irrelevant and--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well, I don't think we're gonna become irrelevant.  I think if that happens it's because we have not raised our voice.  I think there are still legacies of oppression and indeed, of privilege that have to be overcome.  I think education is absolutely key, and we have to find ways to reinforce or to counterbalance some of the messages that come from our communities about how education is for somebody else, and achievement is for somebody else.  That's for us too, and that's very much in our tradition, meaning achievement is very much in our tradition.  I think that there are social programs, and policies, and also issues of individual responsibility that have to be faced.  I think our criminal justice system of just gathering up young people and locking them away for long periods of time, just sort of tossing them out is not working and has had a profound and disproportionate impact on black people, particularly black men.  On the other end of the spectrum, though, I think there is a lot to be said for reinforcing the importance of people having children when they are ready for children, and when they are ready to commit to those children, and when they're really, ready, as much as humanly possible, to stick together to raise those children as an investment in the future.  So I think there are--I think the state of black America is, sometimes I feel at risk of being overcome by the attention deficit of the American public, and particularly policymakers who are eager to move on to the next thing.  And maybe the next thing is the growing Hispanic population.  But I think that, at the end of the day, our success as a people in America, and indeed our success as Americans, depends on our seeing a stake in each other's struggles, and seeing the ways in which the strivers who are Hispanic, or the strivers who are women, or the strivers who are poor whites have so much in common with what it is we are striving for.  And trying to build that bridge and see that kind of connection I think may be a key to our long-term success as an American society.
Speaker 1: So what do you think is the most pressing issue facing black America?  Do you see one?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there are a couple.  I think, I think education is huge, but again, not limited to African Americans.  I think it is huge in the African American communities, and I don't think that vouchers, or charter schools, or even programs like A Better Chance [ABC] are the sole solution.  Unless we solve the issue of the quality of the public schools, we are not gonna get anywhere.  And I think we got to start acting like the market is not the only way or the only force that is gonna make a difference in the improvement of public schools.  I think health care is another one, again, not limited to African Americans, but again, we are disproportionately on the losing end of a fair distribution of those services.  And as a result, you know, there are more of us with diabetes, and more of us with asthma, and fewer of us with prenatal and postnatal care.  And so the healthcare crisis that's--and I say crisis not because I haven't seen healthcare calamities in places like South Africa or in Asia, but because we are the richest nation on earth, and we have people who are simply falling through the cracks.  And again, we are on the short end of that stick.  We are disproportionately poor and disproportionately ill-fed, and ill-clad, and ill-cared for when it comes to healthcare.  So, no, I don't think it's one, I don't think--or I haven't been able to articulate a single issue that is failing black Americans more than others unless it is to say that it's the failure of a sense of common destiny and common enterprise, that poverty is somehow connected to fault and that if it's all about our getting our own, an individual getting his or her own and not having any responsibility for anybody else.  And I think that is a sentiment that is widespread in America today and is a profound risk to all of us.

Speaker 1: If you were coming along now, would you choose law as a profession, if you were--I mean you're--our average age is about seventy honestly, doing these interviews, but would you--there's still a lot of your career on.  But--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was gonna say.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But would you choose the law again?
Speaker 2: Well, I've enjoyed being a lawyer.  As I said earlier, I enjoy the versatility of the, and the flexibility of the practice.  But at age forty-eight, I hope to have a couple of more careers before I'm done.  I'm a good lawyer.  I enjoy it.  It's been good to me as a profession and as a place in this society.  But I still have a love of architecture (laughter).  I still love it, still interested in space and how that's contrived, and how it's manipulated, and how it makes you feel, what have you, all those architectural secrets--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --or mysteries I should call 'em.
Speaker 1: Why is that though?  Why do you think?  Is it because you were in a confined space?
Speaker 2: I think more than anything that was it, and because I--it may be that because I'm in a confined space, I know what comfort a well-proportioned room can give, a well thought out space can give, and how wrong an over-proportioned space feels.  And maybe that, that's why I'm particularly conscious of it.  And I think there are some particular skills, and as I say, some mysteries in sorting out those issues.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Deval [L. Patrick], does the older Deval, the forty-eight-year-old Deval, ever talk to the seven-year-old Deval?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: And what does he say?
Speaker 2: Sometimes it's the seven-year-old Deval talking to the forty-eight-year-old Deval and using a term my grandmother [Sally Wintersmith] used to (laughter) say, which was, "Look at you now."  You know, I talk about that sort of inner smile I have when I have occasion to ride on Air Force One, or go to my office here, or sit in that garden in Cairo [Egypt] and have that dinner in our honor.  There is a comfort I feel, you know, and I don't want it to come across as self-satisfaction, because I'm still on my own journey.  But I, there's a comfort I feel toward that seven-year-old that all that time of introspection and all that time by yourself and not feeling connected wasn't forever, and that, as the Bible says: faith is a hope in the unseen.  Faith is a very, very powerful thing, and hope is a tangible advantage if you're willing to put it to work for you and, and invest in it.  And I think, fighting off the cynicism, which seven-year-olds might be a little early for, but it creeps along by ten and eleven-year-olds, and you know, even my kids [Sarah Patrick and Katherine Patrick], maybe particularly my kids, and it settles in some people for a lifetime.  I feel so fortunate not to have been overcome by cynicism.  And I don't know what combination of good luck and fortune kept that seven-year-old from cynicism and kept that seven-year-old with a faith and a hope in the unseen, but I'm very grateful for that.
Speaker 1: And your wife [Diane Bemus Patrick], you've had a very good relationship--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean with, and managed a career and a marriage--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and kids--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --which is--
Speaker 2: She says it's because I work away from home (laughter).  No, we've been married twenty years this year.  This is her second marriage, my first.  We have a wonderful family, and you know, it's not without work.  We've, yeah, relationship has evolved over the years.  But yeah, she's an incredible person.  She's also really the talent in our family.  She's an extraordinary lawyer.

Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: You know, ask me that in thirty years' time.  It's, you know, I'm not, I'm firmly middle-aged now, and so I'm in the midst of sorting out all those questions.  I hope to have a better answer in a little while.  I hope that I have given someone else a reason to hope.
