Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Lelia, L-E-L-I-A, Mae, M-A-E, Hillard, H-I-L-L-A-R-D [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew].
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: That was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Lelia Mae Hillard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lelia Mae Hillard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You know, she was born May 30th, and the exact date--well, she died when she was eighty-two years old.  So you have to come up with the year from that.
Speaker 1: What year did she pass?
Speaker 2: She passed three years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's 2007 [sic. 2006].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what do you know about your mother's side of the family, the Hillards?
Speaker 2: What I know about my mom's--her mom's name was Charlie Bell, Charlie Bell Hillard.  That was her--that was her mom's name.  Her dad, we didn't know him, you know, and they rarely talked about him, you know.  My mom had one brother, his name was Leonard Hillard.  She had, her oldest sister's name was Rosie B., R-O-S-I-E, B. Hillard [Rosie Hillard].  Do you want to know how many sisters?  You don't need their names, or what?
Speaker 1: Not necessarily.
Speaker 2: Okay, I see.
Speaker 1: I guess what I'm getting at is like, what are the stories about that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How did they, you know, make a living, and--?
Speaker 2: They made a living in South Fulton, Tennessee farming.  And from what I understand, her dad did a lot of odds and ends, you know, he was like a handyman around that little town, you know.  And her mom was, did different housework for different households, households, around South Fulton, Tennessee, you know, back in those days; washing and cleaning and ironing for different families in that town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they have any stories that go back to slave days about the origin of the name Hillard?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't.  They never talked about that time, they really didn't.  You know, there was so much focused on trying to make a living and raise kids.  I remember the house that we were in, that was the first house that her mom and dad had owned.  And we lived in it up until the time that we moved here in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  And then her brother, Leonard, took it over.  And his family, you know, they still own it, you know.  But when it came down to--we used to talk about, you know, picking cotton, and going out and picking strawberries, and especially when they were picking cotton on some of the tough days during the summer; how hot it was, you know, and making sure you fill that bag and pick the cotton like it's supposed to be done, you know.  And pick as much as you can, so you can get a good days' wages for it, you know.  And when it came down to the strawberries, you know, not only did my mom, but her oldest sister and her two youngest sisters, that's one of the things that they did, you know.  One of the things I used to hear my mom talk about is when--I guess they call it summer break, when they'd get out to do the harvest, you know, when they'd do the planting and stuff like that, you know.
Speaker 1: A break from school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a break from school, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did they own their own home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the house that we lived in, you know, that was their home, you know.  They--you know, it was one--up until, I think up until about 1950, it was probably like about a three or four room home.  And then my uncle, him and some of his buddies kind of enlarged it, you know.  Because I remember he had the living room and another little space over here where he used to sleep, you know, it was part of the living room.  Then you had the kitchen, then you had the bedroom, and then another room all the way in the back where me and my twin brother [Jerry Drew] and my oldest brother [James Drew] used to sleep, you know.
Story_ID: 433048
Speaker 1: Was there a name for the black community down there?
Speaker 2: We called it, on the hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We called it--because we were the hill kids, you know, on the Tennessee side.  And then when you'd go down to the other part of the black community, it was called, the bottom, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were telling me before we started that you all were about maybe ten feet from the Kentucky line.
Speaker 2: We were probably a good, probably seventy-five yards from the Kentucky line, you know, from the state line between South Fulton, Tennessee and Fulton, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I guess the dominant metropolitan area was Paducah you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the dominant metropolitan area was Paducah, Kentucky.  About eleven--nine or ten miles away from us was Union City, Tennessee.  That's where, when the black kids wanted to go to high school.  After they'd graduate from Rosenwald Elementary School [Rosenwald School, South Fulton, Tennessee], they either went to Miles High [Miles High School], which was the black high school in Union City, Tennessee, or they could go probably thirteen or fourteen miles away to Martin, Tennessee.  But most of the kids went to Miles High in Union City, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Once they graduated from Rosenwald Elementary.
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] able to go to school in South Fulton?
Speaker 2: My mom went to school, I think she went to school up until she was probably in about eighth grade.  She graduated from grammar school.  I never heard about them talking about her going to high school, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she go to Rosenwald?
Speaker 2: She went to Rosenwald, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, the majority of folks in our little town, South Fulton, Tennessee, black folks, went to Rosenwald.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did the--had the TVA started by the time--you know, had the Tennessee Valley Authority, started?
Speaker 2: I think the Tennessee Valley probably--when I began to notice it, it was probably right after we left in '54 [1954].  You know, I don't remember a lot of folks talking about it when we were down there, you know, because we left South Fulton in 1954.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was trying to think.  They were building the dams and all that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you were there.  How did that affect the economic life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, we used to, when I was in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], first the Cub Scouts then the Boy Scouts down in South Fulton, we would go, during the summertime, we'd go up to what you call Kentucky Lake, and we'd go up there and spend a week up there, you know.  And they had a section where they'd let the black kids come and, you know, camp out.  And that's what we did.
Story_ID: 433049
Speaker 1: Let me get your father's full name and spell it.
Speaker 2: Now, my real father's name was Max Bowman [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, I only saw him three times in my life, you know, the person who--and I think he died the year that I went into the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  I went into the Marine Corps in August of '63 [1963], and he died, you know.  So the person who I, who really helped me and was with me, and that I call my father, was my stepfather, Alfonzo Drew.  That was my mom's [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] husband.  I think they were married probably for about fifty-three or fifty-four years, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And his name is spelled?
Speaker 2: A-L-F-O-N-Z-O, Alfonzo Drew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in Florence, Alabama.  As I remember he had two sisters and a bunch of nieces and nephews, I don't remember him having any brothers.  And really, he was sort of like distanced from his family.  Once he had his own family, you know, I'd count the times he went back to Florence; probably about three or four times, you know, never for any family reunions.  Every now and then he'd call his oldest sister, Louise [Louise Drew], who was in California.  But he really didn't have a lot to do with, you know, with his siblings, you know.  He was so busy working for the Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad] and trying to take care of his immediate family, you know.  And he, that's where he focused all his attention at, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he's really the father that you knew (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's the guy that I knew as my father, you know.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you, you were Terry Drew then?
Speaker 2: I was Terry Drew when I was in Wendell Phillips grammar school [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] from the fourth grade up, until I graduated from Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Then I got ready to go into the Marine Corps and found out there was no birth certificate for Terry Drew, you know.  So I had to go and get my birth certificate from South Fulton, Tennessee and it was [HistoryMaker] Terry Hillard, and that's what I had to do.  I wanted to go into the Marine Corps, and that's the way we did it.
Story_ID: 433050
Speaker 1: Were there any stories, now what did-now, I know you didn't see your biological father [Max Bowman (ph.)] that much, but do you have any information about his family?  Are there any stories (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Now, his family, yeah, it's really ironic with his family.  His, his youngest sister was a lady by the name of Emily [Emily Bowman (ph.)], who was a real disciplinarian, man.  When we were living in South Fulton, Tennessee, she lived two streets over with my grandmom, with Max's mom, you know.  And man, I tell you, you talking about--they were just like drill instructors.  When, when, when we'd be out at night, you know, up and down the street playing hide-and-go seek or something like that, she'd be next door to the neighbors, our neighbors Maureen [ph.] and Dorsey's [ph.] house.  And she'd say, "Okay, guys.  It's time to go in now."  And we'd keep going.  And she'd say, "Don't let me say this one more time.  It's time to go in," I mean like a drill instructor.  And when Emily spoke, we went inside; her and the lady next door, Rena [ph.].  You know, my best buddy was a guy by the name of Robert Algie [ph.], we called him Pete.  When his grandma spoke and my doggone aunty spoke--you know, Emily was something.  And Granny, you know, Ophelia Bowman [ph.], she was an older lady, you know, but I mean stern, you know.  If you thought my aunt was tough, this woman used to put the fear of God in not only her doggone--my twin brother [Jerry Drew] and I--but everybody, every other kid who lived up on the hill, you know.  And she got up and she'd walk around, going from one friend's house to another.  And when she spoke, you know, and somebody would be doing something they weren't supposed to be doing, she'd let them know what she thought about it, you know.  And she didn't get no lip, either.
Speaker 1: So, were they capable of corporal punishment?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, what they--, "Go get your own switch," you know.  Here I am getting ready to get whipped, and you go get your own switch, you know.  And if you didn't come back with one that was big enough, you know, she--so you'd go and you got one that was just right, you know, not to inflict too much pain on you, you know, but that's the way it was, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my other aunt, her name is Nancy [Nancy Bowman (ph.)].  Nancy is going through so much.  She stays in Buffalo [New York].  She was, Nancy was sort of like the independent sister of my real father.  She moved to Buffalo and used to be--I remember when she'd come back to the town, you know, about every other year.  And she'd come back, and you knew when Nancy came back that there was at least five or ten dollars that she was going to give you, you know.  Because when folks went to Chicago [Illinois], and went to Buffalo, and went to Racine, Wisconsin and Detroit [Michigan], when they came back down from vacation--you know, these are folks who had--we say had money, so we knew we were going to get some monetary gains, you know, a five dollar or ten dollar gift, you know, from them just seeing us, you know.  Then the last person was Willie Frankfort [ph.].  That was his youngest brother, and he called him Crow.  And Crow, during the time that my twin brother and my oldest brother [James Drew]--he was, did little odd jobs.  But he coached the boys team for the time that I was down there and when my oldest brother was down there.  He coached the basketball team, you know, not only--and when it came down to coaching baseball, you know, and stuff like that.  We only had basketball and baseball.  I didn't know what football was until I came to Chicago, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd never been to a football game until I came to Chicago.  I didn't know what swimming was, you know, until I--and I guess that's the reason I never learned how to swim.  I didn't know what track was, you know.  I never heard of tennis, you know, when we were down there.  It was just baseball and basketball, that's what we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so did your father--what did he do for a living? Your biological (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He did--my biological father?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You know, to this day, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know, you know.  Yeah, because like I said, we only saw him three times in our lives, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, sure.
Story_ID: 433051
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But your stepfather [Alfonzo Drew] worked for Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, and there's some stories behind that.  I think he must have worked for them about thirty-seven or thirty-eight years.  And he was retired for over thirty years, and he said he got his pension and somebody else's pension, too.  And it was just, just ironic, you know, him working for Illinois Central.  The first time I ever went on vacation, it was because he worked for Illinois Central, and we came to Chicago [Illinois] and got on the train.  We had the shoebox with the chicken with the white bread, and with the pound cake, and had a soda pop, you know.  Each kid had a shoebox, and that was the overnight trip to come to Chicago, you know.  The first time I ever tasted steak, shrimp, fish, you know, it was, the old man brought it home, you know.  But we had a good time driving back and forth.  I guess that's the reason I'm such a lover of trains now, you know.  We did a lot of traveling on the trains coming back and forth to Chicago.  And that's one of the reasons why, not only myself, but a couple of the other brothers, more so the brothers than the sisters, we learned how to cook.  Because, you know, you used to always wonder, who was the better cook?  Mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew]?  Or, we used to call my stepfather the old man, you know?  And who's the better cook?  Because both of them could cook, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you know your stepfather's birthday?
Speaker 2: It was, I have to get it for you, Larry [Larry Crowe], you know.  I have to get it for you, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was he older than your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, he was older.  My mom was eighty-two when he died, and I think the old man, when he died, he was probably about ten years or eleven years older than her, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 433052
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they met?  Did they tell a story about that?
Speaker 2: The way I hear is she [Hillard's mother, Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] had just started working for Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad], and the train used to come through.  It used to be a nice sized station in South Fulton [Tennessee], you know.  And she was one of the ladies who worked for Illinois Central who got on the train, and had this big old thing hung around their neck.  They sold apples, they sold oranges, they sold coffee, they sold, you know, different goodies and things.  She went on the train and she was selling to some of the passengers and things, you know, selling her goods to some of the passengers.  And she messed around there, and he [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] was, I guess coming out of the dining car or wherever he used to cook, going back to wherever they kept the supplies or something.  And he looked up and saw her and she saw him, and he kept trying to, you know, get her name and stuff.  And she was kind of shy and didn't want to, didn't want to give up no name and stuff.  And so, that happened the first time.  And the second time around, he almost blew the doggone train the second time.  Because he got off the train with her, trying to get her doggone address and find out her name and stuff.  And that's what happened.  And then it was like while they were working on the train, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and so that, I think that went on probably for about eight or nine months.  And not too long after that, they got married, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when they got married?
Speaker 2: You know, I think when they got married, I was probably, I had to have been probably about six or seven years old, you know, somewhere in there, you know.  Because I remember, I was wondering, who is this guy?  You know, because he came to live with us, you know, and I said, "Who is this guy?" you know.  And so it was, you know, I was just any other kid.  It was kind of hard to take, you know.  For all this time, the only man who had ever been in my life had been my [maternal] uncle [Leonard Hillard], you know.  And I said, "Who is this guy coming in here?"  Well, it was, you know, my mom's new husband, you know.
Speaker 1: Did it take a while to adjust to him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it took a while, you know.  Because you got to realize, now, when it comes down to the Pullman porters and the guys who cooked on the Illinois Central, they was hard drinkers, and they were party guys, you know.  And so, yeah, it took a while to get adjusted to him, you know.  But I think the adjustment really came forward when they moved us up here to Chicago [Illinois], you know.
Story_ID: 433053
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, and their talents, and their dispositions--and this is all three of them, I guess, from what you know.  Like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, I think I take after my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] and probably my stepfather [Alfonzo Drew].  You know, my mom in a sense, who is really low-key, very humble, but you know, always--if she had an opinion or something, she would say it.  If she didn't have an opinion or something, she kept her mouth shut.  The old man wasn't really vocal, but, you know, when he said something, he meant it, you know.  But the one thing is, don't mess with his family, you know.  When it came down to--if you screwed up in school--which by me being the prodigal child--you know, out of ten kids I'm probably the only one who ever got suspended twice from school, you know.  If you come in and you'd think you were going to rant and rave and raise a whole lot of hell, he'd come in and he'd say, "You know, you got to do what you got to do.  But at the end of the day, it's going to come back to bite you."  And, but, he was one of these individuals who knew how to talk to us, you know.  And never, not one time out of the whole time did he ever throw this thing up, "Well, you ain't my kid," you know.  He said everything that lived in this house belonged to him.  But I would have to say that I took after both of them; my mom, when it came down to her very humble, very easy way of getting along with people; but the old man when it came down to--if you cross me or if you do something to my family, you're going to have to answer to me, you know.  But he was, when it came down to his girls, just like when my daughter [Terri Hillard] and my granddaughter [Danae LaJaycee-Hillard], you know, very strict on the girls, you know.  There was somewhat of a leeway with the boys, you know, but he, you know, he knew how to make adjustments.  He knew how to make us make adjustments, and keep us in line, you know.  At the end of the day, he'll tell you, "This is my house.  You know, I'm running it.  I'm feeding you, I'm clothing you, you know.  I'm providing for you to go to school and all of that.  You got to do what I ask you to do, you know.  I ain't going to ask you to do nothing that I wouldn't do, you know."  He didn't talk a lot, you know, but when it came down to sports, he'd sit there and watch TV and watch doggone sports.  And, you know, that's when you'd see his doggone--and he would say his words when somebody would screw up, you know.  I remember one time I let it slip, you know.  And he looked over at me, you know, like, "I can say that, but you can't say it."  You know, it was something that shouldn't have been said, you know, but I'd heard him say it, so I figured it was okay, you know.  He looked, "No, no."  But, yeah, I would say I kind of take after--it's a little of me in both of them, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: But I think when it came down to my character and the way I am--not really getting excited, really getting arrogant or anything like that--the old man used to always have a saying, you know, "What goes up, comes down," you know.  And he always said, "If you treat people like--well, expect that in return," you know.  There's a certain way you got to treat people, you know.  And give them, you know, their just due.  And treat them with respect, you know.  You ain't got to kiss nobody's butt, but you got to treat people with respect, you know, whether you like them or not, you know.  That ain't what it's about.  It's about if you got something to do, it's about getting the job done, you know.  And he used to bring back--the supervisors I guess on the dining car [of the Illinois Central Railroad] used to--the majority of time, we didn't like the majority of the supervisors.  But he said, "I had to make a living.  And there were certain things that I had to do, and I had to adhere to," you know.  And he said, "You know, did it hurt my feelings?   Did the doggone--did it bother me and bother my principles and my morals?  Yes, it did, but I had to make a living.  I had mouths to feed at home."  At the end of the day, that's what it's about, you know, taking care of your family.
Story_ID: 433054
Speaker 1: What were race relations like in--?
Speaker 2: South Fulton [Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in South Fulton (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: When you were a little kid, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, you know, it was bad.  You know, but being small, you didn't realize how bad it was, being our age.  You know, I'll never forget the one restaurant down on Main Street.  And I showed my kids [Terri Hillard and Dana Hillard] where you'd go down and they had the colored window.  And the colored window was probably about two inches larger than that legal-size paper that you got.  We could order hamburgers, cheeseburgers, or hot dogs.  I didn't know what pizza was until I came to City of Chicago [Illinois].  We couldn't get a pizza there, you know.  You couldn't get a banana split or a doggone milkshake there.  Hamburgers, hot dogs, French fries, and one other sandwich, and then some type of soda pop, you know.  I never did get to go in the front door, always to the side, to the window.  When we'd go to the movies, the only time we could go to the movie was on Saturday, Saturday matinees.  They opened up at twelve, and would go like about six or seven or eight o'clock at night.  We'd sit in the balcony, you know, and white folks sat on the main floor.  And we'd go in, and usually that's when the kids went.  And they had a lot of cartoons and stuff like that, like Superman and things like that.  But when it came down to--every now and then, kids being who they are, you know, we'd throw popcorn down there, and pop.  And the first time, wouldn't nobody say anything, you know.  The second time, you'd get a warning.  The third time, they'd come in there and they'd throw everybody out, you know.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Everybody?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody, yeah, you know.  When the wagon comes, everybody go, you know.  They'd throw everybody out, you know.  And those are some of the race relations.  But my uncle--my Aunt Ruthie [Ruthie Hillard Morris (ph.)], when her husband, S.T. [ph.] worked at the Brown Derby out there, we could always go to the back door, and if he wanted to give us food and stuff, you know, we did that.  But you never could walk through the front door and sit down, you know.  Race relations was, it was, it was bad, you know.  But then at the age that we knew--when we were growing up, we didn't realize how bad it was, you know.  And we'd go and sometimes we'd stray across over on the other side of Kentucky.  And some of the kids over there, we were called the N word, and we'd call them the C word and all of that.  And then you'd come back, you know, and you'd start throwing rocks at one another.  You know, that's what it was, you know.  I'll never forget when my oldest brother, you know, Denny--Denny [James Drew] is an avid golfer, you know.  If, I'd say if he had had the proper training, he would have been up.  He'd probably have been in the PGA [Professional Golfers' Association].  He used to go out to this small golf course in South Fulton, Tennessee and he used to caddy.  During the whole time that we were down there, at his age, he went out there.  And he used to go out there during the summer and caddy almost every day, you know.  He'd come back and he'd get his little money that the golfers would give him, and he'd give me and my twin brother [Jerry Drew] and my two oldest sisters, Laraine [Laraine Drew] and Diane [Diane Drew], you know, a quarter or fifty cents, or something like that.  And, but not one time were you able to play on that golf course.  And that's one of the things that--between me and my two brothers that's up here in Chicago [Illinois], we're trying to get him back down there before he gets too old, where he can go on that golf course, which they're allowed to play now, and play on that golf course.  That's where he first became acquainted with golf.  Take him down there so he can play a few rounds on that golf course, you know.  But yeah, it's, like I said, we went to Rosenwald high school [Rosenwald School, South Fulton, Tennessee].  And the only thing that we had was basketball during the wintertime and baseball during the summertime.

Speaker 1: Can you describe for us some of the, what the neighborhood looked like when you were growing up, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, growing up in South Fulton [Tennessee], we stayed on Craig Street, 112 Craig, C-R-A-I-G, Craig Street.  And on our street was one, two, three, four--it was six houses on our side of the street; and one, two, three--four houses on the other side of the street.  And across the street, at one time there used to be a huge field.  And in this field is where, we used to play baseball; baseball, strike-out, and all of that, and play catch.  And then the Hopkins [ph.], the Hopkins was the folks who owned the only black restaurant in the town.  And it was like a night spot, too, you know.  During the daytime it was like open up for the kids to go and get hamburgers or hot dogs or something like that, and polish sausage and French fries.  But at nighttime, then that's when they sold beer and they sold--I don't know if it was so much whiskey, but I know it was a lot of beer sold, and stuff like that.  And I think probably a year or two before we left, one of their relatives came and built a house right across from my house.  It was the first time I'd ever seen a doggone brick house, you know.  And I said, "Man, these folks are rich."  They got a brick house and they got a doggone, what they call the sally port, where you pull your car in.  I said, "They got the doggone place where they can put their car and everything.  Man, these folks are--who are these folks, you know?"  But the folks kept their lawns mowed, you know.  And they had these big old long things in the back where they barbequed mutton and they barbequed doggone pork shoulder.  They barbequed ribs and chicken, and stuff like that.  But during the daytime it was hot, and nobody had air-conditioning, you know.  And you'd open up the front door and the back door and make sure you had screens on the front door and the back door, and makeshift screens on the windows and on everything in the house so you'd at least try and get a draft.  We had plenty of fans, but nobody had air-conditioning.  I didn't know what air-conditioning was until I got to Chicago [Illinois], you know.  And you'd go from one house to another.  At that time we didn't even have, we didn't have an electric refrigerator, you know, and the ice man would come around.  The smells, it was--we had nothing like when you come to Chicago.  You know, we had none of that type of odor from the stockyard and all that.  This, this was basically a little small country town, and the smell was refreshing, you know.  When people cut their grass, you'd smell the grass and things like that.  At nighttime, you'd hear all the crickets and the frogs that was by some of the water; there was rivers there, you know.  There wasn't a lot of, like, excessive noise like when you come to the city or come to an urban location, you know.  And when a husband and wife got into it, whether it be next door or across the street, you could hear that, you know.  And we'd go out on the back porch, "Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. So and So, they into it, you know."  And you'd hear a bunch of names being called and all of that, you know.  But it was, everybody had a front yard and backyard and front porch.  And mainly that's where the majority of the gatherings took place, you know.  We might be on our front porch, and my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] and my [maternal] uncle [Leonard Hillard] and my aunts might be on the neighbor's front porch or down the street, you know.  When it came down to listening to the St. Louis Cardinals, and Stan Musial, and Red Schoendienst, and Jackie Robinson, and Junior Gilliam [Jim Gilliam] and doggone Gil Hodges of the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers], we were all Brooklyn Dodgers fans.  And the St. Louis Cardinals, you know, they were the enemy, you know.  And whenever they were playing in St. Louis [Missouri], we'd get it on the radio.  When they started, even if we had school the next day, you didn't go to bed until that game was over with, you know.  That's just the way it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 435370
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: The late '40s [1940s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were born in '43 [1943], so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About '46 [1946] is when Jackie Robinson broke--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --into the Major League [Major League Baseball].  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and--
Speaker 1: When you were a kid, that was the hero.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was the hero, you know.  And then the '50s [1950s], you know--and especially the couple times that the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers]--the Brooklyn Dodgers was the team, man, you know.  And we could sit there and talk about--the book came out a lot later, 'The Boys of Summer,' [Roger Kahn] but you can name them.  You know, Billy Cox on third, and the shortstop Pee Wee Reese, and Jackie Robinson on second base.  And Gil Hodges, and Roy Campanella, and big Don Newcombe, and Carl Furillo, and Pafko [Andy Pafko]; we knew them all, you know.  But we hated Red Schoendienst and Stan Musial, you know.  They were the catalysts of the doggone St. Louis Cardinals, man.
Speaker 1: Now, the Cardinals were still an all-white team, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was the--I mean was there any particular character about that team, or the fact that the local white people liked them so much?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, by them being from St. Louis [Missouri], and being close to what--you know, St. Louis--some of the folks went to St. Louis to--they loved, you know, they loved the Cardinals.  But we in the black community, we loved the Brooklyn Dodgers, you know, simple as that, you know.  And you had Jackie and all of them.  And man, I tell you, you could drive or walk up and down Main Street [South Fulton, Tennessee]--that's where most of the white families lived, on Main Street.  That side was Kentucky and this side was Tennessee, and the game would be on.  You'd go in the black community, whether you're on the hill or you're in the bottom, the game would be on, you know.  Forget what else was happening.  They could have a flood, but the game was on, and everybody was listening to them, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, was the radio situation--did most people have their own radio?
Speaker 2: Everybody had a radio, you know, most folks had a radio.  And then I forget the name of it, but I think it was Philco and then there was a couple of others.
Speaker 1: Zenith [Zenith Radio Corporation; Zenith Electronics LLC].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  But everybody had a doggone radio, you know.  And I'll never forget, you know, on our radio we had wire, and it was going out the doggone what-cha-ma call it.  You didn't need it, because it wasn't FM, it was just AM, you know.  And man, but I tell you, it was, it was something, yeah.  It was--but--
Speaker 1: What about Joe Louis' fights?
Speaker 2: And on Wednesday nights, we used to listen to--what was that?  Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and 'The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports.'  And the one thing that the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] and my [maternal] uncle [Leonard Hillard] used to always say, "Listen to what they say.  Listen to what they say.  What are they saying?  When you look sharp, you feel sharp, and people think you are sharp."  They were talking about the Gillette blades and all that.  And he used to bring it up time and time again, you know, "When you look sharp, you feel sharp, and people think you are sharp," you know.  And then the Pabst Blue Ribbon--I think it was Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, wasn't it?  Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Joe Louis used to fight, and Ezzard Charles, you know, Sugar Ray [Sugar Ray Leonard], you know.  Whenever a fight was on, you know, we'd be right there.  And the killing part about it, when something major like the fight was on, or the baseball game, and we had school the next day, wasn't nobody going to be telling you to go bed, because they wanted you to hear what was going on, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, that's something.  So they wouldn't make you to go to bed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.
Speaker 1: They'd let you watch?
Speaker 2: You, you got to--you didn't watch nothing, you got to listen to it.  You got to listen to the fight and you got to listen to the baseball game, you know.  And, and, and a lot of times--you know, because the little house we were living in at that time, it was my two youngest aunts [Ruthie Hillard Morris (ph.) and Oly Hillard], my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew], you know, and my uncle, you know.  And then our kids, you know, me and my oldest brother [James Drew], my twin brother [Jerry Drew], and my two oldest sisters [Laraine Drew and Diane Drew], you know.  And then when my stepfather came in, it was him, you know, all of us in this little old small house.  But all the women would probably be in the bed, and the men would be on the front porch, you know.  Because they'd put it right there by the window, and we'd be on the front porch, man.  And hey, it was something.
Story_ID: 435371
Speaker 1: This is a good time to--can you name all the people in your household in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You go back to my mom, Lelia Mae [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew].  You go back to my old man, my stepfather, Alfonzo Drew; my [maternal] uncle Leonard Hillard; my [maternal] aunt Ruthie, Ruthie Hillard [Ruthie Hillard Morris (ph.)].  It's Ruthie Morris now; then Oly, O-L-Y [Oly Hillard], that was my aunt, the one next to her, you know; and then my oldest brother, James, you know, Denny, we called him Denny, James [James Drew]; then my twin brother, Jerry [Jerry Drew]; myself; Laraine [Laraine Drew], and Diane [Diana Drew], you know.  Those are the kids.
Speaker 1: Now, were you very close with--like your twin, you would think--most people think, you know, twins are very, very, close.  Were you very close to your twin?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very close.  But my idol was my oldest brother.  You know, at sixty-six years old, I still say that.  And people look at me, "What?"  My twin, my oldest brother, has always been my idol, you know.  And I've been close to my twin brother and my oldest brother for the longest, you know, and my other siblings too.
Speaker 1: That's Denny, right, your oldest brother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Denny, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the twin brother, he, I had to be close to him, you got to realize, because he's a lot smarter than me.  Oh, yeah, I struggled in grammar school and high school, but this guy, man, I'm telling you, he was, he was an honor roll student.  Even when we lived in--we didn't know what honor roll was down in Fulton [South Fulton, Tennessee] at that time, you know.  But we came here to Chicago [Illinois] and went to Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], went to Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and he was always an honor roll student, you know.  And he'd help his younger--because he's fifteen minutes older than me.  And he helped me out when it came down to my studies, you know.
Story_ID: 435372
Speaker 1: Just a couple more quick questions about Tennessee, and we'll get you to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But in Tennessee, now did you--how did--I know that you mentioned a place, Hopkins [ph.], down the street.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know when people drink, it's going to be some problems.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And just in general, in life, there's going to be some issues.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How was the community policed?
Speaker 2: The community, we had an all-white police department, you know.  And, and, and when there was an issue, when there was a problem, they came, you know, and they took care of it.  And you know, during that whole time that I was--I never saw the police being called to a house on Craig Street.  You know, we stayed there.  There was this block--take for instance that railing there, that was Main Street.  We stayed at 112 Craig Street, and then there was another street there.  And then down at what we call at the bottom of the hill was the other part of Craig Street, and probably about another seven or eight houses down there.  And I can never, ever, remember the South Fulton, Tennessee police being called to any house on that street, never, ever.  I know they got called up to the Hopkins Restaurant and Cafe [ph.], you know, a number of times, you know, and you'd hear the grown-ups talking about it the next day.  "Yeah, So and So got arrested because he was drunk and hit somebody in the mouth," or something like that.  But never--they wasn't talking about really aggravated violence, you know, or a knife or gun, like that.  It usually was a fight.  Somebody got too doggone drunk, and they'd take them and put them in the doggone jail so they'd cool off, or something like that, yeah.  But it was policed by the South Fulton, Tennessee police department, you know.  And I think they probably had a police department probably of about four or five guys, you know, with a chief, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what about the music in Hopkins?  Did you ever get a chance to listen to it?  Or did you like the music (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, one of the things they played up there, and I guess that's the reason I'm such a blues fan--they had the jukebox, you know, but a lot of it was blues, you know.  And a lot of it was having to do with a lot of the black artists, you know.  And, but most of it was blues, you know.  And, and, at that age, we listened to some of it, but we wasn't into music that much when I was growing up in Tennessee.  We was into baseball and basketball, that's what we were into, you know.  And our bicycles--and fixing--you know, we knew how to put together a doggone bicycle and take the bicycle apart.  Because there was only about three or four people on what we call the hill who had new bicycles, and my oldest brother [James Drew] was one of them, you know.  And the bike that I had, I put together.  The bike that my twin brother [Jerry Drew] had, I put together; me and my buddy next door, you know.  But when it came down to music, you know, you'd go into the what'cha call it, and you'd hear it on the thing and you knew it was the blues, but that was it.  I don't ever remember--like what they call the Chitlin' Circuit.  I don't never remember like a named artist coming to South Fulton, Tennessee when I was growing up.  Now, I remember after I grew up and went away and went to Chicago, and then went away to the [U.S.] Marine Corps and came back and went back down there, they'd built what we call across the creek.  I told you about the second block down there, that was a creek; you crossed the creek.  I think it was Rutford [ph.], or something like that, the name started with an R.  He built a joint down there, and they had a couple of folks from like Memphis [Tennessee] and Nashville [Tennessee], or some of them--Obion [Obion County, Tennessee]--some of them other little towns would come, and a live band would come down there and play.  But I didn't go there because it was a bucket of blood, man.  They had more problems down there than a little bit, you know.  At that time when I went back down there, they had one black policeman on the job.  And yeah, man, they caught hell at that joint down there.  And I guess finally after a while they had to close it down, you know.  But this guy built this place from the ground up, didn't know how to take care of it.  But at Hops, Hopkins Cafe, they called it Hops, you know, Hopkins, the people Hopkins who owned it.  They, the only problem they ever had was every now and then somebody would get drunk, you know.
Story_ID: 435373
Speaker 1: Did you go to Rosenwald School when (unclear) [South Fulton, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I went to Rosenwald.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I went there until--I was probably about in the third grade.  Yeah, yeah, I'll never forget the lady who taught us first grade and second grade, Miss Mason, a little old bitty lady, little short lady.  And she had a son, I think his name was Godfrey [Godfrey Mason (ph.)].  And she was a single mom, and boy, she was tough, you know.  She was tough when it came down to getting the kids and learning how to read, and arithmetic, you know, and how to write.  But she not only taught me, she taught my oldest brother [James Drew] and she taught my two youngest [maternal] aunts [Ruthie Hillard Morris (ph.) and Oly Hillard].  And I wouldn't be surprised if she taught my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew], you know.  She had been there for ages and ages.  She was probably almost the oldest--she was the oldest thing in the school, you know.  But, and I don't think she died until she was about ninety-something years old.  And she must have taught until she was probably in her mid, mid-sixties, you know.
Story_ID: 435374
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: You know, no, I didn't.  Not down in, when I was in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I got to Chicago [Illinois], you know, I was, I liked history, you know.  But other than that, you know, it was, down in South Fulton [Tennessee] it was basketball and baseball.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned--now was there a place to play basketball in South Fulton?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had, one of the things that my [maternal] uncle Leonard [Leonard Hillard] did--we had some yards, you know, a space in the back of our house.  And what he did is got a couple of his buddies and kind of cleared it off, and packed the ground down and put us up two hoops.  And for the longest, until we moved, our house was like the center for kids from the bottom and kids from the other side of the tracks.  Kids from the Kentucky side would come over and play basketball.  But he had a rule.  When it got dark, when the sun went down, that was it, you know.  And we had like a streetlight on, where you could probably see on this goal, but not on this goal.  And he said, "Ain't going to be none of that," you know.  "When it gets dark, there's folks here who work and folks who want to go to sleep, and they don't want nobody--."  And you could get out there at seven or eight o'clock in the morning and play all during the--and it would be hot as hell, you know.  And we'd try not to play during the middle of the day, but we had our own basketball goal, you know.  And then they would open up the gym every now and then down at Rosenwald [Rosenwald School, South Fulton, Tennessee], you know.  It all depends on--I forget the name of the principal.  It all depends on how he was feeling.  And if he was in the doghouse at home, or what'cha call it--if he was in the doghouse at home, you know, the thing would be open up, you know.  If he wasn't in the doghouse, he wasn't nowhere around.  You know, he was the only one who had a key to the doggone, to the building.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 435375
Speaker 1: And you were in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], you said?
Speaker 2: I was in the Boy Scouts, yeah.  I was only in the Boy Scouts like for about two years.  And it really wasn't the Boy Scouts, it was the Cub Scouts, you know.  And for two years, we got to go to Kentucky Lake.  And man, I thought that was something, you know, to go to Kentucky Lake, and you got to sleep outside.  And then one time we got to sleep inside the cabin.  But see, I'd never seen a body of water this big, you know.
Speaker 1: It's huge, for those who haven't seen it.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's like one of the Great Lakes almost.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, it is huge.  And I'd never been on a boat, you know.  And one of the things--and I think that kind of stuck with me.  When I was growing up, like during July the 4th or May 30th, which is my mom's [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew]--Memorial Day, my mom's birthday--on those two days, like for a couple of years we had some kids who went out into the--where the farms were, and jumped in the pond.  And some of them, one of them didn't know how to swim, and he drowned, you know.  And it was like back to back, you know, and that always troubled me.  I said, "I don't know how to swim.  I ain't going nowhere near no water.  I ain't going nowhere--."  And I went four years through the [U.S.] Marine Corps, and didn't learn how to swim, you know.  And I was--we went to Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and looked up and saw a swimming pool in the school, you know, they had this big old swimming pool.  And my twin brother [Jerry Drew], you know, the coach, Mr. Taylor [ph.], told him, "Those who don't know how to swim, step over here.  Those who know how to swim, step over there."  Okay, he said, "All right guys, this is what we're going to do.  The ones who don't know how to swim, I want you to jump in this doggone thing."  And he had this big old long pole with a hook on it.  And I looked at him and I said, "If you think I'm jumping off in that water, you got to be nuts."  I'm the only one out of all the guys who said--.  My twin brother jumped in there and almost drowned, you know.  But that goes back--I still say that goes back when those two young men--you know, we knew their families, you know.  They were a little older than us, you know, but they drowned.  Yeah, they drowned, you know.  And it was always on a holiday.
Story_ID: 435376
Speaker 1: This story comes up again, I know, too, because I was reading the book ['Chicago Police: An Inside View, The Story of Superintendent Terry G. Hillard,' Thomas J. Jurkanin with Terry G. Hillard].  But tell us about the move to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did that happen?
Speaker 2: That was, the old man, my stepfather [Alfonzo Drew], decided, you know--
Speaker 1: This is, what year is this?  19--?
Speaker 2: This is 19--really it started in 1953.  We moved in 1954, I think, is when we came up here.  That was desegregation, when that Brown against what-cha-ma call it [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], I think.
Speaker 1: Board of Ed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Board of Ed.
Speaker 1: Topeka, yeah.
Speaker 2: And we tried--we got forewarning that it looked like mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] and the old man, my dad, and the five kids--the three boys and the two girls--that we were going to be moving to Chicago.  And man, we went around and we started--you know, the kids started going to aunts, you know, on my real father's [Max Bowman (ph.)] side.  And my grandma [Ophelia Bowman (ph.)] and all the friends were trying to get them, "Y'all go ahead and move, and let us stay here with our two young aunts and uncle, you know."  And he said, "That ain't going to happen.  We're moving as a family, and we're going to Chicago.  Better schools and all of that, you know."  And man, for almost eight months we did everything that we could, especially me and my twin brother [Jerry Drew] and my two sisters [Laraine Drew and Diane Drew].  My oldest brother [James Drew], it didn't bother him.  Well, he was in high school, getting ready to go to high school, you know.  So, it didn't bother him one way or the other.  And then we finally made the move.  We moved to 3616 South Park [South Parkway], and later 3616 King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], into one, two--I think it was a four-room apartment, you know.  We had a living room, a kitchen, and had a small bedroom off to the side, where me and my twin brother and my oldest brother slept.  And then my two sisters slept in the living room on the pullout couch.  And the old man and mom had a bedroom, you know.  And we stayed on the third floor, and it was like one of these--3616.  You got to--it's the only building like this--shaped down there.  It looked like at one time it might have been a loft, and shaped like that.  And on a day like this, when it's going to be 90 degrees, it was stifling, you know.  We had fans and window fans, and pushing that air, you know.  But, yeah, when it came down to moving, we really did not want to come to Chicago.  And--
Speaker 1: That block is an historic kind of block.  Is that close to where Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right across--well, it's in the next block.  After staying there about, probably about five or six years, we moved into a five-room apartment at 3702 King Drive.  That was directly across the street from Ida B. Wells.  But this was just one block north of Ida B. Wells, you know.  But there's a lot of history down there in that block, you know.  But, yeah, that was, that was traumatizing, the move from a little town like South Fulton [Tennessee] where you knew everybody, you know, and everybody--and then move up here.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your first impression of the street of Chicago [Illinois]?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: I remember when my Aunt Rose [ph.] stayed at 44th [Street] and Prairie [Avenue], and the "L" [elevated train] track was right behind it.  And the first time that we ever--the "L" came by and this doggone noise--man, it was terrifying.  I mean it was, oh, man, you talking about some kids that was--we were scared out of our minds, you know.  Because the "L," we never heard noise like that before, you know.  That doggone thing up in the air running on those doggone--you know, you got to realize, you know, we didn't have a bus in South Fulton, Tennessee, you know.   The only bus we had was to take the kids from--we would--the basketball team would go from Fulton [Kentucky] to Union City [Tennessee], or to Martin [Tennessee] or up in Murray [Kentucky], or what'cha call it, to play basketball.  You know, and that was one of them yellow school buses, you know.  But then to see a doggone--what you call a train.  The only train we'd ever seen was an Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad] train, not no doggone train that make this much noise, man.  It was deafening, you know, you couldn't hear yourself talk, you know.  Then to come up here and just to see how big this place was, you know.  A one block area in Chicago was like two or three blocks, what we call blocks, in South Fulton, you know.  And we stayed on doggone South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], you know, with not only this side, but then with the inner drive with the doggone parkway on each side of doggone South Park.  And then there was the inner drive over there on the other side, you know.  That doggone street was, even the doggone downtown section wasn't that large, you know.  And it was just, it was something.  And then to see all the different stores and all the different folks, you know, this many people standing in an area, you know.  It was, it was an eye-opener.
Story_ID: 435378
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you--what about the difference in how you were treated, the segregation problem (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, especially being in the--coming to Chicago [Illinois] and being in a neighborhood where you didn't see nothing but black folks, you know.  You could go to the store, and that was owned by black folks, you know.  You could go to a movie, which was, didn't nothing but black folks go to, you know.  I still went to a school that black folks owned, but it had a doggone, it had a gym in it.  When I first went to Wendell Phillips grammar school [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--to see a gym, that gym was almost three times as large as our doggone school almost, you know.  The doggone--and then they had an area outside where you could play, you know.  And then when you went over to the park--and see, they had not only a pool in the park, but they had doggone baseball diamonds, not one, but three or four baseball diamonds over in Madden Park [Madden Park Homes, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  And then they had a doggone pool, you know.  Man, what kind of place is this, you know?  It was an eye-opener, you know.  And we looked up and saw this--we went to Wendell Phillips grammar school and saw--you know, Wendell Phillips grammar school was attached to Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So when you graduate, you don't have to go eleven miles to go to high school.  We would just leave this building and walk down the hallway, and we're going to be at the school where--without even going out of town.

Speaker 1: What year was it when the DuSable Panthers [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] went downstate?
Speaker 2: That was with Paxton Lumpkin and all of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, and Charlie Brown [HistoryMaker Charles Brown].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Charlie Brown.  That was in, it was in the '50s [1950s].  I think it was about '56 [sic. 1954].
Speaker 1: Now you were there.  You were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I was there.  I was in grammar school [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you all follow the team?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we used to listen.  Yeah, we used to listen.  And the one, Art Hicks, who went to St. Elizabeth [St. Elizabeth High School, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  He was going to Seton Hall [Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey] I think it was, you know.  We had a big, had a radio in our bedroom that the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] had gotten us.  And we could listen, we could listen to basketball games, basketball and baseball games, in our living room, you know.  It was something, you know.  But when they went down, when DuSable first went down to Springfield [Illinois], man, we listened to that the whole time, you know.  We were rushing home to make sure, you know, that you were able to get it, and not only for the pre-game, but the entire game.  Then afterwards, you know, we'd be pulling for them the whole time, you know, just like when Marshall [Marshall High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] went down, you know.
Story_ID: 435380
Speaker 1: You all probably got a TV pretty soon, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a trip, man, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was a place at 63rd Street [Chicago, Illinois] where the viaduct--where the Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad]--the trestle right before you get to Stony Island [Avenue].  They had a little, there was a little store there, and that's where all the railroad people used to go.  And they had credit, they had instant credit.  Man, you could go and get TVs and could go and get appliances and stuff like that.  And we got this Silvertone TV, and it was a little black and white TV over here.  We'd raise up this thing, it was probably about that long.  And then right here you raise this up, and it had a record player.  And then it had an extension speaker just a little longer than your thing--the one you put over your-- I still got that speaker at home, and that speaker is still in my basement.  It's in the basement or it's in the garage, you know.  And I remember when we first got it, and there was some stipulations that went around with the what'cha call it.  There was only three people that could turn the TV on; the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew], mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew], and my oldest brother.  The other four was told, "Don't touch it."  If you want to see something, and the old man or mom wasn't there, Denny [James Drew] had to turn it on.  And then if you wanted to turn the channel, only he could turn the channel.  By him being the oldest, he looked at what he wanted to, you know.  And, but when the old man was there--like, and very seldom, you know.  Because when he was on the railroad, they would go out and he might be gone five or six days.  Because the City of New Orleans [Louisiana] and the City of Miami [Florida], you know, he'd leave and he went down and he'd stay a couple of days and then come back.  So he might be gone four or five days and then he'd come back, and he'd be home for three or four days and then he'd leave again.  But if he was home on a Friday night when 'Amos 'n' Andy' came on--it was, I think it was like during the week.  And 'Red Skelton' ['The Red Skelton Show'], those were the only two programs that he liked, 'Amos and Andy,' and 'Red Skelton.'  If he was there, the TV was his as long as 'Red Skelton' and doggone 'Amos 'n' Andy' was on, you know.
Story_ID: 435381
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us about Two-Gun Pete [Sylvester Washington].  He's one of the legendary Chicago [Illinois] police officers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Pete, you know, Pete was not only a legend among the Chicago Police Department, but in the black community, you know.  And I remember, I remember the old man and one of his buddies when they'd be--when we moved to 3702 South Park [South Parkway], King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], we had like a little sun porch out there, you know, where you walk out; I don't know what they call it now.  We stayed on the third floor, and then you could walk out and they had a couple of chairs out there.  And back in that day, you know, the guys from Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad], they would, for some reason they bought half-pints.  They didn't buy pints, they didn't buy fifths.   They'd buy half a pint and then they'd drink that up and then go get another one.  And I remember them talking about, it was some problems that they had had, like at 39th Street.  And the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Terry Hillard] said, he said, "Yeah," he said, "You know," he said, "I'm going to tell you."  He said, "Once they put Pete down there, he's gonna clear that up, you know."  And probably about two or three weeks later, you heard Pete's name again from the old man, saying, "Yep, I told you he was going to clear it up."  He said, "Pete's the baddest thing in our community, you know."  And then once I got on the police department, well, Pete had left.  But he had that tavern, the HillTop [HillTop Lounge, Chicago, Illinois] up there.
Speaker 1: It was near 39th and Lake [Street], Oakwood [Boulevard] and Lake?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 39th and Oakwood, on Lake, yeah.   And you'd always hear all the old-timers, doggone Harness [Robert M. Harness] and Lorenzo Chew and Beavers [William Beavers], them talking about Pete, what a doggone bad guy he was.  And one of the stories that you heard was Pete took a couple of guns off a couple of bad guys.  And he said, "I can't go right now.  I got another call to go to."  And he told these guys, "Meet me in the station, and your butt better be there when I get there."  And supposedly these two guys went there and reported to the desk sergeant and said, "Yeah, Pete told us to meet him here, you know, and to wait 'til he gets here."  They said, "Well, what did you happen to do, you know?"  And they said, "Well, Pete will tell you that."  And the sergeant said, "What did you do?"  He said, "Well, we had guns."  And they said, "Well, sit there."  He said, "Are you going to put the cuffs on me?"  He said, "Naw, if Pete told you to get here, I don't need to put the cuffs on you, you know."  But Pete was, you know, he was a legend not only in his own time, but you know, he was one bad dude, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think that people were more afraid of him, or were they, did they respect him?  I mean was it, or was it a combination of both?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was a combination of the two, you know.  Because back in those days, you know, we didn't have a standard for cops using their guns, you know.  We didn't have oversight when it came down to brutality and excessive force, you know.  Those terms weren't used in those days, you know.  He got away with a lot, you know.  And, and, and, and rather than suffer all that pain and aggravation, you know, from Pete, you did what he told you to do, you know.  And here's somebody who didn't hesitate to use his doggone guns, you know; he wouldn't hesitate, you know.  And I don't know how true it is, but you know, Pete was in a number of shootouts, and he lived to tell about it, you know.  So, and, yeah, it's a combination of the two.  People respected him, you know, but they feared him also, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that was it.
Speaker 1: It's traditional pretty much probably in most police departments I guess, and correct me if I'm wrong, that reputation is earned by, you know, being in the line of fire and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and reputation.  And I would guess every law enforcement agency got their icon when it came down back in those days as somebody who didn't take no mess, you know, who ran roughshod over the bad guys in that particular neighborhood, you know.  And when they had a problem with it, that precinct commander, that watch commander or whoever it was, would send one or two folks that he knew could get the job done, and they went out there and got it done.  And that's what they said with Pete.  Pete went out there and got it done, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what would you think?  Now, I know you probably thought about this a lot, you know, in retrospect, you know, because you didn't know in those days you were going to be a police officer or a superintendent.  But you know, in retrospect, like, what did the black community in those days think about the police department and about Pete's role, you know?  I guess he was the highest profile black person in the department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, Pete was.  Pete was the highest profile black street police officer in the city.
Story_ID: 435382
Speaker 1: And you had guys like Harness [Robert M. Harness], you know, Bob Harness and his partner, you know, who's legendary in their own right, you know, when it came down to investigation, things like that.  But they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bob--how do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: Harness, H-A-R-N-E-S-S.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Bob Harness was the commander of the old, what we call the 2nd District [Wentworth District].  At one time it used to be what we called the Prairie Avenue station, you know, and then they changed it.  But, you know, he was, Bob Harness was one of these folks--when they needed somebody to be a district commander--and first he was a captain, and then he was a watch commander, and then he became district commander, you know.  He ran that district, you know.  He ran it like it was supposed to done.  And a lot of folks, especially young black policemen, you know, even before I became a policeman, you know, they looked up to Harness.  And that's what he epitomized, and that's what they wanted to do, you know, "I want to be a Bob Harness."  Harness didn't care whether you were black or white, he spoke his mind, you know.  And a lot of the white bosses downtown, you know, didn't particularly want to hear him.  But he's one of these guys, he was--first, he was a man, you know, and then he was black, and then he was a policeman.  But he spoke his mind, you know, and he didn't care whether it was a white commissioner or a deputy commissioner or a doggone black alderman, you know--Bill Dawson [William L. Dawson], you know.  Harness didn't take any stuff from anybody, you know.
Speaker 2: So, Harness was the first black police executive (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Is there a story about how he got his spot?  Or--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you know, a lot of it probably had to do with his reputation on the street, but also having to do with politics, you know.  And politics played a lot, you know, during the first time of moving folks up in the department.  Whether you were black or white, you know, politics ruled the day when it came down to the Chicago Police Department.
Speaker 2: Now, was he affiliated with the old Republican regime, or the Democratic regime?
Speaker 1: You know what?  I would have to say he was more along the Dawson line, that's what I would suspect.
Speaker 2: Democratic, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Democrats, you know, yeah.  I just can't imagine Bob Harness being, you know, affiliated with the Republicans, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, because I'd heard from other people I've interviewed that most black folks were Republicans--
Speaker 1: That's what I--
Speaker 2: --all through the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I heard.  I think Congressman Dawson sort of changed that, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: The whole profile started to change.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And all the alderman, one by one, Sammy Rayner [A.A. "Sammy" Rayner] and the others (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --they lost their seats to Democrats.
Speaker 1: Yeah, to Democrats, yeah.
Story_ID: 435383
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wendell Phillips grammar school [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Grammar school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then went to Wendell Phillips High School, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it hard to adjust to the work when you started school?
Speaker 2: Well, it was hard adjusting to Wendell Phillips grammar school, because at that time, when we first got here, that movie with, I think it was Gary Cooper [sic.] called 'The Kentuckian,' had came out.  And I had a couple of guys that was in my class, man, especially in home economics, you know.  And one day we would doggone learn how to do some cooking, and the next day we would learn how to make things with our hands when it came down to using a hammer or something.  And I'll never forget, there was this guy, I think his name was Dwayne Howell [ph.].  And Dwayne was a kid, he was a kind of big robust kid.  And I was a small kid, you know.  And man, he used to, I mean he used to rub me the wrong way.  And nowadays we call it bullying, you know.  But boy, he used to go after me.  And at first, when I first got here I was scared of him, you know.  And I remember going home one time and sitting on the side of the bed and getting ready to do something, and I'm almost in tears.  And the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] was getting ready to leave, and he said, "What's wrong with you?" you know.  And I told him, "You know, this kid--." He said, "You know, somewhere down the line you got to make a statement.  You just got to stand up to him," you know, "and let him know what time a day it is, you know."  That's all he said, you know.  And I think this is probably the dumbest thing that I ever did, you know.  But I went back the next couple of days and he's bugging me.  And the next day, I think it was about the third day, we're in home economics and we're learning how to make some kind of little old stand for a flower pot, and I had a hammer.  And he had this what'cha call it, and he had his hand on there, and pow, and I popped him on the doggone hand.  And from that day on I had no more problems with that boy, I had no more problems.  As a matter of fact, we went through high school and we became good friends, you know.  I didn't break nothing, but I popped him, you know.  And I remember that was the first time that I got suspended, I got suspended for two days.  And the old man, he said, "You know, I told you to make a statement, but I didn't tell you to do no dumb shit, no dumb junk like that, you know."  But, you know, that was the only way I could get this guy's attention.  That's the only way I could get his attention, you know.  But you call it bullying nowadays, you know.  And, you know, it's--after that I had no more problems in Wendell Phillips grammar school.
Story_ID: 435384
Speaker 1: Went to high school, and my oldest brother, when we got to high school, my oldest brother was, I think he was a junior, you know.  And they knew we was, me and my twin brother [Jerry Drew] was--I was Denny's [James Drew] young brother, you know.  And at that time, you had what you call Gousters and Ivy Leaguers.  Y'all too young to know what that is, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Describe those for us.  Because I've heard the history around that.  But that's a famous Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Ivy League, the Ivy League guys were the guys who wore pants with no cuffs, and their cuffs, their pants looked like they had been in a flood, you know.  And the pants, the length of the pants were always above the ankle.  The Gousters were the ones who wore the pants with cuffs, and we always had like a half-inch or one-inch break in them.  We had Stacy Adams shoes, and we had the long collar, what you call it, and it was like you'd been to the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  The shirt, the edge of the shirt always lined with the belt and to the fly, you know.  It was like one seamless line, you know.  They wore the big cap, you know.  The Ivy Leaguers wore cordovans or they wore loafers, you know.  They were--
Speaker 2: It was more like the John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] style?  The Ivy Leaguers were more like him, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: The skinny ties?
Speaker 1: The skinny ties and all of that, yeah.  And that's, that's, that's what they did, you know.  And the Gousters were the cool ones, you know.  And when we went to--like on Friday nights at Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], they had activity night.  When we went to activity night and to the dances--they had dances in the girls' gym, you know.  And in the boys' gym they had basketball and volleyball, and the swimming pool was open.  And in the study halls, they had, on this side you could play dominoes, you could play chess, you could play checkers.  Over here, they had a number of other things, you know.  And then they had a second location where you could play volleyball, you know.  And it was always, activity night cost fifty cents to get in.  And on Friday nights, the majority of the kids that went to Wendell Phillips High School was at activity night.  We didn't hang out on the corner.  We had a place to go, you know.  And so, a lot of kids wasn't involved in gangs and things like that.  But I'll never forget, doggone-it, you could go to activity night in the basement.  And the Gousters, we were the slow dancers.  We were the cool ones, you know.  The Ivy Leaguers, oh, they'd be jumping around there, you know.  They were the happy-go-lucky guys, you know.  And the Gousters had the long collars, and didn't smile that much, you know, but we were real serious, you know, and had a toothpick in your mouth and stuff like that, and had the glasses, the tinted glasses and stuff like that, you know.  And the Ivy Leaguers, they wore the doggone skinny pants with no cuffs and then the blue blazers sometimes, double-breasted blazers and stuff, you know, with them old skinny ties and button-down shirts, you know.  So, that's the difference between the Ivy Leaguers and the Gousters, you know.
Speaker 2: Because you were a Gouster?
Speaker 1: I was a Gouster, because my oldest brother was a Gouster, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And see, every now and then I'd sneak into some of his Gouster clothes.  And he'd say, "Man, don't wear my stuff no more.  You know, I just wore that the other day, and people going to be looking at you, you know." You know, and I said, "Oh, okay then," and I'd sneak into something else, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 435385
Speaker 1: Now, you got in trouble a second time.  I heard about this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this is more serious than the first time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was, I think I had to have been probably a freshman or a sophomore.  And a guy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is about 1959, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '59 [1959], yeah.  And I messed around, and a guy--I messed around and they played--I never played the dozens, because I didn't know what the dozens was.  And the guy said something that he shouldn't have said about my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew], and I hit him.  And we were, we were in division, and we went at it.  And my division teacher, I forget his name, but he looked something like Clark Kent.  As a matter of fact, what's the guy's name that played Superman?  Reeves?
Speaker 1: Reeves [George Reeves], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he looked something like him.  And we went at it, you know.  And I messed around there and I went home, and they suspended me.  And they called down to Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad], which was at Roosevelt Road and Michigan [Avenue], on Indiana [Avenue], and said, "Mr. Drew [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew], your son Terry [HistoryMaker Terry Hillard], we're sending him home.  He's being suspended."  You know, and at that time you didn't have to come up and get your kid; they sent you home, so I went home.  So I'm thinking, oh, I'm going to be off for about a week or a week and a half, and I'm going to--what'cha call it--I'll just sit and watch TV all day, and ain't nobody going to be--.  Well, little did I know that I was going to catch hell, you know.  Well, I got suspended.  I think it was almost for about two weeks, you know, for fighting.  And the first thing mom said, she said, "What happened?"  I said, "Well, he said something that he shouldn't have said about you."  She said, "You know, as long as he didn't touch you.  Words--."  I said, "No, no, no."  I said, "I couldn't take this, you know."  And well, he called my mom a whore, you know, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that's a common, you know, reason for kids to fight--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in that era.
Speaker 2: And, and, and, she just didn't think that, you know, I should have went to war on that, you know.  And I said I should, you know.  So I got home, and she came home and then the old man came home.  They said, "You're going to be here, but here's what's going to happen, you know.  You're not just going to sit around and lay here, you know.  We're going to give you something to do."  And man, look here, I washed windows, I mopped the floors, swept the floors, and did all that every day, you know, doggone-it.  And we stayed on the third floor of 3702 [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], and the Jordans [ph.] were the--he was the janitor.  And every day, every morning, I had to sweep from our landing all the way down to the first floor on the back and the front.  I mean, it was something to do all the time.  And then I messed around and she had told Mr. Jordan, "If you need him to help you collect some of the garbage, put him to work, you know.  You ain't got to pay him, you know.  We just don't want him to stay in this doggone apartment for two weeks, or almost two weeks, and not do nothing."  And I said, man, you know, when I was through with them two weeks, I was through with it.  I said, "I ain't doing nothing else.  I am not doing not another thing.  I'm not doing nothing else, you know."  But that was, that was one of the reasons, you know.  It was, I figured, you know, that I'm going to go to war.  This guy called my--you know, and I didn't know what the dozens was about, you know, I'm telling you, even, you know, being at Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Because at grammar school [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] I never heard of it, and when I got to high school, that's a different story, you know.
Speaker 1: They didn't do that in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: No, oh, no, no.  You definitely wouldn't do nothing like that coming up in Tennessee.  Because, you know, with the majority of the kids in Tennessee, Mama was like God, man.  Mama was God, you know, and didn't nobody say nothing out of the way about your mama.  Those was fighting words, simple as that, you know.
Story_ID: 435386
Speaker 1: Speaking of God, now what about church?  Now did you, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was, down in South Fulton, Tennessee, we went to Olivet Baptist Church [sic.], you know.  And down there, you went to church--first, you went to Sunday school.  Sunday school was, there was like about a lag time between Sunday school and when church started; it was about thirty minutes.  So, you'd run home real quick and maybe eat some oatmeal or something and then go back to church.  And then you had to go back to church when church was over, and you'd come home and you'd eat dinner.  And then at night, I think it was the BYU [sic. Baptist Young People's Union of America (BYPU)].  I never understood what BYU meant, but it usually started about 5:30 or 6:00.  And then we'd go back to BYU, which lasted about an hour and a half.  And I've never forgot, they had a, somebody like the Five Blind Boys [Five Blind Boys of Mississippi] or the, you know, the gospel thing then.  And they came in and they gave a little concert at our church.  And I'm laying--you know, it was, it was like about eight, nine o'clock at night, and I'm laying on my oldest brother's [James Drew] shoulder and he's got his arm around me.  And the only thing I ever remember is somebody saying, "Well, raise your hand."  And I thought they said, "If you liked it, raise your hand."  But what he said was, "If you didn't like our performance, raise your hand."  And I shot my hand up, you know.  (Laughter) And my older brother popped me, pow, "Put your hand down," you know.  (Laughter) I said, "Well, he said if you like it--."  He said, "No.  He said if you didn't."  But I was half sleep, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: You all were in church a long time.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, man, we was in church a long time, yeah, yeah.  And down there, you know, it wasn't like, "Well, I'll go to Sunday school and I won't go to church."  No, you went, you went; that was demanded.  I remember when we first got up here from South Fulton, and one of the things--we were at 3616 South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] said, "You got your choice.  They got South Park Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois] with Reverend Williams [E.R. Williams, Sr.].  You can go to Reverend Williams' church which was no more than a block away.  You got Olivet [Olivet Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] with--."  He was head of--
Speaker 1: That was Jackson, wasn't it, Joseph Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Reverend Jackson, yeah, at Olivet Baptist at 31st [Street] and South Park.  Well, most of the guys that we hung out with, our friends, went to Olivet Baptist, so we went down there, you know.  And that's when we first got here, not knowing that when the snow comes, we didn't have no money to take no jitney down there; you had to walk.  And that was the biggest mistake that me and my twin [Jerry Drew] ever made, you know, and I'll never forget.  My mom said, "Okay, get up.  You got to go to church and go to Sunday school," and we footed it from 36th Street down to 31st Street, you know, going to Olivet Baptist Church to Sunday school and then to church.  We didn't, we didn't have to go to night service, you know, on Sunday night down there, you know.  But that's what it was.  My two sisters [Laraine Drew and Diane Drew], you know, they went to South Park Baptist, you know.
Speaker 1: Did the church invest a lot of energy in terms of developing your leadership potential at all?  Or--
Speaker 2: And I got to tell you.  I don't think so, you know.  We went to Sunday school and we went to church, and that was it.  It was, back in those days, I don't think it was--they had a youth choir, but it wasn't a lot of youth programs like it is now in a lot of the large churches; it just wasn't, you know.  And, and, and, and, I'd be lying to you if I tell you--the church really taught me, when it came down to my spiritual being, what to do.  Make sure you treat people with respect, you know, and try not to be a bad Christian.  But when it came down to my leadership ability and things like that, you know, I don't think the church played a big important part with that, you know.  I knew we had to be spiritual.  And up until, really up until I went to the [U.S.] Marine Corps, that's when I really was able to grasp this thing about church, you know.
Story_ID: 435387
Speaker 1: Now there's a couple of other things.  I know I read that you, you had a job with the newspaper, you--the Chicago American.
Speaker 2: The Chicago American, I used to work at the Chicago American.  Yeah, that was--and a lot of folks, young folks don't know what the Chicago American was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There were a lot of newspapers in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I used to deliver the afternoon paper, you know.  And I had from 35th Street to 39th Street on the west side of King Drive [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And I messed around and I did that probably for about a year.  And that was the one and only time that I got held up, you know.  When we delivered the paper on Friday, that was collection.  We would go and we would collect.  And I think it was like, about, I was at about 3812 or 3810.  It was about the middle of the block of 38th Street, before you get to 39th Street.  And, you know, the guy didn't want to rob me when I was near 35th Street because I didn't have the money.  He got me when I was almost at the end of my route, you know, on Friday, probably about 6:30 or 7:00, still kind of light outside.  And I'm ringing doorbells, and he comes up and he pulls a knife.  And he says, "Give me all the money you got in your pocket, and don't say a word, or I'm going to cut you."  And I said, "Well, what?"  He said, "Give me your money."  And he had this big old long knife, and I gave him all the money.  He said, "Empty all your pockets out."  So, to make sure I didn't keep nothing, I emptied the--pulled the pockets out, and pulled the back ones out.  And he made me pull up my doggone--so I didn't have no money down in here.  And I think, you know, my doggone collection thing probably wasn't no more than thirty-five or forty bucks, you know, but he took all my money.  And so then he said, "You stay here and don't leave for about five minutes," and he left.  But I got a good look at him.  So I walk out and I look up and down and don't see him.  And these crocodile tears are coming down my eyes.  So I walked to 39th Street and walked over--and our branch at that time was like 39th, right by the school, by Giles [Avenue] on the south end side of 39th Street.  And a guy by the name Ricky [ph.] was the, he and his brother was the branch manager.  Ricky was a little short, dark-skinned guy, but built like a, I mean he was built, you know.  And I said, "Ricky," I said, "I just got held up."  He said, "What?"  I said, "I just got held up."  So he said, "Come on."  So all the older guys, about five of them, they came back and I showed them where it was.  And they were off to the side and they started watching.  What I didn't know was that the prior two weeks, two other kids had got held up, you know.  And they said, "Okay then."  So they said, "Don't worry about it, you know."  And I said, "Man, I ain't going to get paid."  He said, "Don't worry about it."  Well, about a week later I come into the doggone thing, and they said, "We got the guy."  I said, "What?"  They said, "We got the guy, yeah.  He was trying to hold up one of the other guys, you know."  And I'll just leave it at that.  I'll just leave it that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they--
Speaker 2: I stayed at that what'cha call it about another six months, and then, you know, I said I don't want to do this no more, you know.  But during that time, we never had any more robberies of our doggone, of our young men delivering the Chicago American, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you say that the justice was administered by the newspaper (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay, yeah, justice was administered by the older guys from our branch, yeah, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you think in retrospect that their justice was worse than what the guy would have got from the police department (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, these guys were--because they always had a bunch of baseball bats around the doggone, the branch, you know.  There wasn't no guns or no knives, but they had baseball bats, you know.  And that's good, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 435388
Speaker 1: Now, you also worked for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] for a minute, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Worked for the NAACP right there at 3858 or, yeah, 3856 South Park avenue [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And first, my twin brother [Jerry Drew] had the job, and then he started getting in so much after-school activity, you know.  And then I took it, he gave it to me.
Speaker 1: Was he still considered like smarter than you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, he always--not considered, he was.  I knew that, and he knew that, and everybody else knew that, you know.  But I took over the job there and messed around and I must have worked there for a couple of years as an office boy; running errands and going out and taking the checks out for--Reverend Carl Fuqua [Carl A. Fuqua] was the executive director, and I'd take the checks out to Dempsey Travis [HistoryMaker Dempsey J. Travis].  His office was on 47th Street.  So he'd sign the paychecks and then bring them and put them in my shirt, you know, my tee shirt.  And a lot of times I'd come back and they'd be wet and all of that, you know.  Because I didn't want to put them in my pocket because I didn't want nobody to take them from me, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: This is the now famous Dempsey Travis.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: The real estate millionaire (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and author.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But he was, he was the, you know, the president, and he was one of the people who signed them.  And Mr. Davis [ph.], you know, what was Davis' name?  Was it Cornell?  Davis was one of the folks I used to have to take the checks to get signed also, you know.  And almost, when I was probably getting ready to, I was still working and I was getting ready to graduate, I think from high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And that's when the NAACP decided that we're going to integrate Rainbow Beach [Rainbow Beach Park, Chicago, Illinois].  And I went out, and I'm going to go out there with them to integrate Rainbow Beach, and I got arrested.
Story_ID: 435389
Speaker 1: Tell us about what happened?  Now, it's described pretty good in the book ['Chicago Police: An Inside View, The Story of Superintendent Terry G. Hillard,' Thomas J. Jurkanin with Terry G. Hillard].  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--Yeah, well, as I can remember, we went out to Rainbow Beach [Rainbow Beach Park, Chicago, Illinois] and messed around.  And they told people to leave, you know, and we said we wasn't going to leave (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you carrying signs and stuff?
Speaker 2: Yeah, carrying signs and all of that, you know.  And I'll never forget this, salt and pepper team, this black and white policeman.  I don't know if they were detectives, but they were in civilian dress, you know.  And they said, "Young man, you need to put that sign down and you need to get on out of here, you know.  Because, you know, you're not supposed to be out here."  And we said, "No, this is a public beach, and we're allowed to be out here."  And that's what they were saying.  And so I got arrested along with a number of other folks, you know.  And they took us, I'll never forget.  Rainbow Beach was like out by 79th [Street] and the lake [Lake Michigan], but they took us to a station down in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], right off of Lake Park [Lake Park Avenue] or whatever it was, because they had a police station down there.  And they put us in there, and I got to make one phone call.  And I called and wasn't nobody at home, and then so the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] sent somebody by the house and they messed around and told my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew].  And they came by and the NAACP got us out, you know, they put up the bond money and all that.  But I'll never forget the one black policeman told me, he said, "Before you leave here, you know, we're going to show you, you know, the proper way to treat policemen, you know."  I said, "Oh, Lord, I know I'm getting ready to get my butt whipped," you know.  But I just got one slap upside the head, and that was it.  I got out of there and went to, went home.  And the first thing the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] was saying, "I just got one question to ask you, just one question.  You don't know how to swim, do you?"  And I said, "No, I don't."  "What the hell were you doing out there then, if you don't know how to swim?  Suppose they said they was going to open up the beach to you?  You don't know how to swim.  What were you doing out there?"  Well, you know, the old man--you know, like I say, in his own right he, you know, he would always say what he had to say.  But he wasn't a civil rights buff, you know, especially with people going out and getting arrested and things.  And he said, "Stay away from that place.  Let them get somebody else to go out there.  You don't need to be arrested, you know.  We got too many other things going on this household to be worried about you getting arrested."  I said "Okay, then," you know.  But the NAACP put up the bond.  And then when we went to court, they threw it out, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was it.  But that was my first encounter with the Chicago Police Department, you know, when it come down to going into--
Story_ID: 435390
Speaker 1: The pastor of your church--now this is a big church.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you didn't have a real big role in it, but--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Joseph Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] was kind of a--
Speaker 2: Controversial figure.
Speaker 1: Opposition to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] president.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The largest black organization in the world.
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He turned, you know, against Dr. King.  But the whole organization split I think in '61 [1961] as a result of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear him talk about the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: No, I never did, you know.  And you have to realize, you know, like I said, the only youth programs they had was like the youth choir.  And they didn't have this youth ministry and all that back in that time.  Really, the majority of time the church back in those days, especially Olivet Baptist [Olivet Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], it was geared towards the older folks, you know.  And we went to Sunday school, and after Sunday school we went to church.  And at church, you know, you sat there and you listened and you were quiet, you know.  And when church was over you were expected to, you know, to put whatever you had to put in church and then be seen but not heard, you know.  That's the best I can describe it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't really realize until hearing Mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] talk to, I think some of the, her sisters or some of the people in the building, you know, about the split, you know, and that Reverend Jackson did not support Dr. King, you know.  She said, "Yeah, my kids, my two twins [HistoryMaker Terry Hillard and Jerry Drew], my twins go to church down there, you know."  And, and, and that's the way it was, you know.  But that caused--as we grew older, we were able to look at that situation.  That caused a huge split in the black spiritual community, a huge split, you know.  And, and, I'll never forget when they changed the address of the church from being at 30--3101 or whatever it was, King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  You know, he changed it to East 31st Street or something like that, because he didn't want to use King Drive, you know, in the address, you know.  And looking back at trivial things, you know, and people should have been bigger than that, you know.
Story_ID: 435391
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about--now, there was one other big incident before high school was over with.  Now, you were taking--were you taking the college prep course or the general course?  Or what course were you taking in high school?  Or did they have those then?
Speaker 2: I, right before you're getting ready to graduate, you go see your counselor.  And I went to see my counselor, and this is when I'm getting ready to graduate from grammar school [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And I told the lady I wanted to go to, I'd heard about Dunbar Vocational [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wanted to go down there and learn some, become an auto mechanic or something.  They said, "No, you don't have that.  You need to just go to high school and then from high school, be done with it."  I went to--I'm glad I did go to Wendell Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I went to Wendell Phillips and was getting ready to see my counselor, and I'm thinking about going to college.  I knew my twin brother [Jerry Drew] was going to college, but I didn't know anything about me.  And she said, "You know, what you need to do, you need to go take some type of vocation.  College is not in your, it's not in your future."  She said, "I just don't think you have it to go to college, you know."
Speaker 1: Now prior to this, hadn't you been put out of the house for a while?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, what'cha call it.  Yeah, yeah, I messed around I got involved with a situation where me and the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] had a run-in, you know.  And you're talking about when I went to the Audy Home [Arthur J. Audy Home; Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: I didn't know that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I went to the Audy Home for about two days, you know, because I was just--man, I'm telling you.
Speaker 1: That was a reform school here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, over on Roosevelt Road.  And I messed around and went and stayed with an aunt and uncle for a while.  And then my oldest brother [James Drew], you know, he had his own place.  And I messed around and I'm getting ready to graduate.  So I went to, went to stay with him, you know, and then I went to work for Seagram distillers [Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc.].  And really, the old man said, "You got to leave here.  If you ain't going to do what I ask you to do, you got to leave here, you know."
Speaker 1: So, what were you doing that made him so upset?
Speaker 2: One of the things is I was hanging around with a bunch of guys on a Friday.  And I think one or two times they dumped me on the back porch, and I was sloppy drunk, sloppy drunk, you know.  And he said, "You ain't bringing nothing into this house.  You can't come home like this.  You ain't supposed to be drinking."  And this happened not one time, but two or three times.  He said, "You got to leave here, you know."  And I was at the age when I was getting ready to graduate anyway, you know.  He said, "You got to leave here."  So I went and stayed with my brother, if that's the one you're talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And you know what?  And for a while there was a little friction there, you know, after I--especially after I went to the [U.S.] Marine Corps and really got all of that out of my system and learned how to be a young man, and mature, you know.  So if it was me, I would have done the same thing.  If it was my son, I would have done the same thing. "You're either going to--." And that was one thing, he didn't ask for a lot, "Just go by my rules and regulations, you know.  This is my house, you know, and you're going to go by what I say do.  If you can't go by how I want you to do, then you got to get out."
Story_ID: 435392
Speaker 1: Did you work for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] very long after that arrest?
Speaker 2: I probably for about another three or four months.  Because he was, the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] was very adamant. He wanted me out of there, you know.  Yeah, he just didn't think that, you know, that somebody who's in high school should be getting arrested.  You know, that's just the way he, you know, we had folks down in these--these college kids and all that was getting arrested, you know.  But he just didn't think somebody my age should be--especially when you didn't know how to swim--be out trying to integrate Rainbow Beach [Rainbow Beach Park, Chicago, Illinois], you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, did you really--you were really like invested in trying to change--I mean to do that when you were doing it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you know, the NAACP, it taught me a lot of the things that I really didn't know about, and a lot of it I didn't know when I went to Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  There was a lot they didn't even teach us at Wendell Phillips when it came down to race; when it came down to, you know, how black folks was getting treated across the country and things, you know.  And being able to, especially to read some of those doggone histories and some of those cases that they had, you know, it taught me a lot, you know.  And, and, and it opened my eyes to the number of affronts that the NAACP and the different lawyers and activists and advocates across this country was trying to change; you know, the way black folks was being treated.
Speaker 1: Now, was there like a particular person that was kind of like a mentor for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Arlene Wallington [ph.].  Arlene Wallington, she was the office manager there.  But she was like the go-to person, you know, she ran that office, you know.  And, and, and, I mean a beautiful lady, you know.  Not only did she take care of my twin [Jerry Drew], but she took care of myself, and she schooled us, you know, about the dos and don'ts, and the reasons things were being done the way they was being done, you know.  They improved a lot of, not only black folks here in Chicago [Illinois], but across the country, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your impression of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in those days?  I mean, and the community's impression?  I think some people would be surprised to know how people actually felt in those days about--I think people loved him, but they didn't necessarily want to be in the line of fire like that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, see, when I was at that age, you know, I liked what Dr. King was doing.  But after my doggone arrest at Rainbow Beach, you know, and going through, going to jail and all of that, that wasn't my cup of tea.  I didn't want to, you know, I just didn't--you know, and then going to the Audy Home [Arthur J. Audy Home; Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, Chicago, Illinois], I didn't want to be involved with nothing like that, you know.  That's all there is to it, you know.  And I kind of shied away, you know.  My main thing is I really didn't want to have nothing else to do with law enforcement, with the police, you know.
Story_ID: 435393
Speaker 1: That's the reason-that, the rest of that time I spent with Seagram distillers [Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc.] down there--because you gotta  realize being an office boy at Seagram distillers, I had access to every type of alcohol that could be, you know, at my disposal.  Because we packed alcohol up and gave it to some--I ain't going to tell you the politicians.  But we sent out the--you know (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's part of the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was part of the thing when Christmastime came around, you know.  And, and, but we also, you know, we got to take a little ourselves, you know.  And, and after that, I said I don't want to have nothing else to do with the police department, you know, so I'm getting my act together.  And then when my oldest brother [James Drew] got drafted into the [U.S.] Army, I said, "This is my key."  I joined the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  And when I told the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew] and my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] that I was going into the Marine Corps, you know, they kind of looked, you know.  And he said, "Well, it might be good for you."  My mom didn't particularly care for it, you know, because Vietnam [Vietnam War] had just started, you know.  And I said "This is going to be good."
Speaker 2: This is like '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: It hadn't got--
Speaker 1: It hadn't got started, no, but they were sending folks over there, you know.  And, but, and one of the things she said was, "Why the Marine Corps?"  You know, that's one of the things she said.  And I swear, you know, I said, "I went to the Army and I looked at their recruiting.  I went to the [U.S.] Navy and I went to the [U.S.] Air Force."  I said, "I don't want to be in the Navy because that's got to do with them ships and stuff like that."  And I said, "The Marine Corps makes a man out of you, that's what they say.  And I think this is," you know, and she said, "Okay." (Background noise) You want to hold off a minute?
Speaker 2: But that was it, you know.  And I went to the Marine Corps and I had a piece of wood (background noise). It taught me how to be a man.
Story_ID: 435394
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  You were shipped to San Diego [California], right?
Speaker 2: San Diego, and I'll never forget, I'm telling you.  I get there like about eleven or twelve o'clock at night, at MCRD [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California].  And we got off this doggone bus, it's probably about a hundred and fifty of us.  And you look down at the ground, and they got these little yellow footprints, left and right.  And the drill instructor said--at that time they could talk to you, and I don't want to say it on the thing.  But, "A-H to belly button.  Put your feet on those doggone, find you a pair of yellow markers, put your feet on it, and don't say a word."  And so I find it and I put my feet on it.  And the guy next to me, he wants to take my mine.  I said, "No, this is right, that's left.  Your foot's supposed to be there."  And he's trying to take mine.  The guy walks over to both of us, and he puts his white nose to my black nose, I mean just like that.  And he said, "If you say one more thing, I'm going to put this twelve up that doggone brown rectum of yours.  Didn't I say not to speak?"  And so I was getting ready to tell him that this guy didn't know.  And he said, "No, I said not to speak."  His nose was on my nose.  That's when I got my initiation into the Marine Corps.  And brother, I tell you, for the next three days I was--they say you're shell shocked.  I was like what the hell have I done?  I done left my mama [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] and my brother [Jerry Drew] and sisters [Laraine Drew and Diane Drew].  And the MCRD, I don't know if you know it.  This is MCRD right here.  And at the end of MCRD is the San Diego International Airport [San Diego, California], and you see these big old jets taking off going back east.  And for a doggone eleven, no, about twelve to fourteen weeks, every night I'd get up at doggone two o'clock, "Sir, the private here requests permission to speak to the platoon."  The instructor says, "Speak." "Sir, the private here requests permission to use the head."  You had to go the bathroom and you'd stand there using the bathroom, and you're looking at these doggone jets and things, man.  I said, man, I sho wish I was one of them going back home, because this ain't what I bargained for.  But that's the boot camp, it was a different story, you know.  But that was my initiation into the boot camp with this white drill instructor, man.  He made it known that doggone day that, "We run it.  When we say be quiet, we mean be quiet.  You have to even ask permission if you want to break wind.  You got to ask permission, you know.  If you want to go and use the doggone bathroom, whether it's number one or number two, first you got to ask permission to even speak to us.  Then you got to ask permission to go use the bathroom, you know."  So, that was my initiation into the United States Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: So, so, you went from a fairly disciplined household to a super-disciplined regimen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, it wasn't super-disciplined.  This was--what word is it?  What's that--?
Speaker 1: Ultimate?
Speaker 2: When you're the only--well, I forget the name of the word.  But it's, "What I say, goes.  I don't even want to even see what you're thinking or hear what you're thinking.  If I tell you to jump off that cliff, you don't even look back.  You just jump off that cliff, you know."  That's the type of discipline it was back in 1963, you know.  And, and, and, and, and that's what I needed.  That's what I needed.
Speaker 1: But you got through training?
Speaker 2: I got through the training, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With flying colors, you know, especially after about the first week or so, of getting over being shell-shocked and, you know, afraid, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, this is 1963.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: The [U.S.] Army has been integrated about twenty years, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or just about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But the Marine Corps still had its issues, you know.  But like I said it was the, that was the best thing that not only happened to me, but to any black, white, or Hispanic young man that was going through the Marine Corps, you know.  We had a few women that would come through there, you know.  But if it was a troubled young man and he wanted to turn his life around, the Marine Corps was the best thing that could happen to him.
Speaker 1: Some would say--
Speaker 2: Well, I--let's put it this way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --for [HistoryMaker] Terry Hillard, this is the best thing that could have happened for Terry Hillard, you know.
Story_ID: 435395
Speaker 1: I mean, some would say it's the most dangerous branch of the service (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're more likely to get killed in it than any other branch, and--
Speaker 2: Well, and I'm a believer in this.  It's that when the man upstairs have decided for you to come home, you know, it can happen right here with me sitting here talking to you, you know.  So when your time comes, your time has come.  There's no way you can avoid it, you know, whether in the [U.S.] Army or the [U.S.] Marine Corps or something like that.  They used to always tell you that if you're a machine gunner, the life expectancy of a machine gunner in combat is like ten, fifteen minutes, you know.  If you adhere to your training, like I tell young cops out here, if you adhere to your training, whether you're in law enforcement--there's a good possibility that you're going to be able to retire.  But it's those folks, you know, who sometimes they get out there and become mavericks, you know, and want to push the envelope, you know.  And, but I'm a huge believer that when your time has come, your time has come, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any trepidation about the war [Vietnam War] when it was going on?
Speaker 2: No, because--and I got to say, they brainwash you.  We went over there thinking that these little old folks, ain't no way in the world can they measure up to what we're bringing to bear over there, you know.  And we, we, we're the Marines, you know.  We've been talking about the United States Marine Corps, and we got some of the best training there was.  Well, what we didn't realize is when they come, you can have all the training you want to.  But when it comes down to training, when it comes down to experience, these people been fighting for twenty or twenty-five years, you know, generation after generation after generation.  And they knew how to fight in the jungle; they knew their stuff, you know.  And, and, after a while, you know, it's a different mindset, you know.  Am I going to--the biggest thing is to make up in your mind--my mindset was I came over here, I'm going home.  And I'm going home the way I came over here, walking under my own strength, you know.  And you had a lot of guys, they'd go out and they'd be sitting on the perimeter at nighttime, you know, and they messed around there and was going to sleep you know; guys going out on patrol and might, you know, smoke a joint or two.  I didn't do none of that, man.  You need all of your faculties, all of your senses to get through this, you know.  Because the folks that you was fighting, you know, they knew their stuff.  That was their training, you know.  And when they said dig a foxhole, I dug a manhole.  When they said dig a trench, I dug a cave, you know.  Simple as that, you know.  And guys who were in the service used to tell me, and they'll tell you.  We'd go in there and we'd say, "We're going to be here for the night."  And the first sergeant would say, "Okay."  And we'd hear a gunshot, and, "Okay, let's dig holes."  Mine was down in and down again, you know, because I wanted to go home, you know.  Like everybody else, you know, you're afraid.  But, you know, if you want to go home, then put some energy into it, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It sounds like you're learning something about yourself in this stressful situation.  You say some people would smoke a joint or do something else (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that.
Speaker 1: --but you wouldn't do--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't need nothing like that, you know.  My, my, my main thing was I want to go home.  And in order for me to go home, you know, I need all the senses and all my faculties working in cohesion, you know.
Story_ID: 435396
Speaker 1: The Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] are sent in to go into the thick of the fight first.  Now, is that how they deployed you all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because I was 0331 [MOS 0331], I was a machine gunner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 0311 [MOS 0311] is what we called a grunt.  That's what the [U.S.] Army called an infantryman, but we call them the grunts, you know; that's infantry, a rifleman, you know.  And the majority of people in the Marine Corps are 0311s or 0331, you know.  That's the backbone, that's the core of the Marine Corps; the ground troops, you know.  And that's what they did, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your unit?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I started out, I was Charlie 1/5.  I went from, I got over to, went over to Vietnam as Charlie 1/5, Charlie Company, First Battalion, Fifth Marines [Fifth Marine Regiment].  And then I got over there I went to Golf 2/9, Golf Company, Second Battalion, Ninth Marines [Ninth Marine Regiment].  And I wound up in Lima 3/3, Lima Company, Third Battalion, Third Marines [Third Marine Regiment].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your encounters with the North Vietnamese.  And it may have even been the South Vietnamese.  Were you sure who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it mostly was the Vietcong, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: That's what it was.  I was on a lot of, a lot of patrols, you know, search and destroy missions, you know, being in an environment like where the temperature is 110, 112 degrees with a doggone 60, 70, and 80 pound pack on, helmet, you know, with this big old--you know, like now they got the M14 or the AR15.  We had the M14s, a hell of a weapon, but just heavy, you know.  And walking through the doggone rice paddies, you know, everything from leeches to doggone buffalos charging you.  And I'll never forget when we was in the hut one time, and messed around and me and my machine gun team looked up and saw a viper.  It's probably one of the most poisonous snakes in the doggone, in Vietnam.  And one of the guys ran straight through the doggone straw hut, and you know, I ran out the front door.  We left our weapons and our machetes and everything in there.  Didn't nobody want to--you didn't mind getting shot, but you don't want to get bit by no viper, you know.  That's this snake, yeah.  And you know, you got to say the Vietcong, the enemy, even the Vietnamese, are very cunning, very experienced, and can be very deadly when it came down to--nowadays, our guys have to put up with what we call IEDs [improvised explosive device].  At that time we had the booby traps, you know, everything from the bamboo sticks that had human excrement on it, and urine and stuff like that, you know, to the big swing trap that would come out of the tree and hit guys in the head, you know.  And, you know, you had to be on your, you had to be on your Ps and Qs, you know.  That's the reason I never could understand how guys, you know, had to get, some of the guys would go out and smoke reefer, and then they're going into an environment like this, where no telling where you step or where you go, something might come out of the tree and hit you in the head or something, or you might fall into a doggone pit with all these bamboo sticks and all of that, you know.  And then you know, one time when we was up north, up by Chu Lai [Vietnam], when a doggone sniper hit probably about four or five black Marines, you know, that's in like a three-day period, you know.  That sends a message to you, you know.  And one of the things about a sniper, a sniper can put fear into a doggone squad or company or battalion, you know.  There's somebody who's long range and picking off people one at a time.  But when they pick off four black Marines, you know, you're wondering am I going to be next, you know?  And, and, and, and that's the reason they say when the enemy, when you come up on a sniper, you know, you do any and everything you can.  You make sure he's not taken prisoner, you know.  You make sure that you get rid of him, you know.  Because he can, one or two snipers can pin down a company or a doggone battalion, you know, if they got the strategic advantage, you know.  And so, you know, that was the biggest fear, you know, of getting hit by somebody, you know, that you don't even see; you don't even hear it coming, you know.  The bullets are fired, and you don't even hear it, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: That's, yeah, so you were there thirteen months?
Speaker 2: I was there thirteen months (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 435397
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was a little longer, because I was one of those, I refused to take out a savings bond.  I had all kind of allotments coming home to my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew], you know, and I'm trying to help my--because at that time when I went, we had more kids in the family, you know.  I think it was three or four, you know, and I wanted to help Mom and the old man [Hillard's stepfather, Alfonzo Drew].  And the first sergeant was very adamant.  He wanted 100 percent of doggone participation in getting 100 percent in the savings bonds program.  And out of the company I was in at that time, I think it was only me and one other guy, and they had threatened to keep me over for a couple extra months.  I think they might have kept me for a couple of weeks or so like that, you know.  And I got a letter.  My mom wrote me every day.  At times I'd get fourteen, fifteen, sixteen letters at one time.  But she wrote me every day that I was in Vietnam.  And I remember she said, "You're supposed to be home."  So I think I was probably about a week or two weeks late.  "You're supposed to be home."  And I wrote her back and told her.  And when I got home she said, "That was the dumbest thing you've ever done."  Pow! (Gesture) You know.
Speaker 2: She was really worried about you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you know, not to take out a doggone savings bond.  When you get home, you can cancel the thing.  But no, you know, that's that--I think that's--not principled; that's being not arrogant, but being hardheaded, you know.  "This is my money, and can't nobody tell me how to allocate my money.  I don't want no savings bonds."  You know, so take the saving bond out, and when you get back to the states, you can cancel that doggone thing.  She said, "That's the dumbest thing you've ever done in your life, you know."  And she was right, you know.  So, but I was glad to get home, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you came back, this is 1965, I guess?
Speaker 1: Really, it was about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-four [1964]?
Speaker 1: The latter part of '65 [1965].  Yeah, I think that's when.  Because I got out in '67 [1967].  I think it was '66 [1966] or '67 [1967], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you got back, were you stationed someplace else?
Speaker 1: I went to Camp Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina].  I went to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, that's where I was stationed at, yeah.  Because you got to realize, I was a West Coast Marine, you know.  It's a different thing now.  People who go through Parris Island [Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, Parris Island, South Carolina] and people who go to San Diego [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California], you know, there's a rivalry between them.  You know, you got the two--there's a huge rivalry between, you know, the Parris Island Marines and the doggone MCRD Marines [Marine Corps Recruit Depot], you know, yeah.  You know, they call us the Hollywood Marines, you know, yeah.  So, but I went back there, and for about--I was a sergeant E-5.  And I went back there and the--well, I was sergeant E-4 when I went there, and when I got there I became sergeant E-5.  And it was one of those things where some of the guys, you know, said "Oh, this is another one of these Hollywood Marines," until he found out what I knew and what I'd been through.  Then I didn't have no problems after that, you know.
Story_ID: 435398
Speaker 1: For the most part did you, were--it's been written that a disproportionate number of black soldiers got killed in Vietnam.  Well, how did you feel about the race relations in the deployment of people in, you know, the makeup (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, you didn't worry about deploying people.  All you wanted was a body next to you.  I didn't give a damn whether it was black, white, Hispanic.  I didn't care what it was, as long as we had a body next to us, and they had a rifle and knew how to use it, you know. That's what we wanted, you know.  You know, you knew that you had a, you had racism in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  But folks, when you're in war--me, personally, I saw when we was in Vietnam, guys knew that in order for them to make it off of a doggone patrol, off an ambush, whether he was white or black, well, he needed the input of everybody.  That's what we needed.  We needed the input of everybody, and that's what we were going to do, you know.  And once we was back in the back, if you want to exhibit your biases and your racism, not only black, but the whites too--you know, your idiosyncrasies--you know, you could do that.  But when we were out there on patrol and we was doing the business we'd been taught, you know, you leave that crap back there in the rear, you know.  Because the only way that we're going to make it back is we make it back as a team and we operate as a team, you know.  And I think the Marine Corps, they was trying to address it, you know.  But they know they can only address it at a slower pace than what should have been, you know.  Because you had some folks and some officers and some noncoms, you know, who really thought it should have been status quo.  But, you know, they knew there was, that change was coming, you know.
Story_ID: 435399
Speaker 1: Now, how did you feel about the political debate about the war [Vietnam War]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what?  There were pros and cons, you know.  I was there, I was in the [U.S.] Marine Corps, and our allegiance was to the Marine Corps and to the United States of America, you know.  And at that time, you know, you looked at the young college kids who'd never been there, and they didn't know what we was going through; and then when we got back, the way we was treated, you know.  But this was a country where everybody was able to express their rights.  I was over there fighting so they could express their rights against the war, you know.  So, you know, I can feel about it one way or the other, you know.  If I'd gotten sent back over there for a second term, a second tour, I would have went back and done it, you know.  But that's what it was about, you know.  And we knew.  And we got training, and people would come and tell us there's a lot of folks out there who don't agree with the war, they don't agree with what you're doing.  When you get back to the states, here's the possibility of the way you're going to be treated, you know.  So, just be aware of that.  But what you do, you make sure that you're calm, you're collected, and don't do anything dumb.
Story_ID: 435400
Speaker 1: So you were at Camp Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina].  And you had made sergeant E-5 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sergeant E-5, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are there any other experiences from the [U.S.] Marine Corps we need to talk about before we get you out of the Marines?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I think the Marine Corps, I'll never forget when I was going through the second ITR [infantry training regiment]; this is after boot camp.  And I'd never fired a rifle before, you know.  And I was trying to, and I wanted to be an expert, you know, not just a marksman, I wanted to be an expert.  And the doggone, all the time and all the things that the instructors went through, I left being a marksman and later on became an expert, you know.  But with the trials and tribulations that they put you through when you're on that rifle range, you know, it was amazing, you know.  They didn't want you to be able to hit something at a fifty yards or a hundred yards.  They wanted you to be able to hit something at three hundred or five hundred yards, you know.  And for a lot of guys, seeing some of the guys that went through there, and some of the psychological problems guys had when it came to that doggone rifle range, not being able to--some of them not being able to pass, you know.  It was, some of them, it was devastating to them, coming through boot camp.  And guys got kicked out because they couldn't do fifteen or twenty pull-ups, or couldn't do doggone twenty-five or thirty sit-ups, and couldn't run a mile in so many minutes, you know.  It was huge, you know, and guys were drummed out of the Marine Corps because they couldn't pass the doggone physical, you know.  That's what it was, you know.  But I was, I guess I was lucky and I was blessed, and I had the good Lord on my side, you know.  After overcoming that doggone, that rifle qualification, I did it, you know.  I think that the big thing with the Marine Corps in Vietnam is, like I said about that sniper.  But it was a guy who came through boot camp with us and all that, a guy by the name of, from Detroit [Michigan] named Bell [ph.].  And, you know, coming through Tennessee, through Chicago [Illinois], I'd heard of folks dying, like the two folks who got drowned, but never seeing one of our guys, somebody that I know, get killed with a doggone gun.  And to see Bell laying there, you know, with a doggone bullet, you know, that's when it finally came home, you know, that this stuff is for real, you know.  This goes far and beyond what they taught us in boot camp.  You know, we are the baddest suckers out here.  It's some folks out here that's a lot more better trained and a lot more badder than we are, you know; they're on an even keel.  And you'd better adhere to your training, and you'd better do what folks who know what to do--you better do what they tell you to do, because if you don't, you're going to wind up like Bell.
Story_ID: 435401
Speaker 1: I think we're talking about the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and the end of the--so when did you, when were you discharged from the Marines?
Speaker 2: I was discharged from Camp Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina], I think it was 19--, like August or July of 1967.  And it was time to get out of there, and for about the last couple of months I'd been like a practical joke.  And the first thing the first sergeant told me, he said--he brought me in, I'm getting ready to eat lunch.  And then after I eat lunch I'm going to say good-bye, and I'm going to get in my little old Volkswagen and come home.  And he said, "Sergeant Hillard [HistoryMaker Terry Hillard], let me just tell you one thing.  I've got some intel that when you get ready to leave here, that you might do a little streaking."  He said, "Let me just tell you one thing."  He said, "About four miles to the gate, if you do some dumb stuff like that, you're going to be in the brig."  (Laughter) I said, "No, I'm not.  I don't know who told you that, but I'm not doing any streaking," you know.  And it's time to go, and I said my goodbyes and I left there.  It took me, probably to get to the front gate, it must have took me close to about thirty minutes, which would normally be about like about a five or six minute ride.  It took me--you know, because I went around and looked at as much of the base as I could, because I thought about staying in.  I thought about being a lifer.  And my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] said--she wrote and then she told me to call.  And she said, "Look, you been gone for four years, almost four years.  You was in Vietnam for thirteen months and something."  She said, "Why don't you come on home?  You got young brothers and young sisters that you need to help with.  Come home and do your share, you know."  And, and, she said, "Find a job here."  So I told her, I said, "Well, when I come home I think I'm going to become a, I'll try for the Illinois State Police."  She said, "Don't go with the Illinois State Police.  If you become an Illinois State policeman, then they're going to send you to southern Illinois and northern Illinois, or eastern or western."  She said, "Become a Chicago [Illinois] policeman so you can stay here and help with your young brothers and sisters, you know, like I said, you know."  I said, "Okay."  So I came home, and I still went down there.  I was going to try for the Illinois State Police.  And I got there and I said, "You know what?  I better do what Ma said."  And I went and put the application in for the Chicago Police [Chicago Police Department].
Story_ID: 435402
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this.  Now, it seems to me that about that time--and we've interviewed some of the other people like [HistoryMaker] Renault Robinson and others--was the Chicago Police Department, you know, pushing to bring more black officers on board during that time period?  Because it seems like a lot of people were coming on.  Schoolteachers had quit their jobs and joined (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but it was reluctantly, you know, reluctantly, yeah, you know.  It wasn't like they was in the black community, like we did when I was superintendent, recruiting for minorities; but reluctantly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because there was some kind of decree, wasn't there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a consent decree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Judge Marshall, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I messed around there and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Ernest Marshall [sic. Prentice Marshall], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so I messed around there and I went and put my name in.  And I just happened to see one of the guys who was a precinct captain for Dawson [William L. Dawson].  He said, "Well, if you want to become a policeman, you need to go down and see the congressman and all that, you know."  I said, "Well, why do I need to see the congressman, you know?"  "Well, just go see the congressman, you know, and they will--." I said, "Why do I need to see the congressman?  I'm just going to take a test, a whatchamacallit, you know."  And being naive, just out of the [U.S.] Marine Corps, you know, I didn't realize it at the time.  But after a couple of days and I'm telling a couple of people, they say, "Well, how much money you got?"  I said, "I ain't got no money.  I left the Marine Corps, and I think I must have left there with about three or four hundred bucks [dollars], you know."  And they said, "Well, it might be what--."  I said, "No, I ain't giving nobody no money for no job.  I ain't paying nobody for no job."  So, I got on the police department, and I didn't see nobody and didn't ask nobody, you know.  But contrary to the popular belief, they said, "Well, they're going to exclude you because you don't have a sponsor."  I said, "What do you mean?"  I said, "I was in the Marine Corps for four years; I was in Vietnam, you know."  "No, you don't have a sponsor.  You need a sponsor.  And if you don't pass the test," he said, "they're going to get you because of your feet."  And what was that, having to do with your arch?  You've got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fallen arches?
Speaker 2: -fallen arches, you know.  I said, "I ain't got no fallen arches."  He said, "Well, let the doctor, the medical doctor, you know--."  I said, "Man, I ain't got no--."  I said, "I got my doggone thing from the Marine Corps."  I told him, "I came out in perfect health, you know.  And I went through, and didn't nobody ask me--I went through the medical, and they didn't knock me out, you know."
Speaker 1: So, these are the common things they were excluding people for (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, fallen arches and things.  Oh, man, it was just a rash of things, especially when it came down to minorities, you know.
Story_ID: 435403
Speaker 1: I think you probably should tell the story about the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] though, first, before we get you in there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: You had your application in, and you were like serving as a bus driver for a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I went.  I forgot all about that.  Because that was a big episode.  I went to become a CTA bus driver, and I did it for a number of months.  And the day that I really got fed up was when they had the machine where you could only put tokens and quarters in, on Lawrence Avenue.  And I had a swinging load.  A swinging load is where they're standing up and they're right there on top of you.  Everybody's sitting down.  And my leader, the guy in front of me, who was supposed to be like five or six minutes ahead of me, he probably had three--well, he was running fast, he was running hot, so he wasn't getting his load.  And I was getting his load, my load, and probably the guy's load behind me, you know, that's how far we were behind.  And we got to Lawrence and Kimball [Avenue], and that's where, you know, where they got the "L" [elevated train] and things, the subway and all of that.  And something hit me, I said, "This is it."  So I took the changer, and I took my ten dollars that I had for my change--you start out with ten dollars--my bank.  I took my ten dollars out of the thing and put it back up there.  Badge 6384, I put it on the little thing there, and put the puncher on the thing, and took one of their dimes and called.  I said, "This is Badge 6384."  I said, "You got a swinging load left.  I'm at Lawrence and Kimball.  We probably, to get to the end of the line, we probably got another ten or fifteen blocks to go.  You better send somebody out here.  I quit."  That's what I--I was just fed up with it.  Because people was getting in, they were getting on.  And I said, "No, no, don't put the--."  They was putting nickels and dimes and pennies in the machine.  So that means you got to collect the fare by hand.  And the more fare I was collecting, the more behind I was getting on my schedule, you know.  And I said, "You know, this ain't right, you know."  So I said--and this was like early in the morning.  So, I just left.  I went home and I told my mom [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew], I said, "I quit."  She said, "You what?"  I said, "I quit."  I said, "I couldn't take that."  So I slept for two days, and then that's when I decided I was going to, told her I was going and try for the police thing, you know.  She said, "Well, I told you when you got out of the [U.S.] Marine Corps that you need to take off for doggone three or four months, and, and, and, not go to work.  But you wanted to go work, you know."
Speaker 1: So, do you think it was the Marines discipline and the--you know, that caused you to have, to kind of lose patience with the--
Speaker 2: Well, no, but I got frustrated.  I got frustrated because I was used to operating as a team, you know, folks helping folks, Marines helping one another, you know.  Well, if I had a tough time here, you know, I knew somebody was there.  But these guys here, they were out for themselves; the guy in front of me and the guy in back of me, you know.  The guy in front of me, he was running hot; he was probably about ten minutes ahead of time.  And the guy behind me, he was running behind time, so he wouldn't move up to give me a hand with this load, you know.  You know, I wasn't used to that.  I just wasn't used to that, you know.  And I said, "You know what?  This ain't for me.  This ain't for me, you know."  And I was used to, when people would tell you to do something, you did it, you know.  And you're talking about, you're dealing with civilians.  You're dealing with, you know, community people, and, you know, they don't have the training that we have.  And if you tell them, "This is only for quarters and tokens," and people are getting on putting nickels and dimes--man, it's, I don't need this, you know.  That's not, this is not the job for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 435404
Speaker 1: So the Chicago Police Department, you started in?
Speaker 2: Eleven March, 1968 [March 11, 1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Over at the Police Academy [Chicago Police Academy, Chicago, Illinois] on O'Brien Street that served as a grammar school and high school during the Civil War, that's how old it was.  But it reminded me so much of the [U.S.] Marine Corps, because it had hardwood floors, and those floors must have had two hundred coats of wax on them.  Even if you wanted to scuff them, you couldn't.  And the guys, the janitors during that day was still putting wax on them, you know, over the weekend.  But the hottest place right there was Maxwell Street.  And it was 92, 93 degrees when we reported there, you know.  It was hot when we reported.  Well, not March, about a month later.  But being able to smell the polish sausages and the onions and the hot dogs and the hamburgers, you know.  But it was hot as hell, no air-conditioning, no fans.
Speaker 1: Now, Chicago [Illinois] police, I've seen it myself.  In that area, you could see the police recruits run by.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Down the street.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They're all running and--yeah (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Well, during that time, we didn't run outside.  We ran around the gym in the basement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's why they outlawed, not only in this city, but in most other police departments, the duck walk.  Because we had a guy by the name of Stanley Salbernack [ph.].  Do you know what the duck walk is?  You put your hands on your hips and get down like this here.  And he would make us walk all around the doggone building like that, and up and down the stairs.  And it just kills your doggone, your biceps, you know.
Speaker 1: And your quadriceps up under your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--it kills them, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It kills them, you know.
Speaker 1: Or the hamstring, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that was like the second or third day, you know, and they hadn't even thought about were we--were some of these guys in shape, you know?  And it went on from there, you know.  But the 11th of March is the day that I reported to the academy.
Speaker 1: So, was the physical training tough to you, after coming out of the Marines?
Speaker 2: The physical training in the sense that, you know, going up and down steps, you know, because it was a three-story--really going from the basement it was almost like four stories, you know.  That was something, because in the Marine Corps we had like the open land and we had the mountains we would go up, you know.  But going up and down steps doing the duck walk, they didn't do that in the Marine Corps, you know.  But other than that, I handled mostly everything else, you know.  I felt sorry for a lot of the kids who'd never been in the service, you know.  Because when it came down to pugil sticks, when it came down to a lot of the hands-on, what'cha call it, they weren't, they hadn't been trained.  They weren't equipped to handle that, you know.
Speaker 1: So, was there, there was a high attrition rate?
Speaker 2: They got rid of the ones they wanted to get rid of, let's put it that way, you know.  And folks would come there and if they didn't adhere to the training or know how to take orders, they had their own little way of getting rid of them, drumming them out of the doggone system, you know.
Speaker 1: For instance, can you give us an example of how somebody might--
Speaker 2: You know, you had a couple of guys, you know, when they would tell them, "This is the way we want you to do this," you know.  And the guy would say, "Why I got to do it that way," you know.  "How come I can't--?"  "No, you're going to do it the way we asked you to do it."  "Well, this is not the service, you know.  This is the Chicago Police Department.  We're civilians, and we shouldn't be treated like that."  You know, guys who had too much mouth, you know.  And that's--you know, guys who never been to the [U.S.] military, you know, they think that, you know, that they got a right to be vocal.  Well, in the Marine Corps, you know, we found out you can't be vocal, you know.  You're in training, you do and adhere to what we tell you to do, you know.  And I saw a number of the kids, you know, not only white, but black kids, you know, who let their mouth override their butt.  And a couple of them got drummed out, you know.  Was it fair?  Well, who can say, you know?  The thing about it is when you get ready to go into an organization, you know, and you know the type of organization is a semi-military organization, you got to have some discipline.  You got to have some character, and you got to have some values.  And a lot of these kids didn't have that, you know.
Story_ID: 435405
Speaker 1: What would you say would be the philosophy of the Chicago Police Department in those days?  Because I know it's changed over the years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and they that, they say it has, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: --in (unclear) different ways.  But--
Speaker 2: I think back then the Chicago Police Department was, "We're going to get you out of here, but once you get to the district station, you know, it's up to the district commander and the watch commander, you know, to tell you what and how to do things."  And for the longest, you know, when I first got on, I went to the 18th District [Near North District], you know.  I was there for about three or four days, and one of the guys said--you know, I said, "Who will I be working with?"  They said, "Well, you'll be working with black guys."  I said, "Well, we don't work with white guys?"  He said, "This ain't the [U.S.] Marine Corps, buddy.  This is the Chicago Police Department.  You're going to work with a black guy, you know."  Well, that changed probably within about two or three weeks after being there, you know.  I got to work with a white guy, and went to--at time for lunch we'd go to the Drake Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] and we'd pull up in the back.  And he said, "You want something?"  You know, and I said, "What--?"  He said, "I'll go get us lunch."  Well, little did I know--you know, he'd leave me there and he'd go in and get a hot lunch, and then he'd bring me back a cold-cut sandwich, you know.  I didn't find this out like about until, about two days later when Vernell Cunnigan [ph.], who was one of the black guys, he said, "No, no, no."  He said, "This is what's happening," and he told me, you know.  Well, you know, you still had your racism and you still had your--you know.  "We go there, but you know, we don't want to take you."  But that's how it was.
Speaker 1: District 18, if I'm--
Speaker 2: It used to be on Chicago Avenue.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is the station, you all covered Cabrini Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and the Gold Coast [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we--yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 435406
Speaker 1: Couple of other stories about the 18th District [Near North District].  When I first reported to 18, Clarence Braasch [Clarence E. Braasch] was the district commander.  And I'll never forget, about the third day I reported there--you know, let's say roll is 8:00, and I get there at 7:30.  You walk through the back, from the parking lot through the back, and it was just like in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  I mean, sharp.  Doggone pants looked like Frank Sinatra's tuxedo, you know.  Razor sharp, dressed to the hilt, you know, uniform and shirts ironed and everything, shoes polished.  And I walk through and I say, "Good morning, Commander."  He had a habit of going back and just checking the garage and the parking lot.  And I walked right by him like I was--I said, "Good morning, Commander."  He'd look at me and walk on by.  I did this for three days in a row.  And finally a guy by the name of Vernell Cunnigan [ph.] and his partner, a Polish guy, a salt and pepper team--we had roll call, and they said, "We want to talk to you after roll call."  And after roll call, they pulled me to the side.  And they used to say, "Young blood."  They said, "Young blood, let me tell you something."  He said, "I've been here like eight years.  The man ain't never spoke to me or--," I think his name was Lenny [ph.].  "He ain't never spoke to either one of us. Now what makes you think, and you've been here for three days, and just because you're spic and span, you walk through here saying good morning, that he's going to speak to you?  Leave him alone.  He's a cantankerous old SOB.  Leave him alone, simple as that."  I said, "Okay, all right."  Fast forward, I think a few years later, you know, he wound up getting killed and went to jail for a doggone corruption over there, and then wound up getting killed, you know.  But that right there in itself taught me a lesson, you know.  I know even in the Marine Corps, even if you had some racist officers, like NCOs [non-commissioned officer], you say good morning to them.  "Good morning, Lieutenant," and they said good morning back.  I said here I am in the Chicago Police Department and my commander, the one who I'm going to get out there and work for, I say something to him and he won't even answer me, you know.  So, that taught me a lesson.  And I'll tell you, later on in my career I ran into it again, that somebody had done before I--the commander that I replaced in the 6th District [Gresham District], you know.  So it's a two way street, black and white commanders, the way they treat their men, what I call leaders.  There are some people who are managers, and some people are leaders.  And these guys were not leaders, you know.  But, you know, I didn't say anything to him after that, after they spoke to me.  Probably a few days later, I got put on a walking beat on Rush Street, man.  Mind you, I think I was only temporarily there, but I got put on Rush Street.  And I got a call and went to the box, and the what'cha call it.  They said, "Yeah, you got a ticket."  I think it was at Athens Restaurant [ph.] or something; it was a Greek restaurant down on Rush Street.  So I went down there and they were illegally parked, and I wrote a bunch of tickets.  It wasn't an hour later after I wrote these tickets, "Call the station, call the station."  I called the station, "Yeah, you've been assigned to Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois]."  "What did I do?"  So I go to Cabrini-Green, and a car came by and picked me up.
Speaker 2: This is a demotion, certainly a demotion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hey, hey, wait 'til you hear.  So I get back, I didn't ask no questions.  I figured, you know, Cabrini is tough area, and they want me over there.  I get back in, and the sergeant pulls me aside.  He said, "Young blood, how many tickets did you write over there the other day?"  I said, "Oh, I probably wrote about fourteen."  He said, "What? Do you know who owns that restaurant?"  I said, "No, who owns it?"  He said, "Thanasouras."  I said, "Who?"  He said, "Mark Thanasouras."  I said, "That don't mean nothing to me."  "He's the commander of the, I think it's the 24th or the 25th District [sic. 15th District; Austin District]."  I said, "What?"  He said, "Yeah, and they found out you were writing tickets, and that's the reason you got moved off that street."  I said, "No joke?"  I mean, within an hour after I wrote them tickets I was gone, brother.  I was sent to Cabrini-Green, yeah.  And I said, "No joke."  Fast forward.  Then he gets hooked up, went to jail, and he wound up getting killed I think by some outfit guy, or something like that.  I say that to say this here, you know.  Some of our leaders on the Chicago Police Department has been outstanding leaders, but some of them, you know, should never have been on the police department in the first place, you know.  So, that was my induction into the 18th District.
Story_ID: 435407
Speaker 1: That was my induction, and so I was there for about, I only spent probably about nine or ten months there.  But they came up and they said, "We want you to go on the vice team."  I said, "Go on what?"  I'd heard of the tact team.  I said, "What's the vice team?"  The vice team, you go up to the bar, they give you money and you go in there and drink, and you see if they're gambling or trying to pick up prostitutes, you know.  And I know the [U.S.] Marine Corps is one of the reasons I went into the--alcohol was one of the reasons I went into the Marine Corps, because being left at the back door--.  I said, "No, I don't think I want to do that."  And I had the push on from the sergeant there, Sergeant Lewis [ph.].  I was the youngest thing in the district, you know.  "Come work for us."  I said, "No, I don't think so."  I left and went to Area Two Task Force.  Area Two Task Force is, was a city-wide, real aggressive unit.  Wherever they had a problem, they put task force there.
Speaker 2: Where would Area Two be?
Speaker 1: Area Two is the far South Side [Chicago, Illinois], you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Is this the station at 111th [Street] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, where I--
Speaker 2: That's the 2nd District [Wentworth District].
Speaker 1: Where I went was 91st [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue].  That's where the guy who just started this trial, Burge, Commander Burge [Jon Burge], who's going through all--that's where he was working at, you know, but I never worked for him.
Speaker 2: That's like Burnside [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Burnside, that's where it was.  But I stayed in 18 [18th District; Near North District] for like about nine or ten months, and I put in a request, you know, I went to see the lieutenant out in Area Two Task Force.  And they said, "Yeah, you can come out here, you know."  And so I got to go out there, you know, me and my partner.  But what I didn't know when we went out there that we weren't going to work--you have to work with old-timers for at least six months before you can work with the partner that you go there with.  You know, training.  But during that time after I went out there, about, probably about a year later, that entire vice team from the 18th District went to jail.  They went to jail for the doggone, the taverns.  I don't know if you remember, but they were shaking down taverns and all of that.  They went to jail, and that's what Braasch [Clarence E. Braasch] went to jail for.
Speaker 2: So, you barely dodged the bullet.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, being in the Marine Corps and knowing when to do something and when not to do something--they taught you; you had a gut feeling.  If your gut told you, what'cha call it, you knew to move on, you know.  And so, yeah, I dodged the bullet and didn't nothing else to do with it.  I went to 18 and got out of there and went to Area Two Task Force.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, Jon Burge was there?
Speaker 1: Jon Burge, after I was in--I came back, you know.  I was there for--that's further on down.  But Jon Burge was out of that unit a few years later, you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, out of that building, not the unit I was in, yeah.
Speaker 2: I guess that's the old building there at 91st and Cottage (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's now--
Speaker 1: Some type of service center for the city (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, for Parks and Rec [Chicago Park District], I think, or some--for Streets and Sans [City of Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation].  Streets and Sans.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 435408
Speaker 1: Well, what happened in, in Burnside [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, went to Burnside and had a lieutenant by the name of Lee Harvey.  And Lee Harvey was a black lieutenant, an educated black lieutenant.  And he was smart, and he was a lieutenant there.  And he used to sit up, we'd be at roll call, and he used these, we called them Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] words.  And the black guys would be looking at the white guys, and the white guys would be looking at the black guys saying, "What did the lieutenant say?  What does he mean, you know?"  And then finally, we had a kid by the name of Lenny Pucinski [ph.].  Lenny was the only one who had, I'd say who would doggone would test him, "Lee, what do you mean, you know?"  He'd break it down to us, you know.  But that was, that was a fun time, but that was when I really, really, began to learn how to be the police, you know, working with some of the old-timers in the task force [Area Two Task Force]; how to make high-risk felony stops, you know; how to doggone process and how to do reports, how to do arrest reports and do case reports, you know; and how to--when there'd been a shooting or something like that, how to do grid searches and things like that, you know.  Yeah, and you learned the basics.  I don't know if they learn it nowadays, you know.  But when you went into that unit, if you came in new, you worked with two or three guys for six months, you know, during a six-month period.  You worked with this guy for two months, this guy for two months, and this guy for two months.  And you find out from the best and the most aggressive how they do business.  And I got to tell you, the guys that you work with, that they pick for you to work with, they selected for you to work with, they wasn't boo-boo guys, guys who didn't get a lot of complaints and all of that, but they knew how to do police work, and knew how to conduct themselves on the street professionally, you know.  And could hate, they could hate folks' guts, but they knew what they were doing and they knew how to do it, you know.  And, and, and, a lot of times that's missing in today's environment when it comes down to law enforcement across this country.
Story_ID: 435409
Speaker 1: Did you go to the gang crime unit after that point?
Speaker 2: At--I worked there for a couple of years, and during one of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, let's get the years maybe, so we can--
Speaker 2: Okay.  When I went to the task force [Area Two Task Force], that was 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went there, I think it was like February or March of 1969.  And they had a guy by the name of, an Irishman, named Sergeant John Tolley, who was my squad leader.  And one of the things that Tolley used to say, "If you want to be in my squad, those of you who only have a high school education, you got to go back to school."  Because I know he had mostly veterans on his squad.  And he said, "I know you get that G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  If you want to be in my squad, I'm going to require that you go back to school and go to City Colleges."  And between him, my wife [Dorothy Brown Hillard], and my brother-in-law [Jesse Brown], that's one of the reasons I went back to City Colleges, the Chicago Loop College [Loop Junior College; Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Loop College, because he was steady pushing folks to go to college.  And I tell you, I teamed up with my partner and one of my best friends, a guy by the name of Kudell Cochran [ph.], because we came on the job together.  And from there, after we had worked with folks for those six months, we teamed up and became a hell of a doggone force to be reckoned with.  Because we, we complemented one another greatly, you know.  We got a lot of guns off the street and got a lot of doggone hot cars off the street, and caught a lot of bad guys, you know.
Story_ID: 435410
Speaker 1: Around this time, well, in 1971 you married your, you met and married your wife [Dorothy Brown Hillard] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy [1970], I think it was.
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 19--I can't forget that, May 9th, yeah.  My brother-in-law was Jesse Brown.  He was the secretary for veteran affairs for President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  He was one of the--that's who the hospital [Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois] is named after, over there on the West Side.  And Jesse and I was in the [U.S.] Marine Corps together.  And one of the things that Jesse was adamant about, he didn't want none of his friends or buddies dating his sister.  He was very adamant about that.  "If you're my friend, don't be messing with my sister," you know.  And so, we used to give what we call reunions, you know, the guys who was in service with us.  And guys were coming from as far as California, New York [New York], Columbus [Ohio], Atlanta [Georgia], Texas, you know.  And one year we gave it at Jesse's house, and the next year we gave it at my house.  The main thing was my apartment, you know, and then my mom's [Lelia Mae Hillard Drew] house, you know.  And we had a party one night, and we were having one of the--we'd like start on a Thursday and then end on Sunday afternoon.  We're at my house, my apartment, and Jesse's sister came.  And so there was another guy named Steven Todd, who grew up with Jesse, and he was just sitting over there talking to her.  And I walked over and said, "Hey, you know, this guy is married.  You don't want to be talking to him."  You know, I wanted to diss him out and get him out of the way.  And I said, "I'm single," you know.  So we started talking, and after that, I think within about six or seven months, we were planning for a wedding, you know.  And Jesse didn't take too kindly to that, but it finally grew on him, you know.  And then after about a year or two, he said, "If anybody, if she was supposed to marry anybody, she was supposed to marry you, and I'm glad she did."  Yeah, but I married her.  And as a matter of fact we just got through celebrating, I think it was 40, 40, 39 or 40 years this past Mother's Day, you know.  But I got married in 1970, and then I went to, not long after that I went to the 7th District [Englewood District] for a little stint.  Because Kenny Cantor [ph.] got killed at 70th [Street]--69th [Street], 70th and Peoria [Street].  And one of the kids who put the shotgun to his head and blew his brains out was the nephew of a policeman.
