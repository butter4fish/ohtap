Story_ID: 13010
Speaker 1: I'd like to have you start out by giving your mother's name and telling us what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Dionne Jacqueline Deshab, was.
Speaker 1: Can you spell the last--?
Speaker 2: D-E-S-H-A-B.  My mother, mother's history is a little unclear to me.  I know some things about it.  She was born and raised in a, in a little, a small sawmill town in Louisiana whose name is Bogalusa.  She, she--her mother had her out of wedlock, and there is some question about this person's decent.  I've never met him.  Some of our, family say he was Italian.  Some people say he was French because there were, of the emphasis on the French culture down there.  But I, don't know.  My mother said that he was Italian.  I never met him.  She was raised by her aunt, her Aunt Nellie and her husband, Arthur Morgan, along with another daughter because it--we need to start over.  And I should probably start before my mother.  My mother's mother was Ollie McGee.  And her mother, my great grandmother was Dora McGee.  Bogalusa was a--for African Americans, most people lived in what were called shotgun houses.  They were old army barracks.  It was, when I first started going there, it was at the conclusion of World War II, so there a lot reminisces of that.  So a lot of African Americans lived there.  And so it started with her.  My great grandmother, Dora, had nine children.  My mother's mother, Ollie, my mother was one of those.  Another daughter, Desser, had a daughter named Eulene.  Both of those sisters gave their daughters up to Nellie.  Nellie raised my mother and my, my cousin, Eulene.  They grew up together in one of these shotgun houses.  They both ended up going to Piney Woods [Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].  My mother was a drum major.  She learned to play the kettledrums at Piney Woods.  And she later went to Southern University [and A&M College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] where she met my father [Herman Scott].
Speaker 1: Can you talk about Piney Woods?  Did she ever talk about--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she talked to me some about it.  And it's interesting that it's enjoying such a resurgence of popularity.  You know, at the time, you know, it was one of the few--it was the only boarding school for African American women that she knew of and certainly that I've ever heard about.  And she talks fondly about, you know, all the girls being there and her relationship with her cousin, who incidentally continues to live today in Bogalusa.  She talked about the camaraderie and the, and, you know, the girl talk at night and how strict it was and how she benefited greatly from going to Piney Woods.  And she talked about it with a great deal of pride.
Speaker 1: Did--how, did your mother share any other stories about her growing up that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, again, it was a sawmill town.  She, my mother--mom wasn't one to dwell on racism, but her and my cousin were raised as sisters.  And she had a lot of stories about my cousin, Eulene, who was a drum majorette and one of the prettiest girls in school who ended up marrying a, local boy, Jimmy Polette, who, and who had another son, James Clifton Polette, Jr.  This, husband of hers was a band instructor at the local high school.  And he later went on to the Peace Corps [U.S. government international service organization].  They divorced, and he ended up marrying an African princess.  Where exactly it was, I don't know.  But I've seen him subsequently.  I believe that he's passed away.  But my cousin, Eulene, has a, very, very interesting history.  And mostly my mother would talk about them growing up, you know, the fact that there were outhouses.  When they were punished, they were banished to the outhouse.  And my uncle that raised her, Arthur, was a great dog enthusiast, and she talked about working with him, training the dogs and, you know, what--and I've got tons of pictures of her when she, from the time she was a baby.  And though it was a rustic place, everybody in the town worked at a place called Crown Zellerbach.  It's a big paper factory, and so everything centered around life at this factory.  And just about everybody who had a job worked there; talked about the cuisine and cooking and, that kind of thing.  So, yeah, she, she seemed to have a very happy childhood, thanks to my aunt and uncle.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?  What kind of person?
Speaker 2: My mother, to this day, there's barely a day that goes by where somebody doesn't talk about my mom in very gracious and glowing terms.  She--aside from the various professions that she has, she, for example, was one of the first people to start the March of Dimes [charitable organization concerned with infant health/mortality] as a neighborhood effort.  She would go to her neighbors and, and solicit other people.  And they would go through the neighborhood, getting dimes from people to, give to charity.  She didn't meet anybody that she didn't know, and they, in turn, loved her.  She, was really kind of an institution in the neighborhood in terms of her passion for the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and the area she came from and her passion for giving to people.
Story_ID: 13011
Speaker 1: Your father, can you give his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Herman Scott.  Herman Scott was born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  He went to high school there, and his father was Horace Scott.  Horace--his mother and father were Horace and Elizabeth Scott.  My grandfather came from Baton Rouge, and he left Baton Rouge and, and came to New Orleans [Louisiana], and actually as a matter of fact, my father's family is from Baton Rouge.  He's actually from New Orleans.  He had a great interest in cooking, wasn't much of an athlete, really had a lot of what people call feminine features.  And he loved to dress well.  And when he moved here, he, worked in hospitals and he worked as a short-order cook for a while, but he ultimately took up the profession of pressing.  He was a clothes presser.  And he worked, when he and my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] came here [Chicago, Illinois], mostly North Side cleaning establishments.  And one of the things that allowed him to do in addition to making money and getting our clothes cleaned, he always had a sense of what the latest styles were.  And he, and he followed them.  He taught my mother to cook.  He was one of those worker, kind of personalities, up every morning, 5:30, go to work, very disciplined in that regard.  He died at a very early age.  He died at forty-nine from a combination of things, but he had intestinal cancer when he passed away, never smoked, and was a great, great cook, good man.  Again, he had a real passion for New Orleans and the Mardi Gras and things of that nature. He would go back annually to visit his folks.
Speaker 1: Was he a talker?  Did he share any stories of his growing up with you?
Speaker 2: No, my dad wasn't one of, those kind of guys.  He--I got a chance to know some about him by traveling back to the South with him.  He had a, an interesting family.  And I think that there was a disconnect because I think that his father, Horace--and this has never been told to me, but I get the impression that he left Baton Rouge with a family.  And I've later met a half sister of his.  And so when he, his dad came to New Orleans and connected with my grandmother, there was very little said about his, his history.  And so I didn't know very much about it.  Not too very long ago--I have a cousin from my father's side of the family who lives here, who had a connection with that family in Baton Rouge.  And so two summers ago, I got, their names and numbers.  I got my children and we got on a plane, and we went to Baton Rouge.  And it was a, very moving homecoming for my children, and I think they took to us immediately.  We knew who they were almost immediately.  They got all of the family elders, and we went through a family tree kind of situation.  And I got to know a lot more about my family, most of which were gone, but there were lots of cousins and, you know, lots of old stories about them growing up.  But they, you know, they couldn't be so, very specific because it had been so long ago.  But we felt very at home, and we communicate with the regularly.
Story_ID: 13012
Speaker 1: Where are your blue eyes from, Michael?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting--you know, I'm kind of, I've been kind of the repository for family photographs.  And I've got some really, really interesting photographs of both my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] and father [Herman Scott] growing up and various members of the family.  I've got all nine of my mother's, aunts and uncles.  And I've got a lot of my grandfather's parents and--I'm sorry, grandfather's relatives on my father's side.  And on my, father's side, my grandfather's aunt has very, very, very light eyes.  And I have a picture of her.  And as, when I got it from my cousin, I actually was told that, you know, this is where the few people in our family who have hazel eyes get them from.
Story_ID: 13013
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: Well, as the story goes, my father--my sister--my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] was in, was at Southern [University and A&M College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And my father [Herman Scott] was there with some boys.  And, you know, my mother loved to swim.  She was a great swimmer.  And they were out in some body of water, and they were swimming.  And the boys were under the rocks, you know, watching the girls jump in.  And my mother jumped in, and they met, and they became friends, lovers and moved here [Chicago, Illinois] in 1949 and, and moved to the near, near South Side, somewhere near the old Comiskey Park [baseball stadium].
Speaker 1: Did they talk about why they moved, why they came?  Or was it part of the, well, the, you know, migration of people coming to the--?
Speaker 2: It was part of it.  You know, in the late '40s [1940s], there was this great migration.  And I don't know if you, you know, how much you know about the history of the West Side [Chicago], but during the time that they came here, there was, of course, the enormous meatpacking industry, slaughterhouses on the South Side.  But on the West Side, there was International Harvester [Company], McCormick [Harvesting Machine Company] reaper factory, Hotpoint [Division of General Electric Company], Westinghouse [Corporation], Sunbeam [Corporation], Western Electric, Sears [and Roebuck Company], Alden's, Continental Can [Company], all of them existed there.  And for years that, those industries were--they had a symbiotic relationship with the recent migrant worker.  And during the '40s and '50s [1950s], you know, tons of people came to the North looking for work.  The problem was, when they came to West Side in the '50s and '60s [1960s], every one of those companies up and left, creating this tension that existed on the West Side that led to Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] coming, riots, et cetera, et cetera.  They were all part of that, that history.
Speaker 1: Do you know why they left at that time?  Was it just sort of--I didn't know that--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they had just gotten married.  They were looking for a better way of life.  As is in most cases, there's family that,  encourages this, this movement north.  In this particular instance, I mentioned that my father knew his stepsister, Olivia, it was his, half sister.  Her and her husband owned a building somewhere near [Chicago] White Sox ball park [Comiskey Park].  And when my parents came here, their first residence was with them.  And as the story goes, after I was born at Cook County Hospital [Chicago], they were so poor and had so little that my basinet was the third drawer in their chest of drawers.  And the, you know, while they didn't tell me a lot about the life there, my mother did tell me one story about the fact that she loved smothered potatoes.  You know, coming from--she just loved them, and smothered with onions in the big black skillets.  And my parents were great moviegoers, coming in from the South because in, Bogalusa [Louisiana] and the small towns of Louisiana--I know this was true then because when I would visit in the summer, I remember we'd have to sit in the balcony.  So I can imagine, you know, that this was a big sense of freedom for them getting here.  And so they went to the movies a lot.  And she told me about the fact that she cooked this pot of smothered potatoes.  She was pregnant, pregnant with me.  She covered them up and they went to the movies.  And when she came back, she said that the rats in buildings, from the tenements had eaten them all.  They had taken the, the lid off and, eaten them all.  So, while it was obviously a happy time for young marrieds, it obviously was filled with a lot of challenges.  The moved from there to an address on Warren Boulevard [Chicago] in a, building that was owned by a guy named Mr. Jesse.  And I don't know the exact year, but it was on Warren, near Western Avenue.  During the time that we were there, I remember getting our first television.  I remember getting our first telephone and the birth of my sister, Beryl.  Then people who lived in the basement of that three-story building, the Washum family, cared for my sister and I.  And, as a matter of fact, there's a place that I go to on a fairly regular basis where the oldest daughter of that family goes, and I can continue to enjoy a relationship with that family to this day.
Story_ID: 13014
Speaker 1: Now, so you're the oldest.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how many siblings?
Speaker 2: I have a sister who is three years younger than me, and a brother who is ten years younger than her.
Speaker 1: Their names?
Speaker 2: Beryl Scott, B-E-R-Y-L, named for that same--they wanted to name my sister, Becky Nell.  And my mother--those, those aunts that I talked about, which was a combination of Nellie that raised my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab], and I forget where the Becky comes from, but somehow they moved from Becky now to Beryl.  And she's fifty-one.  And then my brother, Tracy Scott whose a fireman, was born ten years later.
Story_ID: 13015
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Jesus, I can almost remember--when my parents [Herman Scott and Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] came north with a group of friends, you know, they, not only did they come, but lots of people came.  And they knew one another, and they communed together and they socialized together.  And they would have picnics and, you know, there was, you know, lots of stories and things of that nature.  And I remember going out with kites and flying them and meeting their children who had become lifelong friends of mine.  My, my best friend in the world--well, no, I have several good friends.  But all of them emanated from those relationships that my parents had.  And so, I remember going to the hospital to get my sister [Beryl Scott].  So I had to be three years old at that point.  And so, that's about the time that, that things really kick in for me.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were three, were you living near Comiskey Park [Chicago, Illinois] or were you over on Warren [Boulevard]?
Speaker 2: No, I was born when we were there.  Because of the, obviously because of the situations that existed, they had to get out.  I don't remember moving from there.  My first recollections were of that house on Warren, which was the second house.  The third house was one on 18th [Street] and Springfield [Avenue].  We lived there for several years.  We moved form 18th and Springfield to 3700 on Douglas [Boulevard].  From 3700 on Douglas to 3100 on Douglas, and that's where my parents lived.  And I bought the first piece of property I ever owned right around the corner from them on Albany [Avenue], facing Douglas Park.
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to take yourself back to, you know, the early period, either on Warren or, you said 18th and Springfield, but now, when you were on Warren, what age were you?
Speaker 2: I had to be from three to five.
Speaker 1: Three to five, okay.  So 18th and--or even 18th and Springfield.  I want you to just take yourself back, and I'd like to know what sights, smells and sounds--.
Speaker 2: Which place?
Speaker 1: Where you can--it doesn't matter to me, but I want to know what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the, Warren address is really vague now at fifty-four, that was fifty-one years ago, but I do remember it.  And what I remember about that is that those buildings were old and Victorian and the stairs squeaked.  This Mr. Jesse, who was the landlord of that building, was one of these old Scrooge-type characters who was very tight on his tenants, wanted money immediately.  And I recall, you know, some of those conversations.  I remember again telephones and, televisions for the first time, the old Jackie Gleason movies and the old 'Amos 'N' Andy' sitcoms and, that kind of thing.  And I remember there being a lot of laughter.  There was great camaraderie in the building.  My mother was--as I told you, my father was a, almost a gourmet cook.  And I remember lots of conversations between the two of them, talking about succotash and jambalaya and gumbo and, and those kinds of things.  He looked--my father was a, he loved to do exotic things and stuffed bell peppers and that kind of stuff.  And I remember lots of conversations about that.  It was about the time that my mother, you know, after the second child, got her first her job here.  She was a, a telephone operator over at Bethany--no, not Bethany Hospital. That's where my sister was born, at Schwab [Rehabilitation Hospital, Chicago, Illinois].  She was--when telephone operators did the plug-in kind of thing.  And so there were lot, lots of conversations about that kind of thing and going to work for the first time and how we, how we'll handle the children.  Moving over to Springfield, at, that age, you know, you're more collegial.  And I remember having my first neighborhood friend whose James, James Cunningham.  James Cunningham and I--before I, just before I came in here, I talked to him.  We have been friends for many, many years and gone through a lot together.  I spoke at his sister's funeral not too long ago.  So just, I said that only to say, I've got a great relationship with lots of people that are very old relationships.  So anyway that's the first time I remember being in the neighborhood.  I remember sitting on the front stoop and being, being the smallest child in a group of people with my mother there.  And the neighbors had a dog and the dog got loose, and everybody ran inside the building.  My leg left out and it got mauled by the dog, and having to, go through the agony of determining whether or not I'd have to have rabies shots.  I didn't, but I remember neighborhood, and I remember people, the beauty parlor in the basement next door to us, and all the neighbors, three and four doors from us, all being friends, and my mother starting to get involved.  That's where she started the March of Dimes [charitable organization concerned with infant health/mortality] effort and joined the PTA [Parent Teacher Association].  And the guy across the street was a barber and I would go across there, the street, and get my hair cut.  And I took piano lessons two doors from, you know, where I got my hair cut.  So it--the neighbors downstairs, the people who owned the building, the Morgan family, the head of that house was Johnny Morgan.  And he was a policeman, and there were lots of stories about him.  He had three--four daughters.  And I continue to see them to this day.  And the wife, Willa Mae, she was a nurse, and all of her children have college degrees now.  And, more community, more a sense of, being a part of the world and being a part of a community and watching my parents open their lives and hearts to people and thinking that that was a good thing.
Speaker 1: And growing up, you were, your world was really that community, I would take it?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell me what school did you--I want to, one thing about the police officer, Mr. Morgan, that--there weren't many black police officers, were there at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I remember him having a really important position in relationship to everybody else.  He had a great deal of stature.  I remember him being a, an electrician on the side.  I remember him caring a great deal for his daughters.  And he was a very handsome man, and I have fond memories of John.  He's, he's up in Michigan now.  He retired from the [Chicago] Police Department, did several things in real estate.  And he bought a home up in Michigan, and he commutes between his Michigan house and the far South Side now.  That was another really interesting thing later on, you know, it was the agony of my parents as they watched all of their friends leave the West Side to go to the South Side.  So most of them are living South now.
Story_ID: 13016
Speaker 1: You weren't, as a young person, aware of the difference between the North Side and South Side [of Chicago, Illinois], were you?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't--not--.
Speaker 1: Not at that age.
Speaker 2: No, that, reality hit me about, the eighth grade.  And it was a really interesting experience.  You know, as more and more of my family--my parents' friends started move--my friends started to move.  And, and I didn't become aware of that until, as I was--there was a family, who intersected with our lives very closely.  It was the Williams family.  The Williams family, Andre was in my class, handsome, smartest kid in the school.  We were good friends, and my sister [Beryl Scott], who was a couple of grades behind me, his sister was in her class.  His mom, Mrs. Mabel Williams, was a principal in the public school--well, she was a teacher and then became a principal in the public school system.  Our fathers, you know, didn't get along, but there was enough friendliness, you know, up and down our, our family, you know, we did sleepovers.  We did things together and we were really good friends.  Well, that family that lived at the corner of Douglas [Boulevard] and St. Louis [Avenue], was one of the first families to move in Marynook [neighborhood on Chicago's South Side] on 87th [Street] and Avalon [Avenue].  And, as a freshman in high school [St. Philip's High School, Chicago], I would go out to 87th and Avalon and see these bungalows and see these beautiful houses.  And to, at that point, I had, I had only lived in apartments, and to see this family in this beautiful home with a backyard and that kind of thing.  I would come out there on the bus and stay with them.  It was, I was like in nirvana.  And I remember it being a wonderful thing, and I really envied it for a very long time.  It's an interesting story that, in terms of what happened to all of them, which taught me very valuable lessons in terms of raising my children.  And since I've mentioned their names, I don't know that I, I want to do that because it's pretty tragic.
Story_ID: 13017
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went--first to [Roswell B.] Mason [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and then [Theodore] Herzl [Elementary School, Chicago] and then to St. Agatha's [Our Lady of the Westside School-St. Agatha Campus, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: What were you like as a young--a little, you know, little boy?
Speaker 2: As a little boy, I was very--extremely shy, extremely shy, a fair student, but the thing that I really liked to do and the thing that really made me excel as a person was sports.  And I just loved baseball, football.  And I played little league.  I played, a lot of baseball and a lot of football.  And I, was really good at it, and, you know, it was the kind, of kid where my parents [Herman Scott and Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] kept close tabs on me.  But as long as I was playing sports, they didn't' mind.  And I was the kind of kid where kids would come to my window and scream for me and scream for my mother to--beg her to allow me to come out so I could go and play with them.  There was a, the beginning undertones of serious gang problems as I was growing up.  And we were always cautious about that.  I remember being in the park with my friends playing ball, and a group of guys, and they're--when you're little, and these things are so dramatic.  But it appeared as if the sky would darken when these huge groups of fifty, sixty, seventy guys would walk through an area.  And then you're standing there.  It's like an invading army.  And you, and you don't any of them, and you don't know what they're gonna do to you.  But there were times when we'd be playing and they'd--like locust, they'd take every bat, ball and glove (laughs).  And when we--when they'd walk through, there was nothing left.  We'd just have to stand there and watch it.  And sometimes they would throw the stuff back to us.  Sometimes we'd never get it.  I remember being out for Halloween one night.  And I worked my can off.  I'd, we had been to every house in the neighborhood.  I had a bag this full with another good friend, Clyde Crenshaw, who became a policeman and musician, who lives on the South Side [of Chicago] as well.  And we had, we had all this stuff, and you know, several guys ran, ran by, took our candy.  And we just had to stand there and watch it (laughs).  You know, a group of us got herded up by a group of local guys who were in gangs, but knew us.  They tied us up and put us on a roof for a day.  I mean it was, it was really interesting times.
Story_ID: 13018
Speaker 1: We were talking about the gangs, you know, and you were telling the very vivid story about them coming through.  And were you ever, you know, at that time, were you sort of fearful of them or were you told to stay--?
Speaker 2: Very, very fearful.  You know, you could see when they would have meetings where they would congregate, but the athletes always got a pass.  You know, and I, I was really good.  And so, you know, if you, you played ball and, you know, people kind of knew that you did that, they kind of gave you a pass.  And so, you know, unlike the stories that you hear about people standing in front of schools recruiting and that kind of thing, I never remember ever having experienced anything like that.  You were either--I mean it was, it was tough though.  I mean, the theaters you'd go to, and if you weren't part of the group, you could be thrown out of a balcony.  I mean they were pretty brutal.  But I, I never really experienced that.
Speaker 1: Did they have names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the earliest I remember was the Clovers.  They were located around the 16th [Street] and Springfield [Avenue] area [Chicago, Illinois].  As a matter of fact, the Clovers evolved into the Vice Lords.  And when I was in college, essentially, the Vice Lords ran 16th Street, got a lot of money from the government, opened businesses, tried to be legitimate, with everybody walking up and down 16th Street in red berets.  So that the Clovers, the Vice Lords, the Conservative Vice Lords, the Imperial Chaplains, those were the prominent ones in my day.  I remember--I knew about the Black P-Stone Nation.  As a matter of fact, during that same time we're talking about, there was an issue with me in high school.  I was originally supposed to go to Tilden Tech [Edward Tilden Career Community High School, Chicago].  The year I was to go to Tilden Tech, it became a coed school, and the technical end of it went to  [Robert] Lindblom [College Prep High School, Chicago, formerly Robert Lindblom Technical High School].  I didn't like Lindblom because I had friends at Tilden.  I didn't like Lindblom  because of all the South Side [of Chicago] stereotypes.  I won't go into that, but--so I ended up going to St. Philip's [High School, Chicago].  What's--what I was trying to tell you?
Speaker 1: You were telling, I was talking about--you were talking about the gangs sort of, and then the Vice Lords and the--.
Speaker 2: But I was gonna tell you a specific thing, story, but I don't remember it now.
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, okay.  You were talking about one of the gangs, is it one of the gangs?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  Oh, I know.  I was telling you--oh, yes, I, I remember now.  I was--because I--before I actually went to St. Philip's, Hales Franciscan [High School, Chicago] had just opened.  And I was really interested in Hales Franciscan because it was a school that was supposed to cater to young men.  And I had started driving.  And my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] went with me to Hales Franciscan.  And I was gonna get an application.  And so we parked in front, you know, in front of the school.  And I got out of the car to go into Hales to get an application.  And between my car and the front door, I came across six young men.  And as I, we passed them, they asked me what club I was in.  And I said, I--you know, "What are you talking about?  I don't know anything about a club."  And they started saying to me, "Take off your coat," you know, you know, and all the time, my mother was watching me.  And my mother got out of her, the car, as these guys surrounded me.  She took off her shoe and she, she charged after these guys, fearlessly, get away from my son.  And then when they--they left me alone.  But I mean high school was a--anytime you got out of your element, it was a, touchy situation.  I remember after I got into St. Philip's, you know, there were two ways to go home.  And very often we would walk from Kedzie [Avenue] and, and Jackson [Boulevard], down to Central Park [Avenue] to catch a Central Park bus to go to Douglas [Boulevard].  And I don't know whether that'll mean anything to you, but it will to West Siders.  And as I was walking from Jackson and Kedzie to Jackson and Central Park with some of my classmates, we were, came upon a huge group of guys, you know, who were running, obviously, had been involved in something else.  And they came across me, same kind of deal, you know, "What club are you in?"  "I'm not in any club."  "Take off your clothes."  They started stripping me of my book bags and all that stuff, and they just started to beat me, just jumped up and down on me.  And it was a very violent time. And fortunately, a police car came by and I got out of it pretty much unscathed.  But, I mean the guys that were with me, they had enough sense to run.  And that's kind of a sense of how fearless I was, I just--I wouldn't run.

Speaker 1: Having gone through this, this metamorphosis of communities, you know, I started to wonder--and very often talk to a lot of people--as a matter of fact, I'm trying to find Tim[uel] Black [historian/professor] now to ask him if he knows anything about it and Dempsey Travis [entrepreneur/author], I read a lot of his books, and I get sense of some historical things.  But apparently, this schism of our two communities, nobody really knows where it came from, but this is my take on it.  In 1871, there was a great--this goes back this far, 1871, there was the Great Chicago [Illinois] Fire.  It was the year that [Joseph] Medill became mayor [of Chicago].  And, as a matter of fact, on his ticket was the first African American elected official in the city of Chicago, a guy named John Jones, for your edification.
Speaker 2: I know that.
Speaker 1: Excellent, very good, not very many people do.  Anyway, the Great Chicago Fire took place north of what is now the Eisenhower Expressway.  Unbeknownst to most people, when the city was incorporated in 1837, there were six wards.  Most African Americans lived in the 1st and 2nd Wards, which is generally, north of--I'm sorry, south of the Eisenhower Expressway, up to about 22nd Street, mostly right around Roosevelt Road, from Roosevelt Road to where the Hilton Hotel [720 S. Michigan Avenue, Chicago] is.  And that's where they were.  In 1874, three years after the Great Fire, there was another great fire that essentially devastated all of the African American home ownership to the south.  And the city was faced with its first urban renewal problem, they didn't know to do with these black people.  And while there's nothing written that says that, there is very clear evidence that what they did was they divided up the community, sending some around where the old Halsted Street area, market area is, sending the rest a little further south.  And that was the first division of our community.  And they did it, I think ostensibly, you know, to--so that there wouldn't be a voting block created.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  And I--you know, there's a gentleman named Christopher Reed, do you know of him?
Speaker 1: Sure, I do.  Chris is from the West Side.
Speaker 2: That's right, he's from the West Side.
Speaker 1: He's a doctor.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: He and I were--we lived in the same neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Okay, he and Charles Branham are probably ex--you know, have done a lot of research on the early Chicago history.
Story_ID: 13020
Speaker 1: Elementary school, you said you were--and which elementary--?
Speaker 2: I went to [Roswell B.] Mason [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--,
Speaker 1: Mason.
Speaker 2: --Then [Theodore] Herzl [Elementary School, Chicago], and then St. Agatha's [Our Lady of the Westside School-St. Agatha's Campus, Chicago].  They had middle schools at the, they had middle schools during the time I was growing up.  And the middle school, after sixth grade at Herzl, was [Julius] Hess [School, Chicago].  And it was one of those places that had a bad reputation.  And so rather than subject me to that, my parents put their resources together and put my sister [Beryl Scott] and I in St. Agatha's.
Story_ID: 13021
Speaker 1: You weren't Catholic at all, right?
Speaker 2: Not at the time, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab], you know, in this evolving set of jobs that she had, she went from, she went from the operator at Schwab [Rehabilitation Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] to being a cashier at Woolworth's.  And, you know, through her involvement, she started to get political. And so the next job she got was as a crossing guard.  And she crossed the corner of, of Kedzie [Avenue] and Douglas [Boulevard, Chicago], which is right at the corner of St. Agatha's [Catholic Church, Chicago].  She developed a great relationship with the priest and the people there.  They convinced her that St. Agatha's [Our Lady of the Westside School-St. Agatha's Campus, Chicago] was a good place for my sister [Beryl Scott] and I to go and that's where we ended up going, and later on converting, the entire family.
Speaker 1: So what denomination were you before that?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Baptist and then for a while, Presbyterian.  Archie Hargraves [community leader/religious figure] was, whose got a lot of history around the city [Chicago], was the, was the pastor at a place called Lawndale Presbyterian [Church, Chicago] and for several years, we were Presbyterian.  But we--my parents [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab and Herman Scott] came here as Baptists.
Story_ID: 13022
Speaker 1: Can you describe just other, you know, sort of memories of--you've done a great job, but of growing up, and maybe family life, you know, things that sort of, are memories that stand out?
Speaker 2: Well, there're lots of memories.  And, you know, I have to divide them.  As, as a child I remember Christmases. They were always a big deal, a big deal around my house for my sister [Beryl Scott] and myself.  That same uncle that I mentioned to you, Arthur Morgan, had risen through the company at, at Crown Zellerbach [paper company].  And for their employees every year, they gave them boxes of toys.  And we were the equivalent of grandchildren for them.  And so every year we'd get this huge box of things and we knew it was Christmastime when, when those boxes showed up.  And that I kind of remember, being as a child.  And then middle years, I remember the death of [U.S.] President [John F.] Kennedy.  I remember parents being, you know, put under extraordinary pressure because of the moves and the economics of the situation.  The Civil Rights Movement was starting to develop.  I remember the first time I saw [Reverend] Jesse Jackson I was so small that, that I went there with my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab], who again was always involved in resting my head on her lap.  I was, I was that young, at a church over on Washington [Boulevard, Chicago].  So I remember the evolution of the, Civil Rights Movement and being involved in that, and having my friends become involved in that.  And then, you know, high school [St. Philip's High School, Chicago, Illinois], just the trials of, trying to survive at that point, because, you know, kids can be brutal at that age.  I remember Herb Kent [radio personality] doing his big parties on the West Side [of Chicago] and only being allowed to go to one of them.  I keep--I'm sorry about these stories about violence, but I remember, you know, the big deal was the gousters and the Ivy Leaguers [styles of dress].  And I had to be one of the only Ivy Leaguers on the West Side.  And that, in itself, caused me a lot of difficulty and I was run out of, I was run out of a many a parties (laughs) because I didn't look like or dress like the people that were around me.
Story_ID: 13023
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your interest in sports.  You said, that you, you know, you were a fair student, but you loved sports.  And did you love baseball better than--I mean which, what was your favorite, and did you have any sports heroes?
Speaker 2: I had lots of sports heroes.  I thought that Willie Mays was, great.  I thought, what he, what he was able to do was tremendous.  I, appreciated all of his skill sets and essentially tried to emulate that.  Jackie Robinson had already broken into the big leagues, and, but my, you know, outside of the city sports teams, Willie Mays was, was really kind of a hero for me.  Baseball was my--was the sport that I excelled in the most, but I, enjoyed football more.  There was a, you know, Mr. [Richard] Barnett, I don't know if--who is a political organizer now and renowned, you know, but Mr. Barnett, in it before he got involved in that was really involved in the lives of young people in that community.  He lived on Springfield [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  And when we moved on, I didn't know him personally, but through playing baseball and playing against the teams that he organized, I got to know him as an individual.  His teams, the Jaguars, which was a team that I was, which--that team was in the league that I played in, was always the team to beat, always well-financed, very nice uniforms, had a great, great disciplinary code and every year, they would win those games. I played on a team called the Eagles.  And they regularly beat us, but it was really the, the experience.  And it allowed me to play high school ball, and I probably would have played pro ball had it not been for the fact that I tore cartilage in my knee in my junior year in high school [St. Philip's High School, Chicago].  Then I started to play more football.  I was really, really, very good.  And as it, as it turns out, my son was a first team, all-city tailback at Whitney [M.] Young [High School, Chicago] during his time there.  So, he obviously got some those, those genes.
Speaker 1: And were you competitive in sports you think.  You said, you were shy--you know, you were quiet.  I mean you were a quiet--did sports bring you out?
Speaker 2: Well, the things that I do now, and the things that I've done in my life require a great deal of discipline, self-discipline.  And if you are a person of self-discipline, you have to hold things within.  And it can be detrimental to your health, you know, it creates tension, you know, you--and that kind of thing.  Sports, even then, was an outlet, you know, because it allows you to expel that energy that you have bottled up inside of you.  So I would not characterize myself as a competitor.  I would characterize myself as a fierce competitor.  I hate to lose.  And you would never know that.  It comes out playing ball.  It comes out playing bid whist.  It comes out--and anybody that knows me will tell you that I'm really, really fierce.  I, hate to lose anything.  It's just the different, the different energies that have to--that you expose based on what it is you're doing.
Story_ID: 13024
Speaker 1: As a young person, did you live a lot inside your head, sort of--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, still do.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Still do.  I mean I keep my own counsel a lot, which is not good for you.  I think that everybody's better--somebody once told me that, you know, there was this guy that I had a lot of respect for, and I won't tell you who he is, who, who always seemed to be able to determine what was going to happen.  Well, you know, we'd be talking about current events.  And I'd say, "I think such and such about that."  And he'd say, "No, it's not gonna happen that way.  It'll unfold in this fashion, and this is what's gonna probably happen."  And he had an uncanny, uncanny ability to call it, you know, to always call the right shot, always to be able to predict, you know, the most likely scenario.  And I, I never understood it.  So I went to him, I said, "You know, how do you do that?"  And he would say to me, "It's not, it's not that.  If you're well read, and you read the newspapers every day, you learn more about the subject.  You know what the tendencies are.  You know what the trends are.  You're more likely to be able to be able predict, you know, what will happen at the end."  And I took that to heart as a freshman in college [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], as a matter of fact.  And so, you know, I calculate a lot in my head.  You know, I, try to anticipate two, three, four, five steps in front of me and think about the, overall consequences of just about everything I do, which makes me a very metered and measured person, not given to rushing into things without appreciating what I'm going into.  Yeah, I think that kind of describes it.  I, live a lot in my head.
Story_ID: 13025
Speaker 1: You, as a young person, did you want to go on and play sports professionally?  Was that what you wanted?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was--well, you know, you, everybody has illusions of that.  And like I said, I was on a fair student.  My grades were good enough to get into Xavier University [of Louisiana] in New Orleans [Louisiana] and subsequently, Fordham University [New York, New York], but just a, you know, just an average student.  But I was really good at sports.  And when I was a junior, I had expressions of interests made in me to my coaches from the St. Louis Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates [professional baseball teams].  And I was really considering it after my senior season, going to camp and trying out for those teams.  But when I was a junior, I tore my cartilage and spent my senior year recovering.  And so I just went on to college and actually, I got an academic scholarship from the Better Boys Foundation [social service organization], which I'm grateful to, to this day.  And that's how I went to college.
Speaker 1: So and what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I played center field, right field and first base, left-hander.
Speaker 1: And at that time, you're still--but you're playing in leagues, you know, within--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played with--well, my, skill level evolved.  And I remember I played little league, and then in the summers, I would come home, and then I would play in the more advanced leagues.  And the leagues that I played in featured people like Lou Brock [professional baseball player] when they were just getting started.  I mean these, these--I played with some, some legendary ball players.  And, as my skill level evolved, you know, my confidence grew, and I, was really very good.  When I went to college though, I developed an even greater interest in football.  And, you know, in the summer camps that I would work in, there were always these, big games and, and I could tell how far I had advanced, you know, from, you know, what would happen at these games.  And I, remember really being, really excelling in both phases of the game.  But it was my intention to try out for semi-pro football when I got out of college and, just play because--and I remember going out and remembering the size of these people and recognized what it takes to really get in shape.  And knowing that that I had had a knee injury, I soon gave up any real notions of doing it seriously and began to focus on a career.
Story_ID: 13026
Speaker 1: I'm still gonna take you back to high school [St. Philip's High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Who was influencing you there?  You know you said you, you mentioned something about I was at--you know, "I would have trouble at gatherings.  I was an Ivy Leaguer."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What does--?
Speaker 2: What does that mean?  Well, it's a--well, the, the two styles of the day were Ivy Leaguer and gouster.  A gouster was an individual who wore the large flannel shirts.  He'd wear, pleated pants, biscuit-toed shoes, sometimes with zoot chain, and that was a style of dress, as opposed, guys that would wear thin-legged pants, big cordovan shoes, jackets, caps that were pressed and button-down shirts.  And they--it was a cultural deal and, you know, and sometimes, you, you know, aside from the gangs, you'd get in trouble for being a gang member or not you'd get (laughs) in trouble for, for the way you dressed.  And most of the people that I hung around with--and remember I told you about my father's [Herman Scott's] sense of style, he, monitored that.  And if I, if I would come home with like, for example, a cowboy chain around my neck that he thought was just disgusting, I'd hear about it, and it'd be taken off me in a hurry.
Story_ID: 13027
Speaker 1: Who was also influencing you in high school [St. Philip's High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  I mean, you know, you talk--were you active in the Better Boys Foundation.  You know, you said, you'd gotten an award.  And who were you aware of, like would you look up to, you know, in the community and things like that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there were a group of older guys that were coming along just in front of me, that, that got themselves involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  And I was a little leery of that.  But they did influence me because they were good people, and they were trying.  But if I had to name, prior to going to college, you know, individuals who influenced my life, it would probably be Father Daniel Mallette, who was kind of a rebel priest, came to St. Agatha's [Catholic Church, Chicago], the one who influenced my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] to, go to school there.  He had the courage of his conviction.  You know, he was in the middle of this neighborhood, you know, and he really worked with other, other clergy in the community, specifically, Reverend Shelvin Hall and other people.  And it was that union of baptists and catholics that became a very powerful element for social change.  And they were the ones that put together the LPPAC [Lawndale People's Planning and Action Council] Group, the Pyramid West Groups, and, and were really responsible for having Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] come to the West Side [of Chicago].  And, you know, one of the things that was interesting about that, Dr. King wanted to come, and he actually wanted to go to the South Side [of Chicago].  And they were told, you know, by the local leadership of the city, that he couldn't come out to those churches, least you incur the wrath of the city.  And these gentlemen, Father Mallette and Father--and Reverend Hall invited him anyway.  And he came, and he lived on Hamlin Avenue.  And it caused a great stir in the community.  It caused a wave of, interest, and who was this man and what is he doing here?  And the streets were alive with electricity because of his very presence among us.
Speaker 1: Now, you're talking about the mid-50s [1950s]?  Are we in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: No, we--I graduated high school in, in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So all of this happened before, before I left.  So we're talking between '63 [1963], '64 [1964] in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, and in that time period, now who are--are you aware of who, politically, you know, who sort (unclear) (simultaneous)--are you hearing names and things like that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  From the perspective of the West Side, it was really interesting, really interesting environment with politics.  My father [Herman Scott] was kind of a precinct captain, the old 24th Ward, and the 24th Ward has a really rich history out on the West Side.  But he was precinct captain, so I learned early that these guys were always armed with stockings and cigarettes and those other kinds of things, encouraging voters in the '60s [1960s].  This was--we moved over on Douglas [Boulevard] in '59 [1959], the year the [Chicago] White Sox won the pennant.  And what I'm talking about now is between '59 and '67 [1967] when I went away to, to college.  But I'm sorry, when I went to high school, graduated, graduated high school [St. Philip's High School, Chicago] '67 [1967], graduated college [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] '72 [1972].  But the names that were beginning to surface at the time were, of course, Ben Lewis.  Ben Lewis was an alderman.  He became--I don't know if Ben Lewis ever became a congressman, but I can tell you that he met with an untimely death [1963].  He was shot on the corner of Central Park [Avenue] and Roosevelt Road [Chicago] in his office.  That death has not been solved yet.  His era gave way to the era of George Collins, who was alderman, and congressman.  He met with an untimely death.  He died in a plane crash.  His wife assumed his seat in [U.S.] Congress.  Behind him was David Rhodes, Bill Henry, Jesse Miller, now, Michael Chandler [past aldermen of the 24th Ward, Chicago].  So on the, on the state legislative side was Arthur Turner.  Arthur Turner came along the same time I did.  As a matter of fact, Arthur was also a recipient of the Better Boys--of a Better Boys Foundation scholarship.  And so I mean those were, those were kind of prominent names of the day, going back to the time I first recall anything about politics.
Story_ID: 13028
Speaker 1: Do you remember--now, [Chicago, Illinois] Mayor [Richard J.] Daley was mayor at that time, right, the father?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember as a young person his influence or, you know, people talking about--?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure I do.  When I graduated from college [Fordham University, New York, New York], you know, I--my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab], because of my mother, I immediately got involved in, different things.  And one of the first things that, first things that I was encouraged to do by Grady Jordan [Chicago high school district superintendent], who is, a legend on the West Side [of Chicago], was to become involved in the, community councils at the Urban Progress Centers [Chicago social service organizations].  And so, you know, I, started--I was elected to that board and became a very active member at a very early age.  And there was a big ceremony out in Douglas Park and they rolled out a mobile stage.  And, and I was to introduce Mayor Daley.  And so I used that introduction to this day.  And there's a picture of him looking at me, after I gave the introduction.  As a matter of fact, I used it for his son [Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley] very recently.  So, I remember all of this equipment being brought out for him.  And I remember, you know, the park being clean and all this attention being given to the neighborhood.  I remember the, the iron fist he held over the human services employees in terms of who got jobs, who didn't.  I felt his influence almost from the very time I graduated from college and came home.
Story_ID: 13029
Speaker 1: I'll tell you how--how tight things were [during the Mayor Richard J. Daley administration in Chicago, Illinois].  I'll tell you, I'll tell you a story that I tell a lot of people.  This is my real first personal encounter with the power of the politics of the day.  The, kids that I went to school with were all of the Vietnam [War] era, all very aggressive people.  A lot of them came back shot and wounded, and they were filled with stories of a world in the jungles, et cetera.  And most of them, by virtue of this aggressiveness, wanted to go into some form of law enforcement.  And so, not because of my choice or anything that was empirical, you know, I kind of gravitated to law enforcement too.  And the first thing I wanted to do was get a job making nine--ten thousand dollars a year, and I wanted to be a policeman.  So I took the police exam when I was a junior in college [Fordham University, New York, New York].  I came home.  I took the exam and my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] called me several weeks later and said, "You got a letter.  It said you passed."  So I came home that summer and, and didn't hear anything.  The list came up, and I was very high on the list for going in.  But in order to do that, you had to pass a preliminary physical.  So when I was a senior, very early in the senior year, they asked me to come in and take a physical.  I came in to take a physical.  I went to an office building over on Hubbard [Street, Chicago], which is now an office building.  There had to be three hundred young men.  They told us all to go to the basement.  We went to a locker room.  We took off our clothes.  We were asked to go out into this large open space, stand there, in rows, dress (unclear).  And we're standing there, all striped down to our underwear, all three hundred of us and maybe fifteen rows of guys.  Out of a side room came this guy, a little old man, with a beard and stethoscope with two guys in front of him and one behind him, and a clipboard.  He walked up and down the rows of all these people with a, stethoscope and pad.  And he would put the stethoscope against everybody's chest and he would say, "Yes," "no," "yes," and I could hear him--we could hear him saying something, but you couldn't--it wasn't audible enough to know exactly what he was saying.  But he was saying, "pass," "fail."  Then when he, you know, as he came to you, you know, your heart was beating fast, you didn't know what the heck this guy was doing.  He put his stethoscope to my chest and said--
Story_ID: 13030
Speaker 1: Breathlessly this guy [police force medical examiner] came to me and he--they said, "No, you got a heart murmur."  So I was stunned because that's [joining the police force] what I really wanted to do at the time.  Here you are a twenty year old kid and you've got your life in front of you, this, this is your first big test for a job.  And I failed.  And so as we were walking out, and I began to ask people--of course, I was more comfortable asking African Americans, "Did you pass?"  "No."  "Did you pass?"  "No."  And of the three hundred people in the room, there had to be fifteen African Americans.  And I think I must have talked to 85 percent of them and all of them said, "No."  As it turned out--that they hadn't passed.  As it turned out, one of the guys that was right next to me in the locker room was an African American guy, seemed in reasonable health.  I said, "Did you pass?"  He said, "No," he said, "No."  He said, I said, "What happened?"  He said, "Heart murmur."  He said, well--and he said, you know, "I really don't understand that.  I came home from the [United States] Army, and I get a physical every week.  And I didn't have a heart murmur."  And I said to myself, "Ah-ha."  So I, I knew--I thought that it was bogus.  So I went home and reported this to my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab].  She, in turn, called the congressman's--the alderman's office, [Alderman] George Collins [24th Ward, Chicago, Illinois].  George Collins said, "You know, don't worry about it."  I went back to school, three weeks later.  I get a call from my mother, "They want you to come back to town, and they, the organization's gonna pay for it."  So they paid for my trip from New York.  I came back to town, and then Walter Shumpert, this is one of the [Chicago, Illinois] aldermen I missed, Walter Shumpert who was then a, driver for either Alderman or Congressman Collins, picked me up from my house, took me right back to the same office and told me to stand here.  He went away.  A few minutes later the same guy with the, little white beard, the white hair and the smock came out.  And they were down the hall, and he pointed at me and Walter Shumpert shook his head knowingly.  And he came back to me.  The guy went away.  We waited there for a couple minutes.  He came back, and he had a card in his hand.  He said, he showed it to me, "Is the card you filled out?  Are you Michael Scott?"  And I said, "Yes."  He tore the card up and said, he said, "Fill this out."  I filled it out again, and he said, "Passed."  And so I passed the exam to become a policeman, the preliminary exam.  And then after college [at Fordham University, New York, New York], I had the, the other interviews and background checks and that kind of thing.  And as it turned out, when I got ready to go onto the force a year later.  I had graduated and started working, I wanted to make--the starting police salary at the time was $9,100 a year.  I had a job making $10,000 a year so I refused to go.
Speaker 2: And what was that job that you were--what job was it at $10,000 a year?
Speaker 1: Well, I had started--when I came home from school, I started working at LP--first I worked at a youth center, and then I started working at LPPAC [Lawndale People's Planning and Action Council].  And they paid me $10,000 a year.
Story_ID: 13031
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your Better Boys Foundation [Chicago, Illinois-based social service organization], you know, scholarship and how you ended up choosing Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana] to go to?
Speaker 2: Because Warner Saunders [Chicago news anchor] went to Xavier.  Warner Saunders was, at the time, he had been a, principal at the same [Julius] Hess Elementary School [Chicago] that I told you about.  He had met a, businessman and philanthropist whose name was Joe Kellman, who happened to own Globe Glass International [automobile glass corporation].  He recruited Warner to go be the Executive Director of the Archie Moore's Gym [youth center, Chicago], which became the Better Boys Foundation.  I think it, a couple years after he got there, they started a big box programming and they started a scholarship program.  The year they started the scholarship program was the year I went, that I went away to college.  And I got the benefit, of their first scholarship.  Not only did I get the benefit of the first scholarship, the businessmen who contributed their dollars for me to college would come regularly, visit me in [at Fordham University] New York [New York] and take me to dinner and make me feel special.  When I was thinking about the first things, first professions, you know, how you jump all over the map, I was thinking about being a pharmacist.  I had been befriended by a, great guy who had drugstore on the corner of Roosevelt [Road] and--I'm sorry, Kedzie [Avenue] and Douglas [Boulevard, Chicago] where my, my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] was a crossing guard.  His name was Austin Jones.  And he was a pharmacist.  And he had a great job, and he always hired the young, youngsters in the neighborhood.  And he was a good person and he was a very fair and good man and, and always kept his discipline and in line, etcetera.  So I, my first season was I wanted to be a pharmacist.  When I talked about that and talked about where I wanted to go to school, Warner had gone there.  He was good friends of then, Vice Chancellor [of Xavier University], Norman Francis.  He called Norman.  I sent my paperwork, and I was off to Xavier.

Speaker 1: You had actually spent some summers, not New Orleans [Louisiana] so to speak, but in Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Just about every summer, my sister [Beryl Scott] and I would get on the Illinois Central Railroad and sometimes my grandmother would come and get us.  Other times we would go by ourselves, but they put on the railroad with a box lunch.  And sometimes my father [Herman Scott] drove us.  And we would go to New Orleans and, and what typically would happen was, we'd go to Hammond, Louisiana and we'd get off the train.  One of my relatives would meet us there, and we'd go to Bogalusa [Louisiana] where we'd stay with my great grandmother and my grandmother and all of their sisters and brothers.  And there was a really warm, really warm, warm time for me.  You know, it was a place that I, the one place on earth that I could go and the minute I arrived there I could feel--I felt like I was loved.  It was a remarkable feeling.  I had a great uncle there, who was also a great influence, excuse me, Uncle George, George McGee, was my great uncle, who lived with my great grandmother.  And when we would go, the other sisters would take my sister off to the other houses, but I would always stay there with my great grandmother and my Uncle George.  And I recall very vividly, when I would arrive there, there was a, glass that was put on the shelf.  That was my glass.  And they'd take my glass and they'd put, you know, they kept glasses in the refrigerator down there.  And they'd put my, glass in the refrigerator and, and say I was home.  And the house was very small.  It was a shotgun house three rooms.  But my great grandmother had the front bedroom with this huge bed and a leather rocking chair and a television.  And when I would wake up in the morning, I'd wake up to the smells of, country bacon and grits and homemade biscuits.  And they would sit me in, in this big chair with a, little tray table.  And they'd sit me in front of that.  I swear I felt like I was a king.  And they would just cater to me and, and see about me.  And my, great uncle and I would watch Roy Rogers [western actor/singer] and all of the westerns of the day.  And it was really a, remarkable feeling.  I, you know, over and above the mother's love, it is the greatest love I ever felt.

Speaker 1: When you go to Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana], you're sort of--but this is a new--this is the city as opposed to (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the other part of that is that, those are my mother's [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab] relatives.  My father's [Herman Scott] relatives settled in New Orleans, and as I got older, we would spend half the time in Bogalusa [Louisiana] in the country and the other half with my cousins in, New Orleans.  And I began, to develop a great relationship with my father's sister's children who I still have a great relationship with.  As a matter of fact, my father's sister just died last year, Marlene.  And so it evolved from country to part, half country--you know, half the time spent in the country, half the time spent in New Orleans.  So I grew up being very familiar with New Orleans.
Speaker 1: So how was the Xavier experience for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was really interesting.  You know, I mentioned the fact that there was a lot of militancy developing on the West Side [of Chicago, Illinois].  You know, friends of mine marched into Cicero [Illinois] and, you know, were--had rocks thrown at them.  And I did testing in the Belmont-Cragin [Chicago, Illinois] area, you know, where we would go out and ask if you had houses to buy, or rent.  And we'd be told no.  And by the time we got to the other, real estate offices, they'd be closed because they knew we were in the area.  They'd all call one another.  And so, it's in that backdrop that I go off to, college.  And the first school that I went to was Xavier University.  And Xavier was, an anomaly.  It was, it was a place where--and I'm sure I'm exaggerating, but every time I think about it, I think of straight-haired, light-skinned kids who railed at the notion of being called black.  And you'd literally be in a classroom, and when the word was--it was 'black' at the time, it would be mentioned.  They'd say, "I'm not black." They'd literally, "I'm not black."  And I--every time I thought of the campus, I thought of these kids in white shirts with the red and blue v-neck collars with tennis rackets in their hands, you know, running across campus in a, way that didn't really reflect what I thought was going on at the time.  The school was, at the time run by a nun, who was white.  Norman Francis was the deputy chancellor [of Xavier University].  And it, really was inconsistent with what I was about at the time.  And I thought to myself, well, hell, if I'm gonna go through this kind of stuff, I might as well just go to a, majority university.  And that same guy that I talked to you about, Father Dan Mallette, who was so instrumental at the parish level had, been shipped off to New York by then [John] Cardinal Cody because of his irreverence.  He was the dean of admissions.  I applied to Fordham [University, New York, New York] and the next year I went to Fordham.
Speaker 1: So you went to Xavier one year?
Speaker 2: I went to Xavier one year.
Speaker 1: So you really--you found the experience--a lot of times people don't understand about the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  They were very conservative at that time.  And you're talking about the student body, you know, very--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Xavier was a different, animal in the sense that, at the time, and I've, heard that it's completely changed.  And I have no reason to believe that's not true, but at the time, we were all struggling for identity.  You know, we had become black for the first time.  We, you know, we, were all growing afros.  You know, it was just a different time.  It was, a time of discovery.  And, you know, in my opinion, these guys were really locked in some past that didn't make any sense at all to me because you left New Orleans and came to Chicago, you'd be looked at as black, just like I was.  And it, was just odd.  And I think that the teachers were caught in that dilemma.  I think the school was caught in this identity dilemma, and I was.  And I wanted to do things and it didn't appear like they were moving in that direction.  So I said to myself, you know, you know, let me go try something because this isn't, this isn't working.  And I went to [New York] New York, which was a--which is another experience all together.
Story_ID: 13034
Speaker 1: I mentioned the fact that New York [New York] was--well, that, that we were going the Vietnam War at the time.  So we were talking lotteries, talking veterans coming home.  Unlike anything I'd ever seen in Chicago [Illinois], there was a very severe drug culture there.  As a matter of fact, three of my classmates died--classmates died of overdoses in the washrooms of Fordham [University, New York, New York].  As it turns out, Fordham has two campuses.  It's the Lincoln Center Campus and the Bronx Campus.  The Lincoln Center Campus, was Midtown [Manhattan, New York] and this--just like the, University of Illinois Circle [Campus, Chicago, Illinois].  It's an in-town campus but just had opened up.  So it was this really remarkable opportunity for people to come and learn from the inner city.  And they were taking veterans and G.I.'s [military personnel] and--a good mixture of all kinds of people.  It was really kind of a remarkable deal, but there's this severe drug culture.  And one of my--one of the most poignant memories is that these guys would come from Vietnam, and they would be--from the jungles, they would be well fed.  They'd be suntanned.  They'd be healthy.  They'd be strong looking, very handsome men.  And literally, within a matter of months, these strong, virile, good-looking guys would be reduced to ashy faces, shriveled up arms, hair falling out, nodding in their seats in the cafeteria, nodding in their seats in their classrooms.  They would, snort something called scag which was heroin waste.  And that was the drug of preference.  And they would come to the tables with their nostrils red and sometimes the nostrils would just bleed.  And I recall going on the plaza, which is overlooking the Juilliard School [New York, New York] of music, this fabulous plaza with all this brick and mortar.  And I was standing there, and a friend, you know, I had known every day, walks up to me and asks me if I want to get off.  And I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.  I'm this kid from the Midwest.  I said, sure.  And literally, out of his school bag, he pulls a hypodermic, a cooker, a syringe--I'm sorry, a syringe which is a hypodermic and a, and a rubber band.  And I said, "I'm not--I can't do that."  And he said, "Well, help me."  And I tied up his arm.  And he asked me to hit his arm so he could see the veins.  And he shot up in front of me.  I'd never seen anything like that. It was just a remarkable thing.  Now, that's on the--that side.  And, and there was a lot of that.  And I'll tell, it was tough not to get in trouble.  But on the other side, Margaret Mead, the world-famous anthropologist was an instructor of mine.  And she would come to class with her cane, accompanied what seemed like an army of people because she was really revered.  And she would sit and she'd talk about these experiences, and it was just breathtaking.  On another occasion, I was asked to go to an assembly in the large auditorium that they had there.  Just go, it's an African American speaker.  So they all tried to herd us in there, but, you know, of this room, I was by myself because I couldn't get any of my friends to go.  It was mostly white children listening.  And this guy came on stage, he was African American.  And he talked about his business and how well he had done and how after he had done well, he retired early.  And he had this notion about trying to figure out who his family was, and figuring out, he had children and he wanted to pass something along to them.  So he started this research project in the library and he looked up, you know, his family.  And he found out that unlike he thought, his family was really from somewhere in Carolina.  So he actually got on a, bus or a plane or something and went to this town.  And he did some research there and found out that he had relatives there and the relatives, you know, did searches.  And they went their books, and he--they found out that his family was from, indeed, Africa, the West Coast of Africa.  And he'd gone to Africa, and he describes, you know, as, as tears start to stream from his eyes, that he finds his, family's village.  And he talks to people and he finds, the sub-village that he's from and the tribe that he's from.  And he actually walks into a place and discovers a relative of his in Africa.  And the person describing all of this was Alex Haley [author], long before he ever wrote his book ['Roots'], long before there was ever TV series ['Roots' and 'Roots II: The Next Generation'].  You know, that was, a kind of cultural experience that New York brought to you.  There was an African American who, was the first play critic that wrote for the 'New York Times,' [newspaper] a guy named Daniel Watts, who was the editor of the 'Liberator' magazine.  You know, there was just a, remarkably rich period in terms of culture and growing up.  New York was a, the New York Knicks [professional basketball team] were the world champions.  And you would regularly go to parties and see Walt Frazier, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was then Lew Alcindor [professional basketball players], had just graduated the year before from Power Memorial [Academy, high school, New York, New York], which was right up the street from there.  And in the, late school year, they would always be back in the city, and we would run into them at the different functions that we went to.  Afros were big.  You'd go up to Smalls' Paradise [New York nightclub].  Smalls' was a big-time place and people were parked four deep of the largest Cadillacs you'd ever seen in your life.  Abyssinian Baptist Church [Harlem, New York] was up there, and at the time, [Congressman] Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.] was still an elected official.  And there was another woman who was one of the first, the first African American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives--.
Speaker 2: Shirley Chisholm.
Speaker 1: Shirley Chisholm, who came to the school and talked with us.  It was really, really a rich time.
Story_ID: 13035
Speaker 1: So did you--but you didn't find yourself to be a New Yorker, though?
Speaker 2: Well, after a while I became one.  What happens is you really get used to the pace.  You know, you really, you really kind of go with your friends.  The one interesting thing about me though, I was really determined to get out of get out of college [Fordham University, New York, New York] in four years because of the manner in which I had been sent.  And so I had this philosophy and I actually sat down with my children and anybody else that I really care about that's going away to school, and I say to them, "You know, college has a lot of distractions.  And, you know, you really have to be careful of them.  The dilemma is you have to get your schoolwork, and then there's this party life that exists."  And let me tell you, it existed for me in proportions that are really hard to imagine now.  But I'd say to them, "You can participate, you can go, you can, go through college and go to parties and never feel like you'll miss anything.  But you wear a watch.  And at 11:00, 10:30, 11:00, 12:00, you have to leave."  And my MO [modus operandi] would always be, I'd go to the parties as early as I could.  I'd be there as everybody came in.  And as soon as the party really got going, I'd leave.  And I do this, I do that to this day (laughs).  If you ask any of my friends, they'll always tell you, you know, I come in, I make the rounds, and I'm gone.  The other thing is that, I always, I always believed that one should be known by their good works.  And I tell my children this as well.  You know, I never wore a name tag as I was coming along, never--and if you see me now, I don't know that you've ever seen me put on a name tag that anybody gives me.  And the reason I didn't, I never put one on is because I wanted to be able to go into any function around the city of Chicago [Illinois] and have people say, well, you know, "Hi Mike, how are you?"  But I was known, not because somebody had to peer at a nametag to know who I was.  They would know me because of my good works.  And, lo, these many years later, that's true.  And those were habits that I picked up in New York, trying to make sure that I spent enough time on my studies.  Go early, leave early, you don't miss a thing.
Speaker 1: Was it because of the scholarship or [Father] Dan Mallette--you said, something about I wanted to finish in four years and I could have, under--.
Speaker 2: I was saying that, my discipline centered around the fact that I wanted to get out in four years because I was on scholarship from the Better Boys Foundation [social service organization].  And I, and those guys would always check on me and make sure that I was doing well.  And so I wanted to be sure that, I was, not responsible to the people who sent me to college.  And so I had to develop these habits that allowed me to get out.  And, of the, 231 African Americans who entered that class, that first class of 3,000 kids, 6 graduated on time, and I was one of them.
Story_ID: 13036
Speaker 1: You came back [to Chicago, Illinois] because, you know, of a possible job with the police department, right?  Is that--?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, no.  You know, I--you know, during that time, nobody really knows what they want to do.  The first thing, I drove up to--. I had a friend who worked for Aetna Insurance.  And he was an efficiency analyst.  And his name was Chip.  And he traveled the country, you know, going to various Aetna places, doing calibrating and calculating, whether these people were being as efficient as they ought to be.  He said, "That's something you ought to do."  So I actually went to--I went to Aetna Insurance in Hartford, Connecticut, took the test and passed that too.  And so when I graduated out of college [Fordham University, New York, New York]--because I wasn't sure when the police were gonna call.  I just wanted a job.  So after I graduated, I was given a report date for ten days after my graduation date.  So I left New York and drove home, unpacked my bags and I started to prepare, to leave for Hartford, Connecticut.  But after two or three days of my mother's [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab's] cooking, after two or three days of being able just to sleep and not be on a clock anymore, and trying to wind down, my date, my deadline for reporting to work came and left.  And I never left the city.  I ended up that first year out of, after--ended up that first year after graduating from college working at the ABC Youth Center [Chicago], working with children.  I had figured out, you know, coming home every year looking for a job, that the job market was artificially inflated with kids swearing they weren't gonna go back to school.  They'd take these, take up these jobs, and at the end of the year, they'd leave.  And so I figured the best time to look for a serious job was after the summer.  So I spent that summer working for the Chicago youth centers.
Story_ID: 13037
Speaker 1: And is that when you went to work for Lawndale Community--let's see, for Pyramid, no.  Or was Pyramid later?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, after that summer [following graduation from Fordham University, New York, New York], I started trying to look around for work in St. Agatha's [Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois], which has always been a rock.  They had a social center going, and one of the youth workers over there was a guy named Willie Curtis, who actually drives a cab on the South Side [of Chicago] now.  But he was very active and very involved in youth, and if you see him, to this day, I just ran into Willie not too long ago, he said, "You know what, Mike, you're out of college.  You've got a degree.  You know, they're hiring over there at then, NLEDC," the North Lawndale Economic Development Corporation.  And he said, "You ought to go over there and apply."  And my mother [Dionne Jacqueline Deshab], again, who was involved, you know, I told her, I asked her if she knew about them.  She said, "Yes."  She called some of her friends, and the next thing I knew I had an interview.  I was interviewed by a woman by the name of Diane Glenn, who later became the president of the Community Bank of Lawndale. Then I was interviewed by a guy named Cecil Butler.  They liked me, asked me very few questions, and the next thing I knew I was hired.  And I was hired as a coordinator or something, I forget.  And, but for the North Lawndale Economic Development Corporation, which was a part of the old Community Development Corporation legislation, Title VII, which was similar, similarly funded to the urban, to the urban progress centers.  That was Title VII money.  But this was a special allocation of dollars.  And these dollars were ostensibly set up for, local groups to start for-profit businesses.  And that's what the NLEDC, which, was the predecessor organization to Pyramid West Development Corporation.  In the meantime, all of this had been started by a parent, a not-for-profit parent called LPPAC, which exists to this day, which is the Lawndale Peoples Planning and Action Conference.
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe North Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] at that time, you know, the community and the role of--.
Speaker 2: Pyramid West?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, the thing that you have to remember now, during high school, you know, the jobs started to move that I told you about.  And all these people had come here in frustration.  And it kind of flowed over.  There were the riots and then, then [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] died [1968] and there were more riots and more and more business people started to leave.  And so by the time I actually graduated--the, troops had actually occupied Lawndale during those riots.  I saw stores ransacked.  You know, I watched reporters walk up to friends of mine.  And there was a group of kids that had participated in those riots who were interviewed by a guy from the '[Chicago] Tribune,' who was a graduate of Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire].  And he ended up having, getting four-year scholarships for five kids who lived in the neighborhood.  Paul Cooper, who was a--he's about to retire from the Chicago Board of Education after a thirty year distinguished career.  Two of the guys died.  Another guy I saw just the other day at, at DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].  He's a teacher out there.  So anyway, these guys, as a result of that, went away to Dartmouth.  And so, so the community that I knew as a high schooler with the businesses and shops was completely different at the time.  And so this group was put together to try to rebuild the community.  And they had these--there was a report called the Greenlee Report that was really kind of a roadmap for community economic development to be done--owned by African Americans and run by African Americans.  And so it was a, time of fear, people not really knowing where jobs were coming from.  All the jobs had left at that point.  A lot of disparity, a lot of people being put out of their homes, lots of, lots of change going on during that time.
Speaker 1: Now, was Bethel New Life [Inc.], was it operating around that time or did it come a little later?
Speaker 2: Actually, it did start to, it did start around that time, but they were operating primarily just to the north and west of us. They, started it in a, in a little office on Madison Street [Chicago] and their original name was CAM, Christian Action Ministry.  It was a group of churches that got together and, as a matter of fact, it was run by a guy named Al Portis who died last week and Mary Nelson.  They built some housing units.  They went into the nursing home business.  A schism kind of took place.  Al was the head of their nursing home.  If, I don't know if you recall, but that was a--the air conditioning went down.  They had a real severe mechanical problem which resulted in the death of some seniors and they split. And then CAM went on to do the things that it's doing.  And, and Al went on in the private sector.
Story_ID: 13038
Speaker 1: Now, during this time, this is still a time of, you know, sort of, well, turmoil, but these are opportunities being opened up for black people.  And money is, you know, coming into--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: It has come into this, city [Chicago, Illinois].  And--.
Speaker 2: From the enterprises that were created by that operation, there are people that I've seen work all their lives, raise their children, send them to college, and they're still there.  I mean it was, it was a testimony to their plan.  And I mean all the things that they set out to do, didn't always happen when they thought it was going to happen, but they stuck with the plan.  And for the most part, they realized most of the things they were trying to do, which was really to create long-term employment opportunities for people in the neighborhood, when there were none.
Speaker 1: And the community had been--now, did you remember the riots?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  When--and I'm, and I'm, the dates are foggy, but there was one that happened as a result of just frustration when I was in high school [St. Philip's High School, Chicago].  And when I went away to college [Xavier University, New Orleans, Louisiana/Fordham University, New York, New York] , I remember coming home from college during the holidays after Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had died.  And the whole neighborhood was in flames.  I came home in a cab, and the cab driver literally wanted to put me out of the car.  He didn't want to drive to my house.  It was devastating, fires everywhere, people running in gangs, attacking store by store with rocks, breaking windows, tearing out the bars, running away with the clothing, stealing the food.  It was just devastating.  It was nothing left when it was done, nothing left.
