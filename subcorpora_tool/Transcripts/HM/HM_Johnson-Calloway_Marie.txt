Story_ID: 277154
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're just gonna do kind of a few questions to kind of get relaxed.  They're gonna sound kind of silly, so just kind of bear with us.  Could you tell us what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: Apples (laughter).  That's the first thing came to mind, but that's one of my favorite foods.

Speaker 2: Usually fall, but here in this area, March, because everything is so fresh and green and new-looking.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Why?

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it' more vital.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Hawaii.  We're going next week (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or a favorite saying?
Speaker 2: I noticed that you asked that question, and I was trying to think of what favorite quote I had.  And I think the one that keeps coming back is that you don't know where you're going until you know where you've been.
Story_ID: 277155
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we're just gonna go and kind of explore your background a little bit.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Could you please tell us, tell me about your mother.  What was her name, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Her name was Marie Mack [Edwards].  She was born in Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea when?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was born in 1890.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a little bit about when she was growing up, something about her background?
Speaker 2: Well, her mother was the daughter of a slave master.  And her mother was raised in the big house by his sisters, both spinsters.  But she was taught to read and write, one of the few slave children who could read and write.  And she was raised by these two sisters as a part of that family.  And there were several occasions when their friends came to visit.  And my grandmother was a very beautiful young lady.  And one of the visitors at their home was a lawyer from Manning, South Carolina, and they established a relationship.  And when emancipation came, he got one of her field hand brothers to take her away from Charleston to Manning, South Carolina.  He set her up in a home, and they raised five children, but they were never able to marry because of the laws there.  However, he married a white person, and they had another whole family on the other side of town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that affected me directly.  When I would go to visit my grandmother every summer, and my Aunt Lillian [Mack (ph.)], who frequently was there, my mother's older sister, would always dress my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] and me up in our finest dresses, and comb out this long hair, and walk us downtown.  And we never realized until much later that she was really showing us off to the other side of town.  And that's my memory of my grandmother's home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had white neighbors who treated her as if she were their mistress.  They came over and they chopped her wood, and they brought her (laughter), helped her with her chickens, and was an, an interesting relationship.  They had a very close friendship with her white neighbors.  She also had black neighbors, and they were very good friends.  And my mother established friendships with, with these people who lived around there.
Story_ID: 277156
Speaker 1: Okay, so when your mother [Marie Mack Edwards] was--can you please tell me about your mother's growing up when she was little.  And what did, did she work?
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: When she was little or when I was--
Speaker 1: When--
Speaker 2: --little?
Speaker 1: --no, when she was little.
Speaker 2: No, she--this family of five children and my grandmother were supported by their father, who was a prominent judge in the town of Manning, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he supported them.  And according to my mother, they had a very warm relationship.  He used to come to their house every night and bring candy and things for the children.  And she has fond memories of him.  His name was Clinton.  And my middle name is Clintonia, named after him.
Speaker 1: So, did your mother go to school?
Speaker 2: My mother's oldest sister was sent to school, finished college at Claflin College [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], which was I think perhaps a land grant college--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --in South Carolina.  And she became a member of the first faculty there, which I showed you a picture of.  And while she was teaching there, she brought my mother there to live with her and to go to school.  So my mother was one of the earliest graduates from Claflin, which became a state college, and I think it was in Orangeburg, South Carolina--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that also in the town of Charleston [South Carolina], there was a couturier designer named Madame Pauline Seiber [sic. Pauline Seba].  And my mother was sent there when she was fourteen as an apprentice to Ms. Pauline.  And she lined all the fine art of sewing and all the fancy dresses, and she worked in her sewing room.  And interestingly, Chuck [Charles Calloway] and I went on vacation to Charleston a few years back.  And walking down the street, I passed this house that had Seiber on the plate in the door.  And I'm sure that was probably the house of this Seiber family where my mother was the apprentice seamstress.  So, she taught us all how to sew, and that was a big part of our life.  And my mother supported us by sewing for people.
Story_ID: 277157
Speaker 1: Could you tell me something about your father?  What was his name?  Where was he born?
Speaker 2: His name was Sidney Joseph [Edwards], and he was ten years older than my mother [Marie Mack Edwards].  And he had met her in Manning, South Carolina, where he visited as a young minister.  He was one of the few ordained ministers of that time.  He was born in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And he married my mother when she was eighteen, and moved to Tampa, Florida, where my oldest sister [Anita Edwards Posey] was born, and then ended up in Pimlico, Maryland, where he started a Baptist church, Berean Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland].  But he also was a men's tailor, and he used to make clothes for all the jockeys and the racetrack people at Pimlico [Race Course, Baltimore, Maryland] (laughter).  It's a mixed up background, isn't it?  So that was where I lived until I was four years old.  And that picture is taken in the backyard of our Pimlico home--
Speaker 1: Okay, you had--
Speaker 2: --my father, and mother, and sisters, and bra- sister and brothers.
Story_ID: 277158
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that when your parents [Marie Mack Edwards and Sidney Joseph Edwards] were there, there was no school for the African American children.  And your mother did something very interesting.
Speaker 2: Right, my mother was an active worker in his church, of course.  And she gathered all the little black children--they were called Negro children then--together and taught them under a tree in front of the church.  And she went around and gathered up every one of them, whatever their age was, and convinced the City of Baltimore [Maryland] that there was no teacher there for these children.  And be, through her efforts, they sent a teacher, Ms. Mary Brown.  I remember the name.  And so that was how the school was started.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea what time, when that was?
Speaker 2: That would have had--I wasn't born.  So my sister looks like she's about three on there, and she was born in 1915.  So it was probably around 1918.
Story_ID: 277159
Speaker 1: You've told us something about your grandparents on your mother's [Mary Mack Edwards] side.  Could you tell me something about your grandparents on your father's [Sidney Joseph Edwards] side?
Speaker 2: We never knew any of my father's relatives.  And my mother didn't know any of them except for one sister who was a nun in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Now, my sister [Anita Edwards Posey], when she, much later, she married Leroy Posey, who was from a very well-known family at Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Leroy Posey's father [Leroy Posey, Sr.] was the head of the science and math department at Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and he taught there.  Leroy went there to teach when his father died.  And my sister was living there, and we went to visit her.  And we got the idea that we should go look for my father's sister in New Orleans.  And we knew if she was a nun, there couldn't have been too many nunneries for black sisters.  And it, in no time we located her, and it was a school out in the outskirts of New Orleans.  And we went to see her, and she was the mother superior there.  And there was a very tearful, beautiful reunion because we had never met her, and she didn't know any of her brother's family.  And so she had corresponded with my mother, but my mother had never met her.  But that way my sister and I with one of my, both of my children met her.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a wonderful story.  Could you tell me--
Speaker 2: Her name was Sister Eulalia [ph.].
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: Sister Eulalia, and she was the, the mother superior there.
Story_ID: 277160
Speaker 1: What were your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: I have lots of them (laughter).  When we left Pimlico, [Maryland] we moved to the City of Baltimore, [Maryland] and we lived on Druid Hill Avenue, which was across the street from Druid Hill Park.  And I remember frequently crossing the street to play in the park.  My brother, my younger brother [Augustus Edwards] was a baby, and he was my charge.  I was about four, and he would have been one, so he was a little tyrant (laughter).  And we had to cross the streetcar tracks to go to the park and back.  And whenever we got to those tracks he would stretch out on the track and have a tantrum (laughter).  And we would, I would have to pick him up and bring him home.  That's one memory.  And my father [Sidney Joseph Edwards] was a minister, but he was rarely at home.  And so my older sister [Anita Edwards Posey] and brothers [Alphaeus Edwards and Sidney Edwards] were in school, and the two of us, my little brother and I, were home alone.  And I remember my father telling us what to do if the phone rang.  And if anybody came to the door, I was to say my father is gone to the drug store, and my mother's [Marie Mack Edwards] in the hospital.  My mother was ill.  And so there was a period of time when I remembered that.  And we moved a lot.  I think my father had trouble paying the rent, and every time the rent wasn't paid we had to move.  So we moved into at least six or seven different houses when I was a child.  And one of my unhappiest memories, I would think, would be to come home from school and find our furniture sitting in the street.  Because in those days, if you didn't pay the rent, they'd put your stuff in the street.  And I know of at least two or three occasions when we would have to go home and fit- fish through (laughter) these things and find out--but I don't remember it as an unhappy childhood especially.  I think my mother was able to keep a home that we felt at home in.
Story_ID: 277161
Speaker 1: Could you tell us your siblings' names in their birth order?
Speaker 2: My siblings' names?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: My oldest brother was Alphaeus.  This older sister of my mother's [Marie Mack Edwards] was literate and classical, and she named us after (laughter) these classical people, and he was named A-L-P-H-A-E-U-S, Alphaeus.  I don't know where that came from.  But he was an ideal older brother, and he was very bright.  He finished high school and went to Morgan College [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], the first to go there at fourteen.  He started college at fourteen.  But at twenty-two, he died of tuberculosis.  And tuberculosis was rampant at that time.  He'd spent some time in a--what do they call those hosp- hospitals?
Speaker 1: Sanitariums?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: A sanitarium?
Speaker 2: Sanitarium, and he died there.  And that was, I was about thirteen or fourteen years old at the time.  We were very close, because I was finishing high school, and they had a February graduation.  And you didn't go to graduate till June.  There used to be able to graduate in--so between that February and June I was home.  But that was also the years in which he was very sick, so I would go walking with him.  And we had to have milk and the fresh air and so forth, but he died.  And then my next sibling was my sister, who's five years older than I.  We became very close and more close as, as we both became older.  And then I had another brother, Sidney [Edwards].
Speaker 1: What was her name, your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Sister's name was Anita--
Speaker 1: Anita.
Speaker 2: --Anita Alise [ph.], and her middle name was after one of my mother's sisters, Alise.  And my sister was a teacher.  And actually, for a few years she was the support there in the house because my mother and father [Sidney Joseph Edwards] were separated when I was about seven.  So my mother raised these five kids alone.  And then my sister finished Coppin [Fanny Jackson Coppin Normal School; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland], which was the school where we all finished if we wanted to teach.  And after she taught--I mean finished Coppin, she went to Columbia University [New York, New York] in the summer in New York [New York] and got her degree.  If you wanted to get a degree, you had to take extension work or go somewhere else.  So that's what she did, in which she'd learned writing and teaching, and she became a writer, and she wrote children's poetry.  Several of her books of poetry were published.  And she was also a singer but taught in the Baltimore [Maryland] school district for a while, for most of her life, til she married Leroy [Posey], and then she went to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] with him.
Story_ID: 277162
Speaker 1: And the third child?
Speaker 2: Third child was Sidney [Edwards].  He was three years older than I.  And he was selected to go to Prairie View [A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] (laughter) when several black children from Baltimore [Maryland] were taken there by a coach to be on the track team.  He was a runner.  And so he went there and finished Prairie View.  He never worked as anything except a waiter, which is what a lot of the young men in Baltimore did for a living.  At that time, black waiters were, that was one of the best jobs they could get.  And that brother did that until he developed lung cancer.  He came out to San Jose [California] and lived with my mother [Marie Mack Edwards].  He was told he had six weeks to live, but he, he lived a year and a half after that.  And then my younger brother was Augustus [Edwards].  There's another classical name (laughter).  And he was three years older [sic. younger] than I.  He's the one that I kind of helped to raise.  And he became a drug ad- addict.  He was a genius, and he was a fellow at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York] in the industrial relations, but he was drafted in the, the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] before that time.  And when he came back he had gotten into drugs, and he never was able to lick it.  And so he had lots of opportunities, but it, he couldn't beat the drugs.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And eventually he died from that.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So these are not very happy stories (laughter), and I don't know that all of this needs to be published.  But it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who I am.
Story_ID: 277163
Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about the neighborhood you lived in, in Baltimore [Maryland] when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I lived in so many--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right you did.
Speaker 2: --different neighbors because we moved quite a, a lot.  But we lived in Northwest Baltimore, which is where most of the African Americans lived, and we finished [Frederick] Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  I was reading in one of your HistoryMakers somebody else who finished Douglass High School, much later than I did.  And so my first teaching was right there in that neighborhood too.  And it was like I guess most of us, we, we had a totally segregated life, and we lived within that narrow range.  But we didn't feel we were all that unhappy.  And it, well, my husband [Charles Calloway] and I were talking about this the other day, and it may have been because we had excellent black teachers, many of whom were talented musicians or writers.  And [W.E.B.] Du Bois' daughter [Yolande Du Bois Williams] was my English teacher.  Thurgood Marshall's mother [Norma Marshall] was my kindergarten teacher (laughter).  And Elton Fax, I don't know if you're familiar with him, he's a well-known artist.  His sister was my mathematics teacher.  And so these teachers gave us something special.  And contrary to the way our children were raised in integrated situations, we always felt very special because we were good students, and we learned to read, and write, and grammar, and history.  And so I felt we, we did all right.  We did, we got all the old books that came from the white section of town.  The pages would be half missing, but we learned from them.
Story_ID: 277164
Speaker 1: Could you tell me, are there are sights, or sounds, or smells that when you come in contact reminds you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Rolls cooking, maybe hot rolls.  My mother [Marie Mack Edwards] always fixed hot rolls on weekends.  One of the peculiar things, we found is peculiar, that Thanksgiving and Christmas we had turkey and sauerkraut.  So I still have sauerkraut with every holiday.  My kids [Art Johnson and April Johnson Watkins] are used to it.  And I found out that was strictly Baltimore [Maryland].  And, but I can still smell that smell.  And on the way from school, we passed a bakery where they would sell the crumbs to the kids for a penny a bag (laughter).  So we always would stop there and get this cake crumbs, so that's another odor.
Story_ID: 277165
Speaker 1: You've talked something about the schools and some of the teachers you had.  What kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I started school in the third grade, because when I was three, my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] had taught me how to read from the cereal boxes and the salt box.  And these were the first things I learned how to read, all the stuff on the boxes.  And so when I went to kindergarten I didn't like it because they weren't reading, and I was the first truant in my family.  My mother found out I was hiding because I didn't want to go to the kindergarten, so they just brought me home.  And then when it was time for me to go to first grade, when I would be six, they took me in and they found out I could read, "The old lady lived in a house on a hill."  That was the sentence I had to read.  So they put me in the third grade.  And so, the third grade--and then they'd skip children.  So then I skipped the part of the fourth grade and part of the fifth grade, so at nine, I was in junior high school.
Story_ID: 277166
Speaker 1: You were telling us that when you were nine years old you went on to junior high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So could you tell us a little bit about junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, that's where I had the incident with the man who had exposed himself.  And at various periods, up until I went to teach at training school, he would show up where I was.  He never bothered me, but he would be right near me, behind me, (laughter) or under some steps or someplace.  And a couple of times my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] was with me; we both saw him.  And finally it was when my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] saw him at the window, and she went and grabbed a broom and went and chased him away.  And ultimately, he was arrested, so I didn't see him anymore after that.  But that was just one of those weird things that happened, but most of my school life was just very, you know, pleasant.  And I was salutatorian when I finished junior high.  And they took me in for a lot of tests because I was so young.  But I became very friendly with the principal (laughter).  And he would come and get me out of class when he was walking the halls, and we would just walk.  I think he was really trying to see how I was doing.  But you know, it was just fun.  I would walk with the principal, and we would go into different rooms.  And then at high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], we just did the things that all the kids did.  I was in a lot of plays.  The drama teacher wanted to put on 'Everyman,' which is a morality play, a classic morality play.  And he couldn't find a boy to play the part of Everyman so (laughter) I played the part of Everyman.  And they felt that it didn't have to be a boy.  It, Everyman was male or female.  That was a memorable time.  We also had declamation contests, where you had to recite or do so oral presentation that was a big classic, and they brought somebody from the radio station to judge it.  And my teacher thought that I should do this poem called 'The Bells' [Edgar Allen Poe] because she thought I had a range.  I could speak high, or I could speak low.  And I had done lots of reciting, but it were always something for church or some little Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem.  And this was different than anything I had ever done.  And when I got up to recite, the students cracked up (laughter).  And I had never been laughed at on the stage.  But I was singing, saying: "See the silver bells and then the groaning and the moaning of the..."  And I tell you, when I looked out there and saw my classmates were just cracking up (laughter) laughing, I was heartbroken.  I got an honorable mention, but they gave me that for having the courage to stay out there on that stage and be laughed at. So that, that's another big memory I have. But generally speaking, I thought, you know, my school years were, were happy years.
Story_ID: 277167
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that influenced you or?
Speaker 2: Yes, that particular teacher who was the drama teacher was also the Latin teacher [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And I never could understand why we learned Latin, but I will defy anybody to question my grammar now, because she taught grammar, English grammar, through teaching Latin to us.  And she was just an outstanding teacher.  My Latin teacher, after her, was also outstanding.  I had a lot of teachers who I thought were excellent.  And they introduced us to things that our children nowadays don't get.  And we learned these classic things, and you know, you don't forget them.  With a little interesting aside to that is since Chuck [Charles Calloway] and I got married, we both found out we like Scrabble.  And we both found out we are pretty evenly matched, so we have some cutthroat games (laughter) of Scrabble with each other.  But we attribute it to the fact that we had good teachers, and we have vocabularies that match each other.  And that's a treasure that we got from those teachers.
Story_ID: 277168
Speaker 1: What about some of your friends in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] or school, the kids you grew up with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of them still lives in Baltimore [Maryland].  Her name was Snookie [ph.] (laughter).  And when we were looking through those pictures, one of those pictures was Snookie; that we were, we lived around the corner from each other, and we were inseparable.  And our favorite pastime was to walk from our house down to the Enoch Pratt [Free] Library [Baltimore, Maryland], which was about twenty-five blocks from where we lived.  But we would go to the library almost every day, and that was our big sport.  But also, she was an only child.  And her mother became pregnant, and she, they were being very strict and not telling Snookie any--but she knew something was up.  And she found this book about having a baby (laughter), which she snitched and put under her underwear and brought it over to my house.  And we went in the bathroom, and we were looking at this book and finding out where the baby comes from and all.  Her mother never knew we, we stole the book, and we learned all about having babies from that experience.  But Snookie is still living in Baltimore now.  And she's ill; she's almost blind.  But I saw her a couple of years ago when I went back there to visit.  Several of my friends, you know, they were, they were the high achievers (laughter) in school.  And so, you know, they've all, I don't know where they are now except for Snookie.  She's still living.
Story_ID: 277169
Speaker 1: How did the church influence you?  Did your family go to church often?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Sidney Joseph Edwards] was--
Speaker 1: Your father was a--
Speaker 2: --a Baptist preacher.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My mother [Marie Mack Edwards] was quite active in church.  But, of course, as I told you, when I was seven they separated.  But, for a while, my father would try to come back and visit and spent a little time with us.  And one of those pictures where you see him with my brother [Sidney Edwards] and me, he had come and taken us to Wonderland Park [Baltimore, Maryland], which was like a theme park.  And he also took care of us when my mother took my brothers and went to South Carolina.  And one of the things that I think caused them to divorce was when she came back, he had moved us from the house we lived in to another house where he could have his tailor shop.  But he also was cleaning the clothes in the back.  And when my mother came, and she saw that we were in the house with all these fumes, and my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] and I were in the front room taking care of customers (laughter), that's when she moved us out.  And, but during time, one of the memorable things is my father decided he would cook stew for us.  And he hadn't done any cooking, so it was terrible.  And he thought he'd got it red by putting red pepper in, instead of tomatoes, and we couldn't eat it.  But you know, these are things that I remember.  The house had a, had a dumbwaiter, which is like a little closet that would take things down to the first floor and up to the kitchen. And when we were kids we would hide from each other in the dumbwaiter. And when we were unhappy about something, we would hide in the dumbwaiter 'cause the dumbwaiter was a kind of symbol of retreat for us when we were growing up.  That was very young, that was.  But yes, they were young.  I always knew where my father was.  He had a tailor shop, and he still worked in the church [Berean Baptist Church, Baltimore, Maryland].
Story_ID: 277170
Speaker 1: But he [Johnson-Calloway's father, Sidney Joseph Edwards] had lost his place in the bigger churches, and he was down to a little storefront church, and that's where he lived, I mean that's where he ministered when he died.  And when I was married then.  I had children, you know, babies.  But there was no one to take charge of his funeral but me, because he didn't have any family.  And so that was a very memorable day, when I had to go take care of this funeral.  And my brothers and sisters and I had to go down the--the church [Berean Baptist Church, Baltimore, Maryland] was very hostile to us because we had not been, grown up in that church.  We went to another church, where my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] went.  And my mother went to the church where all the intelligent people, the teachers and the so forth were.  But my father's church was all these down home, lower econ- economically lower people, so they resented us.  We were also very light-skinned, and even though they loved my father, they did not love us.  And anyway, the most memorable thing that happened at that funeral, and this I wrote up in a story once, was when they got ready to close the casket, the funeral director--my father always wore a diamond stickpin, and he was buried in this stickpin.  And the funeral director came up and took the pin off and said she didn't think we wanted this to go in the funeral, in the ground.  And she handed it to my brother, who was the oldest one there.  And this little lady came down the aisle.  This little lady just fussing: "Oh, no. I gave him that (laughter), I gave him that pin, and that pin is going in the ground with him."  And so there was moment of indecision as what to do with this pin, and here's my father lying there in a casket.  So I said, "Put it back on him."  So, she put the pin back on him, and the casket was closed with this diamond stickpin.  I had one on this sculptor, but one of the shows I had it in somebody stole it because it, they thought it was a diamond.  I think it was a dime store pin I had put there (laughter).  But that was a memory I'll never forget, of this woman coming down there telling us about this pin--
Speaker 2: When you--
Speaker 1: --so (laughter).  I got lots of those.
Story_ID: 277171
Speaker 1: When you were in school, did you take art lessons?  Where you interested--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in art then?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't until I was in Coppin [Teachers College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and we had to take art for children, you know, how, how to teach art to children.  And I remembered then enjoying that class so much and finding out that I had some ability.  And that was the first art class that I ever had.  And after that, I realized that that was a very special part of my life, but not, not until then had I--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --had any.
Speaker 1: --could you tell us some more about Coppin (unclear).
Speaker 2: Coppin was unique.  We didn't have a school.  We had the top floor of an elementary school.  There were about six or seven rooms, and all of our teaching was done in those six classrooms, but it prepared us to teach in the City of Baltimore [Maryland].  And it's interesting, when I told you a little bit about getting a job teaching in San Jose [California], when I was the first black teacher there; and in this interview that they had with me--I don't know if you want me to go back and tell this story, but, do you?
Speaker 1: We'll talk about San Jose when we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, when we get there--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I found out that what I had learned in Coppin carried me and was useful to me later, which I'll tell you about later.
Speaker 1: After you finished Coppin, you started teaching?
Speaker 2: Yes, but not the first year, because the first year they had, during the [Great] Depression, a freeze, and no black teachers were hired that year at all.  So I had to substitute even though I was a second on the list of people to be hired.  I had to, to teach as a substitute, and we got three dollars a day (laughter), and my first paycheck was sixty-three dollars.  And the next year, evidently when the economy was a little better, they hired us, so then I was hired to teach.  But that first year of substituting, I've often worried about those little children because I had to teach first grade, and I had never done student teaching in first grade, and teaching first grade is unique.  And I didn't know a thing about teaching kids to read, but I figured it out.  And I've often wondered (laughter) how they made out.  But later, I taught second grade and then sixth grade.
Story_ID: 277172
Speaker 1: But I taught for, off and on, ten years in Baltimore [Maryland], coming out with maternity leaves.  When I was having my children, there was a law that you could not teach until your kids were a year old.  They didn't want teachers teaching until their children were a year old.  But my husband then was a freshman in medical school, and I needed to teach to support us.  And he commuted from Baltimore to Washington [D.C.] to go to school.  And I'm trying to think how I happen to be telling you that.  Oh, what, what were you gonna say?
Speaker 2: You were, you were telling us that you had to, you had maternity leave, and you had, you couldn't work for a year--
Speaker 1: Couldn't go back until--
Speaker 2: --but you had to--
Speaker 1: Yes, so during that year, I got a, a job in Washington, D.C., which is what a lot of Baltimore people did.  They went over there and worked for the government.  And it was during the war [World War II, WWII].  And I tried several times.  You had to take a civil service exam.  I always passed the exam.  They would tell me that I'd passed it.  And then I would commute over there on the train and get there, and they'd say, "Well, we have already hired."  So after three times of doing this, I was tearfully walking down the street, and I saw this man come out of this building, and he saw me.  He said, "Can I help you?"  I said, I told him I had been over there three times for a job, and I couldn't get one, and I needed.  And he said, "Well, come with me."  He worked in that building, and it was the War Production Board.  And he went up to a desk and said give this lady a job, so I got (laughter) a job as a file clerk.  And I, that's how, you know, we lived for that year, because we caught the train together.  At six in the morning we had to get to the train station, get a, go to Washington, then get to the, where the War Production Board was, and then come back home.
Speaker 2: And your first--
Speaker 1: And my baby was, my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] was taking care of my baby at that time.
Speaker 2: And your husband, your first husband's name was?
Speaker 1: Arthur Johnson, and he became the first doctor who, when we moved to San Jose [California]. I was the first teacher; he was the first black doctor.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so where did he, he go to school?
Speaker 1: He went to Lincoln, which I where I understand-
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  John [Stret (ph.)].
Speaker 1: --John went to school.  He finished Lincoln, but then he went to Freedmen's [Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] in Washington, where he went to medical school.
Story_ID: 277173
Speaker 1: After you had been teaching for ten years in Baltimore [Maryland], you moved?
Speaker 2: He [Johnson-Calloway's first husband, Arthur Johnson] was drafted.
Speaker 1: He was drafted.
Speaker 2: And we were sent to Columbia, South Caroline--I mean Columbus, Ohio.  And because we knew so much about people who couldn't find a place to stay, we bought a house trailer (laughter).  We bought a little house trailer, and we figured we, wherever we went, we would have our own house.  So when we went to Columbus we went in this house trailer.  And before we left, this trailer was sitting outside our front door, and all our neighbors to see 'cause we were gonna drive this house trailer back to, to the, to Columbus.  And I remember during that time was when [HistoryMaker] Samella Lewis is, who is a famous writer, she had been one of my teachers at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] when I went to finish my--see, after I left Coppin [Teachers College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland], I only had a certificate, but we had to go for a year more.  So I went to Morgan after my kids were in school.  And my first art teacher there, painting teacher, was Samella Lewis, and we became friends.  And she was from Columbus, Ohio, so that when I went to Columbus, naturally I looked up Samella.  And Samella was making Christmas cards, silkscreening.  And she taught me how to silkscreen, so I helped her produce Christmas cards, and she sold them.  And, but we were stationed there on the base.  And when winter came, not having been experienced trailer people, we didn't know that they pipes would freeze.  So the pipes froze under this trailer, and my husband was on call, and he wasn't at home.  But his father was visiting us from Baltimore, so his father and I got under that trailer.  And we found out that the people there had what they call some kind of heaters.  And you'd wrap the pipe up, and run heat down there, and it would melt the pipes.  So we had to get under there and find this, his old father and me (laughter), but we got that water running.  And that's my memory of, of trailer living in Columbia, South Carolina [sic. Columbus, Ohio].
Story_ID: 277174
Speaker 1: But I established a friendship with [HistoryMaker] Samella [Lewis], which lasted till now, and--
Speaker 2: So you were taking art classes in Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: That's all I took.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I, by this time, I realized art was what I really wanted to do, and so I took my whole extra year in take, taking sculpture, painting.  But to fill in the time so I wouldn't have to go back and forth between classes, I took a class in creative writing.  And it was during that time that I wrote this story.  And the teacher of the creative writing class sent the story to a college journal where they would print.  And it, I didn't know it, but it was in a contest, and it won the contest.  We had moved.  We, we were back by this time in, in Columbus [Ohio] and in, in Texas and you know, moving around.  And I found out that this story, which dealt with miscegenation, had to be printed in the prison because the prison printed this little journal.  And the warden at the prison didn't want to print this story because it dealt with miscegenation (laughter), and he wouldn't print it.  But the teacher, who had submitted it, insisted that they were responsible so they would have to pay to have it printed somewhere else, which they did.  And it, all of this happened without my knowing it 'cause I had left.  And it was, the story was printed in the [Baltimore] Afro-American newspaper [Afro-American Newspapers] (laughter).  And, but the headline said "Co-ed Story Banned by Prison Warden." I wasn't any co-ed.  I was married with kids, you know.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, so that, that was another interesting incident.
Speaker 2: Do you know what the name of the story was?
Speaker 1: 'The Gentle Hands' [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll have to look it up (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh, I don't know if you'll ever find it.  But I never, you know, it was not published anywhere else, but it was in the Afro-American paper.  And I wrote them and told them they didn't have permission to print my story.  So they wrote back and thanked me for permission and sent me a check for twenty-five dollars (laughter) because my story was printed in their paper.  But that was interesting.
Speaker 2: So your husband [Arthur Johnson] was a doctor in the [U.S.] Army, and you were traveling around to Texas, and, and Ohio.
Speaker 1: And while we were in Texas is when he got sent to Alaska.
Speaker 2: Okay, were--
Speaker 1: And so then we went there for three years.
Story_ID: 277519
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking before we left that you had gotten married, and you had left Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And you were in this wonderful trailer going around the country, and you made it to Alaska.
Speaker 2: Well, not in the trailer.
Speaker 1: Oh, not in the trailer.
Speaker 2: We were afraid to drive the trail- well, in Texas it had gotten so hot that we couldn't live in this little thirty-five, this little, what, maybe sixteen foot trailer.  So we traded it in and got a thirty-seven foot trailer.  And then our little car wouldn't pull it, so we had to get a bigger car.  So we had this Buick and this thirty-seven foot trailer, and that's when we drove it back to Baltimore [Maryland] and left it because we were afraid to take it to Alaska.  So we left it parked in Baltimore and took the ship to Alaska.  And it was quite an experience going to Fairbanks [Alaska] during the real early period.  They had just finished the ALCAN Highway [Alaska Highway], and it was quite an experience to live in Fairbanks.
Speaker 1: Could you tell me what, about what year this was?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952] to '54 [1954], '52 [1952], '53 [1953], and '54 [1954].  And the reason we were there for three years was because usually it was two years that you got, had to stay.  But my son [Art Johnson] was in the first grade when we first went into the [U.S.] military.  And we had to keep moving, and when we got to Alaska, he couldn't seem to read.  He couldn't, we couldn't figure out why he couldn't read.  And he got an older third grade teacher who did wonders for him, and all of a sudden he was reading at eleventh grade.  From not being able to read at all, he suddenly could read everything.  And we were so thrilled with his growth there we didn't want to take him out of that school because she was just getting him started.  So we extended for an extra year, and we stayed there for three years.  But also, because we were so confined when we first went up there, my husband [Arthur Johnson] didn't have housing for family, and yet we wanted to go because he had come home for his mother's funeral.  His mother died.  When he came home, we wanted to go back with him.  And he wanted us there, but there was no house.  But we found out that there was an empty Quonset hut (laughter) that was not being used.  It was being used for storage.  And one of his buddies got us into this Quonset hut, so we lived there until we could get base housing.  And we found this old rug outside in the like the little entryway, and we put this rug down.  We made furniture.  We, we made boxes and put mattresses on them.  And anyhow, we, we didn't ship any furniture.  We just made stuff.  And we found out that we had the general's rug that he used to put under the, the base Christmas tree (laughter) that was rolled up in the entry to this Quonset hut.  And this is what we had figured: we have a rug.  So anyway, we lived there until we got into base housing, which was quite nice, but it was really quite an experience--
Story_ID: 277520
Speaker 1: You couldn't go out in the wintertime beyond twenty minutes, and so your life was pretty much confined to the inside.  And a lot of people got cabin fever.  I mean they would really kind of crack up.  And that's when I started painting.  I had just finished Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and had all this art training, and I started doing painting.  I didn't have any paints, didn't have any canvases, but we took scrap wood and covered it with lead, white lead.  Have, had I know the dangers of (laughter) lead--but we coated these boards with white lead paint, and that's what I painted.  Some of the pictures you saw downstairs are the early paintings that I did by wiping off--I found out this what the masters used to do: they would paint like a glaze and then wipe it off and expose the white.  So anyway, that's how I got started.  And I had my first solo show there in the offices, office--what do you call that?  You know.  What do you call that, the main room where the offices ate and something?  Anyway, that's where I had my first show, and then somebody saw it there.  And the biggest hotel there in Fairbanks [Alaska] was the Northern [Lights] Hotel or something like that, and so they asked me to have a show there in the lobby.  So that was my first exposure, was in Alaska, with, with the painting.  So we--
Speaker 2: How--
Speaker 1: --we met Eskimos, and we, it was like a frontier living.  It was quite interesting.  And we, our kids would learn to ice skate on a pond out there, and our life was confined to the base.  And my, my husband [Arthur Johnson] was flight surgeon, so he would fly to Nome [Alaska] and the very, the very remote places.  But we had a, a, a really nice life there in the winter.  And in the summer, you know, it was light all summer, so we were fascinated with the gardens and the big lettuce and stuff that grew up.  And we met, we became friends with a, a survival expert consultant who was from London [England], and the [U.S.] military hired him in, living in, in frozen areas.  So he exposed us to a lot of back country up there, and we went a lot of places that most of the people didn't go, 'cause he knew.  That was interesting.
Speaker 2: Could you tell us, you, you had your first exhibit.  Could you describe your art, your, what your early pieces were about or--
Speaker 1: Well, they were about--
Speaker 2: --and things.
Speaker 1: --Eskimos and life in the, in that frozen land.  And I think most of the paintings that I did at that time were Eskimo paintings.  I sold some of them, and I kept a few, some of them my children's.
Story_ID: 277521
Speaker 1: So you were telling us about the theme of your first paintings in Alaska.
Speaker 2: Well, those paintings were just pictures of people that, you know, I met up there.  And although most of our social life was with the [U.S.] military, we did see Eskimos in the streets and in certain of holiday festivities.  And then we went to the dog races.  We went where they--what do they call that?
Speaker 1: The sled?
Speaker 2: No, it's kind of--ridron--nidron [ph.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Iditarod [Trail Sled Dog Race].
Speaker 2: What do they call it?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Iditarod.
Speaker 2: Iditarod and we went, attended those, where the Eskimos would all come out, and it was interesting.  And so my painting were mostly about them and the costumes they wore.  And I had mukluks.  I still have my mukluks with the, made out of seal skin.  And I just was interested in, in that kind of life at that time.
Speaker 1: You told me about one piece you did in Alaska that you made from a table.
Speaker 2: Well, I made that piece after I got back--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --to San Jose [California].  But it was based on my experience where we--you know, I was fascinated with the totem poles and the history and the--so this piece that I did was made from an old table that we had made up there when we were making (laughter) all our furniture.  And I used parts of it in this totem pole.  And that piece was selected when thirty-five artists were sent to Osaka, Japan, to exhibit as the American exhibit in the world fair [Expo '70] there.  And that piece was the piece that, that went there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was special about this totem?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Was it like an, a, a Native American totem?
Speaker 2: No, it was a black history totem.  And so I took imagery from black history, African history, and infused it with this totem shape.  And they have little African kings at the top, and further down, groups of African people like moving along.  And it's based on our own history.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, after you left Alaska, then you came to San Jose.
Speaker 2: Came to San Jose.
Speaker 1: And could you tell us about your life in San Jose?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing we did was broke the color line (laughter) in where we lived.  And we, we knew that there was gonna be a problem, even though, you know, it turned out to be less of a problem than we thought, but we came from very segregated Baltimore [Maryland].
Story_ID: 277522
Speaker 1: Could you tell us what life was like for African Americans in the [U.S.] military or in Alaska?
Speaker 2: Well, when we first got there we only met white people who were on the base.  But we found out that the chaplain was black, and we became friends with him.  And then we met one or two other couples who we were very friends with, but we were also very friend with our white neighbors.  And it was our first experience in living in an integrated way, because nothing was integrated in Baltimore [Maryland].  And, but we adjusted to it very easily because the people we met were friendly and compatible, so that was interesting.  And when we left there, and--oh, walking down the street in the town of Fairbanks [Alaska] all of a sudden this odor hit my nose, and I said I smell black hair burning (laughter).  There's got to be a black beauty parlor because there's nothing else that smells like hair being straightened.  And I could smell this odor, so we said there are some black people in this town, and we kept on till we found it.  And it was sure enough, this black lady had a beauty parlor there, and we found out that other black people were around who used that beauty parlor.  And we, you know, we had not seen much of that on the base.  And then because my husband [Arthur Johnson] was a surgeon, most of the people he knew were the surgeons and their families and the white people who lived right in, in our complex, so.  But we became very friendly with quite a few people there.  And I still correspond with the lady who lived across the street from me there, and she sends me--she's been out here to visit me since then.  And we became very friendly with this Englishman, who I told you was a survival expert, and when we moved into San Jose [California], they came to visit us.  And this is, of course, not my history, but we found out then that his wife was an alcoholic.  And they came to spend two or three days with us and stayed five weeks, and finally I had to ask them to leave (laughter) because they were, you know, a problem.  But that's be- beside the point.
Story_ID: 277523
Speaker 1: But in coming to San Jose [California], we were not even aware of a town called San Jose.  We were thinking San Francisco [California] was the dream of to get out of Baltimore [Maryland] segregation and move some place like California, because my husband [Arthur Johnson] had come through Sanas- San Francisco on his way to Alaska.  So coming back, we had two dogs and all this luggage and stuff, and we just didn't like the idea of raising kids in San Francisco.  We were disappointed.  It was still a city, and we--it didn't look like California to us.  So we were all packed up ready to go back east.  And we stopped at a park in San Mateo [California].  We took a Sunday drive, and we stopped in this park, and decided this looks more like California to us.  And so we said let's get a, some food and have a little picnic here in the park.  So we went into this grocery story, and this little black boy was in the grocery story.  And I said, "Do you live around here?"  And he said, "Yes, ma'am, I live right around here."  So we said this must be a black neighborhood 'cause we had to find a black place to live so a black doctor could get started.  So we asked this little boy where he lived, and he pointed.  So we drove on to where he lived, and there were three black ladies standing on the corner talking.  And we went up to them, and we said, "Can you tell us where the doctor lives?"  We didn't know there was a doctor, but we figured if this many black people were there, there had to be a doctor.  So they said, "Oh, you mean Dr. [James L.] Hutchinson?"  We said, "Yes."  So she said there, "He lives right over there."  So we went over and knocked on Dr. Hutchinson's door, and Dr. Hutchinson came to the door.  First thing he told us was take our shoes off because he had white carpet all over the place, and we had to take our shoes off.  But he was very friendly, very--till we said, "My husband is a doctor, and he's looking for a place we might settle."  And he said, "Oh, you can't, you'll never make it here.  There's not enough black people here to support another black doctor."  He didn't want us to come in his territory, but he said but, "My wife's family lives in San Jose, and they've got lots of black people down there and no black doctor.  So he said we're getting ready to go down and visit them, if you want to trail us." So we did.  We trailed Dr. Hutchinson to San Jose and met his parents, and his parents were lovely people.  His father had not gone bath- pass the third grade, but they were very successful plumbers in San Jose.  And so they begged us to settle there because they didn't have any black doctor.  So we went and rented a furnished apartment for a month.  I don't know if it was a month or a week, because we're on our way back to Baltimore.  But we said we'll give it a shot, and we lived in this little apartment.
Story_ID: 277524
Speaker 1: So, like the second day that we were there, I was cooking, and I said, "April [Johnson Watkins], go get your brother [Art Johnson].  Dinner is ready."  And she said, "He's, he's playing over in the playground."  So I went over to the playground in my blue jeans and tennis shoes, finding my son.  Well, the playground was not on a school but was on the San Jose Unified School District administration building.  They were using an old school.  So I remembered that I had been trying to get some information about a credential, since I knew we were gonna move this way, how I could get a California credential.  So I said "Maybe somebody in here can answer the question."  So I went to the door and asked this girl at the desk if she could give me some information about how to go about getting a credential.  And she said, "Well, did you send to Sacramento [California]?"  I said, "I did, but I haven't gotten a reply."  So then she called the man who was her boss, who turned out to be the assistant superintendent.  And he said, "Where are you coming from?"  I said, "Baltimore, Maryland."  He said, "Did you teach in Baltimore?"  I said, "Ten years I taught in Baltimore."  So he said, "Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the Baltimore method."  Well, I didn't know what the Baltimore method was, but I said, "Oh yes." (Laughter)  But I knew enough about teaching that I knew I could teach.  So he said, he asked me a few questions, and he said, "Could you be back here in about forty-five minutes?"  So I said, "Yes."  He said, "Well, I have some people I would like for you to meet." So I went home and got dressed and came back in forty-five minutes.  He had nine school board members there he had contacted to meet me, and I was hired on the spot that minute (laughter).  And that's how we ended up living in San Jose [California], because I had a job.  And we knew I was gonna have to have a job.  He's gonna start cold.  We didn't know a soul in San Jose, but these Ribbs people.  And the Ribbs family is well-known in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California] now.  And so they persuaded us to come there and live.
Story_ID: 277525
Speaker 1: We knew also that, as I said, coming from Baltimore [Maryland], we weren't gonna just walk into a house [in San Jose, California].  So when we found this house that was for sale, we came with that trailer in the middle of the night and parked that trailer--we bought the house.  We bought the house before we went back to Baltimore.  And the lady who sold it to us was from Ireland, and she was not prejudiced.  And she told us that we might have some trouble, but she was gonna sell this house to us.  So she sold, we completed the sale of this house before we went back to Baltimore.  Then we came to Baltimore, brought this trailer (laughter), this big trailer back with us.  And we had a fellow, one of his patient, my husband's [Arthur Johnson] patients who wanted to help.  He wanted to come to California, so he helped drive, and we drove across country in this trailer.  And at least three times on route the little dolly wheel broke down because my husband had packed the trailer with all his medical (laughter) equipment, furniture and everything.  So we were using it for moving, and he kept breaking the tires, flatting the tires.  So anyhow, it took us nine days to cross country, and we got here.  And when we did, we found out that the neighborhood did not know when, what we were.  We were light-skinned black people, but they knew we weren't white.  And so the lady next door kept asking me, "Where did you say you were from?  Where did you come from?"  I said, "Baltimore, Maryland."  So finally she asked me.  I said, "Listen, if you just want to know, we're Negros.  And we have moved here.  We have bought this house, and we are going to stay here."  And we found out she had circulated a petition to keep black people and Mexicans out of their block.  Well, it turned out that she became our closest friends.  She believed God sent us there to teach her how to love people, but it helped that we had a swimming pool (laughter), and, and we let her swim in our pool.  And when her friends from Oklahoma came, they couldn't believe that, that she swam in these black people's pool.  But my husband had saved her husband's life because he almost died one night.  He had an ulcer to erupt or whatever they do.  And she called us, and we both got up and went over to her house.  And he got her in the hospital, and I went over and helped her clean up her dirty house.  And from that time, we were friends, and she believed that, that God had sent us there to teach her a lesson.  But we found out that there were quite a few people in that block who did not want us there.  But, you know, people get used, they, we ended up being friendly.  We had Japanese neighbors and one other black family that lived there.  And we, you know, we finally got accepted.  But that's how we got in there.
Story_ID: 277526
Speaker 1: Did you, you found life very much different for black people in San Jose [California] than back in Baltimore [Maryland]?  Was--
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.  But we also found out that the black people we met--'cause there were very few that was not all these many black people that Dr. [James L.] Hutchinson had told us there were, just about one percent blacks.  And the few blacks who were there had been agricultural people, and there were not that many educated black people there.  So, you know, we became kind of like leaders and you know, developed good relationships.  And it turned out that my husband [Arthur Johnson] had not needed to worry at all about black patients, because he ended up with more patients who were not black than who were, and especially a lot of Spanish-speaking Mexican people lived around there. And, and nobody seemed to care whether he was black or white, and so that was an, a revelation (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to, when we come back, can we talk a little bit more about how your art developed in San Jose?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I--
Speaker 1: Would you continue with it?
Speaker 2: --soon as I came to San Jose, and I had started painting in Alaska, I wanted to get into, to more art, so I took a watercolor class in adult education, and I met, the teacher was a teacher at San Jose State [College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California].  And he was a wonderful watercolorist.  And he liked what he saw me trying to do.  And so I decided to take some courses at San Jose State and I took some classes from him.  And then after I had taken maybe four or five classes, my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] said to me, "Why are you taking all these classes?  Why don't you go on and get the master's [degree]?  Because you're just wasting your time."  My mother knew what she was talking about.  So I decided I would enroll in the master's program, and I did.  And this was about in 1968 or '69 [1969].

Speaker 1: --Dr. [James L.] Hutchinson, and he told you to go to San Jose [California].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And when you were here and when you got to San Jose you met the Ribbs.  Could you tell us something about that family?
Speaker 2: Well, the family has become well-known in, well, evidently were well-known in the area when I got there.  And they had two daughters that I met.  One was Evelyn [Ribbs Hutchinson], and one was--I think she's--she's become a funeral director now.  Can't think of her name, but they were both seamstresses, and, but we were most friendly with the mother and father.  And they were just very warm people and encouraged us to come to San Jose.  Since that time, we--both their sons were plumbers, and one was Felix [Ribbs], and the other was Willy's father, Billy, I guess.  I can't think of what his name, wasn't Billy [Henry Ribbs].  But anyway, the two sons were--and so the three of them were a plumbing company that did most of the plumbing in that area.  And then the father became older, and he moved away, and then the two brother were in business together.  Then I don't know, something happened.  They split up and so they were each had their own plumbing company.  And [William T.] Bunny [Ribbs] was the other brother.  That's, I was trying to figure his name.  Bunny had a son, [HistoryMaker] Willy [T. Ribbs], and Willy was about my daughter's [April Johnson Watkins] age, so he was kind of friendly with them.  And the sister, Evelyn, was married to Hutchinson, and they had a daughter who became a, a pianist and became, oh, went all over doing concert piano.  And the other sister [Alma Ribbs], who had been a teacher, stopped teaching and opened her own funeral home [Lewis and Ribbs Mortuary Garden Chapel, San Francisco, California].  I can't figure her first, name, but she may still be living.  And that's in San Francisco [California].  So none, one of the--Bunny's marriage broke up, and the other, his ex-wife lived there.  But what the old man had done was bought up a whole little plot of land, and started a street that went up in there, and built houses for each of these sons.  So they had what they called Ribbs Lane that was, you know, their little conclave (laughter) right, right there.  Their enclave is the word I'm thinking of.  Anyway, Willy wasn't into racing.  He was just a little tiny boy then.  And it wasn't until after we had left that he became famous.  So that's all I can tell you about the Ribbs family.
Story_ID: 277184
Speaker 1: So you were in San Jose [California], and your husband's [Arthur Johnson] gotten his practice established, and you're teaching school.  And after a while you dec- you were taking art classes.  And your mother [Marie Mack Edwards] came to visit, and she's told you--
Speaker 2: Well, my mother came to visit only when she called us that she didn't want to live in Baltimore [Maryland] and alone anymore and would we come and get her.  So my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] and I went back and got her house sold, and her stuff packed, and in two weeks we had her in Baltimore, but she had a very hard time adjusting at first.  She missed her church; she missed all her friends, and we really had a little trouble getting her adjusted, which she did finally.  We found a house for her, and she lived near me.  And it was during that time that I started taking these classes [at San Jose State College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California], and she advised me to go on and get the master's [degree], which I did.  And just about that time, the San, Santa Clara School District [Santa Clara Unified School District] was advertising for an art specialist.  And that was what I had just been appointed before I left Baltimore, so I went and applied, and I got it.  I always got jobs (laughter) I wanted when I wanted them.  And so it was a part-time job that was just perfect for me.  I went from school to school, and would advise teachers, and actually teach art for them when they wanted to get out of their classroom.  And I met another friend who, white, who was doing the same thing, and we really got to be very close friends.  So, we were doing this art specialist thing.  And then we saw a little ad that said Stanford [University, Stanford, California] was offering an experienced teacher fellowship.  And you could go to Stanford for a year free and guarantee you a master's degree when you finish.  Well, I had almost finished my master's work, but that appealed to me, to go to Stanford and study whatever we wanted.  And that's when I did that little mask up there.  I took a sculpture class the same time I was taking these education courses.
Story_ID: 277185
Speaker 1: Well, I had by this time become quite politically involved in San Jose [California] because there were a lot of opportunities for blacks to grow, and, and they were not progressing.  So we organized the few more progressive blacks who had moved into the area, organized an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] there, and I became the president (laughter) of the NAACP.  And we had a fantastic chapter, and we won the national award for the chapter that had grown the most.  And so I was really involved in a lot of things at that time.
Speaker 2: What were some of the things that the end of--that you did, your--
Speaker 1: Oh, we wanted to get more teachers in the schools 'cause my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] and I were the only two at first.  And I told you my sister came to visit me from Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  And they were ready to leave Baton Rouge because the president there [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was a handkerchief head, and (laughter) he was advising the state that they didn't need to do any more for the college and for the black teachers, and they, we weren't getting raises.  And they bought up all the land around there, and they bought up the property, and the teachers only could get a house if they bought it from the president.  And they had a horrible thing going there.  So when my sister came to visit me in San Jose and I told her how I had just walked in and gotten a job, I took her over to the administration building, and just like that she was hired, and she was an excellent teacher.  So we were the only two for a while.  And so we were trying to get more blacks in the schools.  We were getting--wanting more curriculum for blacks in the schools, plus all of these industries were opening up around there, and we wanted blacks to be hired.  So, I was going to meetings at seven in the morning and meeting with the corporate presidents to hire more blacks, and we picketed.  The Woolworth's stores [F. W. Woolworth Company] were segregating the, the lunch counters and all of that in San Jose.  San Jose had prejudice that we did not know that was going to hap--so we had a very active and progressive NAACP there.  And so that was how I happened to be involved with that.
Story_ID: 277186
Speaker 1: When this fellowship came along, I took the fellowship.  Well, the, this is really (laughter) interesting because somehow or other, Stanford [University, Stanford, California] had gotten a big grant, and they were to bring in professors and speakers.  And our class of special teachers were given the job of planning this special invitation to teachers.  And the class had to vote on someone to take charge of this.  Well, they voted for me to get these speakers.  And so I got three teachers lined up that I was going to invite, and one of them was [HistoryMaker Dr.] Price Cobbs, who had just written 'Black Rage.'  And the other was this little lady, grassroots lady, who lived in East Palo Alto [California], and she was trying to get East Palo Alto improved.  I can't think of her name now, but she was gon' be one of my speakers.  And the third was gonna be Nettie Goddard, who was the third teacher who came into San Jose [California] after my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] and I.  And she was very literate and was teaching in San Jose.  And I just thought this would be a nice balance of people.  Well, they hit the ceiling, and, and the, they thought that these people were gonna incite a riot if they came to Stanford, and they didn't want them to come.  And then I found out that the people who were running this program had never taught in a public school and had no idea what was going on right across the freeway in East San--East Palo Alto.  And so the school newspaper got a hold of it, and it was a big spread in the paper and all.  And just about that time, San Jose [State University, San Jose, California] offered me a teaching job (laughter).  And I had just gotten my master's [degree], and the only reason to stay in this program was to get a master's that would give you an, a college teaching opport- and all of a sudden I had the master's and the job.  So I gave them their money back and didn't finish the fellowship out and went back to San Jose, and started teaching there.
Story_ID: 277187
Speaker 1: And I split my teaching time up between the art department and the black studies department.  And so at, I found out the art department had no, not a single slide of a black art, artist, no curriculum about black art at all.  So I started one and built up a collection. They, they were able to, to do it, and so they have a really fine collection of slides there.  And then I got money to bring in some speakers.  So Betye Saar was one of the speakers.  Charles [Wilbert] White, I don't know if you're familiar with Charles White.  He was one of the speakers.  And I have a wonderful vide- audiotape of a conversation of him in my classroom.  One of my students taped him.  Also, Barry Gaither [HistoryMaker Edmund B. Gaither] from Massachusetts came, and he spoke to my students.  And I guess it must have been five or six artists that we brought in.  And of course, the class just grew.  It was a huge, supposed to be a little, you know, just an art history lecture class, but it grew and grew.  And one of the things that they had to do in order to finish that class was to interview some black artist and come back and report it to the class.  And they had to learn, 'cause one of the things they learned was about the men, the man who wrote 'The Star Spangled Banner' [Francis Scott Key].  And I'm trying to think of these two brothers. Now I can't remember who were the two artist brothers [James Weldon Johnson and John Rosamond Johnson] who lived back during the Harlem Renaissance period.  Anyhow, these kids had to learn the black national anthem ['Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing'] (laughter) in order to finish, because part of it was in, in the Harlem Renaissance period and everything.  And one of my students stuttered terribly, but I said "I can't teach you 'The Star Spangled Banner' music because I can't sing.  I can teach you these words, but I don't know the, I can't sing the music for you."  And he came up to me and told me he could teach them the music, and he stuttered.  He could hardly speak.  But when he sang, he didn't stutter.  And he taught that class so, it was the talk of the art department, to hear (laughter) 'The Star Spangled Banner' coming out of this art room.  That was really interesting. Also, it was during this time that I actually--I'm trying to think now how all this happened.  [HistoryMaker] Harry Edwards, who later became the head of the [Oakland Department of] Parks and Recreation, was the head of, he was the head of the black student group at San Jose State [University, San Jose, California] when I was there.  And I needed a committee for my final master's [degree] thing, and I asked Harry to be on my committee.  So he came in with these white professors to review my final project.  And of course, he liked it 'cause it was all, it was the first black show (laughter) that had been presented there.  So, I had quite a time there (laughter).
Story_ID: 277188
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You, you said you were also in the black studies department at San Jose State [University, San Jose, California].
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Could you tell us something about it?  Who were--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --some of the people who were involved in--
Speaker 1: Well, there were several black teachers, and I can't, my memory for these names is bad.  But one of them was Robert [L.] Allen, who actually put out the--what was the newspaper?  He published the Black Scholar.
Speaker 2: Black Scholar, Black Scholar.
Speaker 1: Black Scholar.  And he also eventually became Alice Walker's live-in partner.  He was one of the instructors.  And I can't remember the name of the woman who was in charge of it (unclear) and then, oh, Leonard Jeffries was the head.  And he had been active in the Operation Crossroads [Africa] that went to Africa.  And so he organized a trip for twenty-five students to go to Africa.  And so my husband [Arthur Johnson] and I went.  He examined all the--gave 'em all them shots (laughter).  And we went along as not part of the faculty, but as adults along--and Cecil Williams.  That's how I got to meet Cecil's, know Cecil well.  But he and his wife were on that trip.
Story_ID: 277189
Speaker 1: But in the meantime, the big thing that happened during that period was the Selma [to Montgomery March].  And I had been the president of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And we had been marching and protesting and so forth, and I decided that I should go to Selma [Alabama], so I went.  My husband [Arthur Johnson] said, "I'm not promising anybody I'm gonna be nonviolent.  I'm not going, and I don't want you to go."  I said, "Well, I feel like I have to go," so I went.  And as soon as I got there, I got arrested (laughter).  The, the one of those articles down on that board tells you that I got arrested.  And--
Speaker 2: For what?
Speaker 1: Well, the first night, that cease--that's how I meet Cecil [Williams].  He was on the plane.  And there was another black woman on the plane who was, I didn't know.  But the two of us met Cecil, and he said, "What are you guys going down there for?"  And we both had our reasons.  So he, when we got there, he knew some of the people.  I think Cecil had been there before.  Anyway, this little old man, Benton [ph.], took us to a motel right outside of Selma where he said it would be safe for us to live.  So we spent that first night there, and we were supposed to get up the next morning and go to Browns Chapel [sic. Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama].  Well, we were on a different time thing, and I, when I woke up, Cecil and this other lady had gone.  They didn't even wake me up.  So here I am out in this motel (laughter).  I don't know from nothing about where Browns Chapel is or anything, so I said I'd better go to a phone and see if I can phone.  Well, I got nothing but a busy signal because evidently they had, everybody was calling Browns Chapel.  And I looked out of the phone booth, and here I see this car coming down right up beside the phone booth with these guys sitting there with rifles sticking out of the window.  I am scared to death.  But just at that time, I looked at one of the other motel rooms, and some people were coming out, black people.  And I ran down there and asked them if they were going Browns Chapel, could I go with them, and they said yes.  So, it turned out that they were some of the leaders of the march. One big guy called Big Orange, he was one of, one of the group leaders. So they drove me down to the chapel.  And soon as we got down there, they were all singing, and they were planning that the, that day, each day they had something different.  That way they were gonna walk down to the mayor's office because an ordinance had just been created that they could not walk down those streets.  And of course, that's what they were gonna do.  So, I'm walking with this little thirteen year old girl.  She, we paired up, and we're walking down the street.  And we come right up to this woman who's got a gun in each hand and tells her to get off of her sidewalk.  And this little girl took my arm, and we just went off the curb and walked down the street.  And when we got down there, there was a school bus there arresting everybody who was walking (laughter).  So they had a whole school bus full of people, including this little girl and me.  And so they took us to the police department.  So we had registered there.  We had to register, and then we had to stand outside of the--'cause it wasn't room; it was a lot of people.  So we're standing out there for hours.  The police are all standing guard.  And finally they, they didn't know what to do with us, it was so many of us.  So finally they decided that we would be jailed in the community center.
Story_ID: 277190
Speaker 1: So they put us all in the community center, and we (laughter) had to spend the night there [in Selma, Alabama].  And we didn't have, you know, nobody knew what was gonna happen.  And so we, I slept on the stage (unclear) where they used to do--and this other lady, this white lady, who we struck up a little friendship, it turned out she was Viola Liuzzo, one of the women who was killed with the Chaney brothers [sic. James Earl Chaney].  You remember?  Anyway, we spent the night on that stage, and that was quite an experience because the people who were there, this whole group, well, they just, we had like a rally, you know.  And there were priests there; there were all kinds of people there. And people--the, these San, San Francisco [California]--what's a group that used to put on improvisations?  Maybe you don't remember that.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: They were, they were a famous group of improv performers.  Mark Saulwood [ph.] was there.  The, a lot of entertainers were there.  So they just kind of kept the program going and kept everybody up.  And somebody in the, in the town who was a sympathizer but didn't wanna come out sent food over, sent a whole thing of food over for us to have something to eat that night.  And then, the middle of the next day they let us all go back.  And I was staying.  I wasn't going back to that motel, but they put me in this old man's house with some old man who lived right on the [Edmund Pettus] Bridge [Selma, Alabama] where they had all been knocked down.  And I can, I can hear him right now.  He said, "I, I seen it with my own eyes.  I was sittin' right here.  I seen it with my own eyes when they shot these people down."  This was before we had gotten there.  But anyway, we, we stayed there.  In the meantime, I had to call home and tell them what had happened, that I had spent the night in jail.  And that's when my husband [Arthur Johnson] decided he couldn't stay in San Jose [California] so he came down.  And it was--oh, then once he got there, he just caught on to what everybody was doing.  And they were happy to see him, to have a doctor to come in.  And I was working in the kitchen with the ladies, cooking food and chicken and so forth.  But he was working, you know, as a first aid doctor.  And he actually, the, the thing he was proudest of was that he treated Martin's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] feet because his feet had gotten blistered, you know, from the walking, and he treated them.
Story_ID: 277191
Speaker 1: But, so then came time for the walk, the Selma walk [Selma to Montgomery March].  And everybody couldn't do it because they said there would be too many people.  So they just let some of us go five miles, and then the rest of them could go all the way.  So I was in the group that could go five miles, and I did that walk--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --five miles.  But then--are you waiting?
Speaker 2: You can finish up--
Speaker 1: Okay.  What I did find out was that they really were running out of food.  And when I called San Jose [California] and told my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] that they were running out of food, she organized a food drive before I got back.  And she and my daughter [April Johnson Watkins] and some of my friends collected food, and the collected so much food that she couldn't get it in her garage.  They had to put it in a fire station.  And they, the whole town of San Jose turned out for this food drive.  And the mayor of San Jose at that time had a trucking company, because it was who's gonna, how are they gonna get the food down there?  And he gave a truck.  He lent one of his trucks and drivers to pick up the food from the fire station and take it to Selma [Alabama].  So that was another big event, this big truckload of food goes down there to Selma.  In the meantime, I had made friends with several of these ladies who were all very poor because the stores, you know, they were boycotting all the, the stores.  And they didn't have any food, and they didn't have any jobs, so I organized an, a, adopt a family.  So there were sixty families in San Jose that sent food and clothing regularly for about a year--
Story_ID: 277192
Speaker 1: Trip to Africa.
Speaker 2: Your trip to Africa, okay.
Speaker 1: Well, just, you know, that it was memorable.  I never would--we went to Ghana.  Oh yeah, what we did there, we went to a little church, and Cecil [Williams] spoke at this church.  And we were so impressed with the singing and the dancing, which was so similar to what black people were doing here [San Jose, California].  And we went to this little program at the, like a community center, and I struck up this friendship with this man who worked with the, the kids' music.  And he invited us to come to his village, which was in Kumasi [Ghana], near, near where we were in Ghana.  And so, the whole group wanted to go, so Cecil and all of us went to his little village and went to his church.  And Cecil spoke, and then he invited me and my husband [Arthur Johnson] to come to his house, which, which was a hut, and we went.  And that was really, and it was, the whole hut was about the size of half of this room.  And his sister somewhere outside was fixing the food, and she brought in each of these dishes while we sat around his little spot, and most wonderful food.  We never saw her.  She would just bring the food, and, and we would eat the food.  But his bed was right in the same room.  And hanging all around his bed were these beautiful fabrics.  And I found out that he did batik dyeing and he taught batik classes.  So, I just loved these beautiful pieces of fabric because most of what we saw were actually from Germany.  They weren't African fabrics.  They were German made, but his were hand-screened and, I mean batik.  And I had mine.  When we got ready to leave, he took the curtains down, folded them up, and gave me the, the fabrics.
Speaker 2: Oh, my.
Speaker 1: So that was, you know, a highlight for me because when I came home, my daughter [April Johnson Watkins] made me this beautiful dresses and things out of this fabric.  So, you know, that--oh, then I met this little lady in the marketplace, and I was fascinated with the different things I saw in the market.  And I struck up friendship with her, and she gave me a tour all around the marketplace, and she taught me what groundnut was and that it was just peanut butter that they sold in big tubs and things.  Well, anyway, we, we became so friendly that we corresponded for like a year after that.  And she sent me cowrie shells (laughter).  I still use 'em in my artwork.  I don't see any in here, but some of my little assemblages.  And in exchange, her daughter was pregnant, and I sent her little baby clothes from Sears Roebuck [and Co.] (laughter).  So we kept that going, and then af- suddenly, I, I, didn't hear any more from her.  And I have a feeling she might have died.  Oh, some of those cowrie shells are in that little piece behind you.  And then she sent me a gold necklace and bracelet with--and we used to really exchange letters, and oh, she could write.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: --that was, that was the best thing for me in Ghana.
Story_ID: 277193
Speaker 1: So and you came back to the [United] States and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so how, and what did you do?  Did, you were, you started getting more and more involved with your artwork?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was always involved with my artwork.  But also, I was having marital problems--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and so.  I won't go into all of that, but I left, and that was in '73 [1973].  And in during that time, we [HistoryMaker Marie Johnson-Calloway and her husband, Arthur Johnson] had talked about moving to San Francisco [California] and had bought an old house in San Francisco, which we were renting out with the idea that if we moved, we would live there.  But we didn't ever do that together, but I had that house.  So when I left, I went to that house.  And I was teaching part time still.  I was teaching in San Jose [California] 'cause I didn't give up my job.  But I was teaching part time at [California College of] Arts and Crafts [California College of the Arts, Oakland, California].  That's when I met--well, I didn't meet John [ph.], but that's where I was teaching.  They asked me to come and teach African American art because there was no one there teaching it, just like San Jose [State University, San Jose, California] didn't.  And they knew about my teaching at there.  So I, I would come there, and then I was trying to get on at San Francisco State [University, San Francisco, California] but I hadn't quite gotten it.  I had subbed there.  And so I was leaving San Jose coming to Arts and Crafts, going over to San Francisco and teaching one class, and then coming back to San Jose; so I was circling.  But just about that time, San Francisco decided to hire me.  So I could give up the San Jose one, and I got my time credited there.  So then I taught there from '73 [1973] to '83 [1983].
Story_ID: 277194
Speaker 1: In the meantime, I was doing continuous shows.  You have my resume with all the art shows and so forth.  And it was also during that time that I had the show with Betye [Saar] at, at the San Francisco Museum [of Modern Art, San Francisco, California] and most of the other museums around, in this area.  But you know, I never really got well-known on the East Coast.  There were eleven of us who had a show together at the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] during that time.  That was way back.  And then, you know, things just gradually kept building.  And I had the show here [Oakland, California].  And oh, Betye put a show together in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] called 'Spaces,' [sic. 'Black Mirror' in Womanspace Gallery, Woman's Building, Los Angeles, California] and she invited me to be one of the artists, so I did a show there.  And from that, oh, I can't remember the order, but there's a lot of art shows that went on in between there.  But the thing you would be most interested in is the Women's Caucus for the Arts [sic. Women's Caucus for Art] is a national organization of women artists who have been confronted with gender problems.  And I had not been active in that group.  I hadn't been too familiar with it, but they had a branch here, and they invited me to be on their board.  And then they gave me a lifetime award for what I had done in this area. Well, then in 2001, the national group gave me a lifetime award in Chicago [Illinois].  That's when I came to Chicago, and incidentally, somewhere back there--do you remember a magazine called Black World that came out from the Ebony publishers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, this guy, can't remember his name.
Speaker 2: Got it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They purchased this piece, which is there (laughter) in the Ebony building.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold that towards you just a little bit.  Yeah, good, okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, they did.
Speaker 2: That's when the, when, when Johnson Publishers [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] opened that new building.  They wanted an art collection, and they collected art from all around.  And I had shown this piece in L.A., and they purchased it.  So it's there in somebody's office.  And this guy, Hoyt Fuller, was the editor of this magazine.  He, he put it on the cover.  This, this is old, 1972, but I keep the magazine.
Story_ID: 277195
Speaker 1: I think we've gotten back to San Jose [California], and you were talking about all of your exhibits.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I'd like for you, if you could take some time to describe your work and how, how you became interested in doing assemblages and--
Speaker 2: Okay, that, that is interesting.  We had decided that we were gonna put a swimming pool in.  This was in my house in San Jose.  And the fence on there was just the usual three or four feet high.  But in order to have a pool, you had to have at least six feet.  So we had to tear all the fence down.  And I have never been willing to throw anything away (laughter).  So I didn't want to throw any of this good wood away, so we piled it in, in the little storeroom, you know, around the pool.  And we were going on a lot of trips at that time and going to Mexico.  We liked going to Mexico, and I was impressed with the little standing screens that I saw down there.  And I was also trying to figure something to put in front of our fireplace 'cause I never have liked the look of fireplaces when there's no fire in them.  So I thought I wanna fix some kind of little screen to go in front of the fireplace, and I'll use up some of this wood.  So I took this wood and started putting it together.  I'm not a carpenter, but I figured out how to do that.  And then I thought, well, maybe I should put some people on 'em.  And so I started drawing people.  And the pieces were only four feet or short lengths.  So I started putting heads on (laughter) on them.  You know, the ideas just come to you.  And then my daughter [April Johnson Watkins] came in there, and I was busy trying to paint the clothes on these figures.  This was the piece that ended up.  And she said, "Well, why you gon' draw those?  You got all this fabric around here.  Why don't you just put some fabric on 'em?"  And so that's when I decided well, I will; I'll put some fabric on.  That started the three-dimensional pieces.  And then I think the next piece was that piece I showed you called 'Dream Deferred.'  Those are actual pieces of that fence that I put together.  And then I put this little boy in it, and one grew into the other.  And I did Papa [Sidney Joseph Edwards] and Ms. Jackson during that time and a couple of others that I've sold.

Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Madeline [Murphy] Rabb, who I told you is the art--was the art director for the City of Chicago, [Illinois] was a friend.  Her father [HistoryMaker William H. Murphy, Sr.] was in school with me.  And we've become friends since then and through our art, you know.  And so Madeline purchased one of these pieces and has it in, in her house. But that was a kind of important show. When the new museum [California African Art Museum] opened in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], they opened it with an exhibit of artists who did a piece especially for that pea- place.  And I did 'The Church Mothers,' and it became their first purchase, so that's a permanent collection there.  And then the [J. Paul] Getty Museum [Los Angeles, California] used that piece in a poster they did of a multicultural art and displayed it around in the different schools.  And they also advertised it in American magazine, so schools all over the country could buy that.  And I don't have a, one of my--when I went to the Getty Museum a couple of years ago I tried to find them and see if I could buy some more, but nobody in the bookstore knew anything about it.  But that's been, you know, several years now.  And I need to connect with the education department.  They're the ones who did it, and they may still have some, but I don't have one.
Story_ID: 277197
Speaker 1: Could you tell us some of your scenes that you're in, that--
Speaker 2: Well, they mostly revolve around family.  In that storeroom down there I have a lot of other pieces.  But they're things that are memories of my childhood in Baltimore [Maryland] and of people in East Oakland [California], in this very neighborhood.  The piece, I don't know if you noticed the woman holding the school sign, she's actually was the school guard down the bottom of this hill.  And eventually these pieces all became part of an exhibit I had at the Oakland Museum [of California, Oakland, California] called "Hope Street."  And what we did was hung the pieces so that you felt as though you were walking down the street, and each of these different sections are parts of the street.  So the musician is one, and then instead of my father [Sidney Joseph Edwards] and Ms. Jackson being just separate, I put them in a church.  And it was like a storefront church, which took me back to my father's storefront.  And, and then I did a piece called 'Stepping Out' because, you know, the ladies dress up so to go to church.  And I took one of my best dresses and dressed this lady up with the big hat.  And one of the ladies who came here to cook one day for a party I was having fell in love with that piece, so she bought it (laughter), and I don't have it more.  It's called 'Stepping Out.'  And then on, on MacArthur [Boulevard] near 98th Avenue there used to be a place called the Food Box Club [ph.].  I don't know if you remember it.  But this man who called himself Elder somebody ran, he must have had a little church, and they ran this store where they, people could buy produce and things.  And so, it was such an interesting storefront, I did one of the pieces.  So what happened behind these figures was I started painting backdrops for them.  So I have all these huge rolled up papers on heavy painting paper, which formed the backdrop for all of these little montages as you walked down the street.  And it, it, it got a lot of publicity.  Pe- people wrote about it, and it was the first show that had gone to the Oakland Museum that had any black subject matter of note in it.  And so, all the black people were just glad to see something in that museum they could relate to. And I can go in there right now and the security people all just remembered when that show came to, to the Oakland Museum. What was interesting about that was, at the time the director of the Oakland Museum for a brief period was black.  His name was Yule, Julian Yule [ph.], with, from, from New York.  And he just insisted that that show was gonna come to the Oakland Museum.  But the chief curator there was a white woman, southern.  And even though she had to schedule the show, she did nothing to make it work.  That is a very strange situation to be in.  And the staff and the crew were all supportive.  I mean they just worked.  We put that show up, and they worked hours.  Everybody seemed to really want it to work.  But she would not schedule an opening.  She would no schedule a reception.  So the black ethnic guild [Cultural and Ethnic Affairs Guild of the Oakland Museum Association] heard about it.  And I belong to a little social club called Smarts [National Smart Set].  And I don't know if you're familiar with them.  Anyway, they heard about it, so they donated some money.  And this ethnic guild put on my opening, and it was a bang up (laughter) success.  So I have articles that maybe you guys will want to look through some of the articles that talk about it.  It was well-received.  So, that's how 'Hope Street' kind of grew from one little old broken down fence into a whole body of work.
Story_ID: 277198
Speaker 1: But then, I moved up here [Oakland, California] or I had moved up here, and here I was surrounded with all of this beautiful outdoors, and I've always loved outdoors.  And when I first started going to San Jose [State College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California], you know, taking my art [classes], abstraction expressionism was the leading trend in art.  And I was trying to do what my professors were doing, so I started out doing abstract painting, and I liked it.  It found, felt very good.  But then when I went to Selma [Alabama] and when I came back, it just didn't fit.  I needed to do things about my own people.  And they, they didn't see anything in the abstractions with which they could relate.  And they didn't understand that they had meaning, just as much meaning for me as those pieces.  But I wanted to do people I knew, and that's when I started doing my father [Sidney Joseph Edwards], my grandmother, my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] at her sewing machine.  'The Girl at the Vanity' ['Vanity'] is in memory of how my sister [Anita Edwards Posey] and I would make our own dresses.  And Betye Saar came to visit me at the time I was working on that.  I was living in, in my apartment in San Francisco [California], but I had a basement where I did my artwork.  And I was living on the third floor of the building.  So I would cut these people out down in the basement, and then carry these bodies up to where I was living and work on 'em.  And Betye came to visit me when I had just found this thrift store vanity that looked just like the vanity in my mother's bedroom.  And I think for something like eight dollars I could buy this vanity.  So I bought it and had it in my bedroom, in my apartment there.  So when I started doing this girl with--I brought her up, and she fit right in front of that vanity.  And you could see her face in the, the mirror.  And I couldn't find just the right dress.  So when Betye got home, she had the right dress.  She mailed me (laughter), she mailed me that dress for that girl I've told her always, so she's in that piece because she sent me not only that, but some of--she and I both go to thrift stores all the time.  And she had found some pictures of some old black people, and I put those on the vanity.  And I went to a flea market over in Marin [County, California], and I found all these little things that somebody had had on their vanity.  And when I looked on the box of powder, it said Queen Marie.  I said this is waiting for me.  So all of that stuff is on that vanity, and that's the piece that won the Florsheim Award [Richard Florsheim Art Fund Award] and that is now in the Triton Museum [of Art, Santa Clara, California].  So they each have a history.
Story_ID: 277199
Speaker 1: When you do a large assemblage, it must, you can't do it alone.  And I know you've worked with your daughter [April Johnson Watkins] and your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I've done all of those alone.
Speaker 1: Oh, have you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the only things I've worked with my daughter on, when we got commissions to do big pieces like the mural ['Passages'] that's in the [Oakland] Convention Center [Oakland, California].  We (laughter), we worked on that as a team.  I did the people, and she did all the background painting.  And our, her daughter, who, who was I guess--I don't know how old Heather [Watkins] was then, but she might have been twenty.  But she was going to be our gofer person who just did the errands.  But we found out that she was so talented that she became one of the painters.  So what we did it in arches.  We did it for this area in the convention center where the halls all have like an arch around so that theme should be in the pic- piece.  So we did it on four-foot panels, four by eight foot panels, and each one is like an arch.  And then a different culture is coming out of each of the arches.  And so we have an African one; we have a European one; we have an Asian one.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so that's how we collaborated.  But other than on those, I did do all the cutting, and the dressing, and the hauling, which is why I'm not doing so many anymore, because I, I can't, I don't have the physical strength.  But we did that piece for the convention center, and then we also did a piece for the West Oakland Senior Center [Oakland, California], where we worked with the architect and helped to design things for the building.  And we, we have a mural in the dining room there.  And then I did the posts.  They have big columns around it, and I designed the mosaic ceramic pieces for those.  And we all painted the mural in the dining area.  And April helped design the floor.  And it was really a big experience to work with the architects.  That was very pleasant.  And so, we've collaborated on two or three of those things.
Story_ID: 277200
Speaker 1: A little while ago you were describing some of your art.  Would you like to tell us about another phase of your art, scrap?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that your art is always closely related to your life.  And for a long time there, I was very anxious for my identity to be involved in my art so that people, my people, people in my world would have some relationship with what I was doing.  But then I realized that a big part of me was not being expressed, and that I have always been a great lover of nature, of jazz music, of poetry, and these things which are not quite as identifiable as the art I was doing, and that I was somehow leaving a big part of myself out.  And so now I do abstractions, and they are a big part of what I do, and I feel so much freer because I don't have to plan it as much as I did the three-dimensional pieces.  With those, I have an idea.  I do a sketch.  I blow it up and do a big pattern, then I have to, you cut it out of wood, and everything is methodically done.  Whereas when I do an abstraction, I just start with a color I want to work with it.  I just let it take me and so much freer.  And I think it's just as expressive really of who I am as a person.  And so people come in here and they think four or five artists live in this house because they're so many different kinds of things, like this piece here looks just like early morning.  When you come out here and you look at, at four or five o'clock in the morning, the sky is all those colors.  And I just was leaving that out.  So now I do both.  And I hop back and forth (laughter), depending on what, what I'm trying to--and I don't know if you noticed the last picture that's on my wall that I'm working on right now.  It's kind of a combination of inside and outside.  And I, I did the thing kind of small.  It's almost too small for me to work.  I don't work too well in little detail, but it's a good study.  I'm gonna do a big painting in which this canyon, it can be just beautiful at different times of day.  And so I have painted that canyon, and then I painted inside the, the deck, and then inside the house, and then inside the woman sitting inside the house.  So, that kind of embodies all of what I'm doing.  But I think you can talk about all of your inner feelings and your outer feelings in abstraction in a much more expressive way than some of the more representational things.  So I like to do both.  But I didn't want us to get through without talking about that part.
Story_ID: 277201
Speaker 1: We want to have a rounded person.  You had such a marvelous life, and you've met so many interesting people.  And before we started you were telling me a story about someone came to your house and used to--
Speaker 2: Dizzy [Gillespie]?
Speaker 1: --come--yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that this was a time when the World Affairs Council--I was very involved, as I told you, civically at that time.  And the World Affairs Council asked us if we knew Dizzy Gillespie, which we did not know.  But Dizzy was playing in the North Beach [San Francisco, California] a lot, the jazz places in San Francisco [California].  And they wanted to invite him to come and speak at the World Affairs Council, but they didn't think he would come because he hadn't responded to any of their invitations.  So they thought maybe if some black people went and asked him, he may be more open.  So we went up to the Black Hawk [San Francisco, California], and we went to see his performance.  And at the intermission he came out, and he was sitting at the bar.  So, my husband [Arthur Johnson] went over and started a conversation with him, and he was very cool and just wasn't responsive at all.  Dizzy can act that way.  He can act dumb, you know, like he doesn't even know what you're talking about, and he was doing that.  And so finally Arthur said, "Listen, man--." Arthur looked Jewish, so he rethought, Dizzy doesn't really know who I am.  So he said, "Listen, Dizzy," he said "from one member to another."  So he said, "What, member what?  What you talking about member?"  He said, "Member of the clan, man, you know, all us Negros have to get together."  And that's when he realized that Arthur was not white.  And--(unclear) immediat- immediately he related to him and agreed that he would come down to give his lecture.  So that became like our salutation to each other.  Whenever we would go to hear Dizzy and in any concert, wherever it was, he would spy us in the audience, and he'd say, "Member (laughter)."  And we knew what he was talking about.  So anyway, when he did come to San Jose [California], they asked if they could have a little party for him at our house, again, thinking he would be more--so he did.  He and the whole band came to the party.  And he went back out into the backyard.  And you had to go through my painting room to get out to the backyard, and he saw this painting there.  And he came back he had this painting under his arm, and he, he was joking of course, and he said that he wanted to take that painting to his wife, Lorraine [Gillespie].  He's very devoted to Lorraine.  And it was because it was an abstraction, but it looked like some nuns.  It was all in brown and beige and white, and his wife is a, is an, a really strict Catholic.  And so he wanted to take this painting to Lorraine, and I let him have it.  I said, "Well, in exchange for your coming here and doing this for us."  So we became friends after that, and every time he would come to San Francisco we would go to see him.  And he would bring the band to our house on their way to the Monterey Jazz Festival [Monterey, California], and then I would cook for, 'em and they would all eat.  A couple of times Dizzy spent the night.  And we just were close friends after that.
Story_ID: 277202
Speaker 1: And we never got to meet Lorraine [Gillespie], but my son did.  He was in New York [New York] once, and this--what, what is this big beer truck that has like a big--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: You know what-
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Budweiser?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, they have, they have a big truck that goes through the city that looks like an old-fashioned--
Speaker 2: Oh, the, the horses, no.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, you, are you talking about the, the London [England], the buses that are--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, the beer--
Speaker 1: The what?
Speaker 2: --the beer truck.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, it was a beer truck?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's advertising a beer.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The only one I can think of would be Budweiser.
Speaker 2: Well, it's Budweiser.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they have a big old-fashioned truck that they take with music playing on it.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Anyhow, they used to, and it went to New York.  Art [Johnson] would, my son was walking down the street when this thing came, and he spied Dizzy [Gillespie] on it.  And they had this big reunion on, on this--it has a name.  It's not like a stagecoach, but it's in that same era.  Anyhow, Dizzy took him home with him to, to his house, so he got to meet Lorraine.  But that's the only time.  We've, we've never met.  But the picture in the other room, Foss [ph.], if you want to go see it, is Dizzy playing his horn in our living room.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I see, all right.
Speaker 2: And my son at that time was like in junior high or high [school].  And he had a little--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So anyway, Dizzy was very close to us.  And then there's a little group of us around.  We called ourselves the Dizzy fan club.  Whenever he would come we would get together, and one of them was a woman whose son owned a boat that he kept in the San Francisco [California] dock there.  And he invited Dizzy to come and go out on the boat, and Dizzy said if we would come too.  So we got to go down to the harbor there in San Francisco and go out on the boat.  And Dizzy was scared on the boat.  He stayed down in the galley the whole time (laughter).  He wouldn't come out.  But we had a, we had a lot of fun with him.  And once when we were in Spain, we, we had some friends we visited in Spain.  And we left and went over to this little town where there was this huge jazz concert going on.  And Dizzy was being featured, and we didn't know when we left home that he was there.  So we all went, this other couple and Arthur [Johnson] and I.  And we went over to--
Story_ID: 277203
Speaker 1: Okay, there's one more artist in your family that we haven't mentioned.  And this is a wonderful story, and I, I'd really like for you to share this wonderful story.
Speaker 2: Well, there are several artists in my family, including the son [Art Johnson] who's on the phone right now.  He does ceramics, beautiful ceramics, and he did the bowl lids on my din- coffee table.  And he did this little lantern down here.  But he is working as a computer person, and he has his own little business where he does retail for small merchants online.  But he, at heart, he's an artist, and he should be doing ceramics.  But my daughter [April Johnson Watkins] finished Cal [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] in, as an art major.  And she has worked with seniors and handicapped people as an art counselor.  And my mother [Marie Mack Edwards], who had never had any art exposure, came to visit me.  And I took her to The San Francisco Gallery [San Francisco, California], which was featuring California funk artists who worked with all kinds of material.  And she was shocked to think that this was art and she started picking up things on her way from church and said, "I can do this too."  So now, we have this whole collection of beautiful little pieces that she has constructed.  And someone from the San Jose Museum [of Art, San Jose, California] saw them and was so impressed they gave her a solo show at the San Jose Museum.  And (laughter) she just, they wrote up an article, and his title was "A Flower in the Concrete," how here in the middle of nowhere she crops up this beautiful little artist.  And she--
Speaker 1: And how old was she?
Speaker 2: Eighty-eight, and she had never done any art.  But as I told you, she had been a beautiful seamstress, had taken the curtains down and made clothes for us.  And she had always been a creative person but never thought of herself as an artist.  But what happened was I was teaching at the time that she had this little show, and I invited her as one of the artists to come and talk to my students.  And they were so impressed with her and how she had used art to overcome her depression from moving to San Jose [California] from Baltimore [Maryland].  She hated it; she didn't like it; she cried; she used to put on tantrums and, until she got to doing this art, and she became an entirely different person.  And so they, and were very inspired by the fact that she had--and she did this up until she died, really.  She was doing a lot of artwork.
Story_ID: 277204
Speaker 1: When you look back on your life, what stands out the most?  Something you'd like to be remembered for.
Speaker 2: Family.  I would say family and art, art as a way of life.  My daughter's [April Johnson Watkins] shop is called the Art of Living [Berkeley, California].  And we just make everything we do art (laughter).  It becomes that way.  And most everything you see in this house is scrounged art because I've gone to thrift stores.  And the little boxes and the little junk around becomes art.  My kids grew up with it, and they all have it.  And my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] and my sister [Anita Edwards Posey], we all--my sister did mosaics after--I did the one at the front door, and she liked that, so she started doing them.  And so the other side is one of hers and along with her writing and her music.  That's what she did.  And her son, who is--she's got, she's dead, and his father's [Leroy Posey] dead, but her son has moved to the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California].  He's a lawyer.  But he brought his children to visit Saturday.  These are his two little girls, and they are just crazy about art.  This little girl did painting from the time they walked in the store.  They'd go right down in the studio, and I put the paints out.  And that's what they do the whole time they're here, and they do beautiful artwork.  And she's only five, and he's three, so it's in the blood.
Story_ID: 277205
Speaker 1: What values do you consider that are important, values that you pass on to your children [Art Johnson and April Johnson Watkins]?
Speaker 2: What, honesty, fortitude.  I think my mother [Marie Mack Edwards] was one of the strongest women I've known.  And they, I think they think I'm strong.  I'm not that strong, but I do feel like, you know, you, you have to go within yourself and find what it takes to do what you need to do and to put up with things.  And I found out there are some problems that you can't fix (laughter), and therefore you have to try to work around them.  And this I'm trying also to get my children to see.  I don't know that they do.  But they had, that's what they get from me and a loyalty to each other.  And, and I think they have that.  There's a close family feeling among us.
Speaker 1: If there's a message or a lesson you could give to your children or to your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren, what would it be for, to, to-students in the future--
Speaker 2: To always have the courage to create, that nothing is beyond your expressing in some way, and find a way to express it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --whatever your medium.
Story_ID: 277206
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the legacy that I have most of is my art.  And I hope that it will maintain a life of its own.  And I, I always try to do artwork which I will be able to look back at years later and not be ashamed that I did it (laughter).  It's always a pleasure to me when I see something I did a long time ago and I find out I can still stand to look at it.
Story_ID: 277207
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Same thing.
Speaker 1: Same (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: No, I think I also would want to be remembered for trying to be genuine.  And it's not always possible.  You know, you find yourself doing things sometime that come across as artificial to you.  But you always have to get back to the core.  And I, I would like to be remembered for always being up front with where I am.
Story_ID: 277208
Speaker 1: What are your hopes or concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that they, our young people, will begin to appreciate themselves more, and to value their history, and to build an inner strength that will take them through many things that the- they're going to encounter.  Certainly, one of them is always gonna be racial strife, and they have to maintain their own identity and remember that their parents and their parents' parents had to muster up the strength and that this is what we need.  But we also have to take pride in the fact that we have so much to offer.  We have so much beauty and so much talent that is not being used.  And I hope that, you know, we will begin to value those things more and make our--each generation has to make its own history.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to say?  Anything else that we--
Speaker 2: I think I have said enough (laughter).
Speaker 1: --that you wanted to talk (laughter), okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I have really talked my head off.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I want to thank you again.  This has been such a delightful experience.  I really--
Speaker 2: Well, it's been--
Speaker 1: --really enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: --an honor for me to be considered a HistoryMaker.  And I guess since I've talked, I've realized that maybe I have had a history that's worth saving.
Story_ID: 277209
Speaker 1: Could you please tell us something about Arthur [Johnson]?  Who is Arthur in--
Speaker 2: You mean Chuck [Charles Calloway].
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, Chuck.  Oh, dear, I'm sorry.  Chuck, oh (laughter), I'm so used to Arthur. Chuck, yes, could you tell us something about him.  Who is he and why is he important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing, I've been married to him for the last twenty-five years, and that is a very big portion of my adult life.  And I always said I would never marry another doctor, and then I turned right around and married another doctor, and I have not regretted it.  I met Chuck at his church.  And it was just before I was having my show at California College of Arts and Crafts [California College of the Arts, Oakland, California], and I invited him to the show.  And when the president of the college called me and said they were gonna have a dinner in my honor, did I want to bring my spouse?  I said, "Well, I don't have a spouse." But just about that time, he called me at my home, and it was the first time he had called me.  And I, we just talked and immediately had a real conversation.  So when they called and asked about the dinner, I said well, I'll bring a friend.  And I asked him if he'd be interested in going to an art show with me and a dinner they were giving in my honor, and he did, which was right near him in Oakland [California] at California College of Arts and Crafts.  So he came and that night I invited a choir from the Allen Temple Baptist Church [Oakland, California] to come and sing at my art opening.  And he was there, and we never stopped seeing each other.  He, from that night on, he came to see me every- six nights out of the seven.  And I began to wonder on the seventh night, what did he always do that he could never come on Monday?  And it turned out he was watching Monday night football, and that is still a very important part of his life, is watching his sports.  But he, he is a doctor in San Jose [California] and--I mean in East Oakland [California], has been there for twenty-some years, retired recently at, at age seventy-five.  And now he's very active in his church and an avid golfer.  And it's because of him that I tried to play golf.  That's something else we didn't talk about.  And my golf should not be talked about too much 'cause it isn't that good, but it's a, it's an important part of, of what we do.  And so we have, have learned what it's like to live through a second marriage.  And he had three children of his own who became a part of our family, and we're still going strong.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful, good.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I didn't want us to close without talking about that important part of my life and how supportive he has been for the most part of my art until he realizes that I've taken over the whole house with it (laughter) and frequently have him hauling it back and forth up the steps.  So I appreciate that as well.
Speaker 1: That's a lovely tribute, lovely, lovely.  Okay, that's it.
