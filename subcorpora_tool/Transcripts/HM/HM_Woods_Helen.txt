Story_ID: 571669
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure, go ahead.
Speaker 1: And, from what I understand, now, you are an orphan right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was adopted by Laurence C. Jones and Grace Jones [Grace Morris Allen Jones].
Speaker 1: Now, do, do you know anything about your birth parents at all?
Speaker 2: I know sa- what they told me, that my mother, birth mother was white and my father was black. So, they had to get rid of me, so they gave me to this orphanage, white orphanage, but then I began to turn black, you know, in color.
Speaker 1: You got darker in color (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got darker, and then they found out you know, that I was black. So there was no place to put me, so they asked Laurence C. Jones would he take me because he--they knew he took poor children in, you know, and his wife wanted a little girl, so that's why I was adopted by Laurence C. Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I didn't want to miss an important point here, and that is that the orphanage, you know, with all these babies were segregated right.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: They only had white babies and they, they by law they couldn't even have a black baby, baby then right?
Speaker 2: I was first in the white, you know, the white orphanage, but when I began to turn dark, they realized that I was black, you know, then I was put in the, in the--I didn't know where--they didn't know where to put me see. So they asked Mr. Jones, you know, would he take me, and he said, you know, he didn't think so at the time, but his wife wanted to adopt me 'cause she--they had two boys [Turner Jones and Laurence C. Jones, Jr.]. And when I was four years old, she died. So that left just Mr. Jones, to you know to be the parent.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Piney Woods School, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Country Life School--

Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did, did he ever talk about his ancestors, where is his ancestors came from or?
Speaker 2: If, if he did I, you know, I--you know, at, at that age I didn't really, you know, pay any attention to it, you know. (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: I know that his father was Mexican. And his mother's [Mary Jones] black and his father, when he was a little boy, his father left and went to Texas and he never was able to find out what happened to his father.
Speaker 1: Okay, first time I ever heard that so, okay. So he didn't, he, he didn't take his father's name I take it? It was his, his mother's name?
Speaker 2: No, his mother's name.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he have any stories about growing up that he talked--
Speaker 2: I don't recall any.
Speaker 1: So, when, was your impression that he was raised in a family of means? Or were they poor or?
Speaker 2: No, just a working family. But, his, his, his family's two sisters were educated 'cause one was a music teacher you know?
Speaker 1: Do, do you know where she taught, if she taught in the public schools, or in college or?
Speaker 2: I don't, I think she did private teaching because she--as I told you she taught Coleman Hawkins, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--do you know where he went to school?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Mr. Jones.
Speaker 2: He, he grew--he went to school 'til--he graduated from high school he was the first black to graduate from the high school there at St. Joe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he graduated from the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the first black to ever graduate from the University of Iowa so, there were a lot of people that took an interest, Piney Woods--in Piney Woods School when he went down to start the school because they, they donated cattle, and everything to help to get the school going, you know.
Speaker 1: So he was the first black to graduate from the University of Iowa?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I think it was Iowa State wasn't it, I think I was, I just know Iowa University (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's interesting I've, I've heard that--
Speaker 2: There's Iowa State [Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm; Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa], then there's Iowa University, (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah, it's two of 'em there. Now I've heard that--
Speaker 2: Now I don't remember the word state, I just remember they said he was the first black to ever graduate from the University of Iowa 'cause they said, he--when he walked across the stage to get his diploma, the whole school stood up, you know, and the whole audience stood up and applaud him 'cause he was the first black to do that you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they also did a lot to help him get--financially to get the school--Piney Wood School going, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now there's a story that George Washington Carver went--Carver went to Iowa State before he--
Speaker 2: He probably was, yeah, uh-huh. I think I've heard of that one too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was an art major, yeah is a major--an art major.
Speaker 2: I've, I've heard that one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Before he got involved in science.
Story_ID: 571670
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how he started Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi]? Can you tell us how, how he started Piney Woods and, and why?
Speaker 2: Well, he had heard--Laurence Jones [Laurence C. Jones] had heard that, that blacks didn't get much opportunity in education in those days they had to work the fields, and things like that, in order to, to, to survive. So he decided that he should go down, you know, and set up a school help educate the black children and things. That's how he wound up in Mississippi, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Piney Woods is located in what part of Mississippi?
Speaker 2: It's near going towards the, the--it's going towards New Orleans [Louisiana], the southern parts. It must be the, the--it's in the middle of, of Mississippi I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because you go to--go Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Gulfport, Mississippi, New Orleans, and all those, all down that area going to Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right. Did he, you--so, so you said when he started the school he had a lot of help from the University of I- Iowa [University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa], and the contacts he made there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they gave a lot to help the school. They gave cattle, and things like that helping. But, there was black man that lived out in the country, to help gave him land to help farm on too, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Asa Turner was the man's name, A-S-A, Asa Turner, donated forty acres and a mule, you'll, you, you, the history about it, you'll read it in a book, for him to get started with this school for black kids that lived in the country like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the, the, the point was to help the rural black kids that were out in the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, rural, yeah, 'cause all they did was pick cotton. They had no, they had no security, no educational security. So when he saw that, you know, the ha- the need, he decided this is a place I will start my school. He, he started the school right there under, under a tree. In a log cabin that Asa Turner gave to him. It was a--where they kept the pigs and hogs, and things. They cleaned it out and gave it to Laurence C. Jones, you know.
Speaker 1: That, yeah--it's probably hard for people to believe now, that there could be a place in the United States where there was no school to go to.
Speaker 2: Well, in those days that was everyday occurrence, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so down in the, in southern Mississippi. So--
Speaker 2: And when we get through with this, I'll try to see to get you a book, you could get the history of Piney Woods.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know there's a, there is history out, yeah, I, I think it's new one actually someone just did new one, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know about that, but I know the original history of Piney Woods and Laurence Jones.
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Story_ID: 571671
Speaker 1: Now do you remember his, his wife at all, his--your step-mother [sic. adoptive mother] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I just barely remember it. I remember that she was a very kind person, you know, she had to be kind in order to, to take me, you know, wanted to see. And they wanted a girl 'cause they had two boys [Turner Jones and Laurence C. Jones, Jr.], so, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was her, her name? His wife?
Speaker 2: All I can remember is Grace Jones [Grace Morris Allen Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay Grace Jones? Okay, and do, do, do you remember--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know where she was from, I can't remember any of that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I just remember that he--Mr. Laurence Jones [Laurence C. Jones] met her and she was doing a lot of work, I understand that she was doing a lot of work with, with black kids, you know, where she was from. So, and he encouraged her to come to Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] and help the school, and then they got married, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so she, she, she passed when you were four years old?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: She passed away when you were four?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. What happened was she sick or what?
Speaker 2: Had pneumonia, died of pneumonia in those days you know, living out there in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: No medicines.
Story_ID: 571672
Speaker 1: What did people tell you about her [Woods' adoptive mother, Grace Morris Allen Jones] per- per- her personality? Did, did, people talk about the way she was and--?
Speaker 2: She was--for everybody--you know they had a--Mr. Gron- Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] formed a, a, a good group of singers called the Cotton Blossom Singers. And they traveled all over America raising money for the school. And she was one of the chaperones, you know, there's--to--you know take the girls all over, you know, over to be seen, and heard, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Mr. Jones' sister was a music teacher. I think--did I tell you before about her teaching Coleman [Coleman Hawkins]?
Speaker 1: Yes, right. Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And, so Mr. Jones was quite familiar with music, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So he, he, he organized the, the students that came to Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] in quartets so they can send 'em out all over, you know, the country, to raise money for Piney Woods.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is a model--it's similar to the model of Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], and some of the other black, black schools [HBCUs] did the same thing right?
Speaker 2: Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's more of a Tuskegee thing--kind of thing. Don't you think so? Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you read the history.
Speaker 1: Well, I think Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] was the first--that was the first singing group to go all over the world.
Speaker 2: They, where were they from?
Speaker 1: Fisk.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Jubilee Singers, now, and but the other black schools kind of tried to do that too, 'cause it was hard to raise money. Right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true, that's true. You're right.
Speaker 1: They had to do something to raise money to, yeah.
Speaker 2: You're right, I'm wrong, I remember now, Fisk University singers. And they were very good too.
Story_ID: 571673
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have an early childhood memory of--after my--Mr. Jones wife's [Grace Morris Allen Jones], my [adoptive] mother died. I was in--was put in the dormitory 'cause he was gone all the time to be with the other girls and things like that. And I can remember standing in the window--dormitory window looking out--I could hear the trains track down--it was down across city highway, and I always kept telling myself one of these days, I'm gonna be on that train going someplace, I could remember that, you know. I remembered that all my life. I still remember that, you know. And this is deviating from what we were saying, but, as I got older, I heard and experienced--the train came through Piney Woods [Mississippi], you know, near, near the border of this school [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi], and blacks got on, you know, they got on one part of the train, and whites got on the other. And you had to bring your own lunch. So they named the, the, the train the blacks were part on, the Chicken Bone Express, 'cause they'd have all their chicken in bags and then when they get, get off the plane--the train there'd be a lot of bags of chicken bones and things. So the named it the Chicken Bone Express, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's interesting, okay.
Speaker 2: And Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] used to take me to Chicago [Illinois] with the music director named, Consuela Carter, to hear the different shows so, we, we could come back to Piney Woods and do these same type of entertainment.
Speaker 1: So, Con- Consuela Carter was the music director?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was our music director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. And she was very good.
Story_ID: 571674
Speaker 1: You grew up basically at, at Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] on the campus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, that was home. That was home.
Speaker 1: And, and what were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Piney Woods?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I can see us marching, marching to wherever we went we all marched, you know, we didn't walk, you know, like, you know, we marched in groups. The girls marched in one group, and the boys marched in one group. And, we all had to wear uniforms. And I also remember that each one--everybody had a chore. You, you--some of the girls had to work in the laundry. And I worked in the dining hall, I washed--help wash dishes, you know, for the, for the students after, after their meals. And the boys did the work on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can remember those days.
Speaker 1: So what kind of uniform did you have?
Speaker 2: I think, I don't remember too good. But, I remember the bands were blue around the band, I think it was grey khaki uniforms I think with bands--blue, you know, you know, your collar you turned over, you know, I just, I just, remember we had to wear uniforms.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean did the girls were skirts or?
Speaker 2: They wore uniforms, the whole dress was uniform, I think I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just a--it's a long, one long dress?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was dress, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And it was grey?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was grey, it wasn't to the feet, to your knees.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody had to wear uniforms.
Speaker 1: And what did the boys wear?
Speaker 2: They wore regular pants and white shirts.
Speaker 1: Okay, dark, dark pants?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Did--what other sights, and sounds and smells? What other--what did the place look like, how, how, how many buildings were there?
Speaker 2: Well, see we had a boys' dormitory, we had a girls' dormitory, we had a dining hall. But, the dining hall was in the girls dormitory for--when it was first was organized, you know, but, later on then they had a library--some woman [Delia Maltbie Dickman] really was interested in Piney Woods, and Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones], they, they gave books and things to Piney Woods, and the woman gave money to build a library there. Something unusual for blacks in those days to have their own library, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's still there, and it's going real good, I like it. Very excellent.
Speaker 1: And, and was this a white woman or black woman do you know or?
Speaker 2: This was a white woman that gave the money and everything. And the librarian was white, there wasn't no black librarians in those days. If there was they didn't, they you know--
Speaker 1: They weren't there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You didn't seem 'em. You didn't know them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 571675
Speaker 1: Were many of the teachers white on the campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause a lot of 'em when they retired came and gave their time, time to Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi], you know, as a you know, to help the kids. But there were some black teachers, but they had you--they had quite a number of white teachers that came down from the North now, be sure--you, you know, came from the North, that came down there in the summertime when the schools--regular schools was out, came down and worked at Piney Woods to help them with the kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. That's interesting 'cause I don't think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And our church was run, run by the Lutherans. We had a Lutheran pastor, named Reverend Schmidt, S-C-H-M-I-D-T, which everybody really, really--'cause he was so kind, you know, and generous.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a, this is a German guy--American guy, fella?
Speaker 2: I guess, I don't know, I just know he was so kind.
Speaker 1: Schmidt huh?
Speaker 2: Schmidt.
Speaker 1: Okay. Reverend Schmidt. Okay--
Speaker 2: And you hated to get in trouble, because he was so kind and you make--it would make you feel worse and guilty. (Laughter) 'Cause he really knew how to talk, you know, to the students, you know.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you ever get in any trouble?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I, I, had, I had to cry many--'cause I was always into something, you know. I'm one of those--you could see that now, one of those talkers, I never stop talking, and you wind up talking so much, you always say eventually the wrong things (laughter). So--
Speaker 1: Can you remember a story where you got in trouble?
Speaker 2: No, because I was in trouble so many times, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So they would send you to Reverend Schmidt if you got in trouble?
Speaker 2: Huh, oh no, they just referred me, because he always talked to the students and told 'em, you know, you know, about what it meant to be a Christian and what it meant to do good and not, you know, don't go out trying to, you know, do things that you weren't supposed to, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you--so, so you mainly got in trouble for talking huh?
Speaker 2: Tal- yeah, always talking too much, you know.
Story_ID: 571676
Speaker 1: How many students were on the campus in those days, I mean just approximately? I know you don't know exactly but.
Speaker 2: No I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Were there hundreds of 'em (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know--huh?
Speaker 1: Were there--was there a hundred, two hundred, three hundred, you think?
Speaker 2: Well, if you put the boys and girls together, sure because the boys worked the farms and the girls did the laundry and, and the kitchen, you know, laundry, washing the dishes and things like that, so it must've been about a hundred and something, the entire student body.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of parents sent their children to Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] because they weren't able to feed 'em and take care 'em properly, so it really was kind of a--what do call it, when you know, when you put a child in a to- you know, I don't think--I think the education came secondary to really finding a place to put the children because we--blacks were so poor, you know, what I mean, you--when I was a child coming up, you could work--you could walk, wor- work all week for five dollars, you know, that was for families that had money. Now, remember whites didn't have any money either, you know, the everyday poor whites didn't have anything either, you know, see, so--Mississippi really was one of our backwards, backwards state. I think that's one reason why Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] wanted to come down and help get things started for black students, you know, because all you could do was pick cotton, you know, that's all, all, you know, and when you farmed, you, you borrowed money from the, the, the store to buy the seeds and things, and most people couldn't count, so when they got ready to, you know, finished doing the harvest, you just turned back what in they said, you know, you owed, you know, 'cause you couldn't count, you didn't know how to, you know it was--Mississippi really was a backward state at the time when Laurence Jones came to Mississippi, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, by, by when, when was the school founded? Do, do you remember?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know but's it's, it's around there somewhere I know.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know. What do you--was it, was it founded around the turn of the century or, or?
Speaker 2: I don't recall, 'cause I don't (unclear).
Speaker 1: Was, was, was it within, maybe--I mean was it in the '20s [1920s] or the '30s [1930s]--I mean the--well it couldn't have been in the '30s [1930s] but the '10s [1910s] or '20s [1920s] or?
Speaker 2: Must've been near the '20s [1920s] I think.
Speaker 1: Beginning of the '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little bit before the '20s [1920s], I thank yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe late 1910s [sic. 1909]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know they have a history book about him.
Speaker 1: Oh, I sure--yeah I'm sure.
Speaker 2: And those type of stuff, you can check it and they--they're, they're more correct in their statement than I am, 'cause, you know, I'm beginning to forget this but, this was history was done a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, well forgive me, I just, you know thought I'd ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No you're--I'm not holding anything, I'm just saying, you know, if I don't come up with the answers it means 'cause I, I can't remember, you know, but it's like I said if you want it done correctly, 'cause I might tell you something, you know, it's--, "I don't think it's like that Helen [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods]," and if you check the library, you say, "Yes it is--it wasn't like that, she was wrong" (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 571677
Speaker 1: What was it like, 'cause nobody can go back and be in it--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and you were there see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. That's true, that's true.
Speaker 1: So, so you know more of that than anybody else. So, so what was it like? What, what was school like? Was it--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I was a little kid and they had chores for little kids to do to, like we would go around and pick up papers and things off, off the ground and things like that, and then they started having this little nursery and kindergarten school you--'cause you remember Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] had his degree, he knew about education, what people should have and what they should not have, you know, and so--they had little places where the little, little kids stayed in the little nursery and had people, you know, to come in and help us and things like that, you know, see, but I don't recall too many activity things but, you know, kids playing, you know, we used to play jacks in the olden days and play balls, you know, little--softballs and things like that, this, this was our main source of entertainment, you know, and at night, especially in the summertime. There were no lights, it was just lanterns, that, that the supervisor would have to see that everybody taken to their rooms when they were supposed to be on time because Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] couldn't afford all that elec- electricity, you know.
Speaker 1: I bet it got real dark out there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes at times, we lived--the school was up on a hill, you know, it's up on hill. Sometime you all should go and see it, so. Haven't some of your family members told you about it?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am, but we're trying to (laughter)--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: This is much later date than when I was there right?
Speaker 1: Right. Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: So, it's a lot of things have changed com- you know, entirely since, you know, when I was there.
Speaker 1: So, so your schedule pretty much was--you had chores and then you had some time to--
Speaker 2: Yes, I had chores and then I, I had chores. Then Mr. Jones loved music, and when we were young, he went--the radio had just come in and he heard Phil Spitalny band.
Speaker 1: Phil who?
Speaker 2: Phil Spitalny that was an all-girl band that was on TV. Don't tell me how to spell it 'cause I don't know.
Speaker 1: So can you say it one more time slow?
Speaker 2: P-H-I-L, Phil, Spitalny, S-P-I-T-A-L-A-N-Y [sic.] or something, whatever it is, put a question mark beside that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they want--that's when TV first came out and you could see pictures of people, you know, playing music and entertainment and things and Mr. Jones saw Phil Spitalny's band on TV.
Speaker 1: On TV?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he said, "Well, I have girls here, you know, that take music lessons, I could find, I could find--start an all-girl band too," you know.
Speaker 1: Now this is on TV or radio now I mean?
Speaker 2: I think it must've been radio don't you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, it had to be radio I think yeah, on radio yeah. So he heard 'em on the radio and?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he said he has girls here that could play music so--
Speaker 2: Yeah he said, "I got girls that could play instruments, I could start a all-girl band too." That's how the Sweethearts of Rhythm [International Sweethearts of Rhythm] came about, you know.
Story_ID: 571678
Speaker 1: When did you first become interested in music?
Speaker 2: Well, playing music---it must've been while I was about six or seven year old. But, I used to like to watch music. I remember when I first started be--want to be involved, my [adoptive] father, Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones], wanted me to play violin. And I told him no 'cause I don't feel like holding no violin under my chin all day long, I wanna play a instrument you know what I mean (laughter). "Well, what do you wanna play?" he was always--I say, "I wanna play a trombone, I like seeing that slide go up and down see." So he told the music teacher, "That girl's got problems would you please get, get her a trombone," (laughter) see--so. And I'm, I'm glad I really you know, I don't think I could've made a violin, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You gotta have patience, you got a have a lot of good, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, the trombone. So, so--okay--so Cons- Consuela Carter was your music te- teacher then?
Speaker 2: She was our first teacher, Consuela Carter, yeah she played Carnegie [Carnegie Hall, New York, New York] she was very good. She had been trained by some retired band leader, you know, that came to Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] to help.
Speaker 1: Okay, she played the trumpet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was very good.
Speaker 1: Now, was it common in those days for women to play the horns and?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know I--'cause we didn't know, we didn't--we were in the country--we didn't--what did we know what was going on. Piano was the only thing, you know, they thought people, you know, could play you know.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, I imagined during them days it was--good musicians there but you--they didn't get the recognition that should've been given 'em you know.
Story_ID: 571679
Speaker 1: When was the band formed?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: When was the band, the International [International Sweethearts of Rhythm]--
Speaker 2: When did we first get started?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, how did he--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, when we first started out, you know, we were--there was a marching band. We were supposed to go to--girls played the instruments, the boys were--didn't play anything. We all played different instruments, and there's a Bud Wilkins [sic.], you ever heard of that, the, the parade in Chicago [Illinois] every year?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bud Billiken [Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic].
Speaker 2: Bud Billiken.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] knew that man that was head of it at that time. So he promised him that he would bring the--our band, all-girl band up there to, to march, you know in the parade? But, somebody stole the money, so he couldn't bring, the band, band up there, you know we were raising money to bring the band out from Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] to Chicago to be in the parade.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, how, how, old were you when--
Speaker 2: How old was I?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I must've been about seven or eight years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're supposed to be in the Bud Billiken Day Parade. So I guess he must've known either Robert Abbott [Robert Sengstacke Abbott], or--
Speaker 2: Who Laurence Jones did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or Mr. Sengstacke [John H. Sengstacke], I don't know.
Speaker 2: Mr. Jones made it his business to know everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had the type of personality.
Speaker 1: So he knew the owner of the Chicago De- Defender [Chicago Defender] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah ok, so he was--
Speaker 2: I don't think he was a public, a--you know, a personal friend, but he knew everybody. He had to, he had to know everybody in order to raise money for the school.
Speaker 1: Now did, did, celebrities come to the campus and visit?
Speaker 2: Yes, a lot of people came, but this was--this not right off later then. I remember the man that owns Saks Fifth Avenue came down, and saw Piney Woods. He came down in this beautiful car. I never seen such a beautiful car in my life. Helen Keller came to Piney Woods, you know, a lot of celebrities came to Piney Woods, you know.
Story_ID: 571680
Speaker 1: Were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: I could've done better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was average.
Speaker 1: Did you like school as such, I mean?
Speaker 2: I liked to read all my life, I love to read, but otherwise no.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you feel special at the school?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't special. I was just another girl 'cause I was raised in the dormitory like the rest of the kids, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, you didn't get any kind of special treatment because Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] adopted you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, unh-uh, no, not at all. Half the time--most of the time Mr. Jones was gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they--the, they--the assistant ran the school, 'cause he was busy raising money for the school, you know, he had--his--he had a full time job, try to, to raise money to keep things going, you know, we were the first lived out in that area to have electric lights, you know, in those type of things. So it was--those were things that you know, you just take for granted nowadays, you know, everybody should have electric lights, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when electricity came there?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember. But, I remember in the summertime they turned, turned it off in order to save money for the school because, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so they didn't, they didn't let it go all year round. So it was like a--but did they have electricity when you got there? When you were a little--I mean did they have it when you started your memory, when your, when your memory started?
Speaker 2: No, it came in later.
Speaker 1: Came in later?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You, you think you may been about what ten, six, seven? I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't remember, but I do remember when it really you know, we started having electric lights. Because we had to turn them off at night in order to save on electricity, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but, Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi]--when it got electricity it was one of the first places out there to get it?
Speaker 2: Prob- yes, yes, Piney Woods was in the middle of the woods. That's why they named it Piney--Mr. Jones named it Piney Woods, this man [Asa Turner] gave Mr. Jones forty acres like I said, and this mule. And you know, it was out there in the woods. And the pictures will show you where he sat up under the tree teaching the kids, you know. So he did a lot because in those days blacks didn't know anything about, about farming or doing anything, just worked in the fields picking cotton, you know, see--so we did a lot, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he taught agricultural techniques and things to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh. And the story goes, over and over about Laurence Jones, that once the whites out in the, the community, they was going to lynch him, 'cause they said he was one of those niggers that thought they was smart. And he told 'em no, if I train your children and everything the people that work--learn the work they can be better servants in your house. They can wait on your family better, and they can be your maids better, they'll be clean and that impressed them, so they said leave 'em alone, don't hang him, you know, see so. But, they were very upset when Piney Woods first came to be 'cause they thought he was coming there to start a lot of trouble, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so there was never any trouble when you were there huh, with the local (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, unh-uh, no, after, after he told 'em that, you know, I coming to train 'em so they can work better in your kitchen and be your maids, and take care--better care of your farm land all like that. That was impressive specially--they didn't have no--whites didn't have nothing either. You know they was as poor as we were. You know.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know speaking of that was, was there a, was there a white school nearby anywhere?
Speaker 2: I don't recall, I don't think so. Unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: Well, what, what was the closest town, to Piney Woods do you know?
Speaker 2: It was a little--called Braxton, Mississippi, it must've been about five or ten miles from, from Piney Woods. Remember in those days it was mostly country, you know, the work, you know people did not live in a city atmosphere, most people worked by working on the farms and things. And Mississippi at one time was the poorest state in America, you, you knew that didn't you?
Speaker 1: I think it still is, I think it still is.
Speaker 2: Well, they've improved just a little bit, they have a casino down there on the end (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's true. If had--if it didn't blow away, during the torn- the hurricane, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it the wind didn't blow it away, but no, Mississippi was known to be the poorest state in the union, you know why? It was a landlocked. Think about it, look at the map and you'll see Mississippi--there's no water there or nothing there, it's right in the middle of everything.
Speaker 1: Well you got Biloxi [Mississippi] down on the gulf [Gulf of Mexico].
Speaker 2: But, that's down at the end. That's going into New- to New Orleans [Louisiana], and them other places, you know. But, I'm just talking about in general right in the middle you know.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Story_ID: 571681
Speaker 1: So who, who were some of your other teachers, now?
Speaker 2: It was Consuela Carter, there was--I can't remember but there was one teacher that I really fell in love with, she was a, a lady that was a history buff. And she could read us stories about history, and made it so interesting you think you were taking a part in it, you know. I can't think of--they had some excellent--one thing I can say about the people that came to Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] they were dedicated. They were very good teachers, you know. And I thank the kids learned a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you can't remember the history teacher's name? Was she black or white?
Speaker 2: It was a black teacher.
Speaker 1: Black teacher? Okay.
Speaker 2: Very good. They taught our group I know.
Speaker 1: Did she, did she, teach any black history in those days?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Did she teach any black history in those days?
Speaker 2: No, she just taught, taught out of the reg- regular textbook, you know. We got--in Mississippi you got all the books that the whites didn't want. And then later on, the Lutheran church gave us books from their kids, and their schools and things that they didn't need or want any more, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See we had, we had, we had all used books when people got through, you know they gave it to us.
Speaker 1: Now, now that intrigues me though, I just wonder did, did they ever talk about any famous black people in history and--at Piney Woods, like Douglass [Frederick Douglass] or Boo- Booker T., or--did they mention them when you were in school?
Speaker 2: They talked about, what's her name and--yeah, they talked about Booker T. Washington. They also mentioned, what's the name that's, George Washington Carver. You know every year in Jackson, Mississippi, the State of Mississippi has what they call a fair [Mississippi State Fair], where they bring in all the, the farm people that teach farm and all like that and have a big meeting, you know, where everybody comes and listens to the things that you need to know in order to, to produce, you know take care of the land better and be better farmers, you know rotate the crops, and all like that. And one year George Washington Carver came and spoke at, at--but it wasn't at my school, it was in Jackson, Mississippi, you know. So we've had quite a number of speakers that came to Piney Woods. Helen Keller came down, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wonder did, did, Mrs. Roosevelt ever come down?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Mrs. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: I don't recall that.
Speaker 1: Okay. I just wondered--
Speaker 2: But I remember old man Saks, who owned Saks Fifth Avenue came down there years ago when I was a little girl 'cause everybody loved to see that beautiful car he had, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so he--Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] had the personality, he could attract people, just like Oprah [Oprah Winfrey]. He and Oprah would've made a good husband and wife (laughter). 'Cause they knew how to, how--bring--reel 'em in you know. Everybody--he had the personality. You couldn't help but like Laurence Jones, you know.
Speaker 1: What you--
Speaker 2: So, he brought in a lot of people to Piney Woods. J.C. Penney [James Cash Penney]--old man Penney came to Piney Woods, you know. The man that owned Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] at the time came--you be surprised at the number of ce- celebrities that came to see Piney Woods, you know. And, they also gave to the school, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now do you remember any of the sayings of Laurence Jones?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of his sayings, you know, would he--is there anything that he would say all the time to the students?
Speaker 2: To the students?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So many should--be--should--could be doing something, when, when you should--could be better employed or something like that something, he use, he use to have quotations all over his, his, his office desk, you know, uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 571682
Speaker 1: You would know this and prob- probably hardly anybody else would, but, what would a typical day be like at Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi]? What would you do first thing in the morning? And when would you get up; when did you get up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the bell would ring at six o'clock in the morning. And we had to get up, wash up, some of the kids they had to go down stairs, if they worked in the cafeteria and set the tables and things. Put the plates--because the plates were not pulled all out, they were staked on--put the plates out, and get ready for us to have breakfast. After breakfast, we had chores, some worked in the laundry, some did this, and some did, you know, things like that. Piney Woods started sending out, you know, letters, you know, with--you know asking for help for Piney Woods. Some of the kids worked in the, in the offices. They learned to type, it, it was something to do. Then they had classes, you know, they had classes, and they, they had to learn a trade too, during the day, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And the girls that were musically inclined had to practice, you know, their instruments and things.
Speaker 1: Okay. So everybody didn't go to class at the same time?
Speaker 2: That's right nobody went--everybody didn't go to class at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how, how many building were on the campus?
Speaker 2: There was a boy's dormitory, there was a library, there was a post office, there was a community house, and there was little--a building were they kept the little bitty kid you know, you know, five, and six years old. And then there were cottages, you know. I should say Piney Woods had at least four or five--I know for sure they had a boys' dormitory which is large, and a girls' dormitory that was large, and then they had a post office, and then they had the library, so at least five to six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Larger buildings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then later on, a white lady that retired from some school where she taught. She raised money to build this big library we, we have there now. It's a very nice library, very large. You know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Did I have a favorite? History.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could imagine myself going to those different places, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite story in history? Favorite place to go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I just, I just enjoyed them telling me about them going how, you know, they were over in England, you know, how they used to have to, you know, had all these sword fights, and all like that, and then I like--read about Paris [France], you know, where they had the beautiful art work, and things like that, you know. Piney Woods also had a nice little library. Where--there were books that whites had given, you know, given the school it was very nice. It was in the back of the auditorium.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you could go back--and it was all classified. So you could go back, and chok- and, and check them out, and things like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so, so--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Um-hm?
Speaker 2: Didn't you say one of your rel- relatives went to Piney Woods?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am, yeah.
Speaker 2: How long ago was that?
Speaker 1: Oh, well had to be in the, in the 19--late '40s [1940s] I guess, early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: You all--school advanced more then--had by then.
Speaker 1: Yeah right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] was dead wasn't he?
Speaker 1: Ye- I- I--no, I know--I don't think he was dead by then. I think she--I think--this, this is my mother-in-law, Glendora Leflore [ph.], yeah, who went there but--
Speaker 2: You know I think I know her.
Story_ID: 571683
Speaker 1: Now, how long were you at Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] before you hit the road with the International [International Sweethearts of Rhythm]--
Speaker 2: I stayed in Piney Woods 'til I was about fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. And I left with the band, when the band left.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1938?
Speaker 2: I think so maybe, I can't recall. I just know I was about--I'm eighty-four now, and I was born in 1923.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah.
Speaker 2: I never was good at math.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: So don't ask me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--I'm talking about--well I guess this about the beginning of the war [World War II, WWII] 1940--let's see if you're born in '23 [1923], '33 [1933] you'd be ten, and, you know, another--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no--you said about the war?
Speaker 1: No, no, I said--I'm just trying to calculate your age. If you were born in '23 [1923], 1933 you would be ten, another, another what four years, we're talking about, you know, 1937, '38 [1938] I guess. So that's, that's when you hit the road with the International Sweet Hearts--
Speaker 2: No, no we traveled to raise money for the school at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay. So did you have a special name then?
Speaker 2: Just Helen Woods, no Helen Jones [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods].
Speaker 1: No, I mean the band. Did the band have a special name?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah they name the--there was fella that was handicapped, but he was an unusual brilliant, and he's very smart he could do a lot of things. He could do a lot of electrical work. And his name was Clorta [ph.]--I mean--I can't think of his name, but anyway, when Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] started bringing in other nationalities, 'cause see Mr. Jones' parents---father was Mexican. So there was some Mexicans that came to school at Piney Woods and there were--so he said well we have a lot of different nat- why don't we just name 'em the Sweethearts of Rhythm you know, 'cause we have different nationalities, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all those girls were students at Piney Woods?
Speaker 2: Yes, all were students--we all were students when the band was organized and when we left.
Speaker 1: So I, I know you showed me a picture earlier of--there were some Oriental girls. What other kinds of people, there, there were two white girls right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had a girl that was Chinese.
Speaker 1: Two--Chinese, okay, Chinese?
Speaker 2: And later on as the band left, and went out on our own we had some white girls that played with the band. But that was years later, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, but while you were in Mississippi there were no, no white girls going to Pi- Piney Woods?
Speaker 2: No white girls, it was all black.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Because, we were working for Piney Woods, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay so when you first went on the road, you, you go on the road, and play and then, then, then come back to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because see the buses, you could, you could eat on the bus and everything--anything but you couldn't use the bathroom, you know, had to go in and use the bathroom.
Speaker 1: You couldn't use the bathroom in any of the public facilities right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Uh-huh, see we had the little bathroom toilet built right into the, the, the, the van--the bus was homemade. You know those long things and they, you know, they partitioned it off, you know, one part was the instruments and the other part was the, you know, where you could sleep, you know and, had toilet places, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So we traveled like that for Piney Woods for a couple of years, then somebody got that bright idea to tell the parents that the girls are doing more traveling raising money for Piney Woods than they are going to school. That's when, you know, we decided to leave Piney Woods and go on our own.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, some of the parents thought that, their, their kids weren't getting a good education?
Speaker 2: We weren't getting any 'cause we were busy traveling, playing, raising money for the school.
Speaker 1: What was--
Speaker 2: See we played all in the South, played in different, sorority dances and little things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what do you think? Do you think--was that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was true.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were kind of sacrificing your education?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, the school was sacrificing you actually.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The school was kind of sacrificing you all for the benefit of the rest of the school?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right we had to raise money some kind of way, you know, see.
Story_ID: 571684
Speaker 1: When was it that you--how, how old were you when the--you broke away from the school [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Oh I must have been about seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--all right so traveled about three years, and then, and then, you know, locally and then broke away (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, then we went on--when--during World War II [WWII], the black soldiers wanted to see some of their women because the white soldier had Radio City Rockettes. And they went to--they went over to entertain the soldiers, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, thorough the USO [United Service Organizations] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Through the USO, they went to entertain the soldiers. But, the blacks they were segregated, they were segregated during World War II, they were segregated so the fellas say, "Well wait a minute, now they got all their pretty girls, why can't we have some our pretty girls?" So, they, they, went and filed a complaint, so they said, "Well who would you wanna see?" They said, "Well, we don't know too many as a group. Well, why don't we get the Sweethearts of Rhythm [International Sweethearts of Rhythm]." That's how we got the chance to go, go to France, and Germany, during World War II, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, I, I just wanna go back a little bit, and just ask you like--how far did you all, did, did you travel before you broke away from the school, before--while you were still at the school, how, how far away did you go? Would you go all the way to, to, where I don't know Florida, or would you go to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, just all, near, near--most of the southern states--
Speaker 1: Just, just, right around--right in the South?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you never went to Chicago [Illinois], or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, we weren't that good, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were just glad to be playing, (unclear) we were just fair.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you don't think you all were that good, you know?
Speaker 2: No, because we didn't have arrangers, we didn't--you know, we were playing stock music, and things like that. That was in those days, you know.
Speaker 1: What, what were the, the tunes you would play? What were the, the--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: What did your repertoire consist of?
Speaker 2: Just the current music at the place, 'Sweet Georgia Brown,' and all, you know, things like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. 'Sweet Georgia Brown,' anything else?
Speaker 2: Some other tunes I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. But some of the popular music that was on the radio?
Speaker 2: Yeah for that day, we played the popular music for that day, because see in those days they had what they call stock music, you ever heard of that?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: You know you could but the music already arranged right at, at the music store see, and then we had to learn how to read notes, so we played, you know, played a lot of stock music, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, so there wasn't a lot of jazz and improvisation or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no, not much of any, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, it was played in unison and harmony, so it sound good, and it was danceable, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did, did--was there any particular girl that played with you that you think was outstanding as musician?
Speaker 2: At that time? No, I think they all--we were all about equal.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so pretty fair band?
Speaker 2: Just fair, just--we played--we were playing stock music that means reading the notes, you know, a lot the times the notes, the, the, the numbers and things, are written up under the notes, so you would know you'll be hitting the right notes, you know.

Speaker 1: So by the time you're seventeen the war [World War II, WWII] started, so they decided to send you oversees for the USO [United Service Organizations] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but see we weren't with Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] then, you know, that don't you?

Speaker 2: But, what happened was, we were doing all this traveling around, you know, you know, in the South and things. And a lot of parents were saying--things had gotten better this, this could do the whole route. Things had gotten better in the South, blacks were beginning to do more than just picking cotton for a living, you know, you know, working in, in somebody's kitchen. They were doing a little bit more you know, and so we, we, you know, we was still traveling in the South and everything. And the parents began to say, well wait a minute we're not getting chance to get an education, we're busy raising--fundraising, you know I mean. So this is how we got away from Piney Woods. A fella came to hear us playing, at one of these little dances, you know, sorority dances or fraternity dance, and he said well if you all will leave Piney Woods, and come with us, we'll see that each one of you'll get good money, and each one you can have a, a diamond ring, or he just told us everything beautiful. We're a bunch of color, colored girls, southern girls--
Speaker 1: Now this--is this a black fella or?
Speaker 2: Yes two, two black fellas named--Dan Gary [Daniel Gary] was the fella.
Speaker 1: Dan Gary?

Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, Dan--
Speaker 2: He, he give us all these wonderful promises, if we come to Wa- leave Piney Woods, and come to Washington.

Speaker 1: She wasn't with you?
Speaker 2: No. She had gone to another school teaching music.
Speaker 1: Okay, well who was the leader of the band?

Speaker 2: I guess about that time.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty [1940], you were seventeen you say.
Speaker 2: Yeah about that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Forty [1940] or '41 [1941]. Now had the war started yet?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it--I guess it probably hadn't, now if you were seventeen--
Speaker 2: I don't recall it then.
Speaker 1: 'Cause the war started in '41 [1941] when--the--after Pearl Harbor after December the 7th of nine- 1941 so.
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's when the U.S. entered World War II [WWII]. Before that time we were, we weren't in it so. That's okay. All right so, so, so did you play gigs in Washington first?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we used to play at, at--use to be a, a dancehall there, that at first it was a, it was a theater--but--Lincoln Theatre, you ever heard of Lincoln Theatre in Washington, D.C? You know there's a dancehall up under there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know that don't you?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't know that (laughter). But I, I've heard of the theater though.
Speaker 2: Okay, well that's it, there's a dancehall right up under Lincoln. We used to play the dancehall up under there.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: But, we had to first practice, and be real good. And then we had an arranger that made nice arrangements, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every heard of Eddie Durham?
Speaker 1: Eddie Durham? That's sounds--
Speaker 2: I don't think you did, but he played with Count Basie for a while, later on. But, he made nice arrangements for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he arranged your music.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so we stopped playing stock music, you know what stock music is don't you?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: And started playing arrangements, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so I, I guess shortly after that they made the deal, to send to you overseas? Did, did, did you go, did, did, you play in any other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we started playing in different theaters then too.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And then we went overseas, you know we use to play the Howard Theatre in Washington every year with Jackie "Moms" Mabley [Moms Mabley].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what was she like?
Speaker 2: Very nice to get along with. Very nice, very nice. You know she lived in Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was very popular.
Speaker 1: Yeah she was very popular in, in--was, was she in fun, as, as funny in person as she was on stage?
Speaker 2: I don't know 'cause when she came out of her dress--you know, she use to wear all type of aprons, and caps things. But she was nice, she was just nice, you know.
Speaker 1: Now did she wear--she, she didn't wear that stuff in normal--everyday life?
Speaker 2: No, it was part of her act, you know. And her favorite saying was she don't--nobody tell her--she don't want no old man telling her where a young man is, she'll find 'em herself, you know. See, so everybody loved Jackie, you know.
Story_ID: 571687
Speaker 1: So we were talking about Moms Mabley.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You said, you said she was from D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes, she was, and she was very nice to us [International Sweethearts of Rhythm], very friendly, very nice, you know, she always brought her lunch to work, she never ate out and she'd always off- offer us something when she get ready to eat her lunch, ask if you want some of this, you know, something, she went out of her way to be real nice, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is she still living?
Speaker 1: No, I, I don't think so no. Yeah, yeah are there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's been a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Any, any stories about Moms Mabley that you remember that?
Speaker 2: No, no, she was, she was very nice, but she was very personal, very personal. What she did, you know, she kep- well first of all I think she thought that we were really too young to be involved in any of her gossip anyway, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she respected your age--
Speaker 2: Yes because we were young, you know, she was very respectful. And her grandson used to bring her lunch every day to the theater, and I remember she always offered us something. She always--she's all--she was always nice, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you were telling us another story about Billie Holiday. Now, now what happened with Billie Holiday?
Speaker 2: Billie Holiday was supposed to sing at Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.] too, you know, but we couldn't play her music. And in the middle of the song, she just walked off.
Speaker 1: Was this, this during the show?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was this during the show or?
Speaker 2: Yes, and her boyfriend slapped her up once or twice and made her get back out there and sing, because he told her, he said you know, you had to get your start once just like everybody else, but she was right. How can you sing good if somebody not playing your music, you know?
Speaker 1: So you all just couldn't, couldn't play--
Speaker 2: No, it was above us. And we hadn't rehearsed it or anything, you know, it was sight reading and weren't that qualified yet.
Speaker 1: Okay. So a real good band--I mean would've been able to sight read it and do all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's all she worked with, was real good bands, you know, but they had her playing, she was a star attraction of the, of the band, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did you play any other cities besides Washington?
Speaker 2: We played every city. We played in Chicago [Illinois]. There's--it was a theater there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, you think it was the Rhumboogie [Rhumboogie Cafe, Chicago, Illinois] or?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but there was a theater there.
Speaker 1: Oh the theater, the Regal, probably the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, the Regal, we played there. And in New York [New York], we played the Apollo Theater. Every year we played the Apollo Theater for years, you know. And Jackie "Moms" Mabley worked with us sometimes, then Pigmeat Markham. You ever heard of him?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pigmeat Markham he's--
Speaker 2: He worked with us, and the Nicholas brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas].
Speaker 1: --'Here Comes the Judge,' yeah the Nicholas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Nicholas brothers in--are--we're all in the same family, cousins. His aunt, you know, and, and, and my, my brother-in-law, his aunt was there--their aunt, but they married, you know, my brother-in-law married their aunt, the Nicholas brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Which, which one Fayard or?
Speaker 2: Both of 'em--we worked with both of 'em.
Speaker 1: Oh well both of them--they both yeah that's right, that's right--
Speaker 2: We worked the Apollo Theater. They were very good, very good.
Speaker 1: You, you have any stories about them, the Nicholas brothers.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were very good. When they got through--we get through the shows and things they would, I forget some other brothers that was--Stepping--no--
Speaker 1: Step Brothers [The Four Step Brothers].
Speaker 2: Step Brothers, they were best of friends, and they'd go downstairs and tell some of the filthiest jokes. (Laughter) And they enjoyed, they enjoyed each other--we ain't have no business going down there no way. See, so--
Speaker 1: Now what about Pigmeat?
Speaker 2: He was nice, but he, he wasn't you know, he never was very close to us. He was just, just a nice person, you know.
Story_ID: 571688
Speaker 1: Everybody was nice. One thing, at that time we [International Sweethearts of Rhythm] had a, reputation, of being girls that were very nice, and needed to be respected. That was our reputation, we had a chaperone, and everything you know that, chaperoned us going and coming every place. So we really weren't allowed to do a lot of things like you couldn't go to a night club when you got through working and all that. You had to go back to where you were staying and go, go home, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Which was good because the girls were young. You just don't release a bunch young country girls to the wor- to the world like that, you know.
Speaker 2: Now, now, did, did you ever meet Dorothy Dandridge and her sister [Vivian Dandridge]?
Speaker 1: Yes we met her she played with us, you know, I mean, you know, she was on the program with us. She was very nice, yeah very nice.
Speaker 2: I know they use to dance with the Nicholas brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas].
Speaker 1: Huh, who you say, who you say did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Dandridge sisters use to dance with the Nicholas brothers from time to time? Did you--
Speaker 1: Most everybody went out of their way to be nice to us, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I can't, I can't say anything because, remember those people were much more experienced in the entertainment, and in the music world than we were. So we had to learn so they went out of their way to be really, you know, be really nice to us. And if we weren't the best, they at least gave us respect, you know. Years ago when we first went to Washington, D.C. to live, they were having the World's Fair [New York World's Fair] in, in New York City [New York, New York]. That was years ago, and they had this--they wanted us to play. I don't know why in the world they wanted us to play at the World's Fair. But, I remember Tommy Dorsey, was one of the judges. He said, "Well only thing--good thing about 'em--I could say is they, they do play in tune (laughter)." So I'll never forget that one, you know. So we, we've had, God was good to us, we've had, we had a lot of good experiences. And mostly everybody was nice to us.
Speaker 2: Wha- wha- what star were you the most excited about meeting in those days?
Speaker 1: The most--that I was excited about meeting?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now that's a good one. I was pleased to meet the Nicholas brothers, because they, they, they were a top act you know, and things. And I--there was a lady that was singer that, the--I still see some records by her, Sister, or somebody that sang she played the guitar?
Speaker 2: Oh Sister Rosetta Tharpe?
Speaker 1: Yes, I enjoyed being with her, she was very nice. We had, we, we had a lot of different experiences. How do you remember all these old people?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where is she now, she still living?
Speaker 2: No ma'am I don't, I don't believe she is. I can't say for sure, but I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Well, we did shows with Sister Rosetta Tharpe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I've interviewed quite a few people that were in shows in those days. And you know, dancers they were doing different things, you know.
Speaker 1: I think the only two people that were distant to us was Duke Ellington, and I can't think of the other pla-, "Hi-de-hi-de-ho--."
Speaker 2: Cab Calloway?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they weren't friendly at all.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: But everybody else was Duke- Count Basie's family friends were fo- friends and you know, everybody went out of their way to be nice. But, these people they were, they were very--well I can understand, they very aloof, you know.
Story_ID: 571689
Speaker 1: I think for years people thought women musicians were a jokes, you know that don't you. Yeah, they didn't really have too high of an opinion on women, and musicians, you know. Yet, there were always some good musicians. This Melba Foster [sic. Melba Liston] or somebody she does all the arrangement for all the big bands now. You know who I'm speaking about don't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah you were talking about her, she's a trombone player. But, she plays everything, right you said?
Speaker 1: And she does, mixes arrangements for, what's the name of this fella?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones.
Speaker 1: Quincy Jones, I think?
Speaker 2: Quincy Jones, she does all of his arrangements. And plus Burt Bacharach, she does his, his music for him, see so--
Speaker 1: Now what about Hazel Scott, did you ever meet her?
Speaker 2: She was good, yeah we played with her once. She was very nice.
Speaker 1: Now she's somebody that everybody had to recognize as being, being a good musician right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and I'm trying to think of the woman that teaches in North Carolina she plays piano. When you go--soon as you go I'll think about her.
Speaker 1: Oh, Marian McPartland. I guess?
Speaker 2: Well I knew Marian, she was just never--this girl is black her name is--she played piano. She was--she's a music teacher in, in North Carolina, I can't think of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, no I don't know who.
Speaker 2: Is it Williams? Mary Lou Williams.
Speaker 1: Mary Lou Williams? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes Mary Lou Williams, she was very nice to us you know. So we've been blessed, and we've been cursed. So we had a bunch of--
Speaker 1: So do you think that women just didn't get a chance really to show what they can do?
Speaker 2: Well partially didn't get a chance, and second of all we weren't quite ready for, for primetime, you know.
Speaker 1: Well the ones that--
Speaker 2: You know, me--you, you--in order to--you gonna--you could--nowadays--in those days you had to be good too. You just couldn't say where there's a bunch of pretty girls they look nice, and go out there and say well, you know, this wonderful no. You had to offer something. And we had a--for a while we had a very good arranger [for the International Sweethearts of Rhythm], I don't think you ever heard of Eddie Durham.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were just talking about him last time Eddie Durham.
Speaker 2: He's the one that made Count Basie's style. He did his style for him you know, and when he--we played any of his music everybody enjoyed listening to the band, you know.
Story_ID: 571690
Speaker 1: When you went overseas where did you go first?
Speaker 2: We [International Sweethearts of Rhythm] first landed in France. And we, I don't, don't think we did too much there 'cause we went on to Germany where the soldier, black soldiers were, you know. And Radio City Rockettes were there at the same time we were there. And they traveled in this nice van with covers, and things. We just, we, we went over--we were in a open air truck, see so. But we were there to entertain the black soldiers, and they were there, I guess most of them entertain the white soldiers, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we were, we got chance to see all the buildings that had been bombed down, and everything like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, were, were you, pretty well protected over there?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I imagine you had a lot of hungry soldiers there that (laughter), that hadn't seen a black woman in a long time.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well. And the thing about it was this, they wanted, you know, to have somebody, you know, to, to, to look around and look up to, just like, you know, 'cause they--see the white soldiers had Radio City Rockettes, you know, see.
Speaker 1: And they didn't really, want the black soldiers at the Rockettes' show did they or?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Did the, could the black soldiers go to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know anything about that. You know, they--on each race entertained its own, you know there was still a lot of segregation in the--
Speaker 1: Yes, so I just imagine I don't know, but I would imagine that the black soldiers couldn't go see the Rockettes if they wanted to.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't really know, so, you know. I know they had their own place, and they had--'cause when we, when we played this dance, where it was you know, and everything was mostly all black soldiers, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, any, any stories from being on the road in Germany?
Speaker 2: No. they, they weren't used to seeing--they said they weren't used to seeing black women. 'Cause we saw one black woman the whole time we were there in Germany. The whole, it was four or five months, you know.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: And they use to tell us that black people had tails, that's what, Hit- Hitler [Adolf Hitler] told 'em and the little white kids say, "Can we see your tail?"
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that story so many times.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they used to say. Can you--see that's--I always said, "No, I can't pull my pants down today, but when I pull 'em down you can see 'em," you know, but they thought we all had tails, you know, because he told 'em that, you know, they didn't know any better, so.
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: I don't know. There's so many things, you know, that happened, that really I am so blessed to have seen all these things, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah. What was the, what was the morale like with the black soldiers. Were they? What did they--
Speaker 2: All we knew they were nice. They were nice--I don't know--we don't know those type of things, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they didn't appear to be happy or sad or any--
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh. They just came to hear--when we played for 'em, they came and they, you know. Some of the girls married one or two of the boys in the, you know, in the [U.S. military] service over there. The drummer, Pauline Braddy, married and then Evelyn Stone [Evelyn McGee Stone], before she married Jesse Stone, married one of the soldiers that she met over--black soldiers over there.
Speaker 1: So, did you date any of the soldiers when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, they, they didn't want me.
Speaker 1: They didn't want you (laughter).
Speaker 2: I never stopped talking, they couldn't get a word in.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you think of the Germans?
Speaker 2: I didn't have too much opinion because, you know the kids stood around and, and, and they couldn't believe it, you know 'cause they weren't used to seeing a lot of black women, you know, they stood around--they wouldn't--they never bothered us, we just, you know. We stayed to ourselves, they told us stay to yourself, so you won't be injured, you won't be hurt, because we're still in the middle of war [World War II, WWII], you know, we were in Germany, when the war was, you know, over. We were playing this big concert for the soldiers and, and this soldier said--walked up--I don't know who he was, one of the officer said, "Stop the music, I have an announcement to make," and we said to our self, now that's rude, but when he walked on the stage, said that--that--wasn't China, it was Japan, is capitulated. Boy and you're now free, that was the end, end of the concert. All of the soldiers just ran out of the hall. We were sitting on the stage by ourselves, you know (laughter). And we had to wait because they had to bring the black soldiers home first, which was fair, you know. So--
Speaker 1: Hm, that's something.  They just left the hall huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were so glad to know everything was over, you know, and you can't blame 'em, you know.
Story_ID: 571691
Speaker 1: What happened when you came back to the states? Did you--was that, that nineteen- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then the band decided each one would go its own way, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is like 1945 or, or?
Speaker 2: I think something like that yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Most everybody, you know, they paid us to go over there. And most everybody saved their little money, so when they came back, you know, they had this small amount of income, they said well, you know, we wanna go home, we wanna be with our family, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was the end of the Sweethearts of Rhythm [International Sweethearts of Rhythm].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of the girls formed little groups and things, you know, but as a whole, you know, the band just--we just disbanded.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did you do after? Did you go back to Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause I was afraid Mr. Jones [Laurence C. Jones] wouldn't take me back 'cause I'd left without asking him.
Speaker 1: Did you ever talk to him after you left or did you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a--he was a type of person, was good to everybody, you know what I mean, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he wasn't mad at you or, or?
Speaker 2: No, I don't tha- I guess he didn't even care, I bet he said good riddance (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he miss his bus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause I was, I was, mouthy then, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Did he miss his bus or?

Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean when you, when you first, came back did you go back--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh right, not then, later on we went back.
Speaker 1: So, so where did you go?
Speaker 2: Went to Jackson [Mississippi], then from Jackson, the bus picked up us and took us to Piney Woods.
Speaker 1: No, I mean when you came back from the war [World War II, WWII] where did you go?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Where, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I came to Omaha [Nebraska] because every--all the girls wanted to go home. I didn't have any place to go see.
Speaker 1: Right, I was--
Speaker 2: So Rae Lee Jones, the manager of the band said, why don't you come home to Omaha and live with us, you know, because I had been sending my little savings to her, to put up--invest for me.

Speaker 1: Ooh.
Speaker 2: Then when we came to Omaha, I asked her, "Where is my--where's my check?  Where's my savings?" First she told me it was in Washington. I said, "We just left Washington, there was nothing there in the bank, you know me." So she finally told me that she needed the money to do some--pay some bills or something. That's how I wound up in Omaha.
Speaker 1: So, she used your money to pay some bills for herself and--
Speaker 2: And her boyfriend. She had a boyfriend, see so. But I'll tell you, that's rea- it was wonderful because I love being in Omaha now.
Speaker 1: So you came back. Did you ever get any money?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't have none, she spent it all and she told me the house would be mine when they die 'cause she lived--her mother and father had a house on Willis Avenue, and when she--when the family died, I went and called the office down there and asked them, I said Rae Lee Jones' family is dead now, just wondering how I do about turning this house over to me and they told me if I paid how much money the house was worth, I could have it. I said what do you mean by that? They said it wasn't Rae Lee's home--Jones' house it belong to the county. See I didn't know that, and that's how I wound up in Omaha.

He graduated from Creighton with a degree in accounting. He was the first black to a get a degree in accounting here.
Speaker 1: That's something, that's--

And he had his little office down there on Dr. Lenox [ph.]--I mean it wasn't Dr. Lenox, it's another build- doctor's office down there on 24th Street.

Story_ID: 571694
Speaker 1: Ma'am what, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My concern is we're not taking the amount of interest that we should in our children, you know. Other races come over here, and they're serious about education and everything, so they're the ones going get the good jobs. You know we're, we're, we're busy being happy with welfare, which it, it, doesn't add up. That's my concern that you know the kids take advantage of their educ- 'cause see I think about the time when I was kid coming up in Mississippi and all those days. We didn't have all these things these kids have now, you know. And it really makes me sad, 'cause nowadays in America children are having children, you know that don't you? See, so we're really--everybody's raising each other, you know what I mean, see so, but--at Skinner [Skinner Magnet Center, Omaha, Nebraska] over there--it's--everybody's nice to me. It's a good school. And they have good teachers, I just wish that some of the students would take more interest in going to school, than you know. And they have, they have a music--they have--the prac- they take music lessons, and everything you know. And the, and the--I told the music instructor, I said I don't think your, your kids apply themselves do they? He, he said, you said that right, you know 'cause, you can tell when they haven't practiced, you know, they don't, you know. We have Omaha, Nebraska is--the whole state is a very good state to live in you know, you think, oh who wants to live in Omaha, nothing out there but farmers and all that other things, but Omaha's a very good state to live in. People go out their way to be nice to you, you know.
Story_ID: 571695
Speaker 1: Oh I wanted to ask you a question about--now do you still play your--a horn (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, heavens no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you just stop playing all together when you came back?
Speaker 2: Yes sir, after I came back I heard Melba--what's her name Melba, Melba, Mel- Melba Moore [sic. Melba Liston], Melba (unclear), I said it's time to retire.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, in California there's a mountain, out from Los Angles [California], where they--you have--you know some of--they take music lessons in the summer all these great musci- concert teachers, masters and all--they come there and give lessons to the--during the summer there. And I got a chance to go up there and see, you know, what's going on up there. It's really, ed- educational, they had some good musicians up there taking lessons.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now when you look back on everything you've done up until now, I mean was there, is there anything you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Yes, there's a lot of things I'd do diff- millions of things I'd do differently? I'm just kidding now camera (laughter), I would pay more attention to what I'm doing, you know. And I would really, try to give more than what I've been, what I've been getting, you know what I mean, you, you suppose give back when you get blessing, you know, I should be doing more than you know, than I really, you know do. I try to give back, you know but, I could still, you know. Example, in evenings helping kids go over their lessons, and things like that, that's all I mean, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you do volunteer at the school around the corner, you were saying the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What, what's the name of that school again the--?

Speaker 1: What today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't have any. I don't have one. What legacy should I leave? You know that you all wrote all this stuff about Helen Woods [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] (laughter). None of it was true. But it's wonderful that you came this way. I, I've never thought about things like that you know. I think the greatest thing that I'm pleased about is when I die that each one of--I have four children, and three of 'em are college graduates, and one [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes] is a millionaire. When you've had those type of blessing you have a lot to be grateful for. This is, this is what my, my gratitude goes to.
Story_ID: 571697
Speaker 1: Now you were telling us about your children?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you were saying how blessed you were that your children, were successful and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I am. I have two boys, and two girls. I have a daughter [Jackie Woods] that lives in Sarasota, Florida. She's married to a judge, and I have Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes], you ever heard of my daughter Cathy? She lives in Washington [D.C.] and New York [New York]. Then I have two boys I have Bill Woods--William Woods [Billy Woods] that lives here with me. I think he's gone to the football game, and I have Robert Woods [Bobby Woods], that lives in California. He's a doctor out there. See so, I've been blessed, every one of my kids have stood on they own, you know, and been able to make it. But, I also give thanks for the school system that came through. My kids, I was, you know, being from--raised in Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi], my kids went--all went through the Catholic system--school system.
Speaker 1: So that was closer to the, the Lutheran system?
Speaker 2: Well, and I like the way they handle children, you know, the--those nuns don't play. And, they, they, you know, they, they, I thou- I think when my kids were going to school, I don't know right today but, th- they, they, demanded disciplined, they demanded you, they demanded that you get your lessons, and everything else and this is very good for kids, you know. Nowadays you go to a public school, you have to be careful what you say to a kid because the parents can come and raise all types of confu- of arguments about their child. And--or you spend your time, defending yourself instead of showing the parent what your child needs to know in order to be successful in life, you know, this is what I, you know, I'm blessed that my kids all went through the Catholic school system, 'cause in those days the nuns would tell you if you don't like 'em, what I'm doing, take your child out of here. You can't--teachers can't tell the, the parent, you know, parents that nowadays, you know in public schools.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right in kind of flips the table, you know, turn, turn, turns the tables.
Speaker 2: You cannot, you know, see so I was blessed by my kids going through this system, you know, the Catholic system.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your husband [William A. Woods] when did he pass away?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's been dead almost thirty-five, forty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he graduated from Creighton University [Omaha, Nebraska] in accounting, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, you have grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have four too many at Christmas (laughter). 'Cause, "Hey grandma did you remember it's Christmas?"  But, I have, I have two boys, and four girls. My son that lives in California has two girls, and my daughter that lives in Florida as two girls, and the boys--what they--Cathy has Alfred [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], and Billy has--my son Billy lives here has a boy.
Story_ID: 571698
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you that you think I should ask before we--before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Just leave your name and address, I'll call and say, you know you forgot to ask this (laughter), no, I, I think that--I appreciate what you've done, you know, I think you wanna get the whole story which--this is the first time they really ask me about all of my personal life, you know, and I appreciate that 'cause you did do the story of Helen Woods [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods], you know, and the Sweethearts of Rhythm [International Sweethearts of Rhythm] see, so I appreciate that, thank you. Because it'll give me something to leave to my children right, see. So you really did me a favor. Because I'll, I'll ask for a tape of it, you know see, so I can see that they can get it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well you're welcome. The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different. Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as somebody that cared about other people beside myself. That's all I'd liked to be remembered as, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
