Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Zina, Z-I-N-A, 'C,' as in cat, Pierre, P-I-E-R-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is December 29, 1964.  And the place of birth is Annapolis, Maryland.
Speaker 1: What is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am an entrepreneur and a lobbyist.  I own a lobbying firm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is June 13, 2003, June 14, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At the present time, we are in my office which is in the National Council of Negro Women building here in Washington, D.C. on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Before we go into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish-type questions we ask, and they just require a short answer.  The first one is Ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, let's see.  Probably crabs, Maryland crabs.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is black.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is actually between March and May.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite destination?  Let's see, probably I would say Sun City in South Africa.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I usually say quite a bit... well, a couple of things.  I always say, "At the end of the day."  It's always, "At the end of the day."  But probably another thing I say often is--I teach my children this in my youth ministry that "You've got to have faith.  You've got to stay focused, and you've always got to follow through on what God has given you in your heart to do."
Story_ID: 90803
Speaker 1: Alright.  Can you tell me something about your family history?  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.  Actually not too, too far.  I do know on the Pierre side of the family that the family is traced from Sierra Leone.  And my middle name, Celestine, has been a name that's come down generation after generation between male and female.  And the... I am the last female of the middle name Celestine.  My father's first name is Celestine.  So, it was passed down; seems like every other generation it was a male or a female.
Speaker 1: And do you know much about your ancestors from Sierra Leone?
Speaker 2: Not very much, other than the fact that they were entrepreneurs.  As I understand it, they owned a number of housing developments-or I guess not housing developments--but apparently there was a huge market in terms of meat.  And they did quite a bit of... I'm sorry, I'm tired...  Can we like... I'm sorry, please forgive me.  Some of this is going to be cut anyway, right?  Okay.  They were sharecroppers. And from what I understand from my grandmother's great-grandmother as well, on the other side of the family, they were into poultry and meats, and had a packing house in West Virginia.  So, the entrepreneurial spirit that I developed certainly came from both my grandparents on my father's side.  But on my mother's side, my grandfather was, owned a cab stand in Annapolis [Maryland].  But he also, his father owned a meat company, and actually, apparently did a lot of butcher work for a number of groups of African-Americans, I would assume at that time.  But as far as my grandfather, my father's father, he owned a butcher stand in New Orleans [Louisiana] and a little grocery store called Pierre's Grocer.  So, and owned quite a bit of real estate in New Orleans as well.  So, he was a landlord across the East Side of New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from the 19th century?  Songs or anything that have passed down through the family?
Speaker 2: I would say the thing that was passed down more than anything was the scripture, "Must Jesus bear the cross alone, and all the world go free.  I know there is a cross for everyone, and I know there's a cross for me."  And I remember my grandmother singing it all the time.  And she always opened up in church as her testimony with that scripture.  And she got it from her mother, and her mother got it from her mother.  And so, it's, it's been a family saying for so many years.  My grandmother was sort of the mother of the church.  She was a hard worker in our church.  And our family has been a part of our church for... during it's, for its entire existence, which is 109 years now.
Speaker 1: Give us the name of the church.
Speaker 2: It's First Baptist Church of Annapolis.  In fact, the property that the church sits on, my family sold it to the church.  And ironically enough, I am the first female minister in my family.  And I was the first woman licensed to preach in, at that time, in the 107-year history of that church, and in the 57-year history of the pastor within the church.  So, a lot of history in terms of family history in that church.  We brought a lot to it, and got a lot out of it.
Story_ID: 90804
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us about your mother?  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us, and her date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Florence Louise Weens.  Justine is her married name.  And her place of birth is Annapolis, Maryland.  She was born in October, 1941, and still currently resides in Annapolis as a nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A retired nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was she like?  What kind of person?
Speaker 2: My mother was a very and still is a very soft-spoken, quiet woman.  Not the biggest socialite (Laughter) like I am.  She's always been very quiet in spirit.  But she was a very stern woman growing up.  You know, growing up, I didn't understand her too much because I thought she was so hard on me and so stern.  But later in my years, I grew to understand that she just wanted the best for me, and she expected the best out of me.  And with all those things came (Laughter) some stringent sort of rules within the house, and she had them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Darryl Celestine Pierre.  And he, his date of birth is December 1, 1941.  And he was born in Louisiana, a little small town outside of Louisiana, actually.  And my mom and my dad were never married.  My parents split up when I was just a baby.  And they were engaged to be married.  My mother married when I was seven with a gentleman, to a gentleman who was from the same city, ironically, as my father.  But yet she met both of them in Annapolis.  So, what can I tell you about my, my paternal father?  He's a gentle spirit, a very loving man, a very giving, caring man, very spiritual man.  A lot of his spirituality, I derived a lot of my spirituality I derived from my father.  And 6 foot 4, but very, very soft-spoken.  But big, big, heart.  He's, he was always the one that would bring in any stray or whatever from on the street, whether it was a cat or a human being.  If the person needed something to eat, if they needed a place to stay, my dad, he's always there to do that.  And he still to this day (Laughter) will do that.  So, he has many adopted children around this country, particularly in the state of Texas where he now resides, because of his giving and caring heart.
Story_ID: 90805
Speaker 1: Well, who was in your household when you were raised?  Your mother and you had a stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yes, and a stepfather, who's--
Speaker 1: Any brothers or sisters?
Speaker 2: One brother from my, between my mother and my stepfather.  And my stepfather's in the military.  In fact, he's over in Baghdad [Iraq] right now as a result of the war, with the Military Intelligence Unit.  My brother and I are seven years apart.  I have no whole sisters or brothers between my mom and my dad.  My brother and I grew up together like Frick and Frack.  And although he was seven years younger than me, I was his gatekeeper.  (Laughter).  And he... we had a great relationship.  We grew up fighting a lot (Laughter) because I wanted my space, and he would never allow me to have my space.  He always wanted to be up under me all the time.  And so, we often found ourselves in little spats with each other.  But we had a lot of love for each other.  I've got to be honest with you, and I want to take this off the record.  I don't... when it comes to family, my immediate family, there's not a whole lot for me to share.  Because, you know, quite honestly, I moved in with a relative when I was fifteen years old.  And so, the younger part of my life, my mother was a nurse.  She worked in a mental hospital.  So I didn't really live with my mother as my first seven years of my life, because I, you know, she worked midnight shifts.  And so, I saw her more on the weekends than I did during the weekdays.  So, it's a little different for me than maybe for most people, in terms of sharing all these great family moments.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Everybody's got their own story.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, I mean that's all I can tell you, is that everybody's got their own story.  Every individual we interview has a different story.  They're not all the same.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So don't think yours is--because it's not like somebody else's--is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --wrong.  I mean, there's no wrong story.  It's your story.
Speaker 2: Right.  The fun things I can remember in terms of a family unit was that we traveled quite a bit.  We often went to New Orleans [Louisiana].  We always, every year we went to the Mardi Gras.  We never missed Mardi Gras.  And I don't know if you've ever been to Mardi Gras, but it is a lot of fun, particularly as a kid, when you're out there and you're getting to catch all the beads coming off the floats.  We had a good time doing those kinds of things.  But there were times that were really rough.
Speaker 1: Is the Mardi Gras... is Mardi Gras the reason you like March so much?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That period of time?
Speaker 2: Actually, March for me is like, it's like an awakening moment, because you've been in slumber.  It's like the bear has been in the cave during the winter months, and all of a sudden the sun comes up and the flowers start to percolate a little bit.  The buds come out, and it's almost like a rejuvenation for me, to see those changes come into place... or to play.
Speaker 1: Springtime--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's your favorite.
Speaker 2: I love, I love springtime.
Story_ID: 90806
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about tough times just before I interrupted you.  What were you going to say about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, you know, I don't really care to share all that stuff.  But yeah, I don't want to put that on tape.
Speaker 1: But you had, you've had some tough times?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were rough moments.  I mean, being a stepchild can be rough at times.  And although I can say that I come from a very, very loving family in terms of my mother's family unit, my mother's sisters and brothers.  I have an aunt who took over when my grandmother died, and served as my grandmother.  And she had a strong foundation in terms of her religion, and she kept me in the church.  She kept me with, around positive people in terms of my cousins and other relatives that I considered to be siblings.  One in particular is Melissa, who is my cousin.  And we endearingly call each other sisters even to this day.  And we grew up like Frick and Frack.  I mean, you didn't see one without seeing the other one.  We wore our hair the same way all the time; we dressed the same way.  Her mother made all our clothes, often ponchos, whatever.  And we always dressed the same.  We're a year apart, and even to this day we...every other Sunday is our girl day, and we spend time with each other and fellowship with each other.  I preach every fourth Sunday in my church, and my family never misses a sermon.  Whenever I travel to go preach, my, that unit of my family never misses a sermon.  And that means a lot to me, because being in the ministry is a very lonely walk.
Story_ID: 90807
Speaker 1: Okay, now can you tell us what it was like growing up in Annapolis, [Maryland].  This is, you know, it's a different kind of place, as a lot of people know.
Speaker 2: It is.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What was it like for you growing up in Annapolis?  And what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of Annapolis?
Speaker 2: Annapolis is a very unique place to grow up, very sheltered.  When I was growing up, there was no melting pot then.  You were either black or white.  That's all you really ever saw in the sixties and the seventies when I was coming up, even in the eighties pretty much.  Until the late eighties, it started to transition and shift.  But growing up for me was, I love Annapolis.  In fact, I'm going to move back there and run for mayor someday.  But I remember picking honeysuckles off the trees and picking apples out of, stealing the apples off of the neighbor's tree that was leaning over in our backyard; and going down to the dock and riding on the Harbor Queen on Saturdays; and taking trips and going to summer camp; and boating; and walking down to the [U.S.] Naval Academy and sitting out on the rocks and doing my homework by the bay.  So, I have a lot of fond memories of Annapolis growing up, even into my adult life.  It's always been a positive sort of bug in my mind, in terms of all the good things in life.  Everyone should have an opportunity to live somewhere near the water, where they can get some peace and tranquility.  And I get that from water.  That's, that's, that's my favorite environment.  Give me water any day, and I'm happy.
Speaker 1: Annapolis is right on the Chesapeake Bay?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a very small city.  It's about 35,000 in population, 40 percent African-American.  It's a, it's a small town but it's a very close knit town.  Everyone knows each other there.  So, it was... you know, you couldn't do anything bad, because if you did, (Laughter) it didn't matter whether that person was black or white, they would call your mother and let them know that you were just doing something you had no business doing.  And I didn't know anything about black, white racism and all those issues.  I didn't experience that in Annapolis.  We were, there was no separatism.  There was no real 'us' and 'them.'  I mean you had your little pockets of communities that certainly were... you knew that it was the white community, or you knew it was the black community.  But growing up, I never... the one thing that my mother did instill in me was that no one else is better than you.  And don't ever put yourself in a position or a posture to make yourself think that person-- because they may have a little bit more than you or they may live in a better place than you--that they're better than you.  Because we're all God's creatures, and it is you who makes you.  And I never, I never had that sort of inferiority complex of, you know, being concerned about what someone else had that I didn't have.
Story_ID: 90808
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  Now, where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to Annapolis [Maryland].  I started at Georgetown East Elementary School.  Actually, no.  I started at Eastport Elementary school.  And then I went to Georgetown East Elementary school.  And from there I went to Annapolis Junior High and then Senior High.  And I played around in school my sophomore year and messed up my grade point average so bad that by the time I got into my senior year--although I was on the principal's honor roll and making almost straight A's--it was too late.  (Laughter).  I had messed up my grade point average, and was not able to start off in a four-year college.  And I was devastated by that.
Speaker 1: Did you make good grades throughout school, through grade school and on up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was a good student, I was a pretty good kid.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  I hated gym.  (Laughter).  But my favorite subject was English and social studies.
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers that were particularly--
Speaker 2: Influential?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Ames was my third grade teacher, and she was very tough on me.  And I was very smart-mouthed then for some reason.  I don't know where I got it from, but she stuck in there with me.  And I, she's the one that sticks out the most in terms of elementary school.  My kindergarten teacher was Mrs. Parnell.  And I don't know if she's still living.  But she, she was the one that taught me, "the itsy, bitsy spider" and (Laughter) I always think about her every time I think about that song.  And she was a big influence.  I was going to... believe it or not... I'm Baptist, but at that time I was going to a Presbyterian kindergarten school, and I just remember Miss Parnell.  Miss Holiday was my elementary school principal, and I remember her very endearingly.  Probably when I got to high school, it was several people.  She's now deceased... I'm seeing her face and I can't think of her name... oh, my God.  I can't think of her name.
Speaker 1: It happens.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm just drawing a blank.
Speaker 1: What did she do?
Speaker 2: She taught... oh my God, I'm tired, and I'm drawing a blank.
Speaker 1: We can come back to it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, so okay.  You went to grade school--
Speaker 2: Mr. Greenfield was my social studies teacher, too.  And we used to call him Greenie.  (Laughter).  He had a lot of...  A lot of who I am in terms of the whole political thing, some of it came from him.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you mean?  What kind of things?
Speaker 2: Well, I... you know, it's funny.  Because if anyone were to tell me back then that I'd be into politics now, I'd say "You're crazy."  But when I took... you know, I took several social studies classes through him, and learned about American politics and really got interested in the whole process of how a bill and an amendment is created, and just the basics of the Constitution, etc., etc.  And I learned all that from him.  And in my mind, that was the foundation that sort of started my interest in politics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is in high school?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: High school, okay.
Story_ID: 90809
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, were you involved in high school activities like band, or the chorus or anything?
Speaker 2: I was in, in junior high I was in and elementary school.  I played the flute and I played the accordion.  Not the accordion, what's that little thing?
Speaker 1: A recorder?
Speaker 2: Recorder.  The flute and the recorder.  And I just, by the time I got to high school I was not interested anymore, I was uninterested.  And, but I've always been one of those leader type people that always wanted to start groups and do a lot of volunteer stuff.  And so, we started this sorority called the Zetas.  And Zeta Phi Beta is what the group was called.  And we weren't supposed to start any sort of sorority or fraternity on the grounds of the school, but we sort of did our little underground thing.  And really, the whole purpose was to create leaders amongst ourselves within the school.  And before I knew it, we were probably a good hundred and fifty strong of this sorority of girls that... we just kind of hung out and made certain that we covered each other, in terms of doing our homework and just, you know, girly stuff.  And it was a lot of fun.  But the ironic thing is that I didn't pledge when I was in college.  So, it sort of dropped off.
Speaker 1: So you created a sorority in high school--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: --for a little bit.
Speaker 2: I thought, well, you know, you're not in control when you have to pledge.  (Laughter).  So, I didn't like the pledging part of having to do all that silly stuff, as I thought then.  I only wish that I had done it now.  And more than likely, I'll pledge Grand Chapter of Delta as soon as Prince George's County opens a line in my neighborhood.  But at that point I thought it was frivolous and silly, watching girls walk around squealing and following each other and being yelled at and all that stuff.  I just didn't like the hazing stuff.  So, I decided not to do it at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, what was the highlight of your high school time?
Speaker 2: The highlight of high school was getting out of high school.  (Laughter).  It was... I guess you know, for me... My senior year I worked part-time, because I had pretty much finished most of my credits.  And so, I was able to work part-time and go to school part-time.  But if I could say anything that was the highlight, it was when I made the Homecoming Court.  And I never imagined that I would have been one of the five chosen to be a Homecoming Queen.  I didn't win, but I was runner-up.  (Laughter).  So, it didn't feel so great then, but you know, I can laugh about it now.   And also when I was in high school, I ran... I was in the Miss Annapolis pageant.  Actually, no, it was right after high school--just my first year into college I was in the Miss Annapolis pageant.  I'd gotten on this pageant track somehow.  And I was in the Miss Annapolis and then Miss Universe, and a couple of other things.  I was, did all the debutante stuff.  My aunt really pushed me to get involved in all the girly stuff, like the cabarets.  We went to kiddy balls every year--my cousin, Melissa and I and my sister, Melissa and I.  So, every year we, you know, we would dress up and have gowns made, and we'd go to the Kiddy Cabaret at the Catholic Church.  I was always in cotillions; I was always involved in little Tom weddings, Tom Thumb weddings.  We did a lot of stuff like that as kids growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were in these pageants, what was your talent?  I know everybody has to have a talent.  What would you do?  Did you sing or dance?
Speaker 2: My talent was singing.  And I, I sang in the church all my life from as long as I can remember, and I still do.  In fact every time I preach, I can't preach without opening up with some sort of song, because it calms me down. (Laughter).  Because it gets a little nervous doing that sometimes.
Story_ID: 90810
Speaker 1: Now, did you...  When did, did you start preaching as a teenager, or was it later?
Speaker 2: No, it was later, actually.  I always sort of felt that there was something in terms of me being different from most of the kids, in terms of my interest in religion.  My grandmother was a heavy Christian woman, God-fearing woman.  And because my grandmother babysat me--because my mom was working as a nurse, and she worked the graveyard shift--I spent a lot of time with my grandmother.  And my grandmother went to Thursday prayer meeting religiously, never missed a Thursday.  And I would drag along with her. And at that time, I was about two or three years old.  And I can remember every Thursday being with her, holding on to her little skirt-tail walking into the church and watching them praise the Lord and, you know, read the scripture, etc., etc.
Story_ID: 90811
Speaker 1: You said earlier that you moved away from home when you were fifteen?  You want to talk about that, and tell us what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I just, it wasn't so much that I was a rebellious teen.  I think that there were just a series of things that I felt the need to remove myself from, in terms of how I got along or didn't get along with my stepfather at the time.  And I, and my being concerned for my mother's happiness, and my own happiness, I thought it was best that I move in with a relative, and I did.  And so I moved in with a cousin who really served as a mother to me--and not that my mother didn't continue being a mother to me--but I have a lot of women who have played as mothers in my life to me, and who are very, very special that I'd love to talk about.  But Holly, in particular, we have a song that we sing to each other (Laughter) every time we see each other.  And it makes my eyes well up every time I think about it.  We always, we always sing, "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.  You make me happy when skies are grey."  And we sing that to each other every time, you know, we get together.  Because you know, we developed a bond with each other, and it was a very special bond.  And it's not that she took, you know, my mother away from me or took me away from my mother, but I think she added some things that I needed when I needed it the most.
Story_ID: 90812
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, well, when you were on the verge of graduation from high school, what did, did you have any career plans?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the time I knew I was going to go into the television industry.  And so, I was very focused on going into communications, and I did do that.  And after college, I ended up with--
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.  Let's go to college first.  (Laughter).  Can we, what college did you attend?
Speaker 2: I started out at a community college, because as I mentioned earlier... Anne Arundel Community College.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Anne, A-N-N-E...
Speaker 1: A-N-N-E...
Speaker 2: Arundel, A-R-U-N-D-E-L.
Speaker 1: A-R-U-N-D-E-L.  Is that two words?
Speaker 2: Anne Arundel, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That's a county in Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Anna Arundel--
Speaker 2: Community college.
Speaker 1: Okay, Community College.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you like that?  And how did you do there?
Speaker 2: It was, when I was going there, it was one of the top community colleges in the country in terms of academics.  So, it was a great opportunity for me because I needed to--it was a kick in the tooth for me, because I had these grandiose plans of going off to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And because I had gotten myself into a little problem with grade point average, I was forced to do that.  And so it was a lesson learned for me, and it taught me discipline.  Because you know, when you're in high school, you know, you've got this safety net of teachers.  But when you're in college, it's a different world; you're sort of on your own to do your own thing.  And you're paying for the tuition, and so you have a choice of making it or not making it.  And it's really all left up to you and your ability to and your willingness to do so.  So, by the time I got into this community college, I was determined that I wasn't going to screw that up like I did high school.  So, but then you know, I was working full time and going there full time, and it was a little rough.  But I got through there and finished and then went on to a four-year college.
Story_ID: 90813
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I left there and went to Catholic University--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of America.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you wind up in the Catholic University of America [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You're a Baptist... a Baptist minister at the present time, right?
Speaker 2: My family on my dad's [Darryl Pierre] side are staunch Catholics.  (Laughter).  So it's funny, because everybody on my father's side are Catholics, and everybody on my mom's [Florence Weens Justine] side are Baptist.  So, it was a transition for me.  All my brothers... because I do have four other brothers... that reside in New Orleans... there are three now... one is now deceased, all grew up in Catholic schools as well.  So, whenever we visited New Orleans, I was always exposed to Catholicism, because we went to Mass whenever we went there.  So--
Speaker 1: So, your father stays a part of your life, you know?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Growing up and you talked about going to Mardi Gras and New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, he moved back to New Orleans?
Speaker 2: No.  Well--
Speaker 1: He didn't?
Speaker 2: My stepfather, as I said, was from New Orleans.  And he was the Catholic influence as well.  He was definitely the Creole influence in terms of what we ate in our household, because we grew up on Creole food.  And--
Speaker 1: That's right, because he and your father were the same town--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in Louisiana.
Speaker 2: That's right, they were both from New Orleans.  And although my--you know, my mother met them here in Maryland, it was just ironic that the two of them ended up being from the same place, eight years apart.  So--
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  So, what was American... Catholic--
Speaker 2: Catholic University?
Speaker 1: --University like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, it was a great experience.  I... in all my classes I was the only African-American.  But, you know, it was in terms of learning that side of religion as well as interacting and engaging in a diverse culture of people, because it's a melting pot there in terms of the diverse group of people that go there.  There are a number of East Indian, and Jewish.  And I had some, at Catholic University I had some Jewish people in my classes.  So, it was rather interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers there that stand out?
Speaker 2: There was one teacher, and I cannot... I cannot remember the professor's name.  But it was a pre-law class that I took.  And I cannot remember her name.
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: My major was actually communications, and my minor was pre-law.  Because the, my goal was just to go to law school after that.  And somehow the Lord said, "That's not what I've called you to do," and I ended up starting at Howard University School of Divinity with my master's degree in religion.
Story_ID: 90814
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, let me backtrack a minute.  When did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982].  Okay, so it's now like four years later, '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay, '87 [1987], okay, '87.  And you're at Howard University Divinity School?
Speaker 2: Well, I took a break, actually.  And I started at Howard Divinity School, well, much later.  I was called into the ministry I'd say in 19... well, when I first knew I was called and didn't receive it, was in 1995.  But when I finally answered the call, it was 1999, which is when I started at Howard School of Divinity.
Speaker 1: In '99 [1999], okay, alright.  Okay, so there's a work experience, I think between--
Speaker 2: A major work experience.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what do you do right after... you didn't go to Howard well... right after--
Speaker 2: I started, I started at Fox.  No, let me go back and backtrack.  I started at the NRA (Laughter)--
Speaker 1: The National Rifle Association?
Speaker 2: I had no idea of where I was working.  I worked there for three weeks, and realized, "Oh my God, what am I doing?"  It was my first job, you know, out of school.  And it was my first job in Washington [D.C.], and that was so cool for me.  I, you know, my first job in D.C.  And it was a secretarial job.  I had no idea what the NRA was at that time.  (Laughter).  And three weeks into it, I was like, I don't think this is the place for me.  And I began interviewing.  And I said, well, you know, what am I doing here?  I... you know, the whole purpose for schooling was to go into journalism.  And for me, because I worked full-time, I didn't have time to do any internships to get any experience, because I was working full-time.
Story_ID: 90815
Speaker 1: So, I got an opportunity to work at Gannett Company.  Gannett, as you may know, owned at that time, and I think they still do, USA Today Newspaper.  So, I was working in the office of the Chair as a receptionist, in Al Newhart's office.  And I worked there for about a year, and then the show, "USA Today" TV show came into play.  And I'd expressed an interest in wanting to work for the show.  And Mr. Newhart was kind enough to facilitate an interview for me with the producers, Steve Freeman... Steve, what was Steve's last name?  Steve Freeland, I believe is the last name.  At any rate, he provided an opportunity for me to be interviewed.  But I got to tell you, during my receptionist time at Gannett I had a phenomenal time.  This wasn't just your ordinary receptionist job.  I had an opportunity to fly on the company's corporate jet to the World Series once.  And it was, it was a great stepping stone from, from moving from being in a realm that I really had no interest in.  But I knew that I needed to do something and place myself somewhere where I can get some exposure.  And what better place to do that than Gannett?  And so, it was the best thing that could have ever happened to me, because here I was in the office of the Chair where everybody who's anybody would come in and out of that building.  And so, when I was able to get the opportunity to interview with USA Today TV show, the rest was sort of history.  I got that show, and I was hired as a production assistant.  And I was the production assistant to Edie Magnus and Robin [Young] at the time.  Robin... I can't remember Robin's last name.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: At any rate, so I worked for the show.  And as you know, it was a short-lived show.  Or, you may know.  We lasted I guess about... maybe eighteen months.  It was a great run.  I think if anything, people at that time were not ready for "info-tainment," and that's what that show was.  It was, it was, it wasn't hard enough news.  We were still used to the "Sixty Minutes" of the world.  And the magazine shows really hadn't come into play very strong as they are now, like Entertainment Tonight.  Entertainment Tonight didn't have nearly the graphics that they do now.  We came up with flashy graphics, great stories, but they were short tidbit stories, and people just weren't ready for that kind of news at that time.  So, just after Thanksgiving, we were all basically told that we were being laid off, and that our last day was January 1.  And so, it was back to a drawing board again.
Story_ID: 90816
Speaker 1: I had an opportunity to go and work for Fox, Channel 5.  So, I was a production assistant there and did chyron graphics.  And I also had an opportunity later on to do some writing and some film producing, and did a little bit of production assistant work in terms of...producer work...in terms of writing small sound bites, etc. etc.  And that was during the Desert Storm time when I was at Fox.  And I remember also monitoring the video feeds that would come in from Desert Storm.  And then I decided, well, I want to do some more here.  And so, I started working three jobs at one time.  (Laughter).  So, I was working at Fox Morning News. I was the video screener for America's Most Wanted, because I did production work and video screening for them.  And I was working at Sports News Network.  Because when USA Today became defunct, Sports News Network became the first 24-hour sports channel, and they used those same facilities that the USA Today studio was in.  And so, I was freelancing there.  And then I had a fourth job.  (Laughter).  I was working, I was working as a statistician for the Bullets.  They were then called the Bullets; they're now called the Wizards.  But I was then working as a stat person at the conference table with the announcers.
Speaker 2: What kind of connections did you have to have, to get all these jobs?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  You know, you meet one person and then they look out for you with the next person.  You know, TV, it's a very incestuous environment in terms of television, the television industry.  Because the one thing I love about it is that we look out for each other.  It's like a family there.  And if you, you know, if you're good and you're willing to work hard, people will pass your name along and provide opportunities for you.  And so, I never lacked a job when I was working in television.  (Laughter).  But then one day I woke up and it was like, "What am I doing?  I'm working four jobs, and it's killing me.  And I'm twenty-five years old and I have no social life."  And so one day I just woke up and said, "I don't feel like working anymore."  And I had some penny stocks saved up, and I was living in a, at that time a somewhat expensive apartment.  It was almost eight hundred dollars a month, and I was twenty-five.  And so, I cashed in on my penny stocks.  I paid off all my bills, quit all my jobs, with the exception of one.  I worked two days a week, and I played tennis the rest of the week.  (Laughter).  And I did it for six months and it was great, because I needed it.  I was so, I was burned out from working four jobs.  And even though I was only twenty-five, I was really tired.  And so I took my money, I paid off my bills, I paid up my rent for six months, and I just had fun.  And it was great.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what year is this?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh.  This was, this would have been in '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992]?
Speaker 1: Yes, '92 [1992].
Story_ID: 90817
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, after your hiatus--
Speaker 2: After my purse, my pocketbook started talking to me, is what happened.  (Laughter).  I wasn't ready to go back to work.  And you know, you get in this mindset of I'm not going to take, you know, just any job, because I've been accustomed to these union $200 an hour gigs.  And all of a sudden you realize there's no more money left in the bank.  And so, I had a reality check.  And I had to force myself to do some things I didn't want to do in terms of jobs.  And I took a, almost minimum wage job, but it was still in the television industry.  It was at a time when News Channel 8 came into play.  And Fox had left the door open for me and said, "If you want to come back, you can always come back," and I did.  So I ended up going back to Fox and working full-time.  And then News Channel 8 came into play.  And they were the first 24-hour local news channel.  And so, I decided that I was going to quit Fox and go over to News Channel 8, because I figured it would afford me some better opportunities in terms of more senior level positions.  Because it was new, and they were looking for people from the ground up to help build this new entity.  And so, I went over to News Channel 8 as a production assistant and worked there for a couple of years and ended up doing some writing there, some field producing there, and even got an opportunity to do weather a few times.  And I really thought at that time I would go into becoming the first black weather woman in this town of Washington, D.C.  That was my goal at that time.  But that sort of fell off the wagon when I started getting really involved in politics.
Story_ID: 90818
Speaker 1: I had an opportunity to cover the inaugural ball of President [Bill] Clinton.  And I was just so enthralled and excited about all of the things that were happening, in terms of this new person who came out of nowhere and became President of the United States, even amidst all of the issues that he was facing then with the allegations that were taking place then.
Speaker 2: This is '92 [1992], right?
Speaker 1: This is '92 [1992].  But I was impressed with him, because he had a message for the people, and it was for all people.  And I'll never forget going to, we covered the...There were a number of us that they had... they sent off, News Channel 8 sent off, they sent, provided us with gowns, sent us to a hair salon.  And we all split up and went to various balls.  And the minute I saw him, I knew I wanted to work for him.  It was something about his message that made me feel like I was someone, and that I counted.  And so, I'll never forget when someone came to me, it was just by chance.  Someone from the administration came to our studio, and I was assigned to escort them back to the studio to be interviewed by one of the anchors.  And I just boldly said to the woman, "Do you have a communications or a press office?"  And she goes, "Yeah, by chance, yeah, we do."  And I said, "I'd love to find out more about that."  And so she said, "Well, get me your resume."  And I went over to my computer and printed off my resume.  And I gave her my resume there, and then I officially sent her a letter and another resume and told them that I was very much interested in being afforded an opportunity for an interview.  And that was granted.  And so they called me in, I guess, about two months after begging (Laughter) and I had two interviews with two people at the same time.  And really, the rest is history.  You know, most people's stories are that they worked on the campaign trail, etc., etc.  I did a lot of local political stuff in terms of volunteerism and campaign stuff, but never anything on the national level.  And so, never in a million years would I have thought that I would have--this little girl from Annapolis, Maryland--would have been working for the President of the United States.  And it was a very humbling experience for me.
Story_ID: 90819
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in the course of working for President [Bill] Clinton, you went from I guess a communications aide all the way up to Special Assistant to the President on Intergovernmental Affairs.  Can you kind of chronicle that for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?
Speaker 2: I started out... ironically, when I left the station, I was making $17,000 a year.  And I went from $17,000 to $40,000 overnight, because I had the experience. But television, you know, the industry that I was in with the cable station, just wasn't paying the kind of money that I was worth or deserved.  And so, I, my first job was I was in the Office of Personnel Management, and I was a public relations specialist.  And I was also Special Assistant to the Director of Communications.  We, one day the head of the agency needed a speech written, and there was no one to write his speech.  They had, they were going through a transition of speechwriters, and a new one was about to come on.  And I got the opportunity to write his speech for him, and he liked it.  (Laughter).  And so, lo and behold, I began to write speeches for him here and there.  And I started writing speeches, I was the, I was the speechwriter for the Deputy Director on a full-time, along with my other duties.  The other thing that I did while I was there is we started this federal government TV show.  And it was a 90-minute live talk show that I did once every quarter.  Can you imagine doing a 90-minute live talk show?
Speaker 1: Who was on the show?
Speaker 2: We used to have like various secretaries of agencies.  We had Secretary [Robert] Reich on when he was Secretary of Labor.  We had [Federico] Pena on when he was head of the Transportation Department.  We had John Koskinen when he was head of the Office of Management and Budget.  And basically the premise of the show was to highlight issues, federal issues, and things that were related to the federal government.  And our audience was obviously federal employees.  And we had an audience of probably about 40,000 at that time, federal employees.  And now, I believe it's probably grown.  It's still in existence to this day.  And I remember when, the first day we did it, we literally made a news desk out of cardboard.  (Laughter).  And it grew from this cardboard thing to going over to the U.S.D.A. Department television station.  And then from there we ended up at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce studio.  And I was the producer, the writer, the moderator.  I did it all, clearly with the assistance of other people in the office.  But we were sort of a one-man show.  And from there I really wanted to get more into women's issues.  I had volunteered here at the National Council of Negro Women, and had done a lot of other things in terms of volunteerism.  I really wanted to get more into women's issues--women's workers' rights, etc.  And I had the opportunity to go to the Department of Labor where I was Director of Communications for the Women's Bureau.  And we, you know, were there to educate women on their workplace rights.  And as I, the year that I spent there, I really had a passion for women making the transition from welfare to work, and I wanted to go more into public policy as it related to that issue.
Story_ID: 90820
Speaker 1: And then again, divine favor.  I had an opportunity to go over to SBA [The US Small Business Administration] and serve as the Director of the Welfare to Work Initiative.  I started out as the Deputy Director, and then was promoted up to the Director of the Initiative where we had a very aggressive goal that we met in a short amount of time.  The director wanted us to make certain we hired more than 200,000 women off of welfare and into small businesses, and we did that.  It was very rewarding.
Speaker 2: How did you do it?
Speaker 1: What we did was we matched up small businesses, and we advertised to those small businesses, to sort of help break the barriers down and dispel the myths of what a welfare recipient is.  Because, you know, most people thought, well, if she's on welfare she's lazy, she's shiftless, she doesn't want to do anything, she doesn't want to be anything.  And that's a far cry from the truth.  Most women that are on welfare are women who have found themselves just on bad times, hard times.  Many of them come from a situation of abusive men, deadbeat dads, and a number of scenarios that certainly don't depict laziness.  And so what we did was we marketed to the small businesses, and we put together a tool kit to show them what the benefits were in hiring someone off of welfare.  And those folks got excited about those tax credits, and actually they ended up getting a better labor pool than, you know, your regular labor pool of people.  And it was a very rewarding thing for me.
Story_ID: 90821
Speaker 1: I was in the story of the Welfare to Work Initiative--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and how rewarding it was.  I remember we were putting together a videotape to show to businesses... to use as a piece to show businesses the importance of getting involved in the Welfare to Work Initiative, and the benefits of doing so.  And we were interviewing several women had surpassed the odds.  And one woman was Sarian Bouma.  And Sarian became our poster child, because she was a self-made millionaire.
Speaker 2: Can you spell her name for us?
Speaker 1: B-O-U-M-A is the last name.  First name is S-A-R-I-A-N.
Speaker 2: She was, she came from Africa?
Speaker 1: Yes, she was African.  She came from, I think she came from East Africa.  And she came over with a very abusive husband... pregnant... and didn't know a soul in this country, but knew that she had some rights when she got here.  And she packed up her bags one day after she had the baby, took the baby along with her to a shelter, went to the House of Ruth, and the rest is sort of history for her.  She's... now she owns a thriving multi-million dollar business.  It's a cleaning service.  A number of her contracts are defense contracts.  And she, the great thing that I love about her is that she never forgot where she came from, and she began to hire people off the welfare rolls.  In fact, her vice-president would...  When I remember her vice-president working for her company she was cleaning bathrooms.  And Sarian mentored her all the way up to vice-president of her company.  And I remember us interviewing Sarian, and I remember interviewing this one girl, Tamika, who said "People think that we're lazy and we're shiftless.   But don't they understand that there is no raise on welfare.  And so, if they think that we're living high off the hog every year, that's not true."  And it really gave, for me, a different perspective of what I saw, too.  Because it... there were points and times where I felt like, "Well, my tax dollars are going to people who can be out here working just like I am."  And when I got to understand and know some of the people that actually are on the welfare rolls, many of these women don't want to be on it, and they want the dignity of a paycheck just like anybody else.  But there were just circumstances that prevented them from being able to do so.
Story_ID: 90822
Speaker 1: Okay.  Usually the case is that people want to make more money.  And in many instances--correct me if I'm wrong--people can make the same or maybe less working at McDonald's than they can if they're on welfare.  So, what's the incentive to change?
Speaker 2: That's exactly it.  And with the new laws that were created, it made it very difficult in terms of being in the Initiative.  Because one, if you make the transition from welfare to work, eventually you lose your benefits after a year.  You are placed in a position where your subsidized rent that could have cost you twenty-five dollars is now seven hundred dollars.  But yet, you're not making that much, to even pay that kind of money.  Then, you know, when your food vouchers are gone, there's another expense.  For many women who don't have cars and have children that vary in age, there are different busses that these kids have to get on to go to school.  So that takes time out of her morning.  And if she has a job that requires her to be there at seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and she doesn't have a sitter to be able to maintain the kids to get them off to school, it's a very difficult situation.
Speaker 1: So, so, to really assist people who don't have the means, you have to kind of fine-tune what they, what kind of aid they get, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  The needs... you know I think that, you know, people sometimes who make the laws don't live them, in terms of understanding how these people live.  And I've witnessed how they live.  I witnessed how... the embarrassment for them of having to go into a neighborhood where they didn't feel safe, and they didn't feel free to walk up and down the streets, and they didn't feel free to let their kids come out and play, but they had no choice, because it was the best that they could do for their children.  I've seen people make the choice of, if it's just macaroni and cheese with no meat this week.  I remember interviewing a kid and asking him, "What's the most memorable thing you can tell me about your mother?"  And he told me, "The mailbox."  And I said, "Why the mailbox?"  And he said, "Because that's where the check comes.  That's where Mommy sends me to go pick up the check when it comes every month."  And I could not believe that that was the memory that this child had for his mother.  But when you're placed in a situation where you don't have a whole lot of options...  Sure, you can go and give a job off of welfare, but they face a myriad of issues.  Some of these women face dyslexia, ADD, depression, all kinds of things.  When you've been oppressed for so long, you can't help but to be depressed.  And so, before you can just throw someone out there and say, "Go take a job," you've got to deal with the social skills.  You've got to deal with all the other ills that these people have faced for so many years and suppress them.
Story_ID: 90823
Speaker 1: Depression is a big issue in the African-American community, big issue.  But for many of us who grew up knowing God, we're always told, "Oh, there's nothing wrong with you.  Just go and pray about it, and God will supply your needs and you'll be okay."  And that's a big challenge in our community.  And even as a minister, I say that.  Because we as ministers, we're at a point and time where we're psychiatrists, we're doctors, we're lawyers to people, we're mothers, we're fathers; we have to be up on the issue of AIDs and all kinds of diseases.  Because those are the things we face day in and day out with our people.  And so, if you're not trained properly, you can misdirect someone.  And that's why I firmly believe in higher education when it comes to ministry.  Because you have to face so many issues, a myriad of issues with people and problems and situations.  You've got to understand business administration so that you can function the church properly and be a good steward over the finances of the church.  So, ministers have a lot of weight to carry.  And when you think about historically the church has always been the nucleus of the community--it's even more so now.  And we have no resources to do anything with.
Story_ID: 90824
Speaker 1: Now this is off the course we were taking, and kind of got off into religion.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: But are you a member of the National Baptist Convention or the Progressive National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Both?
Speaker 2: My home church is National Baptist.  And another church that I've been associated with for some years is Metropolitan Baptist Church, and they are Progressive Baptist.  Dr. H.B. Hicks is the presiding pastor there, senior pastor.  And so, you know, by virtue of my association with the two, it allowed me to be a part of both organizations.
Speaker 1: They're speaking of merging at some future point again, coming back together.  Is that... do you see that coming?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You know, it would be nice to see it happen.  Because I think that the number of splits that took place between Progressive Baptist, Southern Baptist, National Baptist.  And then you have Bishop Paul Morton's group that is separate from even them in terms of--because there's a mixture of Pentecostal and Baptist all in one.  And so, you've four or five different groups of religions that really aren't separate religions.  They're all one and the same, but I guess from a doctrinal point of view, they're a little different.  Some believe in the laying of hands and the speaking of tongues and the Holy Spirit.  And staunch Baptists don't necessarily believe in all of that.
Speaker 1: And there's one other thing about religion.
Speaker 2: Full Gospel Baptist, that's what it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're at Howard Divinity School, or have been there.  Are you currently taking courses there, or did you finish?
Speaker 2: I did not finish, and I'm back actually this September to finally get it together and close out there.
Speaker 1: Howard Divinity School is the center for a lot of the new discussion of the history of Ancient Africa as it relates to the Bible.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And have you been exposed to any of that?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  I have yet to have Dr. Felder's classes.  Dean Newsome, who is now the new president of Shaw University is, was instrumental in bringing in some of the Ethiopian artifacts that now reside within Howard's School of Divinity.  And they're... we had a tour of them in one of my classes.  I took a class called World Religion, and in that class it gave us an opportunity to do a tour of all these ancient artifacts that were donated to the school.  And it is amazing to see the variations of religions, but yet they're all... they all sort of connect in one way or the other, but yet they're so different.  Even down to the crosses.  If you look at the Jewish cross versus the Christian cross versus the Muslim... and it's all almost the same figure but it's not, in terms of, I guess, the beliefs behind it.  But in my mind, we all still serve one God and one faith.  And you know, everybody else wants to, you know, handle their pieces the way that they want.  But at the end of the day, we all serve one God.
Story_ID: 90825
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, back to the [Bill] Clinton administration.  Now, you were with Welfare to Work?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: And I found myself on fourteen White House task forces.  (Laughter.)  I was over there at meetings quite often because I was on so many different task forces.  And so, an opportunity came up that I had heard about within the White House.  And I thought, "Well, you know, I exceeded my goals here with the Welfare to Work Initiative, and it would be nice to do something within the White House.  And so, I'd heard of an opportunity in the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.  And so, I went to the head of the agency that I was working for at the time, the SBA [Small Business Administration], and I talked to the administrator.  And I said, "Listen, I need your blessings and I need your assistance.  There's a position that I know of in the White House, and I would like for you to help me."  And she did.  And I went on an interview there.  And funny enough, the first time, I was turned down.  Because by the time he interviewed me, he had already sort of made up his mind who he was going to hire.  But as a courtesy, he wanted to interview me anyway, because the administrator had requested that I meet with him, as well as the Deputy Chief of Staff at that time, Maria Echaveste.  And so, he gave me the courtesy interview, and you know, at the end of the interview he said, "I've got to be honest with you.  I'm really making a decision this week, and I've pretty much made up my mind what I want to do or go with."  And I said, "That's fine," I said, you know, "thank you for the opportunity."  Well, he hired the person that was, that he was scheduled to hire.  And ironically enough, the person and I knew each other.  And after the person was hired, he decided that that wasn't what he wanted to do, and he wanted to stay within the agency that he was in.  And he actually went to my boss--well, he wasn't my boss then--and said, "Listen, Zina is the best candidate for the job."  And I have so much to be thankful for in terms of Harold, just because he was such a gentleman and a scholar.  You know, my thing is one man's junk is another man's treasure, and this certainly was a treasure for me to have that opportunity.  And so, I became Special Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs, and that's a commissioned officer position.  So, it's something I get to take with me for the rest of my life, The Honorable Zina Pierre.  I never used it, but you know, I mean if I needed to I could.  (Laughter).  And it was phenomenal.
Story_ID: 90826
Speaker 1: My first three days there, I got a chance to meet the President [Bill Clinton] right off the bat.  I was going to an event that a girlfriend of mine who was my colleague there in the White House--she was the liaison to all the African-American community.  And I was the liaison to all the mayors and county officials on behalf of the President.  And--
Speaker 2: They actually have a liaison to the African-American community?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: In general, across the country?
Speaker 1: Yes.  She was the person, the point person, for any African-Americans.
Speaker 2: Um, that's interesting in terms of how a president, Do most presidents do it, do it like that?
Speaker 1: Yes, they do.  I mean, they have their point people, but she specifically, you know, her area of work was specifically for African-Americans.  I mean, in previous administrations they may have had key black people that did, you know, that liaison thing.  But this was a formal position within the Office of Public Liaison.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And your job was to deal with the mayors of cities and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --other city governments--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --city governments naturally that-
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --had a concern of the President.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Things that the President should... could deal with?
Speaker 1: That's right.  And county officials.
Speaker 2: County officials.
Speaker 1: And so, I... my third day on the job, we went to an event that the President was speaking at.  It was her mother's event for NAFEO [National Association for Equal Employment].  And she asked me if I wanted to ride over with her in the motorcade.  (Laughter).  I said, "Oh, my God, I've been here three days and I'm riding in the motorcade."  So, we get over to the event.  And after everything is over with, she introduces me to him.  And you know, and so I was telling him, you know, I was in IGA [Intergovernmental Affairs].  And he said, "Yes, this is great.  We're so glad to have you here."  So we're on our way out to go get back into the motorcade, and he turns around and he goes, "Jenai and Zina, come on, you can ride in the car with me."  (Laughter).  And so, here we are riding in the car with the President of the United States, my third day on the job.  It was like riding with Moses as he parted the Red Sea.  (Laughter).  I mean, because you're literally driving down the road and, you know, of course, everything's blocked off for him, you know, throughout the whole path.
Speaker 2: No stoplights ahead?
Speaker 1: No stoplights.  And so, you know, we're having this conversation, and he's doing his presidential wave to people as we're going by.  And he gave us a black history lesson like I've never heard before.
Speaker 2: A black history lesson?
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was amazing, and it was during Black History Month when he spoke at NAFEO, it was their annual conference.  And he started to talk about, reminisce about his memories of being here during the riots when the houses were being burned down here in D.C.  And he remembered the Stokely Carmichael days, and he talked about all that stuff.  And we were just in awe of his history of our people.  And I remember him constantly saying during his campaign that he wanted a cabinet that, an administration that looks like America.  And he did.  I got to tell you, our cabinet and the White House staff were very diverse.  He had four African-American men who served as Assistants to the President... four.  He had one African-American woman who was an Assistant to the President.  He had one African... one Hispanic woman who was Assistant to the President, one Hispanic male was Assistant to the President.  And myself, I was Special Assistant to the President.  There were several of us, as African-Americans.
Speaker 2: How many assistants does he have altogether?
Speaker 1: Oh, boy.  I would say between Special Assistants and Assistants to the President, at least a hundred that cover various departments, if not more.  Because you've got different departments.  You've got political, which [HM] Minyon Moore headed up.  You had the Office of Public Liaison, which [HM] Alexis Herman started, and then it was passed on to Minyon and then passed on to [HM] Ben Johnson.  Mickey Ibarra, who was my boss, was head of Intergovernmental Affairs.  And the list goes on.  Maria Echaveste was Deputy Chief of Staff.
Story_ID: 90827
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now the last... well now from 1997 on, the Clinton Administration was at war, basically with the Monica Lewinsky thing.  And there were other things going on in government too.  But that, that's so unique in the history of the country--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that kind of attention given to the private activities of a president.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean they made that public to the point of having an impeachment hearing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was... were you... I mean what...  Did you play any role in trying to, you know--well, you know, what did the staff have to do, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, I was not directly in the White House, I was at SBA [Small Business Administration].  And I remember going to one of the impeachment hearings.  You know, when they talk about African-Americans--you know, we have such a giving spirit that we, you know, just want to automatically erase everything he did and forgive.  And you know, part of that is true, and part of that is not true.  I think what drove me was the compassion.  Was I hurt?  Sure, I was hurt.  Who wasn't hurt?  He was hurting.  It was a very difficult time for everyone.  And I remembered the feeling that I got from some of the career people and other fellow Republicans who, it was almost like, "Shame on you to be working for someone like him."  You know, and it was a really time in terms of just walking around.  Because you, he has done so much good for this country, so much good.  And how dare you take all those things and mesh them into one, and try to create him out of a monster.  Did he have faults?  We have all faults.  And I think the challenge for me was I saw all the good things that had taken place--the Welfare to Work Initiative, the Foster Care Initiative, the Empowerment Zone initiatives.  All these things brought opportunities for people to have a safe, freer, cleaner, more productive, more viable environment to live in and feel good about themselves as Americans.  He provided that.  I don't normally talk about that whole era, because I just, I think it's personal, and only God judges.  I had an opportunity to be in his presence on a number of occasions, and I happen to know that he's a good man with a big heart, and he cares about people.  We all fall short.
Story_ID: 90828
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you have any observations about any of the other White House staff?  Are there any individuals that come to mind that are more remarkable or exceptional, as far as you're concerned?
Speaker 2: One of my number one safety nets was [HM] Minyon Moore.  And at that time she was head of the political shop.
Speaker 1: Is she a black woman?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  She went on to be the CEO of the DNC [Democratic National Committee].  And she's now in the private sector with a local firm here in Washington, D.C.  But Minyon... and she came from the [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson] era; she grew up in the ranks of Rainbow PUSH.  And so, she understood that it wasn't an easy environment to work in, particularly, you know, if you're African-American.  And she protected me.  She always made certain that I was included on things.  She always made certain that, she was hard on me... she used to beat my behind.  She used to be really tough on me.  (Laughter).  And when I would go whining to her, she would, you know, shut me up and say, "Just go do what you need to do, and grin and bear it, and deal with it, because life isn't easy."  And I learned a lot from her, I really did.  And the outside influence was [HM] Dr. Dorothy Height, who has been everything to me.  She is the epitome of volunteerism, and that's where I learned it from, between she and my grandmother.  And she made certain from the outside that I was always protected.  And [HM] Alexis Herman was also another one who, when folks were dragging on my paperwork when I was over at the Labor Department, it was Alexis that called the White House and said, "Hey, what's going on with her stuff?  Get it through, and let's move on."  And so I had a lot of good, powerful, strong women around me that had always made certain that they kept me lifted.  And Barbara Skinner, [HM] Dr. Barbara [Williams] Skinner, was my prayer warrior when I was crying and upset and struggling, and trying to figure out how to deal with the diversity and the adversity in there.  She was my prayer warrior who kept me sane.  (Laughter).  Because it was a very volatile environment.  I mean, it's a lot of competition, and everybody wants to be at the top.  And so, you know, you come in there and you think you're just going to do your little piece and stay out of everybody's way, and it doesn't work that way.
Speaker 1: Who was the sharpest person that you met at the White House within the administration?
Speaker 2: Within the administration?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Boy, there are so many good people.  I feel almost afraid to even name one person.  (Laughter).  I'd say, um, there's so many good people; it's a hard one.  But--
Speaker 1: How about a few, well, a few.
Speaker 2: If I could name a few?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: If I could name a few, I would say [HM] Alexis Herman; I would say Secretary Robert Reich, very bright man, former Secretary of Labor; and Alexis, former Secretary of Labor.  She came behind Secretary Reich.  The, the one that I... in terms of the most mentoring one, was Jim King.  He was head of the Office of Personnel Management at that time--very nurturing, a gentleman who really took me under his wings.  And one of the--two of the people that I was very impressed with... I was very impressed with Karen Tramontano.
Story_ID: 90829
Speaker 1: Now, how did you feel in 2000 when it was all over, you know?  Did you, were you hopeful that Al Gore was going to win?
Speaker 2: I was, I was really hopeful that he would have won.  And I would stand behind him any day.  And I know that a lot of people would say, "Oh, that's a crazy statement."  But when you get a chance to meet someone personally and get to know them and be around them a little bit, you see a little deeper than what folks see from television and from sound bites and from the newspaper.  And although I didn't have a "personal, personal" relationship with him, I have had several opportunities to be in his company and really get to talk with him about his goals and what he saw himself doing in terms of this presidency.  And he has a lot of compassion.
Speaker 1: I think that, you know, most of the American voters thought so, too, because they voted for him.  They thought he was, although another president was selected, that the majority of the popular vote went to Al Gore.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, you're not alone in thinking that he had something going.  But, so, how did you feel about that?  I mean, after the election?
Speaker 2: It was a very painful... I'll never forget.  There were two things that were very painful in terms of the transition from that administration.  January 19th was very painful... when we left the White House.  It was our last day in the White House, and all of us were in the room returning our badges and all of our belongings, and just reminiscing and thinking back on all the great initiatives and the accomplishments that now will be a distant memory.  Because the new administration was going to come in, and they were going to want to do it their way and how they saw fit to create programs and initiatives, as is par for the course in any new administration.  And it was sad to see some of those things that you saw work and make a difference just go.
Story_ID: 90830
Speaker 1: Now, you were talking about January 19th, I think it was.
Speaker 2: January 19th.
Speaker 1: Of 2001, the last day.
Speaker 2: The last day.
Speaker 1: You're walking out--
Speaker 2: In the White House, yes.  And it was a, it was a cold, rainy day.  The rain was pouring outside.  And we were, had boxes.  I had boxes anyway, and stuff that I had to move out of my office.  And it was a crazy week anyway, because we were closing out, and we had to archive all our stuff and make certain that everything was where it needed to be.  And it was just a very sad day.  Because you... all of a sudden you begin to reflect on all those things that... those things that you worked on that made a difference--that you saw, you know, at the grass roots level but with government results.  And it was sad to walk away from all those things that you knew had ultimately empowered people to live a better quality of life.  And you know, the uncertainty of not knowing if any of that was going to change or if it was going to stay, or what was going to happen to all those initiatives that had done so much for the least of these.
Speaker 1: And I guess the prospects weren't bright, considering the Republican administration's going to come in, and you have a Republican Senate and a Republican House.  And the chance of those programs staying intact was pretty slim.
Speaker 2: It was.  And it was a big concern to a lot of us who live every day... and seeing the impact of some of those things.  I see the impact of prescription drugs in my own family with my 74-year old aunt, who pays an enormous amount of money every month for prescription drugs.  I see the Welfare to Work, and the difference that it made for some people who have made that transition.  I saw the difference in the empowerment zones, and how it afforded opportunities for more business creation, and therefore more job creation.  So, I saw all those things.
Speaker 1: Are any of those initiatives still in place?
Speaker 2: No.  The Welfare to Work Initiative, I haven't heard anything really on it.  I mean the Faith-Based Initiative, in my mind, has sort of taken its place so to speak in terms of number of importance.  The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Initiatives I think have phased out.  Haven't they, Lynda?  They have not?  How many... I'm sorry.  How long do they have to stay in?
Speaker 1: [Off-camera response]:  Another round.
Speaker 2: Another round?  Which is how many years?
Speaker 1: [Off-camera response]:  I'm not sure how...  They restructured it.  I think it's another round of community services.
Speaker 2: But, like the community block grants, they're gone?
Speaker 1: [Off-camera response]:  I know they're now... they're mostly tax--
Speaker 2: Tax incentive stuff, tax credits.
Speaker 1: So, things have changed and changed considerably.
Story_ID: 90831
Speaker 1: But was there, was there a moment when President [Bill] Clinton gathered everyone together?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Towards the end he was doing a lot of different things.  What a generous guy he was.  It seemed like every week we were getting different things in the mail.  He was beginning to go through all his memorabilia and stuff that he had collected over the years, and he started doling them out to staffers.  And one of the things that I got, it was actually pretty funny.  It was a, someone had... it was a videotape.  Where he got if from... I don't know if someone had sent it to him or not.  But it was a videotape of a man touring the Bible through Israel.  And he knew that I was a Reverend, and thought that it would be a nice gesture to give to me.  And so, in the inner-office mail I get this videotape.  And it has on the outside, "To Zina, from POTUS."  And I was like, "To Zina from POTUS? [President of the United States] I know the President didn't give me this video."  (Laughter).  And so, I thought it was hilarious, and I thought maybe someone had done it as a gag gift.  And when I called Betty Currie, she said, "Yes, indeed, he did ask me to give that to you."  So, that was very special, that he would even think that far enough to say, "Send this over to her."  And he did that, I'm sure for a number of people.  One of the other things that I got, I mean we got so many. He was very giving.  He wrote everyone a Letter of Commendation, thanking us for our tenure within his administration.  And he personalized it and he talked to...You know, he said in the letter how he appreciated my work with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and my work with... serving as a minister and reaching out to other ministers around the country.  And I remember him sending a piece of an ivory plant.  He had a beautiful ivory plant on his fireplace mantle in the Oval Office.  And apparently, I don't know whose gesture it was--if it was his or someone in the office--but they snipped pieces of this plant, and re-planted them in small little planters and divvied it up to certain staffers.  And I still have my plant to this day.  (Laughter).  And so, what was three leaves when I got it, it's now a huge plant that now sits on my fireplace mantle.  So he was very kind in, you know, making certain that we all got letters that we needed... memorabilia to remember our time in the White House.  It was, it was very special.  We got together and we all videotaped a message to him--all the various offices and the staffers.  We put a message together and sent it, you know, to him to let him know how much we care about him and how much we'll miss him.  And it was a very special time.  The most special time for me that I can remember with him was in November during the elections, and we were going to black churches to visit.  And I, myself, [HM] Minyon Moore and Tanya Lombard led the delegation of people from the White House, and we all went with him and [HM] Terry Edmonds to the various black churches.  We went to Shiloh and we went to Alfred Street Baptist Church in Virginia.  And he was kind enough to mention me in his speech, that he had a minister on staff.  And I thought that was so special.  And so, when we were closing out the day... and there's a picture, that picture behind you reflects it.  I'm standing there with the Bible in my hand.  We were just coming from church.  And when we went to go get in the motorcade, Terry Edmonds, who was his chief speechwriter, yells over and says, "Zina, the President would like to see you."  And so, I walk over and he invited me to come back in the car with him with Minyon and with Terry.  And we talked about life after the White House, and we talked about legacy, and we talked about religion.  And it was a great, it was great moment that I'll never forget, I'll always cherish.
Story_ID: 90832
Speaker 1: Okay.  After the White House, you became CEO of the Washington Linkage Group?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is that?  And what exactly do you do there?
Speaker 2: We, we are a full service lobbying firm, and we also do strategic consulting and media relations.  We represent several major cities... Baltimore.  We represent Philadelphia, Rivera Beach, Florida... Denver Health.  We also have in the past represented Prince George's County, and hopefully we will soon again...  Anne Arundel County, which is where my hometown is.  We have worked for the ACLU [American Civil Liberties.  We are now currently doing some work for the National Association of Black Accountants.  And our main contract, one of the main contracts, is the National Conference of Black Mayors.  We service their Washington office for them.  Then we have some other smaller contracts as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And all the while you're working on the administrative team, you're working on your Master's of Divinity?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 90833
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I think the biggest concern is the lack of a holistic agenda for our community.  You hear it in the political arena, you hear it in the social arena, you hear it in the civil arena--that there's no black agenda.  And that is a big concern because there's no one message, there's no one leader.  [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson] in the past has primarily been the spokesperson, or the leader, if you will.  And through some unfortunate series of events--and you know, I still regard him in the highest esteem and still look upon him as a leader, and he is a leader.  But there is this feeling amongst particularly the middle-aged--my age group of African-Americans who are middle class--who can buy our own homes and buy our own cars and go on vacations and live a halfway decent life--we're looking for something and someplace to rest our support.  And while there are different entities that we do that in--I know that I do, with the National Council of Negro Women, with the National Youth Connection, with the Urban League, etc.  But when you talk about it, or you speak about it from a holistic perspective, there are some challenges.
Story_ID: 90834
Speaker 1: Okay. When you look at--back over the things that you've done so far, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: At one point, I would say yes.  But at this point, I'd say no.  It's been... I'm a very strategic thinker.  And everything I do, I do for a reason more often than not.  I write in my diary.  And every job that I've ever had thus far are jobs that I prayed for, and that I wrote down in my diary and asked God for.  And I map out the timing of everything that I do, I try to anyway.  And everything is in God's time, yes.  But he does require that we be movers and doers of the Word.  And that we, you know, be strategic in our thinking and honest in our following of him.  And so, I've always been one to just jump out there and try things.  People thought I was crazy when I started this company.  I didn't have anything.  All I had was some money in my 401-K plan.  I didn't have a contract.  I had office space.  Thank God for small miracles.  And I cashed in on my 401-k and closed my eyes, and said I'm going to jump out there and see what happens.  And fortunately, because I had built so many good relationships within the White House with these mayors, they knew of my work.  They knew of my integrity, so it wasn't questionable for them.  And when I went to them, many of them were forthright in providing an opportunity for contracts.  [HM] Mayor Wellington Webb of Denver, Colorado has been my guardian angel since I started this business.  And he's always made certain that I'm taken care of and that, you know, there are opportunities for me to interact with the right people.  And he gave me my first, and one of my second contracts with my company.  So, I have a lot of admiration for him.
Story_ID: 90835
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on the things that you've done so far--and I realize that you're really very young--what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy, wow.  In the Book of Mark, the 8th Chapter, 31st, 34th Verse, Jesus was telling the disciples that he was preparing himself for death.  And none of them wanted to believe this.  And so they all were sort of arguing between each other about, well, who was going to take over his legacy and who was going to come behind him and pick up the mantra, or the torch, and be able to do all those miraculous things that he did.  And he turned to them, and he said, "If anyone should come after me, they must first pick up their cross, deny themselves, and follow me."  And that is really the life that I live--that I, you know, I'm picking up the cross right now and I bear the cross for a lot of people who can't bear it themselves, that can't do the things that they would like to do.  I try to be there for them.  I mentor a lot of people.  I bring a lot of people into this company, and some with no experience, trying to mentor them.  I bring interns in every summer.  I bring interns in all during the year.  And so, I'm a firm believer in picking up the cross and bearing the cross for the least of these.  That's my ministry.  And denying yourself... you... obedience is better than sacrifice.  And so I've always, you know, denied myself in many ways to make certain that others had... or were able to do and receive... and following the footsteps of Jesus, trying to do the right thing by people, and trying to live a life according to his purpose and not my own.  And I have found that the more I do and give to others, it comes back immeasurably.  And when people look at me and say, "Well, why are you doing it this way?   Why are you continuing to have these people that don't really serve your purpose, that don't really do the things that you need?"  And I look a little deeper and say that these people need right now, and that my needs aren't always in front of theirs.  But the important thing is that you do what you need to do until you get where you want to go.  And so, my life has been a life of labor--of doing and giving and sharing, and I've been able to get a lot of that back.  And it's come back two-fold, ten-fold, because I believe in giving and sharing.  My grandmother taught me that.  And she always said to never worry about tomorrow, that God always makes a way out of no way for you.  And the important thing is that you try to make a way for someone else.  And when you step outside of yourself and your own worries and provide an opportunity for someone else, you'll be amazed at what God will do for you in the interim.  And so, I just want to make certain that as I live on this earth that my labor is not in vain, and that all that I do is for an end goal of making certain that people are saved... that people know God... that people have an opportunity for a good quality... a decent quality of life.  That's why I want to run for Mayor, because I want to make certain that I can go back to my hometown and give and do and serve as best I can to my people.  I see the needs there, I know what the needs are, and I want to be inclusive.  I don't want to be the first black mayor.  I just want to be a mayor, and that's what I intend to do.  Because it's about servant-hood, and my life revolves around serving.

Speaker 1: Okay, we're ready.  Tell us about this photo, please.
Speaker 2: This picture you see here is [HM] Dr. Dorothy Irene Height, to the right in the purple.  And she is the matriarch of the Civil Rights community, and she's Chair of the National Council of Negro Women where I serve on the executive board.  And on the other side is [HM] Susan Taylor, who as so many people know.  And I believe she is one of the HistoryMakers as well.  Susan is editor-in-chief of Essence Magazine, a very good friend, dear friend.  And these two women have just, you know, separately been such an influence in my life.  They both have kindred spirits, they both are very caring people.  And we were at a birthday party that was, that Dr. Height was the honoree of in that photo.
Speaker 1: And about what year is this?
Speaker 2: This was in 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a photo where I was greeting Vice President Al Gore.  It was his, it was in 1993.  And he was just launching the Heroes of Reinvention Award, but also the Hammer Awards Initiative, where they were doing all kinds of heroes of reinvention where they were looking at federal agencies who were doing good things and doing it at less cost.  And so, but in the picture is Janice Lachance to the left of me in the purple.  And to the right of me was the Clinton librarian, who worked in the White House.  And we were greeting Mr. Gore as he was coming in the room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is definitely a HistoryMakers photograph here, and it's one of my favorites.  It was when President [Bill] Clinton first came into office.  And he met with a number of black women leaders.  And in the picture if I start from the right, far right, the first person you see is Maggie Williams who at that time was Chief-of-Staff to now Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.  And next to her is, as you all know, [HM] Maya Angelou, Dr. Maya Angelou, who's a well-known poet and author of numerous books.  And next to her is former Secretary, [HM] Alexis Herman, who was then head of Public Liaison in the White House.  And to the left of, or staged right of President Clinton, former President Clinton, is [HM] Dr. Dorothy Height from the National Council of Negro Women.  And to her in the red is Dr. C. Delores Tucker, who is Chair and Founder of the National Women's Political Caucus.  And next to her is former Mayor of Arkansas who worked in the DNC, who works in the DNC, as one of the vice-chairs, Lottie Shackelford.  And next to her, I believe that is[HM] Minyon Moore who is, was then Assistant to the President in the Political Affairs job.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: That's me in the right corner, in the pink jacket.  And that's when I was moderator of this federal government TV show for the Office of Personnel Management.  And it was a satellite broadcast.  We downlinked to about 40,000 federal employees around the country.  And we were in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce studios.
Speaker 2: About what year was this?
Speaker 1: This was in 1997.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This picture was in 1993, that's got glare on it, too.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This picture was when I was sworn into the administration.  And Judge Johnson to my stage left was the judge who swore me in to serve as Special Assistant to the Director at the time.  And to the other side of me is Director Jim King.  He was head of the Office of Personnel Management.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is my grandmother in New Orleans.  She's actually not my maternal or paternal grandmother.  She was my stepfather's mother, who I came to know as Grandma.  And she was in her, in a fashion show for her 75th birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Papa is what we endearingly called him.  And he was celebrating his 100th birthday in this photo in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: This was in 19... oh, 1998.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a photo of... we were in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The President had started this Digital Divide tour... President Clinton had started a Digital Divide tour. And [HM] Reverend [Jesse]Jackson, as you can see in the dead center, was waving to the audience.  And I was over in the far right, with the cool shades on, (Laughter) trying to stay out of the sun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't believe I put that in there.  That's Socks, the cat (Laughter) sitting on the South Lawn.  And there's his paw print for signature.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of the legendary civil rights leaders, Hosea Williams, several months before his death.  I was in Atlanta [Georgia].  I was the keynote speaker at the National Youth Connection, and they were honoring him there.  And I had an opportunity to chat with him and get a little civil rights history lesson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My home church is called First Baptist of Annapolis.  And this one in Abuja, Nigeria was called First Baptist Church of Abuja.  And this photograph was taken during my trip with the President to Abuja immediately after the new presidency of Obasanjo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of... when the TV show that I was doing, the federal government TV show, we received a Hero's Reinvention Award from Vice President [Al] Gore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year?
Speaker 2: In 1994.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: An award that we received, the Bravo Award, we received from Secretary [Robert] Reich in the Women's Bureau Office.  We actually that year did pretty well.  We received about four Bravo awards and two Secretary Achievement awards that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This photo was taken in the White House in what they call the Map Room.  And as you notice, we all are on phones there.  To the left you see President Clinton in his jeans and his cool Nikes.  (Laughter).  And to the right of him is [HM] Minyon Moore.  She was Assistant to the President and also head of Political Affairs.  In the far corner there, that's Secretary Rodney Slater.  And he's sitting on the phone as well.  And I'm sort of leaning down with my hand on my face.  It was a call that I had organized for the President to speak with several hundred mayors around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This photo, I was actually "miking" the Vice President.  He was coming to our office for an event, and I was assisting him with putting his mike on.
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in 1993.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was my official White House photo.  Senior Staff all had the opportunity to take official photos.  And so, that was the one that I took.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is the staff that I worked with in the White House.  To the far left is Mickey Ibarra, who was my boss, and Maria Soto.  To the right of the President was Seth Applebaum, and then of course myself with the President.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is earlier when the President [Bill Clinton] went to the NAFEO [National Association for Equal Opportunity] event to speak, and we ended up going back in his motorcade.  And he's having a moment, a laughing moment, with Janai Roscoe who was the liaison to all the African American community.

Speaker 2: This is a photo of the President, former President [Bill] Clinton, and my pastor, Reverend Dr. Leroy Bowman, who's like my grandfather.  And the President had a meeting and reception for black ministers around the country.  And we had about 150 black ministers that came into town for this event.  And it was very special for me, because I got to do the Invocation for the President that day.
Speaker 1: Okay, you get to relax a little bit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (Laughter) occasionally I get to have some fun, not too often.  But this was actually at the second Inaugural Ball of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.  And to the left is Shirley Wilcher.  She was then the Assistant Secretary over at the Labor Department.  And the young lady to the right was from New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know if I want this picture to be seen.  This is a picture... after the election was over, Al [Gore] and Tipper [Gore] decided to put together a thank-you party to commend all of the people that worked so hard on his campaign.

This is a picture of my niece and nephews in the White House during the Christmas season, as you can tell.  And it was their first visit to the White House.
Speaker 2: Okay.
