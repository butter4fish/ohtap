Speaker 1: Yeah about 60 percent of Chicago's from Mississippi I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean black Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, definitely, promised land, this was the promised land.
Story_ID: 460545
Speaker 1: So are there any stories passed down in the family from your mother's [Earline Jackson Jones] side about Mississippi or what part of Mississippi they came from?
Speaker 2: No. No, she just said that her grandmother Steen [ph.] came up when she was thirteen and her husband was fourteen.  They got married and caught the train on up.  They almost stopped in Champaign [Illinois] 'cause they couldn't really read that well so they came--somebody told them they stay on the train so they came on up to Chicago [Illinois], got off the train with everybody else and try to make a living.
Speaker 1: Okay so maybe your grandmother [Dori Jackson] was born in say I don't know '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Probably so.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.  Okay so did they stop on the South Side or West Side [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Stopped South Side.
Speaker 1: South Side okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And they you say they lived around 51st Street and 51st and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Fifty-first and what?
Speaker 2: Fifty-first and State [Street]--
Speaker 1: Fifty-first and State.
Speaker 2: --around that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now did they live in those big highrises over there or they there before they were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The projects?  Yeah they were there before that.  They moved into the projects so my mother after her mom died, her grandmother raised them, my great-grandmother Steen.  I don't remember her but she was alive when I was born.  I vaguely--just bits and pieces of her.
Speaker 1: So they were in the projects 51st that's 51st and State is that--
Speaker 2: 51st and Federal [Street] really actually.
Speaker 1: Federal okay.  That's Robert Taylor [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois] then.
Speaker 2: Robert Taylor.
Speaker 1: Okay so they--
Speaker 2: 5120 building I believe.
Speaker 1: --so they were there when Robert Taylor was new?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were one of the first families in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they used to get the milk and the juice delivered to them and all that and you know of course they took the jobs away, Baldwin [Kent, Baldwin and Co.] left and then the steel mills closed and the women that working at Singer [Singer Corporation; Singer Sewing Company] lost those jobs you know then welfare kicked in real heavy and then the violence kicked in because they only had one or two jobs per every ten people so everybody knew when check paycheck day was so of course they brought they cousins and friends and whoever else and robbed people with the check.  That's just how the cycle of violence kicked off.
Speaker 1: Yes, stockyards closed down too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stockyards closed down and all the available jobs for men closed down and they say well if you don't have a man in your house, then you can get this check.  So of course the men vamoosed you know.
Speaker 1: I only heard stories, but I heard when Robert Taylor first opened I mean a lot of people fought to get in Robert Taylor.
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah.
Speaker 1: It was clean.
Speaker 2: Waiting list and the whole nine.
Speaker 1: Recreation facilities--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on Federal Street.  Kids would drive from other parts in Chicago and go to the sock hops over at Robert Taylor Homes.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Oh I heard all those stories about Robert Taylor and I've also heard you know me being into, into politics a little bit, well not even to--as activism I was saying not really into politics but I've heard that they put the German roaches [German cockroaches] in there and I mean from what I understand black folk have been traditionally pretty clean people which is why you know in slavery time they would clean the house you know and even after slavery they took jobs as cleaning people and just for that just to all of a sudden change when the projects was built just a little bit I don't know it's just hard for me to digest. And that could be--maybe it's because I, I identify with black people because I'm one but I just--it's hard to believe that a cleaning woman would go downtown and clean a building until its spotless and then come home and just have roaches and stuff in her house.  So I mean I've also heard about you know from another, from other standpoints that the projects was an experiment and they chose--they took lab mice and saw if they stacked them on top of each other in close quarters, how would they, how would they would act and so they, they carried on.  They developed a system like any organism will develop a system to live together.  So they did, they halved the food rations and the water rations and they began to form groups and began to fight (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So these are some of the stories about how the projects--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --came down?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, about how yeah the, the demise of them yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: In a sense. The living standards came down.  These stories that people tell--
Speaker 2: --the demise of them 'cause I do hear that--like I say they smuggled, my mom used to say they have milk delivered and juice delivered every day and so and so forth, you know. But then all the jobs left and men that were used to a certain wage that work at the steel mill, steel mill was now fighting for jobs as bag boys at the Red Rooster that was on State Street the little Red Rooster store so.  You know I, I understand that the conditions were quite morbid at that point, but and then of course human nature even in the time of adversity is not our nature to expand, our nature is to shrink and hold on and folks just start to hold onto they little enclave families you know friends and then influence of gangs, which is human nature to be, to be tribal and to be in a group.  But that's how it just start falling all apart and then the violence that came from it, from people starving.
Story_ID: 460546

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --very easily.

Speaker 1: --they call it I guess the mafia and the Jones--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Um-hm, um-hm yeah.
Speaker 1: --brothers for control of the numbers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because at one point well you tell the story, I'm a let you tell it.
Speaker 2: Well I mean basically what, what exposed it was I know people way well they didn't do it on purpose but during the time when money was real scarce in America, they put on the cover of Time magazine said everybody in America is in a depression except for this one little enclave of black folk on the South Side of Chicago in the area called Grand Boulevard [Chicago, Illinois] which is now called Bronzeville. And all the eyes focused on him: why is they making money and drive the fancy cars and little boys and little girls is dressing sharp and going to church and they supporting they business and you know spending and you know at the time the black dollar was circulating in the community about ten times before it left.  Well basically you know you couldn't really go a lot of places and spend money any way if you was black, a lot of segregation you know Jim Crow and all that so of course you know they start arresting them one by one, getting them in jail you know black folk we, we're a pretty trusting lot of people.  So hey this how we doing it and then you know mobs came in and battled for it and then when they couldn't wrest it from our hands, they involved the law enforcement which is you know how things worked, still in the City of Chicago so.
Speaker 1: That was a racket that the mob really couldn't--
Speaker 2: Couldn't crack.
Speaker 1: --they couldn't because they can't, they're not black they couldn't, they don't know the neighborhood and--
Speaker 2: They couldn't simulate.
Speaker 1: --the nuances.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: They couldn't simulate us.
Speaker 2: Exactly so they brought the law in, they brought--I heard they was bringing out shopping bags of money, cash.  Police, police was bringing it out you know.  And you got a person making you know three dollars an hour bringing shopping bags of money you know some of that money come up missing and the police in Chicago ain't never had no reputation of being too fortuitous at all you know.  And back then I'm sure it was even a little worse just I--just my summation of it and they broke it down and then all of a sudden this mysterious thing came up called Illinois State Lottery, same racket though, legalized.
Speaker 1: Every, every city in the black community all over the country had some kind of numbers--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --game going but the kings of it were the Jones (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --brothers here like Bumpy Johnson and New York--
Speaker 2: And Harlem [New York, New York] yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah Harlem was one of those.  Okay so your father is part of that family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but he had to--he's probably too young to been involved in--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah no, he was too, even his daddy you know was you know young at the time.
Story_ID: 460548
Speaker 1: What happened now, what I heard, I heard a story--maybe you can confirm it--was that the Jones brothers [Edward Jones, George Jones and McKissack Jones] took some of the money and just actually left the country and went to Mexico or someplace (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And went to Mexico.
Speaker 1: Is that--
Speaker 2: That's, that's accurate yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your father [Hubbard Jones] have any connection with Mexico?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. No my father just you know he was again his mama [Rita Smith], my grandma, I know my grandmother she, she was a dancer and so and so forth and she and the youngest who was Harvey [Jones' grandfather, Harvey Jones] you know he was a good boy and you know she was the little sister of Hubbard, Hubbard Smith and he beat up police and stuff like that and even when I was a little boy I remember my Uncle Hubbard being real tough even though he had been shot by the police a couple of times and they put him in a mental institution, they had electric shocked him and all that stuff and he was just a shell of what he used to be.  But I remember my Uncle Hubbard when I was a little boy was still a tough guy and he ran with the Jones boys but kept getting into it with police officers and they couldn't get up with him physically so they ambushed him, messed him up pretty bad you know but--
Speaker 1: Now Uncle Hubbard is your--
Speaker 2: Grandma's brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, grandma's brother.  Okay, that's your great uncle? Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 460549

And if you see a picture of her she look like you know what you would think Pocahontas or something would look like, or Princess Wildflower or something like that, beautiful woman.  She wasn't ready to settle down.  She wanted to live the fast lifestyle from what I understand so my daddy [Hubbard Jones] and his little sister Penny [Penny Jones (ph.)] was raised by her mother and Mother Smith had a stroke so my daddy would you know be taking care of her and stuff, giving her her breakfast and stuff before he went to school.  He's always been a very responsible person and it was after his daddy had moved after the whole police had infiltrated basically and it was just you know the low end was becoming the low end you know so.

Speaker 1: --back during the late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s] right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm late '60s [1960s] yep mid to late '60s [1960s].  And I remember he told me one story he said that they, that the pigs had raided 'em.  He was like man they know we ain't got nothing in here.  We ain't you know got no weapons in here.  We about peacefulness and so on and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now did they raid a headquarters of SNCC or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of Simba.  Simba headquarters.
Speaker 1: --Simba, Simba okay.
Speaker 2: Simba headquarters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He said he came outside to talk to--
Speaker 1: Do you know where that was?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: No, I don't know exactly where that was.
Speaker 1: Okay I'm sorry go ahead.
Speaker 2: He said he came out to talk to one of the officers.  He said, "Man if you don't shut up," and put a gun right in my father's--my father said the only time he ever been scared for his life.  And he grew up in the streets.  Said that man, he said dude was sweating.  I was like well you know at the time two lottery cats was doing drugs, they was taking drugs off the streets and doing them too.  The police were.  So this what it was you know.  You know the police culture in America is all messed up you already know.  But he said that was the first time he was ever afraid for his life.  He said this dude was really finna do it.  He was gonna set it off.  And he said he realized that being in those organizations like that makes yourself really a target.  He said you could still do revolution, be activist but once you get into a group he said obviously when they came in somebody had tipped them off and maybe the information wasn't right 'cause they was using you know cats that was they catching cats with drugs and say hey tell us what they got going over and cats give 'em false information and stuff like that because he said because they wasn't doing nothing wrong.  Everything was by the book, paper work was in order and everything.  Yeah so I mean and I was a little kid when he was telling me that I just couldn't imagine my daddy being scared of nothing.  'Cause my daddy a tough guy you know what I'm saying.  He not a big dude, but he tough.  He ain't--he don't take no stuff man, you know, not from no dudes.  You know my mama used to you know get away with murder, but (shakes head).

Speaker 1: Just imagining my father [Hubbard Jones] you know what I'm saying and he's always been very Afrocentric you know what I'm saying.  Made his own clothes and you know he wa- he was one of the first graduates from Washburne Trade School [Chicago, Illinois] for sheet metal, one of the first black graduates I should say.
Speaker 2: Yeah Washburne right up here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He worked out of McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois].  Said they tried to throw tar on him and stuff and they--you know, racist.  You know that's a very racist--construction industry is very racist you know especially when sheet metal you know.  Carpenters maybe not, but sheet metals trade (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well the trades in Chicago [Illinois] are really jealous of their spots and they don't wanna give them up for anybody.
Speaker 1: At all.
Speaker 2: Anybody new another ethnic group that catch it.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got lots of stories about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what my daddy said he was like, he said at the time was carrying a pistol in his lunch box.  Then he said that he realized that really quickly that he wanted to move up the ladder and get more technical field so he became an air tester and balancer.  I remember when I was little, he was, he get laid off a lot, obviously first you know last hire, first fire you know that's for real so yeah he was skilled and dedicated worker.  His work acumen is you know and work ethic is impeccable.  I remember my daddy having fevers getting up going to work five o'clock in the morning driving way out to some place in Illinois we had never heard of and he start going to school to be an air tester and balancer.  Had his little briefcase and he would drive cabs at nighttime, study, go to school, try to pick up odd job here and there and with five kids man that's hard you know you can't have steady work so whenever they felt like laying him off, they would it's crazy.  I remember you know and being a proud person I remember days when you know we didn't have nothing to eat and stuff like that and I remember him like reading the paper and I look back he was you know just trying to not let us see his face you know what I'm saying because he felt, he felt the gravity of the situation.  You know we little kids we ain't have much to each we'll be all right you know.
Story_ID: 460552
Speaker 1: My mom [Earline Jackson Jones] was heavily into church and stuff like that.  My daddy [Hubbard Jones] wasn't at all.  He was agnostic basically you know.  But when I was little I used to go to to the, to the mosque with my uncles, my father's cousins really, I call them my uncles, they would go down to the Mosque (Unclear) on 73rd [Street] and I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was 73rd and Stony Island [Avenue]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The Nation of Islam right?
Speaker 1: Mosque Maryam [Chicago, Illinois] um-hm.  I remember--
Speaker 2: That's when Elijah Muhammad was still alive in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm yep.  Yep he was still, he was still there.  I also saw Muhammad Ali speak when I was a little bitty boy.  It was like more, more than, more than anything our family--my father side of the family they was close.  My mother, not really.  She got two brothers, my Uncle Timothy [Timothy Jackson (ph.)] and my Uncle Joseph [Joseph Jackson (ph.)].  Joseph was a player player type dude, you know what I'm saying.  He always had a whole bunch of pretty women and fancy cars and--
Story_ID: 460553
Speaker 1: Finish telling the story about your uncle.
Speaker 2: Uncle Joseph [Joseph Jackson (ph.)] yeah.  Uncle Joseph was like a player type dude.  He played ball for DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] you know handsome guy you know, tall and very confident dude you know and my Uncle Timothy [Timothy Jackson (ph.)] was like the opposite, very timid.  My mom [Earline Jackson Jones] said he used to get beat up.  Uncle Timothy like a superhero, he's so strong man, he been like a Hercules dude all our life but just timid on his, on the inside and Uncle Joseph was you know very much extravert.  And he met my dad [Hubbard Jones] I believe at a rally so said hey come on over to the house and meet my sister 'cause he wanted her to be with a, with a dude you know that was about something.  So my father fell in love with her automatically and you know she had her grandma cook some food and to act like she cooked it and all that you know and they got you know inseparable after that even though my mama ain't I guess she ain't love him as much as she was fronting like she did you know so.
Speaker 1: So I take it they didn't, they didn't stay married you know were they married for a while (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know they stay married for a long time.
Speaker 1: Oh they did okay.
Speaker 2: (Makes noise) Yes, they did.
Story_ID: 460554
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My big brother [Earl Jones], she [Jones' mother, Earline Jackson Jones] was pregnant with my big brother when they met, my brother and--my mother and father [Hubbard Jones] met.
Speaker 2: So she was pregnant with another man's baby when, when they met?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.  Some big time dude from the projects but his sister didn't like her you know what I'm saying.  They viewed her as phony or sadity or whatever and my mother was a very intelligent woman, very smart, could have made a lot out of herself you know, potential.  But my daddy said potential was the worst word in the English dictionary.  Potential, people got potential to do all kind of stuff but unless you can kineticize that it ain't nothing.  So they got married after my big brother was born then she immediately got pregnant with me and I think I was that baby that represented her splitting from dude you know all the way.  He like, "You pregnant with somebody else's baby now you married you leave me alone," just whatever so.  So she couldn't, I guess she just couldn't never find it in her spirit to love me I don't know.  It's strange but we didn't try to figure it out.  Everybody tried to figure it out, every relative in my family, every ma'am, every shaman, every minister we just can't figure it out. That's the way it go (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you and your mother never really had a close relationship you'd say?
Speaker 1: I mean my mother was abusive you know to me which I think she probably would have really been abusive to herself but found an outlet which was me.
Story_ID: 460555
Speaker 1: I remember (laughter), I was about six and my grandma was in the hospital.  She had breast cancer, and she had several operations about--on breast cancer but my grandma drank a lot and stuff and at the time you know black people we still evolving from a medical standpoint learning about our health and stuff and what we can do because we push things to the limit a lot but I remember her [Jones' mother, Earline Jackson Jones] ironing my brother's [Earl Jones] little blue suit and I had never really seen her iron because we be at school or something when she iron or asleep when she would iron.  I never really seen like I've seen her ironing but I never was able to focus on it and it was other folk there and they was ready to go to the hospital, they was gonna ride with us go to the hospital, see my grandma and I was like what is that smoke coming out of there?  So I put my hand by it and it was hot so it was steam obviously, I just never knew, it's hot like fire would be but it's white smoke. Amazing. And it's kind of wet.  She kept telling me, "Stop Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones], stop Malik."  She ironing talking, "Stop Malik." And I'm not paying any attention to that you know little male brain.  I'm focused on what I'm doing, I'm learning though you know what I'm saying, kept telling me stop and then that iron came down on my hand, I looked up my skin was on the iron and at the time this little, this was my whole hand this was down my little arm and this was my whole hand.  My big brother ran and got a little what they call rock glass, put water in it and put my hand in there, but it, the skin was all gone like really like real third degree burn for real.  So my mama wrapped it up and put something on it Vaseline or something which wasn't smart because it keeps the heat in.
Speaker 2: She intentionally burnt you?
Speaker 1: At the time I didn't think she did. And all my life I used to be like my mama actually didn't burn me until I had my son and he made six and I was ironing his clothes, so crazy, so crazy. He had a little Hot Wheels car.  You know how little boys with Hot Wheels, they driving up everything.  No gravity, physics all, physics don't apply.  You know so he just driving up everything.  I'm on the phone like, "Jabriel [Jabriel Jones] get away from the iron, boy. Jabriel get away from here."  He driving all over the couch and he driving on the ironing board and out the side of my face, I see his hand, I snatched the iron away, snatch his hand, "Boy!" And at that same instance I realize my mama did it on purpose.  Now I'm a father, I don't really have those instincts that a mother has but I know not to be putting a iron on my son hand.  I'm just thinking like she didn't feel a little soft hand and that she kept on this.  So when I look back I'm like I'm looking at her face and she looking down at me like, nigger I told you to stop, that's what her eyes was saying. I mean I was like (makes sound).
Story_ID: 460556
Speaker 1: I mean I was aware of the other abuse, you know what I'm saying, broken nose and concussions and.
Speaker 2: Oh she [Jones' mother, Earline Jackson Jones] broke your nose?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  My nose bled every night for about, for about three months every time I went to sleep but just, that's just my, my daddy [Hubbard Jones] was at work all the time and you know she was, she had got accustomed to punching me or slapping me in my face.  I was about ten so every night my nose would bleed.  I have a severe nose bleed every night and didn't realize what was going on so.  Fingers was broke, you know what I'm saying, so I remember going to my physical to go to high school, and I was about thirteen and no, no my physical to be a Boy Scout so I was about twelve and she used to beat us with these--mainly me--with anything really, but these little fiberglass posts that you put in the garden and whoop me with that. But I'm putting my hands down and she so she cracked and fractured them and I remember at the hospital the doctor calling my father to show him the x-rays and my father didn't know because he was at work every day. And she had made up these elaborate stories about how bad I was and she had the whole family against me.  I was like why nobody don't really like me like they not really fuck with me too much you know what I'm saying and it was her.  Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] said this, Malik did that, he so bad this and that and I was really you know her best child, most obedient you know, cleaned up the house anything I could do you know what I'm saying but Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said the oppressed unceasingly seek the approval of the oppressor.  It's really like it's a human nature thing though you know that's why animals, it's every- it's, it's animals though like hyenas that are treated poorly by the rest of the gaggle they keep trying to re-assimilate in even if they have power to leave, they won't so just a hum- it's just you know a thing that we have so and my dad I think he just made a poor choice being a good dude but you know made a poor choice, but he's used to taking care of people all his life you know what I'm saying that's what he did with his grandma when she had her stroke and my grandmama, his grandma, then my grandmama [Rita Smith] was out on the you know dancing around the country whatever he said he--she come home sometime bringing them some rib tips or something like that, but he had already warped into the mold of being the caretaker.
Story_ID: 460557
Speaker 1: There was a question raised during the break about like your father [Hubbard Jones] being in, he's in--when he met your mother [Earline Jackson Jones] the time he met your mother he was in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and he was in Simbas [Simba Wachanga]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and those are not mutually exclusive or anything but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --was he in other organizations?
Speaker 2: No I think he had other little stuff he was involved in but SNCC, because of how organized they were and because they were doing, he was in a specific project, they were working on the Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois] to being built as a community college.
Speaker 1: Okay who else was working with him?  I mean who else was in SNCC then?
Speaker 2: He said a guy named Pemon Rami.
Speaker 1: Pemon Rami.
Speaker 2: Pemon Rami you know him?
Speaker 1: Yeah I know yeah.
Speaker 2: He was in there with him and a guy named Frog [ph.] who I thought was my uncle for years (laughter).  I can't remember the rest of the guys I have to really ask my daddy about that he knew them all though them was his boys.
Speaker 1: Yeah there's some other people that have we've interviewed they were involved in SNCC in those days in Chicago [Illinois].  So anybody watching this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah the probably know my daddy or Mioake [ph.].
Speaker 1: So yeah but Pemon Rami he got involved in theater as a direct- director?
Speaker 2: Yep went to Hollywood and stuff yep, um-hm.  He was in the movie--I remember when I was little he was in some kind movie my father say, "There go Pemon."  I was like man that's a cold name.  I started to like that name Pemon.
Story_ID: 460558
Speaker 1: But yeah, my father [Hubbard Jones] just one of those type of people a deep thinker you know and just really for real about what he say about, you know. Much like me.  I think that's where I get it from.  I'm really about what I say I'm about.  If I say I'm a do something to you, I'm a do it to you.  If I'm a do something for you, I'm a do something for you.  I don't really you know I ain't never made no idle threat to nobody or no idle promises.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now let me ask you this I guess, I guess it's more than obvious but when you think about your parents' talents and personalities and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 1: I mean really, well, scientifically the male child takes 90 percent of the intellectual genes from the mother through  mitochondrial DNA so really a male child is mentally and emotionally more like the mother.  It's a reason for that though you know and--
Speaker 2: Do you think that's true for you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.  Like my father just didn't have the good analytical skills like he just didn't have the dexterity to see through things and I get you know I get that from my mama [Earline Jackson Jones].  My mama she just had the ability to peer through things.  She knew when I first--she knew when I started having sex.  I don't know how she knew she just knew it.  I was like how does she know.  And then one day she like, "You messing with a grown woman."  My sister was like no not Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones].  I was messing with a woman who I had no business messing with.  She's an educator and--
Speaker 2: A teacher?
Speaker 1: --an educator (unclear) and--
Speaker 2: Educator?
Speaker 1: Yeah she's an educator.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm not gonna get past that huh?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.

Speaker 1: I was about fifteen but you know I had a strange transformation the summer that I made fifteen.  I ha- start working at a car wash and they introduced me to the life of narcotics so I was able to make money fast and based on my fearlessness I guess what they call hellified, I was able to you know hold it down too, so cats start saying how shorty get down, he get down and I you know I don't know my father [Hubbard Jones] but he just wasn't he was at work all the time but my mother [Earline Jackson Jones], my brother used to say that she don't know I was selling dope but I don't know how she couldn't know.  I leave the house at six o'clock in the morning and come back at twelve with (gesture) this much money saying I work at a car wash.  But it was the only time she was nice to me though.  Said, "Hey baby," and I lived for those moments.  My mama call me baby or something like that man I would have did anything for those moments.  I used to come in give her four or five hundred dollars whatever but I know when my son [Jabriel Jones] get fifteen (laughter) he got five hundred dollars, I finna question him and I finna ask him questions.  Where you get this?  What?  Every day?

Speaker 1: --from when you're a little kid.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yep.  I must have been about a year and something I don't even know how old I was.  I was a baby, baby.  I remember being in a crib.  I remember hearing my daddy [Hubbard Jones] voice and my grandma talking to him and I heard him say, "Where Leekie [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] at?" And I remember trying to open my eyes and the light came on in the room and I turned over and looked through the little bars of the crib and seen my daddy like looking into the crib and I think either she said I was sleep or he said I was sleep and turned off the light and that's my earliest memory.  He had on like a blue jean hat or something, apple hat or something like a blue jean jacket and I remember that.

Speaker 1: We always ask this question to everybody, what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well my most--
Speaker 1: And this is the early '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on 51st [Street] and State [Street] right?
Speaker 2: No on Stony Island [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Stony Island okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's where my grandma lived--
Speaker 1: Okay all right go ahead.
Speaker 2: --so we staying with her.  My, my father [Hubbard Jones] and mother [Earline Jackson Jones] had start--had separated after me--after my sister [Larita Jones] was born.
Speaker 1: So did you grow up on Stony Island--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's all I knew was Stony Island.
Speaker 1: Stony Island and what?
Speaker 2: Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] was right here so--
Speaker 1: 61st [Street] and Stony? Around 60th [Street] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) yeah so two blocks north I mean two houses north okay.  The street right here this is Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois]. This the street that was like a greystone there, a brown no like a big building a greystone, then our building.  It's right there.  It's all row houses now.  At the corner was a big store.  My earliest memory--the smell I like the most was like my grandfather's lighter.  One of them old school metal lighters.  Yeah that was like a smell of safety to me my grandfather [Harvey Smith].  Although my grandma [Rita Smith] was mean to him.  I remember her being mean to him.  I loved her, I still love her but she was mean to my grandfather but he played the ponies a lot and you know. Willis [Willis Meechum (ph.)] he came into my dad [Hubbard Jones] life when my daddy was like ten or twelve I think he said he was ten or twelve when I think he came around my daddy was ten and then he got married when he was like twelve so that was like his father you know grandpa, papa was my, you know and he was just one of those old school dudes was in the [U.S.] Army you know, big dude think he was half Polish or Italian I'm not sure, nah it must have been Polish, Meechum, I think it's Polish.  And I remember his, his mama, Mama Meechum [ph.] she was I think she was just a white lady, I think she was white or maybe real, real close to it.  I remember going over her house, Mama Meechum and he would drink with his, with his friends Poncho [ph.] and couple of other dudes and he worked at the post office and he worked the morning shift because I remember sometime he wake me up in the morning, he be fixing his little coffee and stuff and fixed me some what they call baby tea like put some tea with some Carnation milk in it.  So I would hang out with him in the morning before he went to work and then wait for him to come back home and I think for a little while my daddy had moved in with my grandma while we was living there just for a little, a brief moment.  So I remember my daddy had a Cougar [Mercury Cougar], the car, and it got stolen so then he went and got another one like the next day and I thought that was a big thing.  That was big like he got a Cougar and it got stolen and he came back the next day with a new one.  I thought that was real gangsta.  I remember thinking that when I was a shorty.  And my grandma fixing spaghetti.  She fixed spaghetti a lot I guess.  I don't guess she could cook that good so we always had a lot of spaghetti.  And then like the sound of the bus going by big old green buses.  We could--we lived right across the street from the park over there too so we used to cross the street go to the park and I remember you--from my window the front window you could hear the kids swinging, the squeaking of the swings so that was like the sights was like this dude that used to work on cars in the back of the house and I had a big dog named Princess [ph.] and I go out there on the porch with her and like whatever I was eating, she just eat it from me whatever she just take it, ice cream whatever, she would just eat it.  And I remember him working on--this guy working on his car, he work on different cars and I remember the big kids, they would learn how to wheelie  bikes the next door neighbor named Sam [Sam Leon (ph.)] had hit the car while he was under it and it fell on him and crushed him.  I can't think of his name.  I think his last name was Leon and that was a big thing.  I remember the police took I mean the ambulance took a long time to come and my auntie took me down, my grandmother wouldn't let me go, my auntie took me down there.  He was my friend's father.  I think his name was Leon 'cause I think Little Leon was my friend's name so that was his daddy and I remember that being rough, like a rough thing to deal with.  Like I don't think I understood death at the time like so he not finna be, he not finna go to the hospital, he not finna die, go to the hospital and come back?  'Cause in the cartoons you know death was kind of relative you know and that's one of those of the sights I remember, all the different cars he would work on and then like the smell was my grandfather's lighter and my grandma's spaghetti and the sound was the bus and the swings.

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest memory of school?
Speaker 2: Yeah I went to like a Head Start I guess or more like a daycare.  I think it was Head Start.
Speaker 1: Was it over there around Stony [Stony Island Avenue] some place?
Speaker 2: Yeah back down though closer to like the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] so Stony all the way down like 59th [Street] I guess or whatever I guess that little Midway thing [Midway Plaisance, Chicago, Illinois] is.
Speaker 1: Where the dead end, where Stony dead ends with--
Speaker 2: Before it dead ends so those two blocks before that by that viaduct.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, where the Midway--
Speaker 2: I had a little Head Start over there and I remember--I don't remember much I remember it reminded me of rumper room being in there and I think it was green on the outside and we would go across the street and it was a statue and I went over there recently, not recently but like maybe ten years ago went over there and read who it was and I forgot who the guy was and he was on a horse with a helmet--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that knight there, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah and I remember we used to over there and have our little lunch over there.  That's my early memory of school.  So that was it called Head Start or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah probably Head Start.  Head Start was started up in the late mid-'60s [1960s] or during the Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] administration.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So yeah it was a Head Start program.
Speaker 1: For early childhood education.  That was the new wave of you know the kids ought to be taught how--they could be taught how to read and the alphabet at least you know before they go to first grade.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm yeah.
Speaker 1: So where'd you start grade school?
Speaker 2: Fridtjof Nansen [Fridtjof Nansen Elementary School; Ronald Brown Academy, Chicago, Illinois], 127th [Street] and Union [Avenue].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what's the name of it again?
Speaker 2: Fridtjof Nansen, I don't know how to spell Fridtjof.  He was an explorer.
Speaker 1: Oh Nansen.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 460563
Speaker 1: So, you were moved by then from (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah when I was about five--
Speaker 1: Now how long did you stay with your grand- you were with your mother [Earline Jackson Jones] at first at 51st [Street]--
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't really I think but my daddy [Hubbard Jones] lived there too but after I was born he got out fast and like I think they- he had an apartment on Ingleside [Avenue] or something not too far from my grandma house.
Speaker 1: But you at your grandma's house a lot?
Speaker 2: That's, yeah that's really my memories, my early memories.  From what I understand that my mother used to leave us in the house, me and my big brother [Earl Jones], and go to the projects.  Act like she was going to job interviews and go to the projects and drink all day with her grandma them and then come back get us but I think like my daddy found out or somebody found out so we start having to be at my grandma house and yeah that's how it went something like that.  She would leave us in the house by our self and go to the project but act like she was going to look for a job.  My daddy was one of those progressive dudes like women should work and you know we do our family and he had dreams of you know buying property and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: So, so you say your father had a higher standards than your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah well she said that she did though.  He said how she tricked him.  She was real pretty.  He said she had the biggest Afro and the biggest earrings and she's very articulate woman, very intelligent, expansive vocabulary but you know she used it, she used her powers for bad (laughter).  So she tricked my daddy.  He believed it all.  Why wouldn't you?  A beautiful woman saying all this stuff you want a woman to say.  Come on man.  Why would you doubt it?  So.
Speaker 1: People often say things they mean but can't follow up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can't follow up, yeah. Like I said I think she had the intentions of being that person but when it came to practical applications, it's difficult though to really be a revolutionary and to you know what I'm saying to really be uplifting people and working you gotta be kind of selfless.  My mama she not very selfless person.
Speaker 1: It kind of sounds like maybe she was nervous or frustrated in the situation she was in?  I mean I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean fear is the pre-genitor [sic. progenitor] of so many bad things you know.  People do so much stuff out of fear.  So you know like you always say you know fear leads to the dark side.
Speaker 1: Okay. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I think she was just scared to get out there.  It was difficult I'm sure you know at the time of the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] and she was you know she was kind of more southern than anything else because her grandma raised her who was directly from the South you know.  Her mama [Dori Jackson] was more cosmopolitan then from my understanding, dressed well and stuff like that from--'cause her brothers were older than her when she passed away, knew more about her.  She was six so she didn't really get to know her mama that mu- that much.
Story_ID: 460564
Speaker 1: So in 1977 you're, you're six is that when you started first grade?--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean at Nansen [Fridtjof Nansen Elementary School; Ronald Brown Academy, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yep, I start kindergarten at Nansen.
Speaker 1: Kindergarten okay so this is '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: Six [1976]. Um-hm yeah.  And we had--I had Ms. Smith [ph.], Mrs. Smith.   That was my teacher.  She was a sweet lady man, sweet lady, Ms. Smith.  Then Ms. Sims [ph.] was my first grade teacher and--
Speaker 1: Now by this time have they taught you how to read or?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think I was reading, reading pretty good I think in kindergarten.  I remember my granddaddy used to teach me how to read though.  I got little books like Sylvester and Tweety and all that stuff and he would tell me to read the pictures.  Which is now a thing that they turn environmental reading to be the assess your surroundings which is very important and lot of native people you know they didn't do well in school prior to this because they learned environmental reading you know not that they was dumb or anything like that they just you know looked at things differently so--
Speaker 1: So did you like school?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Why not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did like school at first, but as I got older I liked it less.  I'm dyslexic.  I have dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia.
Speaker 1: Now how, explain what those are and how you see the world?  I mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah dyslexia--they're doing studies on this now--is they saying some of the presenters could be possibly post brain stress syndrome so like when you shake a baby and stuff like that.  I'm almost certain--I know that my mother [Earline Jackson Jones] drank with me and my brother when she was pregnant with us.  I don't think--I just think she didn't know any better.  My brother, my big brother [Earl Jones] is deaf, super smart though, real smart, straight A's and all that stuff.  But dyslexia is or lexicon you know what lexicon is so when you view words differently it's not so much backwards but it is like a sequential problem so like for me girl is inexplicably spelled G-R-I-L when I'm writing it down.  Although I know it's G-I-R-L. Again never has the second A in it.  Mouse never has a U in it.  A lot of stuff, just tons of different things but mainly it is just I can't, in dysgraphia, I can't really draw my name well, I mean I sign my signature every time differently.  It's ridiculous (laughter).  It's very frustrating.  I mean I was signing autographs I was with Puffy [P. Diddy; Sean Combs] and them and we signing these posters.  This little boy was like, "This how you be writing stuff and stuff?"  I was like man my handwriting is terrible.  But dyscalculia dealing with numbers like long division, you can teach it to me right now, I'll get it and tomorrow I'll forget it.  It's just very difficult.  But also I suffer from a thing called battered neglected and abused child syndrome so that they also saying that certain parts of the brain don't develop, just they don't--well they don't well for slang they don't fire up, they don't light up parts of the brain.  So what happens is in dyslexic's brain the brain is forced to find alternate patterns to move through 'cause there's something that ignites in a child when they look into their mother's eyes, some kind of some signals are going back and forth, it's a language that they're just now starting to understand or figure out that exists that connection between mother and child is I mean you know you can't duplicate anywhere else and when you're looking in your mother's eyes, she's giving you signals and it's telling your brain to light up.  It's forming neural patterns, it's more lighting not forming them but lighting them up and making certain synapsi [sic. synapses] back and forth a whole bunch of stuff and then you miss that step.  They did a study in Sweden which no, no, no not Sweden, Lithuania well used to be Lithuania and kids were in an orphanage and they were fed and they were you know clothed well.  These kids developed their own language 'cause they--'cause the lack of nurturing the brain, the brain needs nurturing and we don't understand why people die with like we don't like it should be like the hierarchy of needs and that's it but no.  People will actually die because of lack of interaction from another human especially nurturing from a mother type figure.  You can have a surrogate but you have to have that female interaction.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--so what--well what I'm hearing is that you're a lot of things that they require you to do in school you really couldn't do.  I mean if--
Speaker 2: It got increasingly difficult.
Speaker 1: You, you could catch on a lot of stuff, you're a bright person, but at the same time some of the things were appearing out of order (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah my programmatic skills just began to just dissipate.  Like I just didn't have them.
Story_ID: 460565
Speaker 1: So you began to like school less and less.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I became disenchanted (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And were you a discipline problem in school or--?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay, just, just--
Speaker 2: I mean people picked on us because my mama [Earline Jackson Jones] had began to like go into a depression I think.  She probably was depressed most of our life.
Speaker 1: Now was she out there at 127th Street [Chicago, Illinois] with you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so your mother and father [Hubbard Jones] got back together or did--
Speaker 2: Yeah they got back together and then we moved out, moved out there.
Speaker 1: Okay and then you moved out--
Speaker 2: Moved out there yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay I got it.
Speaker 2: I was about five they got back together (makes noise).
Speaker 1: Right. Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's weird because I look back on it I think she was just depressed.  She would just sleep all day then like get up and I guess look at TV and shit all day or something so our clothes wouldn't get washed and we was going to school you know bummy and she wouldn't do my sister's [Larita Jones] hair so my sister was getting picked on.  So of course I'm her big brother I gotta take up for her.  So I'm taking up for her and I'm fighting.  I see myself fighting every day.
Story_ID: 460566
Speaker 1: Can you give me an idea of where you were living on tw- 127th [127th Street, Chicago, Illinois] I mean were you all living in a house or what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we had a house.
Speaker 1: Was it like a two flat or, or a single house standing by itself?
Speaker 2: A colonial style house, yeah two story with a basement and attic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You know regular old single family house (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 127th--
Speaker 2: 127th and Wallace [Street], 12757.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right in the middle of the block.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad was a handy man so I think when we first moved there the house was black--no it was white with green shutters and they had thorn bushes in the front for security which is not conducive to having children. (Laughter) We got so many scrapes and scratches in them thorn bushes to one day my daddy just cut 'em down.  We had, we had like kind of like gnawed at thi- we gnawed a path (laughter) behind the thorn bushes to get onto the stairs.  We played hide and go seek with all the kids in the neighborhood and stuff.  My mother [Earline Jackson Jones] was, she was amazing because she would do stuff like feed the whole neighborhood cookies, like all the kids we be playing with, they--cookies and we had a teeter totter and my dad made a a a swing.  It was a tire swing in the back at first then he made it made two ropes and made a seat, a wooden seat and shellacked it and stuff my father was into that.  That's the kind of life he wanted.  He's much different than me.  I'm not r- I'm a good father, really good father, like one of the best I know but I'm not really domesticated like that.  I love playing with my kids but I don't like doing house worky type of stuff and most of that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you learn how to that type of stuff?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you know how to do it you just don't like it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I just don't like to do it.  Like ceiling fan, I can do anything around the house you know plumbing, electrical.  I can do anything.  My daddy--me and my brother [Earl Jones] (laughter) helped my daddy rewire the house when we was, we was thirteen or fourteen. Rewired the whole house pulled all the old wires out rewired 'em, rewired the whole crib.  Yeah I did--I mean we painted the house and (makes sound) I--decorated and pulled carpet and all that stuff you know.  We had a company that we made called Hub Co.  My father's name was Hubbard [Hubbard Jones] and made Hub Co: Home Upgrading and Beautifying Company [ph.] so I went and got a fax machine, registered with the Better Business Bureau [Better Business Bureau of Chicago and Northern Illinois], chamber of commerce.  I love my daddy so I just and make things easy on him.  We never were close though.  I mean it's hard though I think just naturally when the mother doesn't love a child so I think it's kind of difficult for the father.  I have to do some studying on that but I just don't think he ever got a feel for me.
Speaker 1: He was not home a lot right, you were saying?
Speaker 2: No he was at work all the time.
Speaker 1: He was at work all the time?
Speaker 2: All the time.  And then he would come home from work and do odd jobs.  My mama kept bouncing the bank all the time you know giving money to churches and s- (laughter) crazy shit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 460567
Speaker 1: D- do you have an earliest memory of religion?
Speaker 2: Going to the mosque [Mosque Maryam, Chicago, Illinois] with my uncle and them. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so that's the first--so you didn't--you don't remember the church first you remember the mosque?
Speaker 2: Yeah church--my first time going to church was like an Easter Sunday, my grandma made us--made me go to church with her.  We went to like New Philadelphia [New Philadelphia Church, Chicago, Illinois] on 51st Street or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now but which one you remember first the mosque or the church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The mosque when I was a little bitty boy.
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about the mosque, how did that impress you? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: This was--I just liked the people there.  I mean you know I just--a lot of beautiful people, a lot of beautiful women that was there and they was strong and you know without being loud.  I think that sometimes women especially now days mistake strength with loudness or power with loudness and that's you know that's never been the power of the queen.  The queen has always been able to with a gesture make everything turn you know.  Her power is in, in her subtleness I think.  Not saying that women aren't allowed to speak.  I'm not that type of fool and be like women can't talk, but I think women are so much more powerful when they're--now we men we externalize our strength so much (makes sound) we growl and the whole nine but females really don't do that.  They just kind of con- they just kind of run things quietly you know like when a woman walks in a room, it's a different energy than when a man walks in a room and I'm saying that because there's a study that we did and I mean this I don't know if I did one of the researches because of the mosque and because of my experience there and because of how the women were, they just seemed happy though.  They seemed like well within themselves if that makes sense.  They seemed well with themselves.  They weren't searching for something else and I mean you know I really know Mama Lee [ph.], how Cadesa [ph.] was they don't play though, Muslim women they don't really play with you at the crib.  They not, unh-uh, you ain't finna do what you wanna do, they finna be kind of in control.  I think a lot of Muslim households are ran like that.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But those people at the mosque were like family but they weren't all related and my experience at the church was a little different. They weren't like family even though (laughter) they were related or something, feuds and stuff within the family. And I noticed the stark contrast when I was a shorty though so I mean going there was like a peaceful thing for me and going to church was like laborious to me it was like a task.
Speaker 1: So what kind of church was it?  What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: I think it was called New Philadelphia or something like that?
Speaker 1: Where was it?
Speaker 2: I think it was on State Street somewhere on State Street corridor.  I must have been about four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay back near where 51st--closer to--
Speaker 2: Where I'm from yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you used to live okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the mosque of course is on sixty--
Speaker 2: 63rd [Street] and Stony Island [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Stony Island.
Speaker 2: On seventy- 73rd [Street] and Stony Island.
Speaker 1: Yeah 73rd and Stony Island.
Story_ID: 460568
Speaker 1: Now when you were growing up if I'm not mistaken the Nation [Nation of Islam] was divesting itself of a lot of things and I don't know if--I don't--at one time Wallace Muhammad [Warith Deen Mohammed] he sold the mosque [Mosque Maryam, Chicago, Illinois] or they got rid of it and then Mr. Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] actually bought it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --back I guess in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Was it the yeah the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: So it was a time when it wasn't one to go to--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I mean not that one any way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But so did you continue to go to the mosque with your uncle?
Speaker 2: Nah, when we moved out south my mama [Earline Jackson Jones] got back into going to church.  I think it was like--when I was like about nine or something like that she decided one Easter we was gonna go to church as a family.  My daddy [Hubbard Jones] wasn't with that you know he like you know get his little reefer and listen to 'Soundstage' and all that, listen to his music and just you know he wanted to have like be the king of his castle and have his wife comply and do the you know and help build the, build the, the estate the fortune or whatever and have his kids be smart and go to college, that's what my daddy was into.  But my mama, she wasn't up on that.  So she started going to Greater Harvest Missionary Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], used to Reverend Boddie's [Louis Boddie] church and on 51st Street right back over there.  And my daddy said he remember going there too, get food baskets and stuff so he remember going there getting bread and everything and (laughter) we start going there man and you know with names like Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] and my brother Omar [Omar Jones] and my sister Larita Markeeta [Larita Jones] they, they was like, "Y'all going, my mama said y'all Muslims and y'all going to hell."  So of course I get to fighting the little kids you know.  My little brother and sister like, "Malik they said we going to hell."  I'm like, "Nah, what you say," so they like, "Them, them kids bad.  Them kids over there bad."  So my mama start trying to assimilate and my daddy wasn't he wasn't a conformist at all so it was difficult for him but the minister he would be up there you know bashing, bashing us and you know I don't think my father just start to just capitulate under the pressure you know so we start going to church all the time so from like like ten to like fourteen we was in church for like four years.  But I was still in love with Islam so of course I jumped back into that as soon as I could and started being a Blackstone [Blackstone Rangers] so it was like a perfect segue.
Story_ID: 460569
Speaker 1: Now how did you become a member of the Blackstone Rangers?
Speaker 2: Well, we used to be in that neighborhood and the hundreds used to be all Disciples really in that area.
Speaker 1: Now the--
Speaker 2: Gangster Disciples (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Chicago [Illinois], yeah in Chicago you got the Gangster Disciples, you got the Black Gangster Disciples.
Speaker 2: You got well it used to be the Black Gangster Disciples and then they broke up so they broke the six and they became the Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples, then they became the BGs the Black Gangsters too so they broke into three factions.
Speaker 1: Three--okay three factions and then there is the Blackstone Rangers--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --which was you know there are a lot of other different groups in the city those aren't the only ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah Vice Lords and stuff but--
Speaker 1: Yeah Vice Lords then--
Speaker 2: --Blackstones yeah then--
Speaker 1: Four Corner Hustlers.
Speaker 2: --from that--the Four CHs, yeah then--but the MCs was birth--Mick- Cobra Stones was birth from Blackstones [Black P. Stone Nation], Mickey Cogwell. And when I was about twelve the GDs [Gangster Disciples], the Folks [Folk Nation] the GDs, the Disciples came through and it was like recruiting so everybody was like okay we GDs that's the gang we gonna be in.
Speaker 1: I think you ought to explain that too that there are Folks and Peoples [People Nation], are two branches (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two branches, yeah one of the six and one of the five.  So anybody with gangster or disciple in they name is basically under the six or they folks.  Peoples is anybody with lord or stone or like lord or stone really basically.  King, like Latin Kings [Almighty Latin Kings], they under the five.  Puerto Rican Stones, you got a lot of Asian gangs too. Dragons [ph.].
Speaker 1: So to the uninitiated coming into Chicago for the first time and somebody is talking about Folks or Peoples in the neighborhood, you think they just talking about regular folk or people--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, regular people.
Speaker 1: --you are really missing what they saying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you don't know what they talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah right exactly.  It's, it's a certain language.
Speaker 1: I say hey you know any people over here that can you think I'm talking about--
Speaker 2: Exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know or what about color folks that you know you're thinking about not--so it's a very confusing.
Speaker 2: Yeah it is.
Speaker 1: But this is--there are layers of culture in this that we cannot even--
Speaker 2: Layers, yeah layers.
Speaker 1: --penetrate in this discussion--
Speaker 2: No, not here we can't that'll be a whole another conversation.
Speaker 1: --but it's, but it's complicated, very complicated.
Speaker 2: Yeah it is, it is.
Speaker 1: All right so.
Speaker 2: And we flipped--well basically--
Speaker 1: Well I just wanted you to explain some of this so we can you can have--
Speaker 2: --it--I mean they, they you know we was all Disciples, basically Disciples little shorty, I was twelve and they was like, "Yo we gonna be Disciples."  I was like cool, these my friends whatever I don't care.
Story_ID: 460570
Speaker 1: Now who were your friends at that stage, at age twelve?
Speaker 2: Other, other twelve year olds, kids in my classroom you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's what I figured, but.
Speaker 2: Sterling [ph.], Lance [ph.], Willie Reeves [ph.], Carl [ph.], who else, Eddie Jordan [ph.], just a bunch of twelve year old kids (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were y'all into?  What were you trying to do at that point?
Speaker 2: Well they just saying--we just playing being twelve year olds getting interested in girls and basically like man y'all gonna be this, this what y'all gonna be gang y'all gonna be in.
Speaker 1: Now who told you that?  The older guys?
Speaker 2: The older guys, yeah.
Speaker 1: They just told you this what you gonna do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we all Disciples, Gangster Disciples, GDs.  We was like okay cool.  We had kind of heard about the GDs and stuff like okay that's we part of it whoa, was excited about that.
Speaker 1: So you all thought it was exciting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean you get to assimilate with guys that you thought were cool and these guys are kind of your heroes too you know they walk around the neighborhood and some they like they drinking sometimes, smoking and all the pretty girls is you know like 'em and so and so forth. Exude a certain power, you know. And you know power is attractive.   You know with the humans we're made to seek out power.  Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] one time, a discussion me and him had on a private side, he like, "Don't let anybody tell you that it's wrong to be power hungry."  Said the word power according to Webster Thorndike [Merriam-Webster and Thorndike-Barnheart] means the ability to act.  Babies are power hungry, trying to hold they own bottle.  So those guys were powerful and power is attractive.  It, it draws you in you know.  When you see a person you know walking down the street like they got like how I'm a say like oil wells pumping in they backyard you wanna know who that person is.  Man who is this dude?  Who is this lady? You know. So but it fell apart quick because they just wanted to you know use our little, our little enclave in the neighborhood to you know run they program you know, robbery or auto theft or whatever, but it was affecting our neighborhood.  We like kind of like a tight knit community so we was like nah and the older guys Vamp [ph.] and all them Bodacious [ph.] and Veno [ph.] all of them was like nah so they said we ain't GDs no more, we H Racketeers [ph.] which is a division of the Stones [Blackstone Rangers] and Ryan and all those cats Ryan White [ph.] and all them and then the Brett [ph.] and all the other dudes, the older dudes they got off the bus came from Fenger High School [Christian Fenger Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and came just on the grammar school grounds and start beating up the older guys, Sydney [ph.] and all of them.  So after they like we Blackstones, Friday all y'all wear red shirts, tell y'all parents to get y'all some red shirts and some black pants.  So we came to school not even knowing what we were doing little kids representing this new thing, H. Racketeers Blackstone and after that you know like y'all gotta fight with us too like so we stood there and fought and--
Speaker 1: So red shirts and black pants, right?  And so it was like kind of a battle of the neighborhood to see which group is gonna be the--
Speaker 2: Well it's just only two blocks.  Like we the only ones that, that flipped and a couple people around that was our close friends but the neighborhoods they basically GDs but we was because our, you know our blocks that we lived on Parnell [Avenue] and Wallace [Street] we had just--like I had its four--I got four brothers.  It was Tone [ph.] and Mike [ph.] and across the street from me Tone, Mike and then they cousins Poo Poo [ph.] and Dave [ph.] and Teda [ph.] and Shawn [ph.] and then little Larry [ph.] had his friends from across Halsted [Street] and then Corey [ph.] and we had boys on our block, so we had bigger force than they was ready to deal with and we was real tight knit friends so we just Terry [ph.], Timmy [ph.], Mobley [ph.] and Kevin Pate [ph.] and Brian [ph.] and Eric [ph.] and around the corner was you know Melvin [ph.] and Darryl [ph.] and Wayne [ph.] and you know Rob [ph.] and then Derrick Lowe [ph.] and so we it was a bunch of us and we was tough so they couldn't really get up with us so we called it our own little you know created our own little swat in the neighborhood and became you know Blackstones and then we started meeting other Stones from different areas and they was like man how's y'all Stones in the hundreds?  But we was--we were more ferocious than the reg- than the other dudes.  They were older than us and they weren't willing to get down like we was willing to get down you know.  So.
Story_ID: 460571
Speaker 1: Give me an example like, like so your f- your father's [Hubbard Jones] at work a lot.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was still--your parents still together at this point right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your mother [Earline Jackson Jones] and you have kind of alienated kind of relationship so was anybody really concerned about where you were or what you were doing so much?
Speaker 2: Yeah my mother.  She didn't want me to do nothing.  Like she, she gave me no breaks.  She, I don't know like she was just trying to kill me it felt like.
Speaker 1: But seem like you had a lot of time to do other things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really.  I sneak out the house when most of this stuff was happening on the school ground so my brother [Omar Jones] and sister [Larita Jones] would wait for me to fight and they come home you know and then when we go outside to play, our play was gangbanging really, I'm saying, so and then two years after that I'm in high school so I really did what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay now where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so now CVS is not in your neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --I mean so it's a vocational school thought so is that why you ended up at CVS?
Speaker 2: My dad's friend that graduated from his program with him Gene, what's his name, I think Gene Simmons [ph.], yeah Mr. Simmons, yeah Gene Simmons, he was a sheet metal teacher up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my father was like well you can go learn the trade up there and my man is up there and he wound up--and I wound up not even doing sheet metal but--
Speaker 1: So CVS is in south Chicago [Illinois] so that's like 130 some blocks from where you.
Speaker 2: That's like a hundred oh wow, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no it's not that many.
Speaker 2: No, not a hundred.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I'm 127th [Street] so it's like thirty-something blocks yeah.
Speaker 1: About thirty something, yeah right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So forty-something blocks, forty blocks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then further east so like another like fifty blocks, sixty, fifty yeah like sixty, sixty-five blocks something like that.  So it was another world for me.  Obviously I didn't have no friends and stuff there so it was kind of rough but I had a lot of fights and stuff so you know to kind of prove myself and everything.
Speaker 1: So who, whose territory is that?
Speaker 2: It's mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Four Corner Hustlers, some of the Stones [Blackstone Rangers] and the GDs [Gangster Disciples] from Jeffery Manor [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now just from what I think I know correct me if I'm wrong, when you're a freshman in high school, that's a real dangerous time--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --when and especially if you're unaffiliated it's dangerous--
Speaker 2: Oh if you're unaffil- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and if you're affiliated it's dangerous.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's more dangerous if you're unaffiliated--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I think it's all at that time.  Yeah it was--
Speaker 1: Well tell us about the dynamics of that and like what would be your--did you have to have a route to make sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you got from one place to another?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at night, at night time coming down Halsted [Street] it's basically all GDs.  So from 95th [Street] and Halsted on back you passing like eight different sets and they all GDs but 103rd [Street] was the roughest because they be out there coming from Julians [Percy L. Julian High School, Chicago, Illinois] there's a place called P.G.s Gyros [ph.], they be hanging out there.  Some of my worst enemies, my arch nemesis Matthew [ph.], he went to Julian High School, he was rough, he was rough and they catch me sometime they see me on the back of the bus like yeah get off.  Throw something at the back of the bus whatever.  I remember having shootouts with them cats before at the--around they neighborhood but it was like I don't know, it's that machismo thing too like you know I'm tougher than you.  I don't want to be--I don't want the reputation that somebody's tougher than me that's my age you know that kind of thing so it was real difficult.  I'm cool with them guys now, like we friends.  Like Coodie [ph.] and all them cats they in New York [New York] working on doing something with Quentin Tarantino and what have you. But then it was a real volatile time when you a young male trying to find your place in society that's really diametrically opposed to your success.
Story_ID: 460572
Speaker 1: You mentioned shooting, now did you have a gun at--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --when did you get a gun?  I mean what age were you when you a gun?
Speaker 2: My first time shooting a gun I probably was thirteen.  My daddy [Hubbard Jones] had a gun in the house but he had a lock on it.  So we never used that.
Speaker 1: Now did your father have any idea what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: And would he approved of--would he have approved of that or disapproved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, no (laughter) he wouldn't.  He probably would have killed me but he had--but some of the neighbors had started hearing about me and my brother, we was tough you know, it was no question.  They were like so they told my dad, "Yeah Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] and Omar [Omar Jones] are the leads of the Vice Lords around here."  We was like--we vehemently denied it.  I was like, "No we are not Vice Lords, Daddy, they are telling you an untruth."  He like, "Well that's what Ms. Red [ph.] said."  I said, "No, we are not Vice Lords no."  And he can see it in our eyes we weren't but we really Blackstones [Blackstone Rangers].  Peoples and Vice Lords are the same, they didn't know, the old people they didn't know.  But it wound up being that we were protectors of the neighborhood though after that like everybody knew we was in the gang.  You know my dad act like it was a big war kicked off in '93 [1993] and like dope raid and flooded the city [Chicago, Illinois] like.
Speaker 1: That's right, you're absolutely right.
Speaker 2: Dope flooded the city (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In '94 [1994] there were more homicides in the city than ever before.
Speaker 2: Yeah from like '92 [1992] really like '91 [1991] it got--started getting bad but we was holding the whole city down.  We was holding everything down like in the '90s [1990s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you're in your early twenties then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By then.
Story_ID: 460573
Speaker 1: Let's get you through high school.  So you're at CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're a freshman at CVS and you--you know there's--you said there's all kinds of groups at CVS.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it was well getting to CVS and inside CVS too is every gang there too.  CVLs [Conservative Vice Lords], the IVLs [Insane Vice Lords]. Four C- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah a lot of Vice Lords over there in that area?
Speaker 2: Um-hm Four C.H.s. [Four Corner Hustlers].  Not a lot of Stones [Blackstone Rangers] though but the Stones that were there they found out I was Stones so we start to gather together and then the school start flipping all like the generation of the Disciples [Gangster Disciples] that start leaving they was all like brothers there.  We--Peoples [People Nation] we call brothers.  So lot of folks weren't there so you know we was we up--we in there and the older dude was the folks you know the seniors and stuff so we was fighting them to take over the school but it was still like they little brothers coming in.  So it was some tough, some tough GDs [Gangster Disciples] there but it was just also too that that pecking order thing.  Even though you a Blackstone, you--we were like probably the smallest gang in the school but they try to establish you know who was the hierarchy.  It was a lot of Vice Lords probably the Conservative Vice Lords was the biggest gang there and then kids came in that was neutrons, neutral kids they immediately joined the CVLs so they were as far as numbers they was the biggest gang, the toughest gang but like I didn't have no fear in my heart of none of them cats so like somebody said something out the way to me I'm at 'em no matter how big they are no matter nothing I didn't care.  And then like--
Speaker 1: So you got in a lot of fights?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got in a lot of fights.  Football team try to be tough and try to punk me so I got into it with them dudes too you know what I'm saying whoever really wanted it though.
Speaker 1: So you, did you play football?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  For a little while I tried out but my grades wouldn't have let me hold.  I wrestled more than I played football but my grades wouldn't let me be on that either.  I mean probably the coach would've let me stay on there but my daddy [Hubbard Jones] was like he can't--my daddy he didn't have the proper parenting skill, he was a good dude, a good provider, he just didn't have the proper parenting skills though to really deal with this new urban youth that was coming up.
Story_ID: 460574
Speaker 1: So was there anything about school you liked?  Any, any classes that you really tuned in on?  'Cause I mean 'cause you're a poet kind of writer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Biology, I liked biology.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if there was anything literary that caught your--
Speaker 2: Yeah a little bit, like yeah, when we started about Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] I was into that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: I wasn't doing poetry at the time.  I was just being a bad kid.  Yeah I liked Shakespeare one of his sonnets, I think Sonnet 173 [sic.] is the one that was my joint right there.
Speaker 1: So you were introduced to that at CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Ms. Carter [ph.] was my teacher and I mean I--she was surprised as I was that I could memorize the stuff but being dyslexic allows you to keep a, a expanded reservoir of words and increase the repertoire of your vocabulary but you have to because sometimes I mean a lot of dyslexics including myself we stutter.  We do a thing called circumlocution so if you see me taking a lot of pregnant pauses and a lot of breaths in between words and I use my hands.  I'm speaking from my, my diaphragm as a lifeway process, how, you know the natural way that you breathe without thinking about breathing.  So I use that to muster the words from deep inside me and I change the, changed the enunciation sometimes so if I can't form, if I can't form the word illustrative, I'll just illustrative which might be easy for me to say at that point in time so and circumlocution is a brain function where you bypass--
Speaker 1: That actually is the best pronunciation of the word.
Speaker 2: --it is yeah.
Speaker 1: Illustrative.
Speaker 2: The frontal lobe which has like I don't know the name of it it's like a little dam that lets you meter out words well people that stutter that's usually not working or it never been activated which back to the brain thing with the mom and stuff like that.  So you just bypass it and you just move around it and use another part of your brain to form the word, so.
Speaker 1: So at that juncture, you're in high school now, did you--did you finish high school?
Speaker 2: Nah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  It didn't look like you was going to.
Speaker 2: I finished going, I finished going though. I just (makes sound)--
Speaker 1: It didn't for what you described didn't look like you were going to finish but you did get some value, something of value out of school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I learned that I have a problem.   I was like something wrong with me.  So I was doing like I was coming home doing my homework but it was taking me extra-long to do it.  So I'm staying up to like two o'clock at night to do the English assignment and then take that to school like he's like, "C minus."  I'm like fuck C minus mother fucker is you crazy?  So I'm doing A student effort but I'm getting C minuses so I'm like I'm straight.  Now probably another teacher probably would have been kinder and judged me on a, on a broader scale, but he didn't like me, you know what I'm saying so.
Story_ID: 460575
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm not liked by a lot of dudes because I'm a different type of dude.  I'm not group oriented.  I don't--I'm not one of them dudes that seek approval from other men.  'Cause that's just not the natural way though really like we really--men are judged by how women view us you know.  Denzel Washington said that one time we was in a meeting he was like the women of the village deem men, deem men, deem a man, deem boys men.  The women of the village and it's I mean and, and I guess it's evident now if all the women say do this--him then everybody want to be around him like Denzel you know.  But if women say you know what yeah I know Denzel a good actor but he beat women your like for him goes down dramatically just because the woman said it.  So, so my thing was just trying to make sure, plus the fact that I didn't have any nurture from my mother [Earline Jackson Jones] so I was seeking nurture so all my friends were female.  Some dudes was like all, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] fag, Malik gay."  I'm like really? Think so. All right cool.  I mean I was sexually active you know so that was evident that I wasn't gay but the fact that they said it so I just let 'em say it and then after school you know I'm a pretty good fighter really good I think and so I just beat up you know it was sort of pageantry for me too I wasn't really trying to hurt 'em because I didn't have any real personal beef against them but like okay that's your way of saying well that's why he's around so many girls 'cause he gay and they don't feel threatened by him.  Well women shouldn't feel threatened by you if you a man.  You shouldn't be a threat to a female, why, what's that about?  "Well yeah 'cause they know I'm gonna try to get some."  Punk shut up so.  So I beat 'em up you know make it look pretty you know not really damaging busting they nose, busting they lip or something like that.  It'll look more dangerous than it was so my reputation got big so the cats just stopped messing with me and then I started using the school [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] as a place to sell weed so--to get some money.  And you know.
Story_ID: 460576
Speaker 1: So how long we- were you actually at CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] before you let it go?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think I really only attended the first year and after that I just was up there doing business really, gangbanging, talking to girls, messing with this particular one lady up there.  I mean mes- just you know selling weed at school.
Speaker 1: How long did they let you hang out up there before they told you I mean--
Speaker 2: I shouldn't even be saying this but yeah I used to come up there and just hang out just really just coming to school but you know what I had a teacher I'm not gonna say her name.  I'm sure she's retired by now, but I painted her classroom for her.  She found out that I had these skills.
Speaker 1: So you're an artist?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You, you I mean a painter?
Speaker 2: No, she's a science teacher.
Speaker 1: Science teacher.
Speaker 2: I painted, painted her room for her and she had other teachers like they like oh this boy so good.  And it was crazy man I was just like come to school, hang out in the assigned class, not do any--it was crazy.  I kind of like ran the school like a little grown man.  It was really strange.  Now I did go to shop.  I did go to my shop class, my vocation class Mr. Latin [ph.] he didn't play.  But I was failing everything else.  I wasn't even going.  I wasn't even doing to division.  So weird man.  Then I'd go, go to lunch period, any lunch period I wanted to they all knew me.  It was crazy.  I wonder how I did like that.  And then I would just go in the lunch room, hang out.  It was like a more fashion show for me than anything else.  I'd go to the weight room for different periods and work out and all that stuff and then I would paint her room and she had me paint her other, other teachers were like well paint my room 'cause I mean you know they would buy the paint and they couldn't get, couldn't get the school, the school wouldn't give them the--wouldn't pay for the painters to come in, professional, you know you gotta have union and stuff like that.  So I would just come in and do it.

Speaker 1: Historians wanna know the relationship between Moorish Science Temple and the El Rukns.  I mean not the El Rukns but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Blackstones [Blackstone Rangers].
Speaker 1: Blackstones yeah.
Speaker 2: Well the concept of, of the Blackstone obviously the Kaaba [Mecca, Saudi Arabia]--
Speaker 1: That is the well you know I thought it always was Blackstone because it started on Blackstone--
Speaker 2: It did--
Speaker 1: --Street [Blackstone Street, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: --but it, it had another meaning though, double meaning (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  As a poet now you're teaching me something.  All these double meanings of things, Blackstone--
Speaker 2: Yeah um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I'm sure that's all they meant at first--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then they start thinking about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Blackstone, what is a Blackstone.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's a correlation.  That's how the universe would have it though.  It has some depth to it.
Speaker 1: I'm telling you.
Speaker 2: And then you know, the Noble Drew Ali who brought forth these concepts, so our flag became you know crescent moon and five point start you know what I'm saying which is also the flag of Islam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Moorish Science Temple started, what 1915?
Speaker 2: In 1915 Noble Drew Ali established it yes sir--
Speaker 1: Noble Drew Ali so--
Speaker 2: After he came from--
Speaker 1: --how and I know--
Speaker 2: --from England.
Speaker 1: --I know it existed all the way through because there was--they had a Moorish Science Temple on 75th Street way back in the day.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Still, still, is still there.
Speaker 1: They used to come to programs all over the city.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I knew brothers in the Moorish Science Temple but how did the Blackstone Rangers get associated with the Moorish Science Temple?
Speaker 2: From what I understand it was some brothers that brought the, brought what we call the light.  Some brothers had brought the light to 'em you know concept of Islam, Islam Israel you know what I'm saying brought it forth to some of the young brothers that was gangbanging and campaigning and put forth that, that thought to 'em and they got it back to to Chief Jeff Fort who later changed his name to Chief Malik and they were already doing some programs with [HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr.  They was doing to make some stuff at the Afro-Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're doing the great nitty gritty.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm and if you also know the Blackstone choir was, was on 'Ed Sullivan Show' ['The Ed Sullivan Show'].  They sung as a choir.  They said well we not gang, we doing positive things for the youth you know baseball teams (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They did a step show thing too.
Speaker 2: --step show, you had step show, they had a choir, they did--they try to implement the breakfast program again, they were doing lunch programs, they were doing arts and crafts in the community.  They had some centers.  They were also working out of the Afro-Arts Theater on 39th Street.
Speaker 1: Right, Phil Cohran [HistoryMaker Philip Cohran] and them had yeah.
Speaker 2: Brother Phil Cohran and them they also working with Lola Falana, Noah Robinson [Noah Robinson, Jr.] which is--
Speaker 1: Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] brother.
Speaker 2: That's his brother and had a limousine service that was employing brothers as drivers, getting they licenses and so on and so forth you know but at the same time with the Islamic tinge to it when America was first you know they was kind of moving away from the Cold War theory with the Russians making them enemies that said lets you know base it on this religion you know these Muslims before this is before the first bombing of the building and stuff like that they start the Omar Gaddafi [sic. Muammar Gaddafi] and all that these radical (gesture) Muslims so of course Blackstone was a convenient target because of what we adapted into our, into our literature and how we conduct our self in pyramid and crescent moon, the five point star, all these different aesthetics you know, eastern, Af- east African aesthetics that we implementing into our demonstration.  Brothers start to dress more cultural and our hierarchy took on names like caliphs and imams and so and so forth and brothers were calling themselves sultans and so and so forth and implementing the concept of a hadin and so and so forth and we start to have Arabic and kick the Al-Fatiha so on and so forth and especially in the penitentiary where you know having the discipline of Islam kept you out of a lot of problems like you know prison sex and prison violence and prison drugs, the food that they were serving kept you know kept away from some of most of the foods and kept you out of the infirmary and you know it was start to organize but of course you know.
Speaker 1: So did the connection come, did it come--
Speaker 2: It come from the street.  It came from the street.
Speaker 1: Oh the street?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Not in prison but the--
Speaker 2: Not in prison but the prison.
Speaker 1: But it went into the prison with the brothers.
Speaker 2: It was a lot of brothers would become straight Muslims in the prison and I'm for and you know for more for like a better word forsake the Blackstone rap you know but the concepts and the Islamic over and undertones that we have in Blackstone are straight from Moorish Science Temple we you know were introduced to the Qur'an [Koran] through Blackstone you know and certain, certain codes of conduct you know.  The GDs [Gangster Disciples] kind of had like a more free ball way of moving around you know.  They would use the work B-I-T-C-H which we weren't allowed to do you know.  The n-word which we weren't allowed to say to each other you know so and so forth and our thing was about peace and our greeting became assalamualaikum you know and our meetings we had more of a prayer, it was a prayer circle more than it was a game and we address the community issues and we would raise money and do things in the community, providing school books for kids and so on and so forth.  But of course when you implement drugs into a situation because poverty is a steam engine for everything in this world, if you got poverty you can kick anything off I mean.  Any law you wanna kick off and so on and so forth so.
Story_ID: 460578
Speaker 1: Now in the '80s [1980s] I lived in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I think in the late '80s [1980s] or early '90s [1990s] brothers were standing on the corners.  They used to have these puffed up down coats they wear--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they were like you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I know what they were doing, but--
Speaker 2: If you see a kid standing outside in freezing cold on a corner, you kind of know.
Speaker 1: But as you walk as I walk by and I was in my early forties at the time you know sometimes you approach a corner with a little trepidation when you see three or four of these guys on a corner, they always say how you doing sir?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Always very polite and it was almost disarming, I couldn't understand it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It didn't seem like the normal way--
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: --this would go on but I I notice that more and more--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that was an area run by the--
Speaker 2: Blackstones [Blackstone Rangers].
Speaker 1: --Blackstones.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's and that's how we conducted ourselves.  I'm trying to tell you in the '90s [1990s] man you could leave your car door open, your purse on the seat, your house door open on my block.  I remember Ms. Glover [ph.] and peace be upon her and her husband Mr. Glover, and Mr. McGhee [ph.] and they found out we were--they were hurt 'cause I was like you know a good kid.  I mean I do fighting and lot of stuff but they like man but I told--I explained to them well like we Blackstones, that's how we get down and we wear red and you see anybody with blue on, then call the police.  If you see us running chasing somebody, don't call the police on us.  That's us.  So when they hear gun shots I remember I'm not gonna say the person name but we were shooting in the alley, ran back into the house about ten minutes after that a phone call came.  "Hello?"  "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] this you?"  "Yes ma'am."  "Was that y'all shooting?"  "Yes ma'am."  "Okay baby y'all be safe now."  For real a friend of mine's father when they found out what was going on, he was like, "I got a rifle Malik if y'all need it," because the block was safe.  Wasn't no broken bottles, no and now we had a candy store at the end of our block and so kids would come down and they would get permission to come down you know somebody was like, "Hey man, Malik you know I'm at war with y'all but my little brother and my little cousin they finna come out to the candy store on your block man is that cool?"  I'm like, "Yeah that's all right your little brother and sister they more than welcome to come on down.  They know the rules no paper dropping," and so I mean kids would you ain't like you see kids walking eating potato chips dropping, never on my block and then I had a little shortly moes- Shorty Stones [ph.] rake the leaves so the older people didn't have to do no work to they yard or nothing.  We wasn't selling no dope on the block.  No dope being sold on the block.  I remember coming home five o'clock in the morning and it a fresh snow fall oh I'm tired but let me shovel Ms. Glover's driveway.  And if I see, I see a light on and somebody room, hey man come out here and help me.  That's how, that's how we did.  I remember being drunk laying out on the, on the sidewalk like oh summertime.  I remember women coming home from work walking down the block saying that that they work the midnight shift.  Say, "Hey, I'm looking for Malik."  "Yes ma'am that's me."  "Baby it was some strange cars been around my house for two days, I wanna know can you walk me home?"  "Oh yes ma'am, as a matter of fact we all walk you home.  What block you live on Normal [Avenue]?  Okay." Which wasn't our block but we go down there you know seven deep or whatever and the dudes they wasn't gonna pull it you know they, they knew what we was on and like I say it all went bad though when dope got into it because it took it away from, it was, you know, it was a war.  Took it away from fists and put the pistols in it at all times.
Story_ID: 460579
Speaker 1: So this happens in the early, late '80s [1980s] early '90s [1990s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After, after Harold Washington was murdered--I mean after he had his heart attack, they just ain't found the heart yet so I'm sure they will one day very soon, find his heart and do a proper autopsy, but I'm sure he did have a heart attack and they put--they kept having these interim mayors and so on and so forth, and--
Speaker 1: Now how did you feel about Harold Washington when he was elected?  Because you started high school [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] in '84 [1984]--
Speaker 2: Yeah I thought it was dope like Harold Washington a black mayor you know what I'm saying can't do much worse than white mayors you know and Vrdolyak [Edward Vrdolyak] and all was against them and all that you know but I thought it was dope you know.  I know a lot of people probably was you know they was talking about his personal life.  His personal life his preference is his preference.  He a grown ass man.  He can sleep with who he wanna sleep with as long as he taking care of his--the job at hand which is to be the mayor of Chicago [Illinois] wish to control that what five, $5 billion budget come through here or whatever so $5 billion per annual that he signs off on different things now I figure like he have you know just like anybody else would have an affinity for the people that look like them and that's what we was hoping for because we had been, been unjust you know had such unfair treatment for so long you know a negatively I feel like we should have something go in our favor and when he died, my uncle's live-in girlfriend, common law wife, Pamela Westbrook [ph.] was his secretary, my Uncle Joseph [Joseph Jackson (ph.)] like I say he always had pretty girls and smart women around him.  He wasn't the brightest bulb in the, in the chandelier but and I was hurt, I was hurt when they, when they killed Harold and I think people had like a sense of pride, sense of respect when he was in there you know what I'm saying.  I think he was kind of like taken the head off of a, off of a chicken almost you know the body just gonna run around you know and I think that's what happened.  So lot of young, young black men got frustrated, the job shrank up of course and the summer program ceased to exist, the hustle got harder and the dope gang exploded.  Then the international stuff start coming in, Meigs Field [Merrill C. Meigs Field Airport, Chicago, Illinois] was bringing in dope, these little sea ports, the Calumet River and all that was bringing in dope, and I mean if I knew it, why didn't the police know it?
Story_ID: 460580
Speaker 1: So now during this time period, the '80s [1980s] the time period which you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Early '90s [1990s] really.
Speaker 1: --when did you actually stop going to CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Right after Harold Washington, I think the day Harold Washington got killed.
Speaker 1: That's '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  November--
Speaker 2: November something.  I think that was my last day at CVS.  I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what--
Speaker 2: I think--was it? Yeah probably so.
Speaker 1: --how--had you started writing at that point?
Speaker 2: Un-un, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: You hadn't okay.  So you were still basically--
Speaker 2: Just yeah.
Speaker 1: --just hanging out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I wasn't on nothing positive.
Speaker 1: You were almost your full time occupation was being a, a Blackstone [Blackstone Ranger]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my job you know.  Selling weed and selling some dope you know.
Speaker 1: What do you mean, you mean dope what were y'all selling?
Speaker 2: Cocaine, crack cocaine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But a lot of raw too 'cause you know in downtown you know a lot of people that had regular jobs caterers and bus boys and bellmen, they was--you know raw cocaine.  They was snorting and sniffing you know and my clientele at that time was probably 97 percent white maybe, 98 percent out of a hundred people yeah probably yeah about 98 percent white I think my clientele but then when, when the crack cocaine start really getting popular like popping off--
Speaker 1: Yeah that didn't really start in Chicago [Illinois] until around '90 [1990], '91 [1991]?
Speaker 2: Yeah like '91 [1991] that's when it start like you know really getting here you know.  I knew a white dude this Jewish kid from New York [New York], I say his name Ben [ph.]. That was his name actually but I ain't gonna say his last name. He was telling me about how free basing cocaine in New York and he was in rehab in and out of rehab and stuff and then I found out that it was a market for, for crack cocaine in small towns so I start hitting the road man.  Minnesota, South Dakota, shit all up--all the way 94 all the way down I-94 [Interstate 94] up and down.
Speaker 1: Selling crack cocaine?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any trepidation about that at that point? Or you're thinking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really I almost got killed in Wyoming one time.  A dude, he was a rancher, and he had you know, he was selling crack and but he had a policeman that he was giving free crack to, so. But the problem is the dude that he was giving the crack to, because he was fiend, messed up his job as a police officer, so then of course he need money so he pushed on dude the wrong way and it kicked off so that froze that up for me but you'd be surprised how many people wanna escape they whatever circumstance they in or whatever situation they in and that's what crack is, it's an escape you know.
Speaker 1: So when you were making the most money off of this how much were you making?  And how much would you have to give up to, you know?
Speaker 2: Well I'll say per month, say per week, I say per month making about thirty to fifty thousand dollars a month which is kind of lightweight actually.  'Cause it was dudes making ten thousand dollars a day. Easily.
Speaker 1: When you contrast that with the average guy with a job that's making that a year, so--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or be lucky to make it that year.
Speaker 2: Yeah so it was like a free fall, but the game you know it's always been drugs forever you know.  The Aztecs had drugs you know.  Every culture has had drugs.  People wanna escape. But something strange about American drug trade.  It was the, the sinister aspect to try to decimate communities for a political purpose and when you're looking at drugs as a crime, drugs being sold especially by kids, that's a crime.  Not on the so much on the part of the child but on the part of society that administers it.  I mean if you look the TV in them days you would have thought crack cocaine grew on some kind of plant in the ghetto.  You would have thought that you know.  That's just how they, they promoted it but we didn't know about the contras and so on and so forth, and Oliver North and all this when you add firepower to, to poverty man it's it gets real scary I mean and when you're hungry, your regard for another human's life that's not yours or not your immediate family, begins to begins to shrink.  It's people that have eaten other people because they was hungry for a week or two, eating other folks eating actual human bodies.  So to eliminate a person with a weapon that you don't know, and 'cause you got to feed yourself and feed your brothers and sisters or your mama or whoever, you know becomes so difficult especially with the fact that the media is telling you hey war is cool, at the time I think that was the first Iraq (air quotes) conflict [Gulf War] or whatever.
Story_ID: 460581
Speaker 1: So you were alluding earlier about the war that ensued around 1993 over basically over the dope territory right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So the gang colors didn't make as much difference as a--or did it?
Speaker 2: The colors nah but you know you have an affinity for your colors you know what I'm saying you know it represents something but you could wear any color though in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: When people used to fight over territory what I heard and then when the crack thing came in it was really over, over whose gonna sell in this--
Speaker 2: Yeah um-hm, it was just territory too you know but then it, it, then the mob skirmishes came up so you might have these Disciples [Black Gangster Disciples] warring with these Disciples [Black Disciples] inside one community, inside of Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] these on these blocks because they won't hey you're taking our hypes or you got--I got some bad dope, it fell off and you took all my clients now I can't get 'em back 'cause you selling bigger bags than me or whatever.  And it was like it's like it's business, it's business and America's business is to keep everybody in disarray. So if you can be telling you know the white kids, don't go to the ghetto move to the suburbs, I mean white folks move to the suburbs, then you have this you know this suburban rush and then cities you know they're (unclear) until the property value goes down so far and you come in and buy all the property up at dirt cheap and then say hey urban renewal or redistrictfication.  So they had a plan I mean it takes real strategists to do this thing.  But they got 'em.  Like a war strategist and it was dope because it was a double triple, triple punch.  You destroy the community, you kill another, another black person which is getting that person out the way then you gotta compete with they kids for jobs and then you get in the penitentiary and a prison industrial complex (claps) then you selling them weapons I mean it's a dope concept.  Now they gotta get a lawyer and your son went to law school conveniently, now they gotta get--because before that they was saying like stop sending your kids to law school, it's too many lawyers.  Now since they got those drug law, working for a drug laws and shit, hey, my son's a lawyer, you get this and then the doctors.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Emergency room.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you ever--were you ever arrested for any of this or did you?
Speaker 2: I got arrested a lot of times, no convictions though.
Speaker 1: All right, no convictions.
Speaker 2: My, my record is terrible.  My record is terrible.  I get officer friendly alert every time I--
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to do any big time?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Every time I get pulled over four, five police cars show up it's ridiculous but it happens you know.   And it just you know those were the decisions I made you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: But so many people were going to jail though.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Over just a possession of a little bit of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah they had a law, they had a law where they would check your pulse.  If your pulse was racing, they could search your car.  Now how many black people you know don't get a little bit nervous when the police come up behind them, not even put their lights on.  We don't mesh well with the judicial system--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --black folks.  That's why black folk will miss they court dates and stuff it's just something we just don't we know they not for us but you have to get passed that and take care of your business you know so they searching cats' cars and finding dope on 'em and lot of times police was selling dope too.
Speaker 1: So, so would you say that you were just lucky that you weren't put behind bars?
Speaker 2: Just a little bit smarter you know.  You know I figure like okay if I go cop some dope instead of me driving back to my side of town, I call a cab.  Take that cab to the bus, take the bus to the train.  I took the train with dope so many times from the North Side to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] but now they got this new thing (gesture) because of the terrorist they can they not trying to stop the drug trade, they trying to stop the black and Latino drug trade.  They not gonna stop dope.  They don't wanna stop dope.  They just trying to take in they--take whatever made you feel good and cocaine or whatever you was taking now it's you know heroin is OxyContin and they selling it at CVS and Target.  America don't wanna stop drugs.  They wanna stop you from making money.  Like illegal street drugs, what makes that drug illegal?  What makes it a street drug?  'Cause you don't get if from--they not getting the money, or getting the taxes off of it.  I know dudes that sold dope, still selling dope but they putting that money into, into minimarts, mini-malls and shit like that and they, they dealing with people that's higher up in the city you know what I'm saying for real.  Everybody know it's a way to pay somebody to get some dope you know what I'm saying or get some dope through but who do you pay, you just can't go pay the regular patrolman.  A twenty-three year old police officer, he not gonna go for it.  He gung ho, he's a police officer, he wanna be swat something like that but you got a dude that's finna retire he got two daughters in college and a son finna go to college, I bet you can bribe him, but you know go talk to him like I got--who do you talk to to get that popping off?  It's in every town.  You can drive from her to New York [New York] with dope and not get and drive ninety miles per hour and not get stopped and that's a whole another thing I don't wanna go too far into that because I don't want people to be thinking like I'm an advocate of that but I'm telling you it's always been drugs, people always making money off of drugs but now it's 80 percent of the money from Homeland Security [U.S. Department of Homeland Security] went through drug enforcement.
Speaker 1: Now can you tell me how high did you get up in the, in the gang?
Speaker 2: I, I mean I knew suppliers.  I knew, I knew Colombians.  I knew Mexicans.  I knew Italians.
Speaker 1: But were you considered a leader of the Blackstones [Blackstone Rangers]?
Speaker 2: Yeah at the time I had--I was high ranking member yeah.
Speaker 1: And but so we know this is going on for--this went on for a while every since you left CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] from '87 [1987] through to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah well I mean I'm still a Blackstone I mean you know it's not like, you be like, okay I'm gone now peace, I'm finished, you just stopped the negative behavior.
Story_ID: 460582
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I wanna know now like, like when did you start writing?  Because that's what you're, you're really famous for (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) During the war, during '93 [1993], during the war.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: It was so stressful, so much going on, police you know running in the house and I'm driving up into my lawn, jumping out shooting out the house, it was, it got so nuts that this poetry just start coming up out of me man.  But also I'm dyslexic so I thinking in kind of like rhythm and rhyme.
Speaker 1: So what was the first time--what happened the first time that you started writing?
Speaker 2: The first time I wrote a poem I was seeing this girl named Gigi [ph.] and she was a cheerleader at Harper High School [William Rainey Harper High School, Chicago, Illinois] and it was all Disciples [Gangster Disciples] up there but I used to go up there, drive up there in my little Blazer [Chevrolet Blazer] where I used to park like four blocks away from the house and so my mama [Earline Jackson Jones] would never see it.  So I drive up there take her flowers and candy and shit so I been out of town for a couple of days and then I wrote her a little letter, but it came out as a poem.  I didn't realize it though and she was like she paged me like I called her back, she like, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] you didn't write this."  "Write what, what you mean."  "You didn't write this who wrote this?"  I said, "I wrote that."  She said, "No, who wrote this for you for real?"  I said, "I wrote that."  Said, "My friend Anastasia [ph.] said this a poem and you ain't write this."  "It's not a poem, it's a letter."  Said, "What you mean the quietness of my voice?"  "I like the quietness of your voice you know the peacefulness.  It makes me feel like peaceful.  Like even if I got--." I used to go over her house, I had guns and shit on me but it was just something about her. She like, "That don't make sense.  Like how's my voice quiet?  I'm talking regular."  I'm like, "Yeah but--." So she didn't get it and that was how I was trying to express myself.
Speaker 1: And then I stopped for a while and then wound up going to the [U.S.] Army me and my man Mike [ph.] got caught stolen cars and that's before they had the boot camp stuff so for nonviolent offenders you could go to the Army before they had the boot camp stuff again so National Guards and then started writing letters home and stuff and it became more and more poetic you know so at nineteen years old eighteen rather, eighteen, nineteen whatever, I came back to Chicago [Illinois] but I got back on the street though.
Speaker 2: So this is about what year is this now?
Speaker 1: Ninety [1990].
Speaker 2: Ninety [1990] okay.
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989], '90 [1990] something like that so I, shoot man, I started dating one of my best friends' cousin, I really, really liked her.  I was seeing a lot of girls at the time you know and she was like, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] just stop, why don't you stop seeing all those other girls and I'm just gonna break up with my boyfriend Scooter [ph.] and me and you be together?"  I was like shit yeah come on.  I had an apartment up north.  I was like twenty had my own apartment not too far from the lake [Lake Michigan], walk over to the lake and shit and she, she didn't never break up with her boyfriend. (Laughter) She just played me man like one of my guys was telling me like, "Yeah she still with Scooter."  I'm like what?  She still with Scooter?  (Laughter) He was a conductor named Corey [ph.].  He was a train conductor.  I was catching the train back to the South Side from the North Side [Chicago, Illinois].  He was like, "Man I heard you, I heard you messing around with Maria [ph.]."  I'm like, "Messing around? That's my woman nigger."  He's like, "She still with Scooter."  I'm like, "Oh."  So I wrote her a letter but it came out as a poem talking, you know just telling her basically how hurt I was that she faked me.  She could have just been you know been 100 percent with me and that was like the first real time I realized like this is a poem.
Story_ID: 460583
Speaker 1: And then the second time I wrote one to my mother [Earline Jackson Jones], like just I just was fed up with how she was treating a nigger like it was bogus she was just--it was rough and I got drunk with some of my guys in front of the house and I had got a job as a security guard and this crooked dude man it was so crazy he was crooked, (laughter) he was an ex-sheriff.  He was an ex-Kane County [Illinois] sheriff I think or Will County [Illinois] sheriff, he was--he started his own detective agency.  I'm like, "Nigger you got more killers and drug dealers working for you than, than the government, man what is you doing?"  He like, "Yeah all you gotta do--."  Well it was a delivery system basically.  So we go out to different golf courses and stuff and at (gesture) work as security guards and just that's when I first start realizing that older white men was selling drugs.  Like that's how they so rich. They selling drugs, like real drugs.  So we deliver you know.  I don't even thing we was getting checks from them.  Was we getting checks?   Yeah they was giving us a check, giving us a weekly check or bi-weekly check or whatever.  I think we was working like two days a week or something like that but he was logging the hours.  He had it set up real sweet, white dude bunch of tattoos.
Story_ID: 460584
Speaker 1: And (laughter) I came home one night just tired of my mama [Earline Jackson Jones] dissing me you know because after a point wasn't no matter how much money I was giving her she still was treating me bogus.  I got drunk with my guy and I came in the house and I read the poem and I woke the family up, my father [Hubbard Jones].  He was like what?  He had no idea what had been going on all this time you know.  Like, so I read, that was the first poem I ever read to people and then I stopped for a long time after that like I said after that the war kicked off so when the war kicked off I just start writing poetry.  I remember the first poem I really sat down to intentionally write a poem since that one my mother was one called 'If Roses Came in Black' [Malik Yusef Jones].  'Cause I was sitting there looking at TV one day in the middle of the day I think we just had a shootout or something 'cause I remember I was still sweating and there was still dudes, I seen dude walking up and down street on security making sure nobody come down the block or come through the alley and I was looking at a commercial, it was this very attractive white woman on there you know.  And I was like she's really pretty.  But I be in small towns, I be in, I be in Nebraska, I be in Utah, I be in southern Illinois, most white women don't look like that.  I be in West Virginia, they don't look like that.  I was thinking that to myself like they put they best ones on TV.
Story_ID: 460585
Speaker 1: You were talking about how you first--your first big poem (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was sitting at home and like I said, it was these commercials then it was another one after that, then ano- then like four commercials in a row with like these beautiful white women and I thought you know, well they women they beautiful.  I mean the dopest here on the planet Earth.  There's nothing better, the the greatest thing that Earth has to offer is a woman.  That's Earth's masterpiece of all things that are on the planet.  A female human is the masterpiece.  Well I was just like well why ain't no pretty black women on TV you know what I'm saying?  They always got us represented you know through the media at our worst.  It's always a woman and not that I'm not I don't think that gold teeth are unattractive but she's just not at her best you know what I'm saying and they put them on TV at their best.  Not disheveled.  The right lighting, the right makeup, the right movement, the right music and they don't put our sisters on on there like that, that's fucked up.  'Cause [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou is beautiful and she's, she doesn't have a commercial.  And that's not right.  [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll, even though she's older now, but there's beauty in the crone's stage and she doesn't have a commercial.  So. I remember Alice Walker saying that writers are people who tell a story of some- of what has happened, what is happening, what will happen or more importantly what can happen.  So I decided to give an anthem to black women, women of color but black women in particular.  And I mean black when I say black I mean African, West Indian, African American, Haitian, black people you know. And I wrote a poem called 'If Roses Came in Black' [Malik Yusef Jones].  And that's still to this day one of my most requested poems and I wrote that in 1993.
Speaker 1: Can you give us a piece of it?
Speaker 2: I'm shy man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "If roses came in black that is exactly what you'd be.  Reborn every spring throughout eternity and if a single black swan could swim in the lake and watching her take flight, your heart just might break and if the sun could shine a twilight and warm the earth at midnight, it would be in very special honor of you.  I know you love beautiful thangs, I can kind of tell they love you too, if copper bells rang and church choirs sang each and every time your mouth would open but through all this extravagance please don't forget our romance and that's all that I've been hoping and when God allows, when God allows the flap of the bird's wings to open up those dark skies and that same black bird song she sang, opened my closed eyes and if a black butterfly could do her springtime dance and whosoever witness and be trapped in a forever trance with time I have to take my chance and if I will be captured at least it was worth one glance and if I could but only if I could I'll remind the entire earth of all types of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.  A nutritious part of my balanced diet, good for you and delicious too, no man in the world could deny it and if I could, yes love, only if I could I would forever feast on black cherries then make my mouth wet with the sweet nectar of the darker berries uncovering you like a whole string of black pearls of beauty natural and untampered, then I would stroke you like a black cat, elegant, deserving to be pampered and if an eclipse could occur for the whole world to see but the moon still shine bright mysteriously and if roses came in black, if roses came in black, if roses came in black, that is exactly what you'd be."
Speaker 1: Thank you, thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you brother, so that was the poem I wrote.  I just felt like I like you know how you like it's different in writing but I felt like even though I'm not a good artist, I felt like I was drawing a picture when I was doing it and just used the words to kind of do it.
Story_ID: 460586
Speaker 1: Now during the time period were you reading some of the black poets or anybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nah, I never.  That's something people always asked me.  I never--I read a little bit of Langston Hughes in high school [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] but I never--the poet that I read the most was Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] but I think because my father [Hubbard Jones] had always you know really educated us on what black is, you know, and that black is beautiful and he grew up in that time when it was like black is beautiful then Muhammad Ali's say, you know, he's like I'm pretty you know what I'm saying and he was a black man saying I'm pretty and at the time when black was something that was you know that was sullen and nefarious you know the concept of black was bad.  The black devil, black dog, black lie and all that and for the people just be standing up there saying you know I'm black and I'm proud.  I remember listening to that when my father take me to the Black Expo [Black Business Exposition] and seeing these beautiful--like I have you know what I'm saying all my life I've had like some kind of I don't know they say people call it color struck.  I've always liked dark complected women, I don't know just seemed that they was just like they was blacker when I was little they just seemed more like the figurines that my father would have around the house.  But as I got older listening to hip hop and you se- you heard De La Soul and Tribe Called Quest [A Tribe Called Quest] talking about blackness and the shades of blackness and black is any shade and then also the concept that you know black being black is a mind state, it's a state of mind you know.  You can be the lightest com- like Cape Verdeans, they call themselves black but they look like they white and I didn't really understand it at the time when I was like sixteen, seventeen, I didn't understand.  Like Cape Verdean yeah but you look like a white lady.  She said like, "I'm black both of my parents are black."  I'm like that's crazy.  But so the poem is kind of representative of that all types of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate so in my mind it was like and it didn't say it in the poem but it was like white chocolate, milk chocolate and dark chocolate and now I know there's more types of chocolate than that, but that's what when I say all types of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate you know.  The darkest sister and the lighter sister are still black women and it's just I think there's an elegance to that and there's a, a symmetry to that so that's what that poem was--
Story_ID: 460587
Speaker 1: Then I wrote another one, I wrote it was like a trilogy I wrote another one after that and reconnected with Lisa [ph.] who is my son's [Jabriel Jones], my oldest son's mother and I wrote a poem--because I was gangbanging and the war was on and I was selling dope.  I wrote a poem called 'Touching Africa' [ph.] because I felt that she was the closest I'd ever get to Africa.  If I didn't survive that summer which I didn't know if I was or not 'cause it was bad, it was--
Speaker 2: And you're absolutely right.  That's the worst summer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was the worse.
Speaker 2: --in terms of violence in Chicago [Illinois] in history.
Speaker 1: Oh it was crazy.  It was I mean I had my friend bleeding to death on my carpet several times you know.  It was cr- I mean windows shot out my car three times that summer you know what I'm saying so while I was in it twice.  So you know.  So I wrote 'Touching Africa' for Lisa and that was still one of my favorite poems so beautiful then I wrote another one called 'Food for Thought' [ph.] and I take the--I take everything to the tenth power like Reese Cup [Reese's Peanut Butter Cups], Tootsie Rolls anything dark, pumpkin pie I mean sweet potato pies and put this imagery together of like me loving this woman and it's like a food concept but that's what she's a good thing you know and I even used like, I've used words from different, different songs, 'Sweet Sticky Thing' and what's that, (singing) "You leave a sweet taste in my mouth, oh, sooky, sooky now."
Story_ID: 460588
Speaker 1: So I wrote all those poems that summer and other poems I wrote a poem called 'The Ceremony' [ph.] about a Native American wedding that was in the, in the forest just out in the woods and I talk about how the pine trees and the the deciduous trees and the deer and stuff was the witnesses and it was just real dope, really pretty and it's like I had a vision or something and I felt like how I wrote the poem was that I felt really like a dude walked into my room like through the wall, like a native dude and sat the corner--foot of my bed saying, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] could you write this story?  My story's never been told about me and my wife, could you write this story?"  And I--and I know that didn't happen but it still seems like it actually did.  But that's not possible for someone to walk into your room through the wall (laughter) of your bedroom but I wrote the poem that night and everyone was like, "Man what made you write that?"  I was just, I don't know, something--so the whole thing is just you know everything I've done--I did all those poems and I thought in my mind I was like I might write a book one day.  That's all I thought.
Story_ID: 460589
Speaker 1: Now when did you first perform your poetry (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I'm finna tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So it was--I had a one of my best clients she worked in the building downtown.  And she was like, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] where you been and you know what you been doing?  I haven't heard from you, you know come down and see me I need something from you." (Unclear) So I came down, she gave me the code for what she needed and I was like, "Well you ain't heard from me because I been writing poetry lately you know I'm just kind of getting to myself and you know it was a lot of war going on."  She said like, "I heard about it I'm so sorry.  I was wondering if you was--they say guys was getting killed.  I kept looking for your name on TV.  I said but Malik's too tough to be get killed." (Laughter) I was like, "Nah, I'm not too tough to get killed baby." I was like, "But I was a little smarter than most dudes."  She like, "You been writing poetry?"  I'm like yeah and I told her red--'Roses Came in Black' [sic. 'If Roses Came in Black,' Malik Yusef Jones] to I recited and she's like, "That is so beautiful."  I'm like, "They always put white, white girls on TV like they the only ones that's pretty."  She like, "I know.  I think that all the time and they don't represent me 'cause I'm a brunette."  I was like, "Yeah but you still get more love than the sisters though."  She was like, "That's true, it is lopsided."  And she like, "Why don't you go read that somewhere then?"  I was like, "Read it somewhere?"  I ain't never heard of open mic.  I'm like, "Read?" She like, "Yeah there's a place called Weeds [Weeds Tavern, Chicago, Illinois] and there's a place called Green Mill [Green Mill Cocktail Lounge, Chicago, Illinois]."  I'm like, "Really?"  She like, "Yeah you should go down there, they do open mic poetry.  Just stand there and do poetry."  I was like oh that's crazy.  Now I wrote other stuff like soldier story about like me in the street basically and praying every day that I don't die because I'm doing this for my family, I'm doing this for my sister and you know so on and so forth and so that Sunday I went to Green Mill and Marc Smith the inventor of the slam of poetry slams--
Speaker 1: Now where is the Green Mill in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Al Capone's old hangout on Broadway and Lawrence [Avenue] I think.  Yeah Broadway and Lawrence.  Al Capone's--they said he had an underground tunnel that drove all the way from the South Side to the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] and he drive his car all the way through it.  I thought that was untrue until they had the floods of the city.  Remember the city flooded?  They were like this underground of Chicago is flooding.  I was like the underground?
Speaker 1: Oh the subbasement.
Speaker 2: The subbasement. They said the subbasement, it was just all those old tunnels, old Chicago you know and they finally flood them of course that was they excuse for going down there and tearing them to pieces but that's how the mob used to move, you know and all kind of stuff used to move, that's how they did it.  But and Mark Smith used to brag about it too like, "Yeah Al Capone could drive his car in here."  That's crazy actually from downtown like he had a tunnel.  But Chicago is a new level anyway but--so I went down there and had my little paper with me, had a legal pad like that, little yellow legal pad. And I was the only black somebody up in there.  Nah there was another dude but you know he was--different cloth.  Got on stage, read my little poem and they was like people clapped for me and stuff and he was like, "You gonna enter the slam?"  I'm like, "Slam?  What's that?" He like,  "It's a competition."  I'm like, "Nah I ain't on that."  He like, "Yeah you might as well get in people you get free beers."  I'm like, "I'm straight I got money man, I'm good."  And (laughter) I saw how it worked and I stayed and he said, "Can you come back next week?"  I said, "Next week yeah.  I'll come back next week."  He said, "Okay.  Make sure you come back next week and be on time seven o'clock."  Okay.  I'm gonna come back I must be really good.
Story_ID: 460590
Speaker 1: And then that night I went home, instead of going out in the street I wanted to go out to the club or something but I didn't. And I saw on TV Tesh- Tekesha her name was Crystal Tekesha (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] T'Keyah Crystal Keymah yeah.  Yeah, she's from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I had missed the news earlier but I caught the late after news and they was like yeah she was in Chicago at a place called Spice [sic. Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois] the jazz bar where they have, where they have comedy, 'Edge of Sanity' comedy ['The Edge of Sanity'] doing they Allen Edge [Allen D. Edge].  I'm like oh a comedy club.
Speaker 2: Yeah Allen Edge right yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah it was like and that's on Sunday nights.  I'm like oh man I ain't gonna be able to go because I'm a be at that poetry thing.  Oh like maybe I should go to that instead.  I'm like no he asked me to come back I gave him my word and they said also Monday nights they have open mic poetry.  I was like open mic poetry, wow that's what I'm doing so I can go the next night.  So things had got bad, something happened I think somebody stole like some of my cars off where I was getting like I keep my cars at and it was like so like Friday was rough, Saturday was rough so I was like man so I had borrowed my dad's [Hubbard Jones] sta- work car his station wagon.  I was like I'm a go to this poetry thing.  He's like oh well whatever.  Like yeah I'm doing poetry man, it's stand up.  I told him about it.  I didn't really wanna go but I remember driving like it was like gloomy.  I think one of my guys just got shot, it was fucked up.  And I was like man I'm a go and I get there [Green Mill, Chicago, Illinois] and I walk in and it's lit up like this.  It's lights everywhere.  I'm like this don't why'd they fucking change.  This is crazy, why'd they, why is this like this?  I'm looking and like part of the room you can't walk to and the other part where the people was at the slam people was at the last time I walked past this big thing and it say it look like ABC worldwide news, why in the--I'm like ABC worldwide news? Before I can even soak it in, Marc [Marc Smith] was like, "Good you're here.  You're up now."  I was like huh, well let me--got my note pad, went on stage man and because I was a gangbanger so I had my hat broke off to the left.  I get up there and I did my little poetry and they taped me and filmed me and stuff but it was like set up for this other guy that they gonna turn out to be a big poet so they had him win.  I was in the slam, I didn't even know it so people clapped for me but this other guy won, even though my poem was better actually.  Probably my delivery wasn't 'cause I was new that was like you know my second time on stage, so.

Speaker 1: The next night I went to Spices [Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois] and it was all these black people in there with dreadlocks and shit and I'm like oh wow I can do 'If Roses Came in Black' [Malik Yusef Jones] here.  Ted Witcher [Theodore Witcher] was the host.  They had alternating hosts.  I didn't know Ted Witcher from Adams house cat but on the marquee it said, "Tonight hosted by Ted Witcher," and it had a theme the night light was love was the theme.  He's like, "We have a newcomer. A brother name Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones].  Yeah, come on up do your poetry brother." So I came I had my paper, I said like I can do this off memory.  So I did the poem and to see the look on the face of the sisters was just, man. Pamela Wood [ph.], Mama Maria McCray and Sherry Simpson [ph.] and all these just beautiful sisters in there and I did the poem and they stood up and clapped for me.  I was--I couldn't believe it like man so I went to the back and used the pay phone and called my sister like Lola [ph.], you won't believe I came to this poetry club it's called Spices and I remember I had a pistol with me at .25 because it was by Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] on Franklin [Street].  I had a .25 in my back pocket a little pistol but you know just in case and so, "Like for real they stood up and clapped for me sound like it's black people, they got incenses [sic. incense]."  She like, "For real?  Where is this at?  In Chicago [Illinois]?"  I'm like, "Yeah downtown you won't believe it's called Spices Jazz Bar." And when I got off stage when I came back in the room, Ted Witcher was like, "That's what I'm talking about, that brother came up here that's black love right there you know.  Not talking about you know who ain't African enough," and Ted's a very light complected dude you know probably biracial I'm assuming. Well can't be biracial, there's only one race in people, that's human but multiethnic I guess and he was just like real like nice to me like, "Man brother good job." And I was like man, just to be accepted in that crowd and it was a guy named Regie Gibson there that night who the famous dude on the scene, it was him. Dark skinned brother, had the African garb on and his delivery was sharp and was, "Hey brother," du, du, du, I was like man this dude cold, woah.  I was caught up in the frenzy too.  "Oh Regie Gibson, oh."  That was Regie's guy.  So--I mean Ted's guy.
Story_ID: 460592
Speaker 1: So I started to--and then I was at another place called Weeds [Weeds Tavern, Chicago, Illinois] I went to because I went to Spices [Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois] and they lost they PPA [Public Place of Amusement], that's when the city really started really changing stuff and making it hard for little jazz clubs and stuff to survive and I didn't understand it then like little taverns and stuff they had like open mics, they took those PP- they changed the parking permits for one in the, in the communities if you didn't live there you couldn't come there so if you had lived there before when you was a kid and you moved out, you couldn't come back and park.  That destroys the camaraderie in the communities because everybody's parents go to this place so you know, you know little Ray Ray's [ph.]--, "I was with your mama last night, get yo ass off the street," you can't do that no more 'cause you gotta go party here, you can party there downtown, so now a new neighbor move in, they don't get to come to the tavern.  "Hey, who are you, how you doing?"  That's how it used to be.  So I didn't understand that until I became an activist and understood why they did that, it was (unclear) you know his gran parte, he thinks that the government is always up to something but I also listen to the poetry, people was like you know explaining you know gentrification and shit like that and I was just like dope. So I went to, went to Spices and they didn't have the poetry 'cause they didn't have the PPA and the dude kind of broke it down to me like what it was.  We went to Weeds a white owned spot who saw it coming and went and got they PPA up front you know what I'm saying so Spice was closed for like a month, they had all the small bars had to apply for it and they had to have the money together so then--
Speaker 2: What does PPA stand for?
Speaker 1: Public performance of amusement.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Public Place of Amusement.
Speaker 1: Public Place of Amusement, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay all right just want to make sure--
Speaker 1: Yeah Public Place of Amusement and so you know you couldn't have people doing any kind of entertainment you couldn't charge, you can't charge for it.
Speaker 2: Unless you get that license?
Speaker 1: Yeah so you can't make money.  They can perform it, but you can't charge so you can't make no money off of it which is you know a lot of open mics and karaoke bars they draw.
Story_ID: 460593
Speaker 1: So I went to Weeds [Weeds Lounge, Chicago, Illinois] and there was this dude who would do poetry for beer so he would do these poets about knights of the roundtable and Vikings and all this shit so I did a poem called 'Live Where the Demons Live' [ph.] and it was about basically about poor people and how we demonize our poor in America and how that western thought has permeated the world.  Like why do we hate our poor?  Why do we hate them so much?  And he cried and bought me a beer.  Now I didn't know he was a famous dude down there and that's my first time ever being there.  So at that point I kind of saw there was some hands at work like something is to it.
Speaker 2: Is this still about 1994?
Speaker 1: This the same, this the same month.
Speaker 2: Same month okay all right.  So this is '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993] okay.
Speaker 1: February '93 [1993].  This all in the same month so I invited Lisa [ph.] to come down and see me do poetry after that but after I got back up with her but I did my poetry and because Spices [Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois] lost they license [Public Place of Amusement license], I didn't do poetry no more for a while.  I kind of got back in the street and you know '93 [1993] was what it was and it became one of those situations where I kind of just lost the lust for it. Like it was like what am I going down there for you know when my niggas need me in the hood whatever that kind of concept and when I had a chance to perform for the first time outside of open mic, this girl hired me to do her graduation party.  She like, "Do that poem about the buttercups, about the Reese's Cups [Reese's Peanut Butter Cups]."  I was like, "Oh you talking about 'Food for Thought' [ph.]." So I did that and she had a lot of women there and I met this woman that was an ex-model named Max [ph.] she was, she's a piece of work.  She's like forty-seven.  I was a shorty.  She was like yeah you too young baby but what I do to you you wouldn't be able to take it, I'm sorry.  I was like wow.  (Laughter) She just blew my mind and April of two months later, they aired the ABC episode.  Now tell you something crazy about that, I got about fifty calls because when they was talking about they gonna do this new phenomenon in the country slam poetry, so happens my brother and father [Hubbard Jones] were at home looking at TV and they showed a glimpse of me.
Speaker 2: So this is on ABC--
Speaker 1: ABC worldwide news.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: April 10, 1993.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A Sunday and people were calling me like, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] you finna be on TV."  So I called Lisa like, "Lisa," 'cause we just went out four days before that April 6 and they showed this thing about slam poetry in the country, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] they showed San Francisco [California], I believe New York [New York] maybe L.A. [Los Angeles, California] but definitely Chicago [Illinois] and they talked about like you know and the poets they wanna do this and some just wanna be heard and they showed me at the very end doing my poetry off of a pad. And (laughter) that was Sunday.  Monday I went back down to Spices and they treated me like a celebrity but I didn't realize that everybody in the country had saw me that knew me had saw me on there.  So now I'm getting hired.  That was the only my third time on stage ever in my life and they filmed that.  You know I took a huge sabbatical after that.  So I was still a very much a novice and what's crazy was that people because they saw me on TV and this before you know cable was really big and all that and they didn't have no--that was something big.  Your friend on TV doing poetry that was huge and they only had small little (gesture). So I start getting back into poetry and start going back and my, my prominence start to move up and me not understanding you know I became an enemy of Regie Gibson who was the premiere black poet on the scene you know.  He was relatively young guy.  He was like maybe thirty or something like that and he--sexy and you know had sexy poems and shit and so now I'm coming--I'm getting my own following now.  I'm getting a following and I'm working with Oba William King.  I start working with him doing stuff in schools and we put a play together and I would do his functions and stuff.
Story_ID: 460594
Speaker 1: And so (laughter) one night at Spices [Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois] man, two couples walked in.  One couple, one guy was black and the young lady was also black and then the guy, young black guy with a white girl, they were together though two couples and I guess they heard about this Spices 'cause I was promoting it and other people I was having people come down and like some younger poets were coming in you know people my age were coming in. And Luther [Luther Minner] and Diane [Diane Minner] were the proprietors of it, and I kept wanting to be a host 'cause they had alt- rotating hosts so I would sign up every--, "When you gonna let me be a host I got a following?"  But Luther you know he like, "Man I'm a tell you man Diane just don't like your kind man she don't understand the guy with baggy jeans and all that man you know man don't take it personal young brother."  I'm like why she won't let me be a host?  I bring--people come down here to see me.  But the host also get a little paper, she wanted to keep her little rotation of her people, deejay and well Ted [Theodore Witcher] had moved after that.  Ted had moved out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  I think that was his last time at Spices actually. So they come down and this dude named Chill Will and this dude, I ain't gonna say the other dude name 'cause he's a prominent author and another dude named Otis [ph.], they was all like Regie's [Regie Gibson] little minions I guess that was his squad, jumped out his seat.  And said, "Intruder, intruder, intruder, intruder, danger Will Robinson."  And the little girl turned that red man.  And it just hurt me so bad like and she grabbed hold to his hand, the boy she was with and he instinctly like let it go, like grabbed it let it go like to say I'm not with her.  And I just could only imagine how alone she felt in a room full of black folk, the only white somebody in there. And then when they did that it was a group up on stage that was doing a rap and they said, "Well when we say the word bitch we aren't talking about black women, we talking about white women," and that was all in conjunction with the same time and they had to walk to they seat and sit in the booth and he looked like somebody had just offered to let him cut his whole head off with an axe and she just looked defeated.  I don't even know what, how to explain what the look in her face.  And I almost cried.  And there was women, black women in the audience that think felt like they didn't have enough power to speak against Regie and his people because he had a--they had a group called Tribe from the Scribe--Scribes from Tribes [ph.] and they was like the pre-eminent little poetry group inside of this little enclave of black folk at Spices which was like the premiere poetry spot for black folk and I was gonna do a poem that night called 'How Does It Feel to be Black' [ph.].
Story_ID: 460595
Speaker 1: 'How Does It Feel to be Black' [ph.] was the poem I was gonna do and I was like I can't in good conscience--even though I wanted to do it for the crowd.  I think this is kind of where you hit that fork in the road you know like who am I doing this for?  I start to uplift people with this and uplift myself if I do the 'How Does It Feel to be Black' and just have them say yeah that's right we so down trying--which is true.  Black people we've had it rough man you know since the, you know.  I mean post colonization of Africa has been you know (laughter) pretty much all downhill for black people if you, if you made it, it's been because you beat the odds not because the odds are in your favor at all and I was gonna do that just because there was so much information I wanted to put out and let people know that I'm grown in the time I've been in their presence.  But I had to come to the rescue of this girl.  Because it was an atrocity and it has to be addressed.  So I didn't have anything written for an occasion like that 'cause I never saw reverse racism.  That's my first time.  I didn't even know it existed.  I didn't even know--I didn't even call it reverse racism 'cause I didn't even know what it was called.  It was just a human thing you now and so I went on stage and I said, "Hey Spices [Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois]."  They was going like, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones], Malik."  Mama Maria McCray right there to the right as always.  She's part Filipino actually too.  Her mother is Filipino and I said I was gonna do a poem called 'How Does It Feel to be Black.' "Well do it then, do it."  I said, "Well I can't.  Ain't nobody gonna say anything about what just happened, this baby walked in here to--into a place where we say we embrace people and we are uplifting and we are positive and we--and it's love in here and you are safe here and I can't--I--nobody in here will want to change places with her right now.  Our ancestors walked into places to get coffee and got that kind of treatment but they were expecting it.  She walked in here expecting the reverse.  Like if you ever had what you thought was a glass of lemonade but you were anticipating the sour, slightly bitter sweet taste of it and it's water, that's warm, have you ever had that happen before?  When I was a little kid of course that happened to me."  Said, "That's what happened to her I'm assuming." And I was like, "And you know I used to really look up to you Regie [Regie Gibson] and to the other dude and then Otis [ph.] and Chill Will, I thought y'all was the greatest man.  When I came in here I said, 'Man these brothers--.' I said, 'Man y'all broke my heart today man.  I ain't gonna lie, you broke my heart and like I'm so mad that if any of y'all--'cause y'all frowning up got a problem with it, we can go outside.  Y'all don't know me like that dude; we can go outside in this parking lot and handle everything.'  Otis is a big dude and I'm like, 'Otis you the main one.  You soft.  You ain't no real dude man'."  And I hadn't known any of his history of how he had a child by a white woman and later on I found out that he took a chair, brought her on stage at Spices and did a poem about how inadequate she was because she was white and she wasn't like the rest of them.  This was before my time at Spices and nobody said anything let him do this shit to his--this woman who's pregnant with his child and how much of a mistake he made but again trying to fit in with these chumps who all these punks were soft, wasn't no real men to do that because they you know to abuse your power when you're more power to abuse your power to somebody that has none, to just I mean this girl was defenseless and they attacked her, that's not right.  I don't care who you are.  Mr. Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] talked about that you know and it's also teaches in Islam too but and I said so I said, "Man Spices this is for anybody y'all show me love, I'm a show you love back.  Show me your ass, I'm a show you my foot, brothers."  I said, "Man whatever y'all drinking y'all got it on me.  Y'all ain't gotta worry about nothing the rest of the night."  Ain't none of these chumps gonna say nothing to y'all and I ain't never talked like that on the stage at Spices before.  I kept the street Malik in the street.  This was the new Malik I was creating and they brought the old Malik right on out and he never ca- went back in after that.
Story_ID: 460596
Speaker 1: So my poetry career took an even different turn.  Now people was like man, come talk to my kids.  They identify with you.  You what, you fighting and stuff.  But you know I be wearing pink and head wraps and shit mother fucker didn't know you know.  I looked like a soft dude you know.  But you know I guess I prefer looking like that but so I went and sat with them and got they names and talked to them and you know by the end of the night she was laughing and smiling and Mama Maria McCray got up there and did her poetry about the fact that her mother was Filipina and light complected.  She thought her mama was white.  She didn't see the difference between the white people and her mother until they went to a place one time when Mama Maria said they had to sit down and she was like, "Mama, why you can't go up there, you just as light as them pink people?"  She said, "Well I got you with me baby and I'm not gonna have my daughter sit down while I'm sitting with my elevated above her, I'm not gonna have it."  Now her mother--she said, Maria she understood that we do have a right--we can't no matter who you are you can fight and I thought that was real dope that she did that poem that night.
Story_ID: 460597
Speaker 1: And so after that it was like they turned against me you know all those poets that was under the Regie Gibson regime they turned against a nigger so I kind of left Spices [Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois] and start doing my own shit you know what I'm saying, my own open mics and just created my own thing called Full Moon Poetry me and Oba William King and this bask created a Full Moon Poetry.  The full moon of every month, we either the eve, the day or the night or the day after the full moon, we create, we do a poetry event in the city and one night we went head up with first Fridays man and it was like we had it packed and people was like what?  So we start having all the cool people come out.  'Cause I took poetry from the poetry clubs and took it out to mainstream, start doing it at All Jokes Aside [Chicago, Illinois], the Cotton Club [Chicago, Illinois] and the Comedy Clique [Chicago, Illinois] anywhere my homies that was comedians was performing, I'll perform poetry.  I remember people saying they like, "We calling Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] come to--Malik Yusef come to the stage he's, he's a poet."  These girls like, "He's a poet?  They found a poet to come up here?" And I was sitting right next to them I'm like, "Yeah he gonna do--."  He gonna get up there and recite a poem?  That don't make no sense.  This was '94 [1994] and I was like I walked up there, did my poem and I had one about my son's mother because she tried to take my son [Jabriel Jones] from me.  I had to go to court to fight for him and shit.  So my career all started to come full circle.  I was friends with Tupac [Tupac Shakur], who introduced me to Biggie [Biggie Smalls; Notorious B.I.G] in New York [New York] when he was doing a movie called 'Above the Rim' but you know Pac used to--he was wild so they made him take the movie to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] but Pac was the first person that really introduced me to music outside of Chicago [Illinois] like MC Hammer concerts and he would page me from weird area codes 860 area code.  I'm like, "Man where you at dog?"  He like, "I'm in Denver [Colorado]."  It was just crazy man.  And I didn't have any aspirations of doing music that was you know then I start doing poetry, we would kick poems before I start doing poetry--
Story_ID: 460598
Speaker 1: Ted Witcher [Theodore Witcher] came back in town and was looking for me but Regie [Regie Gibson] didn't give him my information so a guy named Mark Goldstein [ph.] found me and called me and said, "Ted's been looking for you, they shooting a movie 'Love Jones' in Chicago [Illinois], they want to bring Larenz [Larenz Tate] down to the Cotton Club [Chicago, Illinois] where you're hosting at."  I was hosting Tuesday nights down there.  Spices [Spices Jazz Bar, Chicago, Illinois] had long since fell apart so they came down, him and Nia Long and I was doing my poetry and Common used to come down and free style with me and it was like them my homies you know what I'm saying.  He wasn't that big, he wasn't this guy now but he was you know a local rapper that was good and (laughter) I show up on the set the next day fam, and Regie had on this African garb as always and when he walked out the, the church that they were using for the scene in 'Love'--the club scene in 'Love Jones' he walked dead into me.  I was like, "Regie what's up?"  But I was at peace for what had happened to us you know man I threatened I said, "I'll beat you up," he didn't wanna fight that was it.  I'm cool with it you know what I'm saying.  I'm street you ain't gonna hold a grudge somebody 'cause they threaten to beat you up forever unless you just fight 'em.  Like hey, hey.  Ted was like, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] I been looking for you."  I'm like, "Man okay I'm on deck what you need?"  So I went to, (laughter) so I went over there in the room with all the extras.  I was supposed to be in the principal room though I didn't know, I didn't know.  My first time being on a movie set.  I seen my friends that I knew a couple of my friends so I'm over there kicking it with them, eating they cafeteria food and the whole nine kicking it and just you know being me.  And they would keep calling me for the set and I was doing my poetry and stuff on the set and Larenz was like, "Malik you supposed to be eating over here with us."  They had the good cuisine, the eggplants and shit over there.  So I would eat my food over there with the principal stars and go back to the extra room and kick it with them and the dude was like, "Where you be at during lunch?"  I said, "Ah man I don't be eating lunch over here no more, I eat over there with them, they be wanting to talk to me and stuff about you know how poetry is now."  And he was like, "Mean to tell me you be over there and you come back and kick it with us?"  I like, "Yeah."  He was like, "Man you a real dude.  First when you came I thought you was just some loud mouth thug off the street man.  So you Malik Yusef the dude, you Larenz Tate," so everybody was like aw but you a regular dude so that made my popularity go up in the city from all the little different actor enclaves that they have and then the movie was being shot and this is the sad part.  So I was telling everybody about the movie and Regie would see me at different poetry places 'cause we was still kind of at the same level almost.  I had the streets more but he had the poetry crowd kind of on smash and he be like, "Hey Malik tell people about our movie."  I'm like, "Oh yeah that's right we did something we 'Love Jones' me and Regie gonna be in it you know.  Regie doing a poem, I'm doing a poem in it.  Regie wrote the poem for Larenz.  I trained him how to do it, it's gonna be dope called 'Love Jones'," not realizing that the poem was about Spices and Darius Lovehall was the Regie was the blend between Ted Witcher and Regie's character, I mean as people his character was a blend between these two guys.  So you know my motorcycle riding that's Ted you know, you know all the women screaming that's Regie.  So I didn't know that they had the friends.  I mean after Spices I would go back to the hundreds.  They would go out to eat breakfast at somebody's house or dinner or Tempos [Tempo Cafe, Chicago, Illinois] whatever I didn't know.  That was they had a clique I didn't know nothing about it.  So everywhere we at he like, "Malik don't forget to tell people--."  Him and the big dude Otis [ph.] they be like Otis be like, "Yeah tell 'em about the movie."  I'm like, "Yeah man I'm gonna be in this movie, it's gonna be dope."  So I'm telling everybody that I know, every poetry that I'm at, no matter what stage I'm on I'm calling people I'm like man I'm gonna be in this movie 'Love Jones' so when the commercials start running like premieres I was calling everybody, "Man don't forget to go see 'Love Jones' when it come out I'm gonna be in it, I'm gonna be in it."  Man I get a call they said, "Yeah we having a premiere at Piper's Alley [Chicago, Illinois] come on," so I see Bill Bellamy and Nia Long, "Hey what's up Nia my baby, what's up."  She like, "You don't call me no more."  "Yeah I been doing, been getting my poetry together for this my big moment you know."  "Yeah we been to three premieres already."  I was like, "Y'all been to three premieres?"  Like, "Yeah." Like, "This is dope."
Story_ID: 460599
Speaker 1: So it come on. (Makes sound) Regie [Regie Gibson] doing his poem, some other poem.  He playing the congos I'm like, "Regie, yeah."  He like, "Yeah."  He like yeah he on the other side of the room like so I'm (laughter) sitting next to Bill Bellamy and the movie is going on and on and I'm like, "You sure I'm in this movie?"  He like, "Oh you in here man."  I'm like, "Okay."  On and on and on and on.  Like, "Dude is you sure?"  They serving up the popcorn and stuff you know, they come in there with the popcorn.  Why they serving us popcorn?  So I'm like dude so I ask him a third time I said, "You sure?"  He like, "I think yeah you are in here."  I'm like they called me and got the spelling of my name like I should so now I'm feeling like I'm shrinking in my seat a little bit I'm like oh my God I told everybody in the world, Canada everywhere I knew people I told them I was gonna be in 'Love Jones' everybody (laughter) man so, pow, there it goes me on screen, the whole screen is me and this music playing and I can't really hear myself.  Why am I not hearing what I was--and it's gone.  If I could have took some kind of secret pill to die, I would have did it right then and there.  You talking about crushed.  Four point five seconds with me doing this with no words coming out my mouth.  They playing music, it's in a collage of scenes with them running through the forest and they had a poetry then they look on stage and it's me four point five seconds of me doing this and then it's gone.  So I'm sitting there, they roll the credits; I'm still in a daze.  Malik Yosef, Y-O-S-E-F [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones], oh final blow, (makes sound).  I pulled--I pealed myself off the seat, muster every bit of manhood inside me, every bit and I stand up and I walk out into the lobby where there is everybody that Regie's invited to the premiere because Ted's [Theodore Witcher] his man.  So he got passes for everybody.  They all around him Regie, people taking pictures of him and stuff.  Man I'm like man that's his big break.  But the woman that played, she played the guy Juvon [ph.]--she played his wife that left him in movies, she, she had her husband, she like, "Come here."  She like, "Malik this my husband."  She like, "And I told him about you since we shot the movie."  She said, "You are an incredible person.  It's like you gonna get don't worry about them niggas over there forget them.  You gonna make it.  All your dreams gonna come true.  You are a beautiful man.  I don't even kiss no men in front of my husband.  But I gotta give you a kiss 'cause I love you and you are so sweet." And I was so crushed that gave me a little bit a chance to breathe like I was forgetting how to breathe, fam. I was like and so I had to walk past Regie and everybody and he like, "Hey how you doing?  You all right?"  Looking at me like I was like, "Man, congratulations, Ray."  I'm saying and plus they had him in another scene like with Larenz [Larenz Tate] like he was Larenz buddy and I was friends with Larenz.  Larenz was in Chicago [Illinois] kicking it with me.  They had him at the table he like all right Regie I'm like they gave this dude this much love in this movie?  But it was based on their whole relationship thing you know what I'm saying so he was like, "Hey after this we gonna be over having some coffee at the Siena Cafe [ph.]," or something like that.  Sibianna Cafe [ph.] something like that.  I'm like, "Okay I'm a come through there."  (Unclear) 'cause like how the movie comes out the next day, that Friday, that was a Thursday night. People gonna see that and I told everybody in the world that I'm finna be in this movie.  I don't know how I'm--I can't I'm not gonna be able to live this down.  So I moped into the garage, got in the car.  I was like well I'm a go by there I don't wanna be like I'm a bitter person so the Sienna Cafe is closed.  So I'm like they closed okay.  I'm a go over here to this tiki lounge and get me a white zombie and just get bubbly.  I go in there and guess who in there?  Regie and his minions. (Laughter) And I said God is against me.  She hates me and that's just what it is.  I did some bad stuff in my life I guess that she can't let me get past so I walked in there and he like, "Hey you made it huh, you found us?"  I'm like oh god how did I find you but yes I did.  Like, "Again man Reg," but sincerely I'm like, "Congratulations though fam, that's big for you, you out of here."  He like, "Oh yeah they gonna be calling having me do poetry everywhere you know, that's just what's just what's gonna happen."  I'm like, "I know, that's great congratulations."  "Want a chicken finger or something?"  I was like "Yeah."  Tried to eat, I couldn't even eat the chicken finger.  I was that sick.

Speaker 1: Got in the car went on to the crib.  I was doing something at a youth organization in Humboldt Park [Chicago, Illinois] YSP [Youth Service Project] and I gave everybody number said if you don't catch me check me in my little office, I'll be working with kids in the evening time, I went up there early.  Mary Scott Boria who is the director she was like and no Michelle Obama called me that morning.  She said, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] did your movie come out?"  I said, "It's out today Michelle."  She said, "I heard you got a--."  "Well not really you know.  They cut my part down."  She said, "Oh baby, that's okay.  Me and Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] gonna go see it anyway."  Of course y'all are, y'all mean y'all go see it any way.  And Mary Scott Boria (unclear) she's like, "What's wrong?"  I said, "They cut me down Mary."  She's like, "Really?"  Said, "That happen to my husband all the time."  Her husband was a visual artist.  Man, dude, phone calls start, phone calls start coming in, people that went to the matinee and stuff.  They like, "Like I seen you in 'Love Jones,' good job."  I was like what?  Who, is this a trick?  And the phones just keep ringing, San Diego [California]; Albuquerque [New Mexico]; Montana; Oakland [California], all over Illinois.  People just calling me.  "What's up fam, I seen you man.  Whoa that's my man boy, that's--."  I'm like what?  Did y'all see this shit?  I didn't--the other movie different I'm okay I'm finna break out.  I go to the movie theater immediately and look at the movie and like man they must have maybe the premiere they messed up.  No the same shit.  But because I promoted it so much, I promoted it so much, I gave you the vision of it so much that people thought it was bigger than it actually was.  Now if I hadn't promoted that little four point five seconds, people wouldn't have even noticed it.  I think I seen you in a movie maybe that what was said.  But people was calling me, my cousins, my cousin said she went to the movies like in Orland Park [Illinois] or something and they said some people that was in the movie theater not with her was like there go Malik boy, Malik, Malik Yusef.  White people was like, "We know okay, we know."  Like every time we see--like the people knew that like it was big thing so Regie [Regie Gibson] came back to me like, "Hey Malik since the movie's out," we been hearing about the responses.  And like, "We should do stuff together."  I'm like, "Yeah I be in the hood though, I be in the projects and shit do my poetry.  You can come on though you know what I'm saying do a little programs," he--but that wasn't his style.  So I'm doing stuff in the projects, talking to this youth and using the fact that I was in a movie to reach 'em and they listening to me.  They mama tell them to make up they bed, they probably ain't gonna do it but Malik Yusef who was just in 'Love Jones' tell 'em, they honoring it.  Same message they mama just gave them yesterday.  I could tell them, "Hey make up y'all beds every day and I'll be back to y'all school at the end of the year."  Whatever, whatever the message teacher was trying to give 'em.  I said what y'all trying to teach these kids what?  Okay.  I go say it and they honored it.  Regie start you know that really wasn't his style he wanted the big pageantry that he thought was surrounding me but they come from the organic aspect you know.  It's just me being who I am walking these streets for real and really doing programs like Girls' World telling girls that you can do anything you wanna do because nobody ever told them.  They fourteen nobody ever told them you can be what the hell you wanna be.  Ain't no limits.  You wanna be--you wanna swim with the dolphins, you can be an oceanographer.  Nobody never told them that and you be surprised what permission does to a person.

Speaker 1: You now I thought it might be a good time to interject.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of hip hop lyrics--
Speaker 2: Aw man.
Speaker 1: --are criticized for being misogynistic--
Speaker 2: They are.
Speaker 1: --and you know and you seem to be doing just the opposite so.
Speaker 2: I know that be wigging me out too.  Like how I attained this level of prominencey and--
Speaker 1: But when you look at it again, I mean your relationship I mean with your mother [Earline Jackson Jones] was pretty traumatic relationship--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --so you would think if anybody was gonna be misogynistic, it might be you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but it's not like that.
Speaker 2: I don't know why though.
Speaker 1: So I don't know how to--
Speaker 2: Maybe it was my grandma maybe I don't know.  It's weird maybe I was just made this way.  Maybe I'm just designed maybe God she like made me per- just like for a personal person for her like just like her little personal person.  I don't know why I'm designed like this.  It's weird, but it's in me though.  It's not like something I do.  It's really in me like for real, for real to the, to the root.  Even though I get mad at women and be like why is she acting like this too but I just I do something different with that though?  I say well maybe if we, maybe if I do better.  Maybe it came from my mother.  Maybe because my mother didn't love me, I was trying to figure out ways to help her to love me.  'Cause can't nobody love you but maybe it came from that.  So I come from more a problem solver assessment because I don't argue with sisters, I don't argue with women.  Unh-uh 'cause you can't really win an argument with a woman.  They too quick.  They brain too quick.  You will lose.  'Cause the argument changes then they now it becomes a thing where they saying I don't like this either then.  Okay that's good because women are naturally you know they check you.  That's what they do.  They, they are better disciplinarians than men because they call you on your stuff.  We don't like that.  Men, we naturally sloppy.  We like to just (laughter) do it like we want to do it even though it ain't the right way.  They said that ain't the way it's supposed to be done baby, do it this way.  And I think too because I was young, high school and stuff, I was dealing with older women which don't nobody do that because that's illegal, but I mean you know I had the swagger of a grown man when I was young so and then hip hop it is but one time tell you the truth man I ain't never said this on camera before, I was an airplane going to Cincinnati [Ohio], Cincinnati Jazz Fest [Cincinnati Jazz Festival; Cincinnati Music Festival].  It was like all my boys Nelly and Joe [Fat Joe] and Carl Thomas and a whole bunch of people was gonna be there and I'm like just one time on the airplane for real on the airplane like let me just go here and be regular and just whatever they messing with the girl right there, they mess with them too.  They, if they at the strip club, let me go to the strip club with these, let me be 'cause I know they be tired of being uncomfortable around Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones].  Me always saying, "Hey man don't use that word when you describing women."  Well you know what I mean.  They like, "It was some bitches in the room." "Oh like really, you into that?"  "Yeah man."  "Oh you into four legged female dogs and in your room that's your own thing."  "You know what I'm talking about?"  I'm like, "No I don't."  "You said bitch, that's what a bitch is."  I don't know why, that's my own personal protest I don't know.  Some women call themselves bitches and they but they that's they social language inside they group, they can do that, we can't do it.  Just like a white person can't call us a nigga.  We can do it in our social group though, that's our social language.  It's li- I mean so a woman say these the words you can't use in describing me, then you can't do it.  And I was on the airplane saying just let me just this time God because I hate when dudes walk away from me when they see me coming.  Awe here come Malik he finna come preach.  I don't be preaching fam I just be like we can do a better job with our women that's all, we can do a better job.  I ain't saying be perfect.  Ain't nobody perfect.  We can do a better job though.  We can treat our women better, better because we at the bottom rung how we treat our sisters.  We here with it.  You can at least go here, here and maybe here.  And I was like just let me just go to a strip club with these fools and act like I fit in and I won't have to feel this, this you know cognitive dissidence of knowing that they ain't really like me but they can't beat me up though so you know they know better than try to get engaged in fisticuffs so they just kind of go with it but they really have a disdain for me and I'm just like God please just and I remember hearing like a voice saying, "No.  That's not your purpose.  Your purpose ain't to fit in.  Your purpose is to stand for change and to champion my calls."  I was like man that sounds like my grandmother or a whole bunch of grandmothers put together or something so I was just, I was just resolved to it.  I was like okay fuck it I guess.  I landed and went there and did what I had to do and was me (laughter).
Story_ID: 460602
Speaker 1: How did things progress after the movie ['Love Jones'] came out and there's enthusiasm about it?
Speaker 2: Man it was so weird because first of all I found out Regie [Regie Gibson] set me up, but he did a good thing he didn't realize by having me tell everybody he helped me promote myself.  He was trying to set me up for a gag basically like yeah, he knew because he was in on the editing and everything (laughter).  He was in all the way.  He was in (unclear) and they knew, he knew they had cut me out man.  But because I promoted it so big man you know what I'm saying all by the will of God see what I'm saying anything bad she turning for good man and that's really what happened.  So after that my respect level in the game was like an OG [original gangster] like even though I only been in the game like three years it was like an OG so then Common was like, "Man you should be on my next album."  I'm like, "Bet."  So I did a poem called 'I Used to Love H.E.R. Too' [ph.] didn't make the album but then the year after that did another piece called 'My City' [Malik Yusef Jones] and went and kicked it with him and he put in a tape of this girl named Erykah Badu and he said, "How you think she sound?"  "Man she sound like Billie Holiday."  He like, "For real?"  I'm like, "Dude, she is the truth.  Where she from?"  He like, "Dallas [Texas]."  I'm like, "Man you have her on the album."  He like, "I'm thinking about it." I'm like, "No, you know you need to have her."  He like, "Well maybe me, you and her can do a song together."  It went from that from me, her and him doing a song to me and him doing a song 'cause she wasn't popular.  Nobody knew who she was.  She had been in nobody's album, no- none of her music was out at all and then he just let me do my own poem on his album called 'My City' and it came out September 1997 and they was like yeah we having the album release concert, Lauryn Hill, CeeLo [CeeLo Green] from the Goodie Mob, that's when he was still with the Mob, it was De La Soul, the Roots, Q-Tip.  It was crazy and I remember listening to the radio like man they gonna have all them performing well I say I'm on the album how come they didn't say me?  So we called his manager Derrick [ph.] and they was like yeah you can come perform, so you open up the show.  So Mike Love and The Diz was like, "Malik Yusef [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] he on the album, got a hot poem on there."  I came out performed it, Julio G in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] was playing the song, he thought it was Common, but it was me.  And then that was another level people thought I was famous so the first time they thought I was super famous was when they saw me on the ABC world news the second time was 'Love Jones' they like man (laughter) I made myself be famous for them so crazy and then Common album and after that you know I'm--you know before that Biggie [Biggie Smalls; Notorious B.I.G.] had died, Pac [Tupac Shakur] had died September 13 Pac died and--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: --that was '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Ninety-six [1996] okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah so the year before that and that's when I had, I had a long talk with Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] he was like why you gonna go out to L.A. or to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], what you gonna do?  You gonna go out there and do what?  What you gonna do?  You know Barack is real cut and dry dude when it come to men.  He ain't--he nice to the sisters but to men he Barack ain't no punk with it.  I had truth stick I know what a truth stick is.  I been in Africa man.  I lived in Africa.  At the time nobody really knew who he was really he just community dude and Michelle [Michelle Obama] she was the ED [executive director] of a program I was doing called Public Allies so that's my bad, I love Michelle (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Public Allies I remember that yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's AmeriCorps [AmeriCorps VISTA] program that Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] implemented yep and then, then my son's godfather passed, Biggie.  In fact Chris [ph.], he died and hip hop start changing and it was like my chance to get into the game and bring my brand of, of literature I guess, my brand my style of thinking and give it to the masses and I, I didn't feel, Lauryn was, Lauryn said, "When you gonna do a poetry album?"  I was like, "I wouldn't listen to a poetry album, like nobody would do that."
Story_ID: 460603
Speaker 1: All right you're gonna bring Kanye [Kanye West] in the picture too with artist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah so I start touring around with Common, just putting myself on tour with him.  Like, "Let me do some shows with you dog?"  He like, "Bet.  Come on."  I would do 'My City' and stuff and different little hip hop events when you know Common was real underground hip hop and there was a little guy named Kanye West that was burgeoning trying to get into the game, a student of the game you know a fan of music of all genres and after I realized that maybe I could make a spoken word album, two years later I got on Carl Thomas album and he was with Bad Boy [Bad Boy Records] and he sold 2 million records and I had a poem on his record and I toured with him as well.  So I was like insanely famous for a poet but just for any artist I was doing pretty well as far as my, my halo effect and then Kanye West, man, was just grinding and I (unclear) I'm gonna work on a album, this guy named Ola [ph.] was like, "Why don't you do your own album?"  I was like, "Well." He like, "Man you know you don't have to sign the Bad Boy, I'll do the deal with you."  So we did a deal, long story on that, but John Monopoly, John John, was like, "I got a producer man."  I was like, "Who?"  He's like, "Kanye."  I was like, "Kanye West, I know dude."  He was like, "Man you gotta get one of his tracks, Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones]," so he gave me a beat CD.  I had my girl Menda [ph.], we was listening to it.  She said, "I like that one." And I was like, "Yeah I like that one too." (Singing) "Wouldn't you like to ride?"  So I called and I said, "I like this," he said, "Yeah okay bet man."  I ain't gonna tell y'all the price I paid for it.  It was dirt cheap.  And he came and flew me in for Christmas and he rapped on it.  He like well this how much money I need and fly me in so I can see my mama for Christmas and he was like who gonna be on the song with you?  I was like Common.  He was like man can--let me get on it too.  I said all right you rap?  All right I didn't know you rap.  Got on the song and that was like my best move I made in music, putting Kanye on that song 'cause I sold it to Chevy [Chevrolet] for a hundred thousand for a commercial license I should say.  License to the 'Coach Carter' soundtrack for a hundred thousand and I was you know and Kanye I chopped up a little bread with him when he was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] after he got his jaw broke.  You know I made sure his room service was taken care of and you know little stuff like that.  Bought some liquor.  But we was working on an album, Kanye's album and between those times I was doing I had, couple of other little things, mixed tapes and stuff like that and was you know mainly and getting down with Carl Thomas and then did my album with Kanye on it and Twista and all them cats I--'The Great Chicago Fire' ['The Great Chicago Fire: A Cold Day in Hell'] 'cause my concept was to bring Chicago [Illinois] together because I was in the studio with Chantay Savage and Nuisance from Psychodrama and she was like, "Chantay Savage, where she at?"  I was like, "Right here."  They didn't even know each other.  So I was responsible for bringing a whole bunch of people together on that project.  You know Twista had never did nothing with Common, they never been on the same project.  Yeah it was crazy like that.  Now it's totally different you know.  Twista and Kanye did music and you know but when I first doing this album in 2000, in 2000 when I first starting my first album in 2000, nobody was really working together.  Common had broke up out the city you know trying to make it happen and it's rough here in Chicago.  You know businesspeople don't, they don't reach out to help you.  You can come with them with a thousand proposals and they not gonna do nothing for you. (Laughter) It's not gonna happen.  Just how it is man and you know we got more black millionaires here than we do anywhere else in the country.  They not reaching out though.  I mean it's, it's systemic to a certain extent
Story_ID: 460604
Speaker 1: But, Ye [Kanye West] I, I knew he had that thang man, he had that what they call a savoir faire or that, that je ne sais quoi, that certain unexplainable something.  It's just something to him he sees music, he's a synastep like I am.  A synesthesia is when two or more senses work together and fuse a new type of sense.  People call it a third eye or X factor or something like that but it's something and he sees music so he can actually physically draw a sound.  He can take a song and draw it and it's amazing.  And like me I see words like pictures.  Like if you say the word whoa, then it depends on what context it's used in it might be red and large like a balloon or you said, tomorrow, it might be made out of slate gray and carved out.  You say it another day it might be made out of wires, depends on what the context of the conversation is.  So I see words which is why people say man Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] one of the best rhymers.  And I don't write for a lot of these rappers.  I write stuff for them 'cause I have just a way with, I have a certain relationship with words, but Kanye does too and like Pharrell [Pharrell Williams], his album, his first album was called 'Seeing Sounds.'  He can see sound.  Synesthesia is you know it's, it's--a lot of people have it but it goes undiagnosed.  Some people see numbers.  Like they have a number line like they can do math into the millions because they have a number line.  So synesthesia it's, it's a relatively new concept, but with Kanye, dude so talented like he insane you know, like he's a mad scientist, dude is insane and I remember being in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and taking him around and introducing him to people and I was like, "This is Kanye West."  They had heard his production on Jay Z's stuff like, "This is Kanye West right here."  "Oh this is the man behind the Roc [Roc-a-Fella Records]."  I remember Game [The Game], when we met Game out in the back, he couldn't even get into the Nike, it was Nelly's Nike party, 'Air Force One' [sic. 'Air Force Ones'] party in Niketown in Beverly Hills [California] on Rodeo Drive.  So I brought Kanye with me and man it was an amazing thing to see how people responded to dude and it makes you feel proud to be from Chicago [Illinois] 'cause people like people from Chicago but Kanye was really bringing something to the table though dog, he was bringing that, he was bringing that dope, he was bringing that you know that that fire to the game hadn't had but boy oh boy.  When it really came down to like being embraced, they opened up they arms, the industry opened up to Kanye you know.  [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones says positive things about his genius and you know then he works with Bono and you know dude is after but people they, they respond to him.  He got something special about him.  They respond to dude and I was just so happy that I did a song with him I had the foresight I guess I don't know, but again that's the universe at work.  Something that I thought was relatively just a move I was making turned out to be one of the biggest moves of my career.
Story_ID: 460605
Speaker 1: So do you think that, that Chicago [Illinois] music scene is starting to catch up a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We forcing it but it's not easy because it's no business behind it you know.  Just not a lot of business here you know.
Speaker 1: What--talk about transition from spoken word to rap, its differences.
Speaker 2: Well it--you got to look at it as poetry and allegory basically and you got poetry that you can write and you read it you know and then you got poetry that's in movement that's you know.  Movement is a necessity for humans.  We have to move in order to to, to sustain ourselves.  You have to move from a place to a place.  You have to move to get food or move to water.  We've decreased our necessity of moving since we create these urban, these urban dwellings where we can bring stuff to us but still movement is important.  But movement is perfunctory.  Why do we come up with dance?  Dance this allegory, it's poetry. Singing, it's poetry. It's been said that the human being we sang before we spoke and it would only make sense because our environment, the loudest thing in our environment is a bird.  We, there's a constant and they sing all the time and we mimic them and in the Native American culture we still do and them codes so on and so forth but singing is a form of communication and it's poetry 'cause we can have, we can have language without singing, why do we need that.  Rap is poetry.  It's been called rhythmic American poetry 'cause it's here, we made it here and hip hop itself is a hodgepodge of different things.  It's, it's Vodun you know it's, it's Orisha music, it's you know, it's Tongan music and everywhere that black folk came from and people that came to this country mixed with the native languages and forms of music and then the Europeans and we made hip hop.  You been to other countries, Japan, same music in Japan is what they been playing four thousand years.  It's the same music but we take that--hip hop you can put a tuba, a banjo, a range stick and hip hop and it fits perfectly well.  You can't put a tuba in country music.  But hip hop is the hodgepodge of all those things and rap is its voice.  Rap is the voice of hip hop but spoken word is even a different thing.  It's like word jazzes.  It don't have a syncopated rhythm.  It exists outside of that.  It exists in a bigger place.  I can do a poem and say, "Now she is free, free to be she.  She frees me and from me she is free."  Can't do that in rap because it's a beat, that catch that you are bound to in rap but spoken word poetry so I said all the things are poetry that's why we call it spoken word poet--spoken word poetry is a different brand of poetry.  It's, it's alive in a different way.  People feel alive when they hear it, people feel alive when they say it so they get on stage and they do poetry, it's therapeutic.  When I work with the some of the women shelters I work with I encourage the women to write poetry.  "Well I can't write at all, I'm not good, I'm not creative."  I say, "Baby that's okay, just write, just write, just write," and they went from, "I can't write at all," to "Okay I got this little twelve page poem Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones]."  I'm like whoa.
Speaker 1: So you think like there's an evolution of that in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Man--
Speaker 1: I don't know if you--
Speaker 2: Heavily.
Speaker 1: --when you're a kid, you had, we had Gwendolyn Brooks world famous--
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah Gwendolyn Brooks.
Speaker 1: --and to hear her read her poetry is special but it's not--it's out there say [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti.
Speaker 2: Right Haki.
Speaker 1: It's more performance oriented but what you all are doing is even more of a performance than that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I think I add the performance aspect to it.  I used to start, I start off on paper and now I'm all over the stage.  I'm in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] with Kanye [Kanye West] in front of fifteen thousand people doing poetry, positive poetry about about black people in front of fifteen thousand people on New Year's Eve and it's like when they gonna find out that I'm just doing poetry (laughter).  When they gonna find out I'm not a superstar, I'm just a poet.  When they gonna find out?  I'm, I'm trying to beat the clock every day to sell albums and t-shirts and you know everything, comic books and everything that I sell, I'm trying to trick people it feel like.  So I guess rap is the the child of spoken word.  But it's a wild kid.  But poetry has to stand back up and say, hey, I'm gonna set a standard, I'm gonna be a, a buoy that say that's dangerous over there.
Story_ID: 460606
Speaker 1: Because rap is dangerous even though it feels like freedom of expression and all that shit which is true, I honor that.  You gotta eat dude the whole nine but I can't let you talk to my niece like that, I can't.  My niece was seven and she was singing (singing) "I'm into having sex I ain't into making love up in the club" that 50 Cent song.  She didn't know.  She didn't know making love, she was seven.  She didn't what making love was. (Singing) "I'm into having sex I ain't into making--." I said, "Jakari [ph.] what you say baby?"  "I'm singing 50 Cent song uncle."  I said, "No you don't sing 50 Cent song."  I know Curtis personally, I know 50 personally but he can't come in my house.  I mean hisself physically if he was in trouble and say, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] these dudes try to shoot at me" or something, "Get in here nigga, hurry up get in here.  Turn off the lights and I'll pull my thang out.  They can't come in here and git ya." But his music can't come in.  He can't educate my, my sons with his music how to treat women 'cause let just tell it, the only way you interact with a woman is doing a menage a trois and then you kick her out after fifteen minutes of sex.  If a woman left my bed, I'm gonna have a problem with it.  You gonna come back home with me after the club then you gonna leave and go somewhere else, you ain't gonna spend the night and we ain't gonna have breakfast and have some conversation and I'm show you this new book I got, you crazy if you think that's gonna happen.  50 Cent is selling them the opposite and my sons they can't--I can't afford to let them hear that.  I can't you know what I'm saying, I can't let my nieces hear that's how they supposed to be treated and unfortunately rap it is to sell records and it serves a higher purpose.  It serves the criminal justice system and it serves the, the, the breakdown of the school system like Ashley [Ashley Howard] was saying and, and it makes you nonchalant and disconnects you.
Speaker 2: You think it's driven by business interest primarily (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of course, of course.  If I--if me and you built prisons right now, built some prisons, don't we need something in there?  Like people?  How do we get to them?  What's the best way to get to people?  Tell you something crazy.  Melody is the most effective way or the most intrusive way to affect the brain and guess where we--the second is speech, that's the second one.  Melody and so rap is music and speech not singing, music and speech.  When we hear a women's voice, our brains all humans our brains register a woman's voice a female's voice based on her vocal cords in a place where we register music, melody.  A male voice we register in a place called the mind's eye.  It's not evolutionary thing 'cause we hear a male's voice.  Is he friendly?  Is he upset?  Is he mad?  How tall is he?  How big is he?  Who is he?  Need that.  He could be coming from anywhere.  So we visualize what a man says but a woman's voice carries more information per bit, per bit because her because music carries a lot of information per bit too so you take music or melody or the female voice which is what music is, muse where the word comes from, take that couple it with the fucking nonsense that these dudes be yelling out they mouth.  Most of them ain't did none of the shit they talking about anyway.  Well y'all was rapping when I was doing what y'all talking about.  Y'all was already rappers so I know you wasn't out there with me and none of my guys can say you was out there with them.  So you take those two and marry them put them into a six year old's head.  When I was six I thought Superman was for real.  You couldn't tell me that Superman, at six years old ain't nothing you could have did.  If a man walked down the street, he could have been a kidnapper and been on a kidnapping tour around the world if he had on a Superman costume and said (makes sound) and jumped down from something.  I'd a went with him.  Nothing my mama [Earline Jackson Jones], grandma, daddy [Hubbard Jones] nobody could said nothing to me.
Speaker 2: But likewise now if you're six and you hear--
Speaker 1: Same thing.  Superman ain't affecting you as much as--'cause you visualizing what he's saying.  He's a man, he's talking.  He's talking to me.  He's saying get this hoe and get these rims.  Get this money little nigga and I'm six, (makes sound) and I'm six years old and he my hero and he got all this jewelry on and he got man everybody respect him, they reaching out for him, he the greatest, you can't tell me it ain't gonna affect me?  And guess what the pathways for me to get into that shit is cut off.  So I'm from 130th [Street], or I'm from Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and my mama drank and smoked while she was pregnant with me so I just can't grasp the shit they talking about in school but I got to have this Mercedes-Benz and somebody say, hey you can make money like this.  Give this person this and they'll give you ten dollars.  It could be bubble gum.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  Where are you right now with your art and where do you wanna go with it?
Speaker 2: I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to do God's work you know what I'm saying.  I'm just trying to I know that sounds so generic and general but I am, I'm trying to uplift somebody.  I'm trying to say that you can do it, you can make it that you right now have the power of the universe inside you.  You are made out of the same substance that every star in the universe is made out of and you are good enough and you are smart enough, strong enough, pretty enough, tall enough.  You don't need to change nothing about yourself unless you want to.  If you wanna drop a couple of pounds, go ahead.  As long as you healthy, as long as your cholesterol ain't up and you ain't got high cholesterol and high blood pressure, you fine.  I would say don't eat, don't eat sharks every day, the little you know and the little fried chicken every day.  I like fried chicken though but don't eat it every day.  I will tell you that.  Don't eat Cheetos for breakfast but you ain't gotta look like Paris Hilton and you ain't gotta have a car like 50 Cent. This isn't anomaly and he--we don't know what he did for his money.  I know a lot of it he been misleading my niece and I want people to feel what I'm saying to 'em because I came from nothing with no help.  Nobody said hey I'm a help you.  I went inside myself and realizing that I'm made--I'm a carbon based entity in this universe that there ain't a star out there that's made out of something different than I am.  Not the largest star in the, in the whole galaxy in the whole multi-universe is made out of something different than me, every atom in me is the same atom that's out there.  I got it all.  If you like Muhammad, I'm made out of the same stuff.  You like Jesus, made out of the same, Buddha, same stuff, Krishna same stuff, the same stuff.  I might look a little different, I may not be able to run as fast or jump as high, I might not be as attractive physically, but I'm--I woke up this morning on this side of the dirt, I woke up on this side.  I already won. (Laughter) I'm ahead of the game already.  Now you wake up on that other side of the dirt, it might be a struggle to win, but on this side of dirt, I got twenty-four hours in my day just like you got twenty-four hours in your day.  Shit, it's gonna be hard to beat me today.  Hard to make me say I give up.  So that's where my music is, that's where my music and art is at right there you know and I'm a truth teller, I ain't, I ain't one to pull no punches.  If you out of law, you out of law.  I won't not love you 'cause you out of law.  I don't think you should die because you out of law.  I'm not gonna forsake you 'cause you out of law.  No permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent standards and values and we need to just a little bit push our value system up and if our females could pull they value system up which is who I talk to mainly in my music to women, then the men's forced to, we're forced to.
Story_ID: 460608
Speaker 1: Now tell me now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd graduate high school [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois] yeah and probably go to college too.  Yeah I would go to college 'cause you got a chance to meet Katie Kellogg [ph.] in college and if you meet Katie Kellogg at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], she probably one of the Kelloggs' dogs, that's how it is.  And it's a networking bonanza and I wish I could man of man I would have knew, if I would have only known networking, that paper work that don't mean nothing.  That means something it's a key but they giving that away to white folk you know what I'm saying.  If Katie Kellogg, (laughter) she not gonna fail 'cause the Kellogg foundation just bought a $5 million wing to the library.  She straight.  And then those little fraternities and stuff if you wanna be a lawyer, join the fraternity doc- it's a reasons because they got, they got the, the books.  I'm like how--I remember my cousin like, "Malik [HistoryMaker Malik Yusef Jones] I'm studying every day, I'm still getting Bs and B pluses.  These dudes is partying all night, not even coming to lecture hall but they getting A's."  I said, "Because they got the legend dude, they got the key.  Somebody, they father's best friend is, is a professor up there.  You gotta work twenty times hard as them."  Told him that and straight A's now, lawyer and he's dating one of the Williams sisters [Venus Williams and Serena Williams] you know so he's doing his thing.  He was Wimbledon [The Championships, Wimbledon, London, England].  I see him on TV at Wimbledon. (Laughter) I said there go Bob Coo [ph.] sitting in the stands.  He went on ahead and did his thing, hit his bar exam.  But that all right.  People--imagine what people can do with permission though.  You get permission to be great.  It's amazing how great they'll be. Like now you can pull it like nah nah you dope.  Nah sister you dope unh-uh, no they was wrong let me tell you.  I'm a cold nigga.  I'm telling you you dope little sister.  I know you fourteen and them shoes ain't the shoes that's in style, but guess what they gonna always make a new style.  You cold.  And the change is instantaneous.  It's not no next month.  No it's like I feel different now and little bit more reinforcement from teachers hey, give a little extra shout out to shorty you know what I'm saying.  If she get one wrong don't tell (unclear) tell her hey you might wanna rethink this answer.
Story_ID: 460609
Speaker 1: Now you're a father and you've got like, what, three children?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Tell us a little bit about your children?
Speaker 2: Jabriel [Jabriel Jones], Nasir [Nasir Jones] and Kilam [Kilam Jones].  Man, man I don't know man.  Just I tell them every day be great.  I say man be great today.  Go and do something great.  Not good, do something great and they be listening, man.  Jabriel you know he twelve and so he left home school and now he's into into a regular school and kids picked on him and stuff and they didn't know he was tough so it wasn't really they fault but he beat up a couple of kids pretty bad, he in the Taekwondo Junior Olympics twice and I was--I hated that that had to happen because his mother she was reluctant to tell me.  They was taking stuff from him at school, taking his little chains.  I'll get him a little stuff from All-Star Weekend [NBA All-Star Weekend] and he got the, you know fighting.  I said, "Jabriel you know just 'cause you realize that these dudes are weak, don't take advantage of that.  Don't just start beating them up every time, explain to 'em, talk to 'em man, have a conversation with 'em."  So first they was always enemies, not even the dudes he beat up I mean they don't like him a lot but they got to honor him so he don't have those problems no more and I mean his ed- the educators and the caderey [sic. cadre]was like, "I don't know why you teach your son, but he's whaling on these kids and hitting them in their neck."  And I'm like, "Look he--I told him don't let nobody take nothing from you period.  'Cause they start, that's gonna happen all the time."  "They like well you not a good father teaching him that."  I said, "Look, I didn't say take no bat, no bottle, no brick.  I said get your stuff back from them and take care of business."  And it's hard to tell a little kid that when you give them power to, to, to, to admonish themselves with it, so me and his mother had to stay on him heavily like Jabriel look now don't go to school with your head like this because the teachers were like, "Yeah Jabriel just walks around here like he owns the school and you know."  I'm like, "Well some of these teachers, they just wanna be your friend Jabriel."  But he's very much like me.  He doesn't assimilate well with groups of people and stuff like and if he is in a group, he needs to be the leader type of thing like that so I been breaking him down.  Now Nasir, Nasir is into soccer, (laughter) superheroes stuff and he's one of those dudes like he wants to be an actor and a model but I'm not putting him into the industry because I feel like I've seen those people that were childhood stars and stuff like that.  I've seen them so I'm waiting until he gets old enough.  If he wants to do it, "Hey daddy can I get my photo shoot?" Jabriel is different, he's shy.  But Nasir is super outgoing, outrageously so he's in love with Storm, (gesture) Halle Berry (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Halle Berry.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter) in love with her.  He said, "When I get sixteen can I marry Storm?"  I said, "Well, ten years from now she'll be in her fifties, I'm not sure if a sixteen year old's gonna wanna marry, but you can if you do all the right things.  Then you can talk to her and see if she wants to marry you."  He's like, "Mom is that true?"  She's like, "Yeah, if your dad say it's true, it's true."  So if he's one--he's super into girls at six years old, it's crazy.  Every, every girl that's even remotely sweet or cute he's--but he's such a, you know a smart kid, I don't know how how I discipline my kids is different.  I say--he like, "Why, why you guys always don't let--." I said, "No, you can do anything you wanna do.  Don't listen to me and your mom.  Do whatever you wanna do man.  It's your day.  Just do whatever you wanna do.  As a matter of fact you in charge, you in charge today."  He was like, "Hm, no I think not." (Laughter) Sometimes you just get that little energy where he wanna be in charge, "Why can't I just play with my toys in the kitchen and do what I wanna do?"  Well you can.  And then Kilam little guy, two years old man, so beautiful and so insane.  He is he's like one of those kids that should be like in the wilderness 'cause he's super strong, picks up stuff, drops it you know he's into that 'cause and effect and I asked my counselor, my counselor my therapist, like, "Why does he do that?  Why he just take stuff and crash it, I don't do that?  You know his brother don't really do that?  Why does he do that?"  She's like, "He's just trying to figure out endurance and stress levels.  That's--your brain is naturally seeing how far he can push his limits to stuff."  Now he as anything that he does and I say, "Kilam what are you doing?"  And he know it's the wrong thing, he (makes sound), go to his mom and cry for he don't wanna look at me, don't wanna touch me for about thirty minutes, he don't wanna, (laughter) don't wanna see me.  But he's so aware of himself.
Speaker 1: Like you say 'cause and effect.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what a two year old is into?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what he's into.  He's into how does this?  Which one is stronger, how do (makes sound), okay if I pull this down it's gonna do this okay what sounds that make.  He's into that you know and it's just you know testosterone.  He's you know little deep voice little dude, so concerned about everything.  "Where mama go?  Where gaddy?" I'm like, "Gaddy is in Rockford [Illinois]?"  "Where papa?"  "Papa is in Rockford as well just relax everybody's--."  He's so concerned about taking care of everybody.
Story_ID: 460610
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you this, we're almost at the end of this roll and we always ask this question at the end and similar to legacy but a little different, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I was born on the day Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and I can't help but think some of his spirit seeped into me you know some years later actually.  He say Dr. King tried to love somebody you know that's kind of what I--I just tried to love somebody you know just so that they would love themselves.  I think that, unfortunately, we do need permission for most things and if you feel like somebody loves you then you assess a different value to yourself.  I have a song on my album that says (singing) "What if you felt there was no God to love you, no God to love you, love you?  What if you felt there was no God to love you, no God to love you, love you" and I think that's real if you felt there was nobody to love you, there's no accountability, you don't have a value on yourself.
