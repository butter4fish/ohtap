Speaker 1: I'm going to start with very basic People magazine-type questions that you probably have never been asked--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: --but you'll know the answers to.  Your favorite, we'll start with your favorite food.
Speaker 2: My favorite food, it could be fruits, it could be fish, it used to be cookies.  It was cookies because that's what my mother [Betty Shabazz] used as a distraction and a pacifier after my father [Malcolm X] was assassinated.  He wouldn't come home and she would take cookies that he and I used to indulge in before he was killed, and she would take oatmeal cookies, which were his favorite, and she'd break it in half, that she made herself, and she'd put it on a plate, by the door, and when I would come and look out the window for my father, I would get upset, she said, but I would see these cookies and I'd pick 'em up and I'd eat 'em and I'd go to sleep.  So, as time went on and she told the story, my girlfriends, all looked like, "Oh my gosh, that's why she loves," yeah, I was always a cookie addict.  And, of course, when you get a little older and the hips really went out of control, you refrain.
Speaker 1: So what is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: The summertime.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color, it could be black, could be lavender, pink.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well I like anywhere that's very hot, that has water, that has horses and I'm just very, very happy.  A lot of greenery.
Speaker 1: This is a good one for me, I can't wait to hear what you say, but your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I, that's a little, I couldn't even--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, so we'll start--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and if something comes up, whenever it comes up, shoot it out, spit it out, favorite phrase or saying.  But we'll start, we'll talk about your mother first.
Speaker 2: God bless you, that's probably my favorite thing--phrase, but anyway--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --that's what I know--
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: I say that out loud, when someone is troubled or happy or any kind of, it's usually, God bless you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought you were telling me, God bless me for talking about your mother first.
Speaker 2: God bless you for that (laughter).
Story_ID: 310183
Speaker 1: So your mother, what was your mother's maiden name?
Speaker 2: Sanders.
Speaker 1: So it was--your mother's full name?
Speaker 2: Betty Dean Sanders [Betty Shabazz].
Speaker 1: And your mother was born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Pinehurst, Georgia.
Speaker 1: In 19--in, do you know exactly?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother, she was born on May 28th, 1934, in Pinehurst, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now your mother, did she--do you know who your mother's, your paternal grand--or your maternal grandparents?  Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, her mother's name was Ollie Mae [Ollie Sanders] and her father's name was Shelman Sanders Sandlin.
Speaker 1: Now, what--do you know anything at all about them?  Did she tell stories about them that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, Ollie Mae had my mother out of wedlock and what happened was, she was a very dark-skinned woman and my grandfather was Native American, Cherokee Indian, and when they saw the women that he impregnated, they said, "Oh, she's too dark, you can't marry her."  And she had the child and, and, left the child, my mother, in Georgia, and her sister raised her.
Speaker 1: What was her sister's name?
Speaker 2: I can't think of her sister's name right, off, right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell Ollie Mae for me?
Speaker 2: O-L-L-I-E, and her middle name was M as in Mary, A-E, Ollie Mae, and she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, and her last name was also--
Speaker 2: I can't--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I can't think of it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's okay.  Go ahead, and she had a sister--
Speaker 2: Her sister ra--took her, and Ollie Mae left and moved to Detroit [Michigan] and eventually my father's mother [sic. Shabazz's maternal great-grandmother], who was Matilda [Matilda Greene]--
Speaker 1: Let me get this, okay, your--
Speaker 2: McAfee [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay your father [Malcolm X]--okay, go ahead, I'm following you, your father's mother, Matilda (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father's mother, Matilda, she knew about the--came and took care of her.  So it was really, they were going back and forth between my mother's aunt and my mother's paternal mother--grandmother.  And eventually, my mother's aunt passed away and they sent my mother to Detroit where she finally met her mother and, she and I never talked about it, but I would imagine--I know that it really wasn't the best reunion, and my mother was about twelve, eleven, twelve years old.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Or between eleven--between eight and twelve.
Speaker 1: Twelve, okay.  Now, did your mother go to school in Pinehurst, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Her formative years.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she ever talk about teachers or--because she--did she ever talk about growing up in Pinehurst, what school was like?
Speaker 2: No, but what happened was, once she got to Detroit, her biological mother basically gave her to Helen Malloy, who became her foster mother and whom my mother regarded as her mother for the rest of her life.  And her foster mother was a school teacher and was also a Sunday school teacher in the African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] church.
Speaker 1: In Detroit?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now what was the--her foster's mother's name?
Speaker 2: Helen--
Speaker 1: Helen.
Speaker 2: --Malloy.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: Helen, H-E-L-E-N, Malloy, M as in Mary, A-L-L-O-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was Helen married?
Speaker 2: Yes, her husband's [Lorenzo Malloy] name was, I can't think of it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Helen took your mother in?
Speaker 2: Helen and her husband.
Speaker 1: And her husband took your mother in to Detroit (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were a middle-class family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They took in my mother.  Her husband--they both were graduates of Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and this is the reason my mother went to Tuskegee Institute.  And her husband owned a shoe repair business and my mother would often work in the shoe repair business and then also the Sunday school in the church [Bethel AME Church, Detroit, Michigan] and the Delta Brightsource Briggs [ph.].  I don't really remember the name but those were young girls before they went to college and would pledge into the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's where my mother got all of that from.
Speaker 1: So do you know, did your mother, do you know what the address was where they lived in Detroit?
Speaker 2: 313 Hague, H-A-G-U-E, Street, in Detroit, and I remember it being a yellow house.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember where the shoe shop was?
Speaker 2: I don't remember but, you know, it is documented.  It's in the Betty Shabazz book.  There's a picture of it and I think it has the address.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your mother talk about her life in Pinehurst, Georgia at all before she moved to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Never, ever?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And most people don't even know she was born in Pinehurst, Georgia.  They assume she was born in Detroit, Michigan.
Story_ID: 310184
Speaker 1: When she [Shabazz's mother, Betty Shabazz] left Pinehurst [Georgia] that ended all of her ties with her--with that, with her real mother's [Ollie Mae Sanders] family?
Speaker 2: Right, but not her biological father's [Shelman Sandlin] family.
Speaker 1: Okay, because her biological father's family was family that was part of the family she went to with in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.  I'm--
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Shelman Sanders Sandlin, his mother, Matilda [Matilda Greene], lived in Pinehurst, Georgia.  All I know was that she had a plantation and that they had pecans and my grandmother [sic. great-grandmother], who was my biological grandfather's wife, would tell me the stories of her coming out, sitting on the porch of her house, where she would have women brushing her hair, and that she would just sit there as if she was the Queen of Sheba, and how one time when my mother went home from college, on a visit to see her grandmother and her father, that she saw the cotton in the back and she said, "Oh, grandmother, grandmother, can I go out and pick some cotton?"  And my grand--and her grandmother said, "No granddaughter of mine is gonna pick any cotton."  So that's just a story that I will never forget because I'm sure, probably as you, if you go to one of your relatives home and you see that they have cotton in the back, you want to go out there and pick it.  But, of course, the history of picking cotton--
Speaker 1: Well, it's, your, so but they were the Native Americans?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, and they, and they had a cotton farm?
Speaker 2: Right, they had cotton and pecans.
Speaker 1: Okay, cotton and--did they have black people working for them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, under what circumstances (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were, they were--under what circumstances?  Well, you know, all I know is that my grandmother, Madeline [Madeline Sandlin], my biological grandfather's wife, said she would just remember the woman on the porch, black woman, African American, on the porch--
Speaker 1: Getting her hair brushed.
Speaker 2: --brushing--
Speaker 1: Brushing her--
Speaker 2: --my grandmother, Matilda's hair and it was just this long hair and she would just sit there.
Story_ID: 310185
Speaker 1: So when your mother [Betty Shabazz] moved to Detroit [Michigan], were, do you know where she went to elementary school or to, where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: I can't think of the name of the school but I, I can't think of the name of the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then what ha--how did she get to go to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?  Out of, or, out of high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --she's going to go to Tuskegee?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Her mother, Helen Malloy--
Speaker 1: Okay, her foster mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) her foster mother.  It was almost, it was a given, you know that you would go to Tuskegee Institute as your mother and father, foster mother and father [Lorenzo Malloy], have gone to Tuskegee Institute.
Speaker 1: What did Helen look like?
Speaker 2: Helen was dark, pressed hair, very thin, church-going professional.  She also was an activist in the community.  My mother really, you know, is a lot like her, an activist in the community for women's rights, for, it was a thriving community of African Americans, I know that, and she was just very active in that community and, and I would imagine that was the reason that she came to take my mother, because everyone thought my mother was beautiful and they really pined over her and, and she must have stood out.  And somehow, I can't remember the story of how they met, but--
Speaker 1: How Helen and your mother met?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How they met, but I just remember that they were excited to have her.
Speaker 1: Why would Helen have been in Pinehurst, Georgia?
Speaker 2: No, Helen was in Detroit, Michigan (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Detroit, so they didn't meet in Pinehurst?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They met in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother actually--
Speaker 1: When your mother went to Detroit to see her mother [Ollie Mae Sanders]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When my mother came to Detroit to live with her mother, she and her sisters [sic. Half-sisters], by her mother's, new, now her mother was married to another man, last name Thomas [ph.]--
Speaker 1: So these were her half-sisters?
Speaker 2: Right, her half-sisters, and they would go to church together.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: I, now see that's terrible.  I can't remember everyone--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --offhand--
Speaker 1: That's okay, that's okay.
Speaker 2: --but I know Shirley [ph.], Aunt Shirley, and then there are two other sisters whose names I should know and, and a brother.
Speaker 1: What happened to them?  What became of them?
Speaker 2: Oh, they stayed with their mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They stayed with her.
Speaker 1: And what became of them professionally (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we even visited--
Speaker 1: Did they, did any of them go into politics?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or any--
Speaker 2: Not politics, but they're all professional women.
Speaker 1: They're all women?
Speaker 2: And, you know, I'm focusing on the women, and men.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't believe I met my uncles on that side but I know that I've met all the aunts and I probably did meet, you know, 'cause--
Speaker 1: What kind of professions did they go into?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Just the ones you can remember, not--
Speaker 2: I don't really--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 310186
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Betty Shabazz] goes to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  How many years does she go before she leaves (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Decided that she was going to transfer to Jersey City [Jersey City State College; New Jersey City University, Jersey City, New Jersey]?  I think she only stayed one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was--she, from what I understand, it was that she had experienced some sort of racism and I think coming from a community, an African American community--
Speaker 1: In Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: --thriving, happy childhood, that she had not encountered whatever it was that she encountered at Tuskegee and that was probably the second class citizen, the berating, well I would imagine things of that nature, and it could have been even more.
Speaker 1: So when your mother--okay--continuing, you were telling me about your--the community that your mother grew up in in Detroit.  So we'll just take it up from there.
Speaker 2: It was a thriving community.  It was a thriving African American community.
Speaker 1: So your mother went to Tuskegee for a couple of years, she didn't like the way she's being treated and so you don't know exactly what happened but she told you that something happened?
Speaker 2: She didn't tell me--
Speaker 1: Okay, but she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but she spoke about it in a few interviews.
Speaker 1: What did your mom speak about like her own life that, like, that you remember as her--with her growing up?  Her life as a kid before she met your father [Malcolm X]?
Speaker 2: Oh, she talked about how she always listened to her mother [Betty Shabazz's foster mother, Helen Malloy] (laughter) and I know she was a little goody two-shoes and I know that she danced, and I know that she--
Speaker 1: What kind of dance?
Speaker 2: Whatever dance was in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The jitter--, you know, whatever dance was in during her time.
Speaker 1: What could she still do that--
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And anyone who knew, knows, knew her, would always say that Betty could burn a rug (laughter).  And I remember going to the mayor's victory party and--
Speaker 1: Which mayor?
Speaker 2: The mayor of Mount Vernon [New York], and--
Speaker 1: What's his name, just as in content?
Speaker 2: Mayor Ernest Davis, Ernest Davis, and we went to his victory party together and I remember one of the young men coming and asking me to dance and I was like, "Oh, no, you know."  I remember this, "Oh, come on sugar, I'll dance with you."  So once she got on the dance floor, she wouldn't really sit down, she just got in all her dancing, all her exercise.
Speaker 1: So what--so we've covered your mom side.  Can you remember any other legendary stories that your mother told about your family's history?  Her side of the family's history?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I know that she sewed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know that she sewed and that she was really involved in the church.
Speaker 1: As the African Methodist--what, Episcopal--
Speaker 2: Right, A.M.E.--
Speaker 1: A.M.E., African Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 2: --which I'm, you know, it's like, oh, okay.  And very active women's rights and, you know, all those things.
Story_ID: 310187
Speaker 1: So your father [Malcolm X].  What do you know about your father's--?
Speaker 2: I know that--
Speaker 1: Okay, give me your father's date of birth?  And his name, his birth name was?
Speaker 2: My father was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, May 19th, 1925 and he came from a family, a very large family--
Speaker 1: What's very large?
Speaker 2: Isn't that awful?  I know all these numbers.  You see there's Uncle Wesley [Wesley Little], there's Aunt Hilda [Hilda Little], there's Uncle Philbert [Philbert Little; Abdul Aziz Omar], there's my father, there is Uncle Reginald [Reginald Little], Aunt Yvonne [Yvonne Little Woodward], that's seven, and before this union between his father, Earl, and his mother, Aunt--
Speaker 1: What was, Earl Little?
Speaker 2: Earl Little.
Speaker 1: And his mother?
Speaker 2: His mother, Louise Norton [Louise Norton Little].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Before their marriage, Grandfather Earl was married to another woman, I believe her name was Mary [sic. Daisy Mason-Little], who also, who had three children, which makes my father the seventh child 'cause I--you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from the book that was written, 'The Seventh Child' ['Seventh Child: A Family Memoir of Malcolm X,' Rodnell P. Collins] and my father's father, Reverend Earl Little, was six foot five, black, strong, very built, robust, very independent, very self-reliant, very much an activist, a Garveyite. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he know Marcus Garvey?
Speaker 2: Yes, Marcus Garvey used to stay at their house.
Speaker 1: Okay, then I want stories about that after you finish telling me about--
Speaker 2: Okay, and then my grand--
Speaker 1: This is Earl?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother, Louise, was the, Garvey's recording--national recording secretary, and she was from Grenada, and she was, her father was white, Norton, Irish, and her mother was Indian, from Grenada, and met my father's father, Earl, in Canada, and you know, that's where most of the slaves, the people in bondage fled and raised children and so forth.  So they met there and then they moved to Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Where in Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: I can't think right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were all, they were in the Midwest, and had children and they were scared out of town there because--
Speaker 1: Why were they scared out of town?
Speaker 2: Because he would, he was very much a, a very strong advocate of pride in one's African, you know, one's culture.
Speaker 1: He was, a Garveyite?
Speaker 2: Right, right, and especially this is in the '20s [1920s], and they considered him to be one of those--
Speaker 1: Agitators?
Speaker 2: Right, but they didn't call him an agitator, I think they--what was the word that they called those niggers, they called them the--
Speaker 1: Uppity?
Speaker 2: They called them uppity, those uppity niggers referring to the family, but, you know, when you, when you're an activist and you speak out like you're a bad, you're a bad person, but anyway--
Speaker 1: Agitator or something like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't agitator though, troublemaker.
Speaker 1: Troublemaker (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they called him, he was such a troublemaker and, you know, he eventually was killed by the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].
Story_ID: 310188
Speaker 1: Tell me that story as it was told to you--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because there are lots of written accounts about it, but what is the story that you know?
Speaker 2: The story that I--
Speaker 1: And tell me all the details you know and this is Uncle--this is Gran Earl [Earl Little]?
Speaker 2: Grandfather Earl.
Speaker 1: Grandfather Earl--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who was Malcolm's [Malcolm X] father?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That he was an activist, very independent, very strong.
Speaker 1: Before we get to his death, he was an activist, is very strong, what do you know about his relationship with Marcus Garvey?  How did they meet?  Where did they meet?  And did he take--he took up on all of Marcus' beliefs?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, he took up all of Marcus' belief--Marcus Garvey's belief, and--
Speaker 1: Where did he meet Marcus?
Speaker 2: In Canada.
Speaker 1: In Canada.  So they all met some place in Canada?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do we know the name of the place in Canada?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do we know like the year in which, or there around?
Speaker 2: I would, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say probably the 19--early 1900s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: So he meets Marcus Garvey in Canada?
Speaker 2: And he and his wife [Louise Norton Little] eventually move to the States [United States].
Speaker 1: To the States, to the Midwest.
Speaker 2: Right, to the Midwest, and--
Speaker 1: And what is he doing at--to be a troublemaker?  Is he registering--I mean, what is he doing, literally?
Speaker 2: He's going around preaching about self-reliance, about, you know, whatever it takes to feel proud of who you are, that you have a history, and remember, these are the Jim Crow days.
Speaker 1: Right, so is he also trying to get people to go back to Africa?
Speaker 2: To build this alliance first, to pull their money together, economic development, giving the facts about history, about what the American whites did historically to the American blacks, and saying that you're not a second class citizen and that you come from a great history and all of this is a result of the enslavement of your people, and the bondage of African people.  And I think whenever you have anyone, you know, whenever you had historically, whenever you had anyone who spoke against the bondage, whether it's psychological, physical, that they were labeled as troublemakers, and--
Speaker 1: He's labeled as a troublemaker?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, he was labeled as a troublemaker and he would go to churches and just--he was always preaching.
Speaker 1: He was outspoken?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what happened then when he was killed by the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK]?
Speaker 2: Right.  He was gaining, he was gaining signatures on a petition to take the League of Nations, which is the predecessor to the United Nations [UN], for--to court, for violating the human rights of African people and, of course, this is what my father [Malcolm X] later did, and he was, you know, getting these signatures for this petition, and right before he left, of course, my grandmother, who they, who was said to be very intuitive, had this vision that he was going to be slaughtered.  And it would have it that they found his body beaten badly and then cut in half on the train tracks.  And so that's what happened to Grandfather Earl.
Speaker 1: Now, where did that happen?
Speaker 2: In Omaha, Nebraska.
Speaker 1: So he was back in Nebraska when this happened?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 310189
Speaker 1: And what happened to your--his [Shabazz's paternal grandfather, Earl Little] wife [Louise Norton Little] and all of the children?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Because it was ten of them total?
Speaker 2: It was a lot of children, and she struggled, of course, to make ends meet.  I don't believe their house had been fully completed because her husband always made the houses.
Speaker 1: And this is back in Omaha [Nebraska]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was his land and it was prime property and, of course, today, this land where his home was, and all their garden and vegetables and fruits that the mother, Grandmother Louise used to teach the children, and they all had their little, their section of where they would raise fruits and so forth, and talk to the seeds, and this is what my father [Malcolm X] would do as a child, talk to his little plant that's growing.  And it eventually became, of course, a strain and they said that she had a nervous breakdown, but my uncles and aunts, the eldest ones, Aunt Hilda [Hilda Little]--
Speaker 1: Who said she had a nervous breakdown?
Speaker 2: Oh, this is what's been recorded in the books--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Kalamazoo State Institution [Kalamazoo State Hospital; Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital, Kalamazoo, Michigan], mental institution came and they took her and put her in this institution.  And it, but before she went to the institution, she had three friends, the McGuires, the Lyons and the Kings [ph.], and they were all from the Caribbean, and so clearly she was not, she had not lost her mind.  And she asked them would they please make sure that they watch over her children because she wanted to make sure that her children--you know, they were still strong.  Caribbean people participated in the marketplace where African Americans didn't participate.  They were extremely stripped of everything, and made very dependent and, of course, you know, Caribbean people would think that Caribbean people were stronger and smarter and that Americans are lazy, which, of course, was not, you know, the case.  But because of the history, it came to be that.

Speaker 1: --Groups of friends that came in [to raise Malcolm X and his siblings].
Speaker 2: Right, there were three--
Speaker 1: Just give their names, again, the McGuires--
Speaker 2: The McGuires, the Kings [ph.] and the Lyons.
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about each of them?  Anything about each of those families individually?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I've met members of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of each family.
Speaker 1: And they were all Caribbean?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they have no connection to Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, and they were in the Midwest and they were the three Caribbean families that my grandmother [Louise Norton Little] knew and--
Speaker 1: Were there only three Caribbean families in this town, outside of your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I know that these were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But there were not that many black people in Omaha [Nebraska]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: And so she just wanted to make sure that her children, children were raised to be proud, that they were together, you know, all of the concerns that any mother would have about their children.  And at first when they took her, they--my oldest, my oldest son, my grandmother's, Grandmother Louise, her eldest two children, Uncle--okay, Uncle Wilfred [Wilfred Little; Wilfred X] and Aunt Hilda [Hilda Little] were the two eldest.  They took care of the family, you know, the brothers and sisters.  And then eventually, because they were on key, prime land, the officials, the local officials stepped in and they were split up but they tried to keep a lot of the children together and my father [Malcolm X] would eventually go to a detention home, or group home, or something to--I think it's a group home.
Speaker 1: What happened to the land?
Speaker 2: Well, and my, okay, my grandfather, Earl [Earl Little], and my grandmother, Louise, owned the land but once they took her and put her in this Kalamazoo [Michigan] institution [Kalamazoo State Hospital; Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital], and then the children, you know, with all the children out, they took the land and right now it's state property.  There's like a, I think there's like a housing project that's on the property.  I don't really remember the whole story, but this is how it is today 'cause I went down there and, and you know, I was told about the property and how the--if it's not a project, the projects, that it's something where the state owns the land.
Story_ID: 315331
Speaker 1: What did your father [Malcolm X] remember about being split up like that and then put in a detention home?  Then who, at what point did other adults step in to take care of him?  And who are those adults?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the family that he went to live with.  It may have been the Lyons.  I'm not really sure but his oldest brother [Wilfred Little; Wilfred X] was always in his--they were all very close.  So they were always in each other's life, even when he was in this detention, or group home, and his mother made sure that education was important to the children.  And, I'm going back to when they were growing up, and she would make sure that they read newspapers from the Caribbean, from the Garvey [Marcus Garvey], you know, any kind of newspaper she could get she would give them the newspaper and tell them to read it to her while she did her chores.  And she would always have a dictionary on the kitchen table and one of my father's friends, or he says is one of my father's aides, had mentioned that Malcolm always said, when you're studying, study in the kitchen and always have a dictionary.  And so later on when I found out that this is what my grandmother did to the children, I said, "Wow."  But it again shows you that this is his foundation, you know, that he didn't just grow up a thug or, you know, 'cause they always say ex-con, dope peddler and all these things.  He didn't just grow up that way, that was society, but his foun--and therefore growing into the Nation of Islam, he didn't--the Nation of Islam didn't make Malcolm, really, my father made the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 1: Because he took them from very small to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He took the values, right, exactly, and the values that his parents instilled in him and he carried on my father, his father's [Earl Little] mission, you know, to take these people to court for violating the human rights of African Americans and then my father doing the same thing later on.  And then also, we read a letter that my father wrote while he was in jail saying--
Speaker 1: How old was he when he wrote this letter?  What year was it?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I would imagine this was about 1948, 1950, and when his brother wrote him about this religion that they came across, with the Nation of Islam, or Islam with Elijah Muhammad, and talked about where it stated that black people come from Africa and they have this great history and that white people basically took it from them and made them into slaves and that, you know, don't eat pork and, you know, all--most of the ideals of the religion coincided with my father's memories of how his parents raised him.  And so in the letter he said, "Mom must have been Muslim because these are the same ideals that she had instilled in us" and, you know, the importance of language.  You know that they would speak--my grandmother, Louise Norton [Louise Norton Little], spoke five different languages and so she made--
Speaker 1: What languages?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I know that they sing, you know, I remember my Uncle Wilfred, the eldest, saying how, when they were younger, that they would say the alphabets in French and she would always drill them but it was a game.  They didn't realize that she was really, you know, making them strong and, and proud and informed and wanting to learn more.
Story_ID: 315332
Speaker 1: When Malcolm [Malcolm X] and the detention needs a little--young boy, what--at what year does he get out of that detention and how old is he?  And what happens in his life next?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the detention was where?  Was that in--
Speaker 2: You know, it's--I don't have the name of it.  It's in the books, though--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, you know, I could find out.
Speaker 1: But where, what city and state was it?
Speaker 2: I believe this is in Omaha, Nebraska [sic. Mason, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And at eighteen, he's released?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think, you know, it wasn't a detention center, it was a group home.
Speaker 1: I mean group home, yes, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I know when he was fourteen, he met his aunt, or his cousin [sic. half-sister] Ella Collins [Ella Little-Collins], and she was the daughter of Grandfather Earl's [Earl Little] first marriage.  And she lived in Massachusetts, which was a far cry from Omaha, Nebraska, and in a thriving community, it was a city, and he had never seen a black woman, as he explained, who was black and authoritative and just a whippersnapper, you know, and he had such respect and awe for her and ended up from one of his visits, coming home and deciding he was dropping out of school and he was never coming back to Omaha, Nebraska, and relocated to Massachusetts, to Roxbury, Massachusetts with Aunt Ella Collins.
Speaker 1: And at what--and then how did he, he, do you know what high school he went to in Roxbury?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he didn't go to, he didn't graduate--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from high school.  He was a high school dropout.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then he--
Speaker 2: Because he was the president of his class all the way through, and we have his book from this particular school where the students--he was the only black person there, you know that, and where the students would say, "Malcolm is swell, he's not a boxer, you know, but he sucks up," whatever it is to say that he really was not a good boxer and it was expected because he was a person of color, of African, he's of African descent, but that he was a swell guy, and, you know, that was pretty much the consensus from his classmates.  So clearly he was getting along with his classmates and they thought he was, you know, fantastic and everything and very tall and, again, the president of his class, the president of the debate team, very smart, but then it was when he was in one of his classes, and said he wanted to be a lawyer, that his teacher said to him, "You can't be a lawyer, you're a negro, you're a nigger, and you have to be more realistic and focus on a job that is appropriate for a young negro, carpentry, you know, something where you're using your hands," and so that was such a--it was discouraging.  And then he met his Aunt Ella and just decided enough of school.
Story_ID: 315333
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where was he when he was arrested?
Speaker 1: When my father [Malcolm X] was arrested, I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I believe he was in Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he spent six years in jail [at Charlestown State Prison, Boston, Massachusetts] in Massachusetts?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he still has contact with his family?
Speaker 1: And the reason--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that he got six years as opposed--'cause it was a misdemeanor, I believe, or maybe not a misdemeanor, I don't really know how all that stuff works, I've never been arrested, but they were given a longer sentence because they had two white girlfriends, and so--
Speaker 2: Mal--okay--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: We're not going to skip over that, okay.  So Malcolm, how old was he?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-six [1946], let's see '25 [1925], '35 [1935], '45 [1945], twenty-one.
Speaker 2: Twenty-one, and he has a white girlfriend?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay, what was her name?  Who was she?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know what her real name is but in the book, you know, he calls her, I think, Mary [ph.].  I don't even remember but--
Speaker 2: Okay, is she still around?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, okay, so he has a white girlfriend--
Speaker 1: He has a white girlfriend.
Speaker 2: --and his friend does as well?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What was his friend's name?
Speaker 1: Shorty Jarvis [Malcolm "Shorty" Jarvis].
Speaker 2: Shorty, and, go ahead.  So they have white girlfriends--
Speaker 1: They have white girlfriends and they are going and they're--she is setting up potential places for them to rob and they're places where she knows there's jewelry and all these other things, you know, his white girlfriend, and what happens is he, I think, steals a watch and he pawns it, and when he goes back to pick up the watch from the pawn shop, they arrested him.  And she was someone's daughter and they made--they were very angry, of course, that she was dating this African American young man and they gave him a longer sentence than what would normally be the sentence for that crime and that's what happened.
Story_ID: 315334
Speaker 1: During that time, an uncle writes to him [Shabazz's father, Malcolm X] about a religion he's discovered?
Speaker 2: His brother.
Speaker 1: His brother.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: His brother, your uncle (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause they were all very close.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Uncle Reginald [Reginald Little], and he and Uncle Reginald were very close, and also Uncle Wilfred [Wilfred Little; Wilfred X] who's the eldest, was also a member of this--was now a Muslim as well.  And--
Speaker 1: And where di--where had they, where had your uncles seen the information about Islam?
Speaker 2: I know they were living in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--all I know is that they became Muslims.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And to me it seems that this, this religion was very similar to--
Speaker 1: Their African beliefs.
Speaker 2: --their, the values that were instilled in them by their father [Earl Little]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about the Garvey [Marcus Garvey] movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, just that black people are something.  That they do have a history.  That there's pride and because I noticed that the men gravitated--my father's brothers gravitated to this religion but the, the sisters didn't.
Speaker 1: What did the women gravitate towards?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't really know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I know that they weren't Muslims.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't join the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 1: So, he's, so he has discovered this religion through his brothers?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he, so take the story up from there.
Speaker 2: And basically his brother told him don't eat pork--
Speaker 1: All these values.
Speaker 2: Refrain, right--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all these, you know, great little values, and then my father learned about Elijah Muhammad and I think Elijah Muhammad wrote him and he attempted to write Elijah Muhammad but his, his penmanship was so bad.  So he began practicing his penmanship and, you know, he started reading the dictionary all over again, as his mother [Louise Norton Little], you know, instilled in him when they were younger and then he just really built himself up.  He started studying all the books in the library and, of course, when he was finally released in 1952 from jail [Charlestown State Prison, Boston, Massachusetts], his Uncle Wilfred, his brother, my Uncle Wilfred, picked him up and he stayed with Uncle Wilfred initially.
Speaker 1: Where--and this is in Massachusetts?
Speaker 2: In Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Speaker 1: In Grand Rapids, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, and when he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uncle Wilfred picked him up, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, and when my father went to one of the first meetings, he was in shock that there were not more members.  And so he then began--he was working in a, like Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] or something, and really didn't see the relevance or significance to life, living life, and felt that there's something that, you know, we have to wake these people up.  And so he began working on recruiting new members into the mosque.  And so the next meeting that they had, which was a Founders Day [Saviours' Day], and when Elijah Muhammad saw what this young brother did--when my father joined the Nation of Islam, it wasn't, it wasn't even called the Nation of Islam, it was a handful, there wasn't many members but the thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousand members ultimately was absolutely amazing and it almost, it's unfortunate that it seems to have become a business to some of the officials of the Nation rather an organization that was gonna provide strength and an economic base and an emotional base and all these things to build up former Africans who had been in bondage.  And that was my father's sincere goal.
Story_ID: 315335
Speaker 1: So how did he [Shabazz's father, Malcolm X] meet your mother [Betty Shabazz]?
Speaker 2: So, my mother--
Speaker 1: Shows up--
Speaker 2: --ends up leaving Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and coming to college in Brooklyn [New York], nursing school [Brooklyn State College School of Nursing], and her father, Shelman [Shelman Sandlin], my grandfather, called our Aunt Ruth [Ruth Summerford] in Brooklyn who was also a nurse, and said, "My, my daughter's coming to New York [New York] and, you know, I want you to look out for her," and, you know, all these great things, and my mother was going to nursing school and one of the women that were, that was in the school, invited her to come and hear her minister speak.  And I think the first time he wasn't there, my mother really wasn't interested, but they had some great dinner and, you know, you're a college student, so she was like, oh, yeah, this was really good food.  She had never really experienced this kind of eating, you know, no pork, no, you know all these things.  And the next time she went and she saw my father and he seemed to have gotten an interest in her, you know, that you're very beautiful and brown and just everything that you would, you know, look for in a woman, African--the American woman proud, strong, intelligent, you know, and very, as I'm a lot of, you know, these--people tell me she was extremely, very nice to look at.  You know, a lot of older men tell me, oh, I had a crush on your mama (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was a looker.  So when your--they meet, they marry--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --there are three siblings before you or four?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two, you're the third?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then there are two after you or three?
Speaker 2: And then there's one--there's my sister Gamilah [Gamilah Shabazz] and then the twins, Malikah [Malikah Shabazz] and Malaak [Malaak Shabazz].
Speaker 1: Okay, so now just list your siblings for me in the order including yourself.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Attallah [Attallah Shabazz] is the oldest. A-T-T (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now can you spell these--can you spell them?
Speaker 2: Yes, Attallah, A-T-T-A-L-L-A-H and the next came Qubilah [Qubilah Shabazz], Q-U-B-I-L-A-H, then came me, then Gamilah, G-A-M-I-L-A-H, and then the twins, after my father's, you know, was killed, Malikah and Malaak, M-A-L-I-K-A-H, and Malaak, M-A-L-A-A-K.  And I just have to say that Attallah means God is present, Qubilah means mother nature, my name, God is present, I mean I'm sorry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Attallah means-
Speaker 2: --Attallah means gift of God.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gift of God and then Gamilah means beautiful, Malikah, queen and Malaak, angel.
Speaker 1: So, your mother and father meet and marry?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm sure you have tons of stories about their lives before you were born.  Which are the ones that stand out most for you?
Speaker 2: Um, probably the love and the attention that he gave to her.  Courting her, you know, I think oh, the courting was probably funny because it was never, you know, like today.  You might say, "Wow, you're so beautiful," or, "Oh, you know, I think I like you or anything."  It's just, do you want to go to the museum, you know, or you know there's, you know, always about, you know, different things to talk about and different topics to talk about.  And what I think what really means a lot to me is the way he cared about her and the way he treated her and the respect that he gave her and the relationship.
Story_ID: 315336
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of him [Shabazz's father, Malcolm X]?  I know you were only two years old--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but do you have any memories of him?
Speaker 2: I do have little flickering images 'cause I was almost three and it's just, you know, and then the stories that my family would speak about a lot and there was just that, you know, whenever anyone would talk to me, I would really not pay any mind or do what they ask me to do, "Ilyasah [HistoryMaker Ilyasah Shabazz] come here" (whistle), you know, but when my father said, "Ilyasah," that, that I just went running, you know.  And, you know, I just have some flickering images.  I, I know I remember the love that I had for this, or the, you know, I know loving this person and wanting him and, and being, and always having these teeth--
Speaker 1: Like yours (laughter)?
Speaker 2: --and really smiling and being so loving and gentle.
Speaker 1: Do you remember, at all, being here?
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that day?
Speaker 2: I would say that I don't remember but I think that for something so traumatic, you know, that noise, the gunshots, the chaos, even our mother [Betty Shabazz] throwing us under herself and, of course, and even being pregnant, that there has got to be that trauma, that's there, and even I know that I always had a very discomforting feeling about good-byes and then when my Uncle Wilfred [Wilfred Little; Wilfred X] had come to visit us when, I think, I was about six or seven years old, and when he was leaving, I remember crying and I'd--it was the most painful cry I had ever had and it was because he was leaving.  And I learned all this--remembered all these things as I wrote my book ['Growing Up X: A Memoir by the Daughter of Malcolm X,' Ilyasah Shabazz and Kim McLarin].  And that's when I said, you know, of course I have to--I have to be aware of that.  It's got to be somewhere in my subconscious, you know, the whole, all of the noise and, you know, surrounding my father's death.  But, when my mother passed away, and I came here [The Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, New York, New York], it really gave me such a comforting, wonderful feeling and, you know, and I immediately, you know, got in touch with the people necessary to continue her work because this was her work and it--but had not gotten to this when she had passed away but, you know, we made sure that, you know, we could follow through with her work and her vision, you know, to have this living memorial space for her husband.
Story_ID: 315337
Speaker 1: At this time you lived in Queens [New York]?  You had somehow moved to New York [New York].  When did the family get to New York City?
Speaker 2: Well, we, okay, we lived in East Elmhurst, Queens.
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: So we were born and bred in Brooklyn [New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) well I'm calling that New York City.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm calling that all of that New York, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  It wasn't really, it's more the suburbs of Queens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's across the bridge but our house had been firebombed a week prior to the assassination of our father [Malcolm X] and so we didn't have a house.  We didn't have anything and, and then in 1966, we moved to Mount Vernon [New York].
Speaker 1: Do you know how your mother [Betty Shabazz] and father got to New York from Grand Rapids [Michigan] because he was in Grand Rapids, she was in--
Speaker 2: Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Detroit or then Detroit she left Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Where did they meet?  What city, what city did they meet in the mosque?
Speaker 2: They met in New York.
Speaker 1: In New York.
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: But how had they both gotten to New York?
Speaker 2: Because my mother came to New York from Tuskegee Institute to go to school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to college to finish her education, nursing, Brooklyn [Brooklyn State College School of Nursing, Brooklyn, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The nursing school was here in Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my father, of all the places that he had gone to while he was working on the train.
Speaker 1: When did he work on the train?
Speaker 2: Before he was arrested.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what did he do on the train?
Speaker 2: He was a porter.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was a train porter?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was a train porter.
Speaker 1: Was he--okay.
Speaker 2: He was a train porter and once he got to New York, he said, "Oh, the heck with that train porting stuff," (laughter), "I'm staying here."
Speaker 1: Now did he want to do something else when he was that age?  Had he--did he have aspirations to do something else?
Speaker 2: I don't think so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because what happens is, you know, once you lose your parents or for those who don't have guidance, direction, there are the streets.  There's television, you know, there are all these things that lure or entice someone who doesn't have direction.  And, of course, his father [Earl Little] had been killed, his mother [Louise Norton Little] was put in an institution [Kalamazoo State Hospital; Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital, Kalamazoo, Michigan], so he basically had the streets and he was on his own to do whatever he wanted.
Speaker 1: And he was young.
Speaker 2: Right, he was young.  He was like fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, and he loved the music, the fashion, you know, what a lot of young people like--
Speaker 1: Like today.
Speaker 2: --bling, bling, you know, and so he became a part of that.  And then, of course, the fast--the hustling and, you know in Harlem [New York, New York], and then going back to Massachusetts almost to hide because he had, you know, been in so much trouble with a lot of the hustlers (laughter), you can tell I read, right, and then he went to jail [Charlestown State Prison, Boston, Massachusetts] in Massachusetts.  And, of course, he would come back to New York--
Speaker 1: When he got it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because this was the place--
Speaker 1: That he had had.
Speaker 2: --that he really loved.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then he was here and he starts to develop the Nation of Islam here.
Speaker 2: He established--
Speaker 1: He established it here.
Speaker 2: --many temples and mosques all around the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he became the head of Muslim Mosque No. 7 [Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York], which was right here in Harlem.
Speaker 1: And what was the address of that here in Harlem?
Speaker 2: I believe that's the mosque that's over by 116th Street but eventually they--after he was murdered, slaughtered, assassinated, martyred, they burned that mosque down and built another years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, who burned it down?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know how they have the riots? And, you know--
Speaker 1: Well, this is an oral history--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's why I'm asking.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, hundred years from now--
Speaker 2: Right, right exactly.  I think history has it when you have people of African descent who establish something that might jeopardize one's dominate role in the world's, their power, you know when you're challenging, you know one's position in, in power, that you do whatever it takes not to, you know, have any rising opposition or forces or any--something of competition.  And so the mosque was burned, our house was firebombed, people were killed, organizations were infiltrated.
Story_ID: 315338
Speaker 1: You are talking about your earliest memories of school.
Speaker 2: Oh, my earliest memories of school was being very upset because I had to wear this dress and my tights, I felt were too short (laughter).  You know, I was tall, and I felt like my skirt was too short and my tights were too short and that my tights were down here, my skirt was up here. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Teachers?
Speaker 2: Teachers.  Well there are so many teachers that I really remember.  My--
Speaker 1: The first one that stands out that had an impact on your life?
Speaker 2: It was probably Sheikh Tawfiq [K. Ahamad Tawfiq] who used to come to our house and tutor us but I was probably about six years old at this time, seven, eight, maybe.  And he would come to our house and he would tutor us about Africa, about Islam, and he would tell us all these really fascinating stories and I just remember, just hanging on to every single word he said.  And so he's probably one that had the greatest impact.  Of course, my English teacher, you know, in the senior--my senior grade, Mr. Nathan [ph.], at Hackley School [Tarrytown, New York] was a very famous English teacher.  He's another one who really, you know, had an impact on my life.  And then, of course, you know we went to the St. Joseph Montessori School [Mount Vernon, New York]--
Speaker 1: And Montessori goes from what grades to what grades?
Speaker 2: It's from nursery to--
Speaker 1: And explain to people what the Montessori is.
Speaker 2: The Montessori method is basically having all of the students, not really in the same level, but it's not like you go into your first period class and your second period and third period but that it's an open environment, open learning and there are different levels, or stages, and you might be, you know there's the nursery school, there's the kindergarten and then there's the school itself, and--
Speaker 1: And it is a private school?
Speaker 2: Right, and, and really great, you know, our teacher, you know, we would all be around this huge table and he'd go around and he'd say, take one and two and three and four and five, take away three, multiple by four, divide by two, and he'd point at you and you'd just shoot out the answer.  So it was really, really great.  It was really great.  Very--that school, of course, had ethnic diversity.
Speaker 1: Where was the first Montessori school you went to?
Speaker 2: That I went to in Mount Vernon [New York]?
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: All my sisters, St. Joseph's Montessori School.
Speaker 1: And where's it located?
Speaker 2: 444 Fulton Avenue, Mount Vernon, New York 10553 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your earliest memories is of this teacher sitting around a big round table?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 315339
Speaker 1: What was home life like during that early memory when you remember sitting around the table?
Speaker 2: I would say it was absolutely excellent because it was all of the sisters, you know.  It was very sunshine, you know, lots of light.  A lot of laughter (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your mother's [Betty Shabazz] mood like?
Speaker 2: My mother's--
Speaker 1: Mood--
Speaker 2: Mood.
Speaker 1: What was her mood like?
Speaker 2: She was very loving and always busy traveling a lot.  We had a housekeeper but it just--and our Aunt Ruth Summerford would come and stay with us and our [paternal] grandmother [Louise Norton Little].
Speaker 1: Do you remember what street you lived on then?
Speaker 2: Of course, we still have the house, 234 East 5th Street, Mount Vernon, New York 10553.
Speaker 1: So now was that where--that was where you moved to after your dad [Malcolm X] was killed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so your mom is a single mom now?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she has how many daughters?
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: Six, and she has to put you all through--
Speaker 2: Private schools--
Speaker 1: --private schools.
Speaker 2: --and she did so, by working very hard.  She put all of her six girls in the school and then she--three went to the United Nations International School [New York, New York] and, you know, I went to The Masters School [Dobbs Ferry, New York], which was an all-girls boarding school.  And I remember her calling her adoptive mother, Helen Malloy, one year, who sent her the money for my tuition.  And I went to The Masters School which was an all-girls boarding prep school and then I went to the Hackley Preparatory School [Hackley School, Tarrytown, New York] which was co-ed.  And it was expensive and my mother just worked non-stop to make sure that her children had a quality education.  It had nothing to do with class, you know it was a quality education.  Nothing to do with wanting us to be around all-white people, she just wanted to make sure that we had a quality education and she gave us the balance by us having this history tutor [K. Ahamad Tawfiq] who taught us, you know, to be proud of who we are.  If we had statues of--I remember this woman statue with a fruit basket on her head from Haiti and a child by her side, which was really tall.  I remember I would always go and, you know, look at the woman, the little woman with this basket on her head and all this art that represented a part of who we were, you know, from the diaspora, and you know, just, you know my mother was--I just think the world of her, you know, what she did.  But she was in--she was pleasant, she was good, she was--
Speaker 1: How did she discipline you--the girls?
Speaker 2: Well, every Sunday, we always went to the mosque and so we always spent Sundays, Saturdays, Saturdays with dance lessons.  I mean, we just did everything.  She really kept us very busy.  God bless her.  And Sundays we all went to the mosque no matter what we did the night before and it was like, "Please, Mommy, please, can we just stay home, I'm not feeling well."  No matter what, you had to get up and we all went to the mosque together.  And after the mosque was over, we would all go out to eat.  We'd all see some, you know, 'The Wizard of Oz,' what was it, 'The Wiz.'  We would go to an orchestra, you know, which to me was absolute torture (laughter).  You know, sitting there over and over and over and just all of the violins and the strings, but of course, you know, in my adult life I have such an appreciation for music, for all kinds of music.  And she just really kept us very active and, and plays, I remember her taking us to see this one play called, 'The River of Niger' [sic. 'The River Niger,' Joseph A. Walker].  And for some reason, this play sort of reminded me of good times for some reason because I remember the talk and I remember this couple and it was sort of dark in a living room and then all of a sudden they were moaning and groaning.  And so my mother got all of us and we followed her out.  So I could imagine for my oldest sister [Attallah Shabazz], who was older and probably knew what was going on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Knew, yeah.
Speaker 2: --she was probably embarrassed and she had this big huge afro and then Qubilah [Qubilah Shabazz]--and we were like in age order, Attallah, Qubilah, Ilyasah [HistoryMaker Ilyasah Shabazz], Gamilah [Gamilah Shabazz], Malikah [Malikah Shabazz], Malaak [Malaak Shabazz], I'm sure we looked like, you know, the ducklings.

Speaker 1: What do you remember about the community [in Mount Vernon, New York]?  That the street you grew up on?  Describe the street to me.
Speaker 2: It was beautiful.  It was a tree-lined street.  And I just remember, like every summer we went to camp in Vermont.  And, you know, or we would go to our grandmother's [Madeline Sandlin] house in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] for, this is where my grandfather [Shelman Sandlin], my biological grandfather is, we would go to our grandmother's for Christmas or Thanksgiving or a break in between school and we would always come back home and I just remember being so excited 'cause there were all these trees that just kind of sunk into the street and then our house was up, it was a high-raised, high-raised colonial house which was a lot of greenery, pachysandra, you know all kinds of lilies and stuff and just what my mother [Betty Shabazz] liked.  And, of course, she would get us out there to pick the weeds and, you know, we had a gardener so I'm thinking, I'm not picking these weeds.  But, of course, you know I guess she wanted us to--there was a reason that she had us out there, of course, without scarves on.  You know, you feel like (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Did you wear the, the Muslim scarf?
Speaker 2: No, sometimes, you know--
Speaker 1: When did you--
Speaker 2: --when we went to the mosque (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you went to the mosque.
Speaker 2: --and prayed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When--mostly during jumu'ah when you're praying, you know you have your hair covered and any other thing covered.
Speaker 1: So how did, how, where there community leaders and how did you feel about other people in the community?
Speaker 2: There were a lot of children and our house actually was on a corner.  So there was the main street, which was East 5th Street and then there was Cedar Avenue, which was a--had a cul-de-sac and it was a dead-end and at the end of it, all the way up the hill was the woods.  So we just had a lot of fun.  I mean, it was really, to me, it was like the best childhood.  I remember my banana--my bike with the banana seat with all the flowers on it, you know, and riding up and down and playing kick ball and one, two, three.  I mean, just like everything, you know.
Speaker 1: So do you remember any--like did your mom have community meetings at the house?  I mean, how active did you, how active was she in local civil rights?
Speaker 2: She was active.  I don't think she really involved us in that.
Speaker 1: How much of it did you see as a child?  Or did you even know what was going on?
Speaker 2: All I know is that I was always, I was al--I don't know what the word is but I was always strong, you know, and I was always very proud and I was very red, black and green, you know.  And, you know, I remember like Curtis Mayfield coming to the house and Ellis Haizlip and Miriam Makeba and Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and, you know, different people coming to our home but not really knowing that there was racism, you know.  I knew that there were strong black people but I didn't know about racism, you know.   And I think that for even our mother, she didn't teach us about Malcolm X, the icon, but we knew about daddy, and we knew that daddy was strong and he did something great but, you know, we didn't--she never taught us about Malcolm X the icon because if you teach about Malcolm X the icon, you're teaching racism, you're teaching things that may have been painful for her and she wanted to overprotect her children.  And I think what was important to my mother was to make sure that we felt secure, that we felt safe, that we felt loved, that we felt proud and that we knew our history.
Story_ID: 315341
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to The Masters School in Dobbs Ferry [New York] first.
Speaker 1: And then you went to, after that, you went to--
Speaker 2: I went to Hackley [Hackley School, Tarrytown, New York].
Speaker 1: And that was a boarding school?
Speaker 2: No, The Masters School was a boarding school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, I didn't always stay. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it was a boarding school.
Speaker 1: How--coming up on your--at what point during your life did you realize you were the daughter of Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: Probably when I went to college, you know.
Speaker 1: So not until then?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so talk to me then about what leads you--how did you decide which college you were going to go to because I read that you decided, "Oh, I want to go to a historically black school [HBCU]."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?  What form--
Speaker 2: I think my mother [Betty Shabazz], again, was being overprotective because I was naive and I thought (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About--
Speaker 2: --about black people.  I thought we were great.  I thought that we all loved each other.  I thought that everything was beautiful and wonderful.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, when did you realize that you were black, and quote unquote black, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I was in--
Speaker 1: --in the sense, I mean, as to be like a black American or whatever?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) When I went to camp [Camp Betsey Cox, Pittsford, Vermont].  You know, I was going to camp since I was seven--
Speaker 1: In Vermont.
Speaker 2: --and it was in Vermont.
Speaker 1: Which is pretty white?
Speaker 2: Right, and I think when I was about fifteen and I must have started like liking boys or looking at them, and I realized there were no black boys.  And I started looking around and I'm like, there are no black people, you know, and I think--I remember, I don't know what it was that I had experienced because I absolutely looked forward to going to camp every year but there was something, there just were not black people.  And Nina Simone's daughter, Lisa Stroud [Simone], was another girl who grew up with us 'cause her mother traveled a lot and my mother figured what's one extra daughter.  And Lisa went to camp with us.  And I just remember that there's just was Lisa, it was me, it was my sister Gamilah [Gamilah Shabazz] and then, you know, there were some trinkles--trinklets, you know, black people that, that began to come to the camp, you know, as we were getting older but I think it was when I was in camp that I realized that there really, you know, I, I understood, not understood, but I was recognizing the difference between me and between someone who was not African American.
Speaker 1: And what were the differences that you recognized?  Did you date any white boys?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't date at all because there were no black boys around?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there was one girl who had a brother and a cousin who came to the camp for, you know, the camp was broken up in a first session and a second session.  We stayed the whole summer.  And there were, you know, these two boys and I think that's probably what it was.  And so there was a time where Jackie and Vernon, were the two boys, Jackie Lassiter [ph.] and Vernon Black [ph.], and they were at camp, and very, of course I thought they were so handsome, but then they must have left.  And so when we would have our socials, you know our square dancing, and get togethers, I think when they were gone, I realized something's just really weird and I don't--I don't feel like I want to be here anymore.
Speaker 1: So did you dance with white boys at that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure I did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I never dated, you know--
Speaker 1: Dated, okay.
Speaker 2: --I was friendly, of course--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --even in--
Speaker 1: But did you feel you couldn't for some reason?
Speaker 2: No, I just had no desire to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, there were, you know, guys--
Speaker 1: I'll stop there, you don't (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 315342
Speaker 1: What aspect of that [Shabazz's experience at Camp Betsey Cox, Pittsford, Vermont] led you to say, I want to go to a historically black college [HBCU] and then which college did you choose?
Speaker 2: I didn't choose my college, my mother [Betty Shabazz] did (laughter), but when I was in the eleventh grade, I went to a school that closed so I had to go to Hackley [Hackley School, Tarrytown, New York], and it was the Scarborough Country Day School [Scarborough Day School, Briarcliff Manor, New York].  And there was a girl there that I met named Joy [ph.] and she was black and so we had decided, we're going to go to a black college and, you know, we're going to go to college together and it was either going to be Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and there was another one that I can't think of right now.  And--
Speaker 1: But, but, okay, you--what, you and I grew up in the same era.  What led you to want to go to a historically black college?  If you--like what had, I mean, what made the two of you decide, we're going to a black school.  Like, what did that mean?  You wanted to be around mainly black people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you feel--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I think because I had gone to school with white people all the time, and I had, there's nothing wrong, but there was something I thought that I was missing or something that I was yearning and it just--it could have even been that it was something that I didn't have and so therefore I wanted it but it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did you--go ahead.  Did you talk to your mom about that feeling?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she knew the schools that I had sent out for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you and your friend decide that you're going to a black school?  And what reasons did you give each other at that age because you're a teenager, you're like seventeen or eighteen?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I remember taking a history, history, American history, and I absolutely was bored to tears and I didn't know, I was wondering like, I just was not in the class.  I didn't like it, I didn't enjoy it, there was nothing of interest for me and it just seemed very dark.  And then, you know, if they talked about black people it was just, there was nothing.  There was no--there was nothing that made me feel good or that inspired me to want to listen so that I could learn and take, and do well on my tests.
Speaker 1: Which was different than the African tutor [K. Ahamad Tawfiq] that you'd had coming to your home?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so nothing that makes you want to do well on your tests?
Speaker 2: Right, I just know that that class, I did not like at all and all I could--I just couldn't wait till I could get out and, and take a history course that was--
Speaker 1: Reflective of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, reflective and refreshing.
Speaker 1: So you decide--your mother decides you're going to which university?
Speaker 2: My mother one day said to me, come on, we're going to go take a ride to SUNY New Paltz [State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, New York] and my mother was working for CUNY, City University of New York, at Medgar Evers College [New York, New York], and the State University of New York was in New Paltz, which was about a seventy mile ride out of New York City [New York, New York], so I said, okay.  So, you know, we go up to the campus and it's a nice green campus and, and, you know, we went, I think we went on an interview, appointment, and basically she did the talking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where they show you the campus, yeah.
Speaker 2: And then she was just like, how do you like your new school?  I'm like, okay.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't historically black?
Speaker 2: No, not at all, not at all, but there was a summer program going on, which was a group of students and there were a lot of--there were more black people than I had ever seen.  So I was excited.
Speaker 1: Now you're in college.  At what point did your mother go back to school and start pursuing, or continuing--
Speaker 2: Her Ph.D.?
Speaker 1: --her Ph--finishing school and getting her Ph.D.?  When did that happen?
Speaker 2: My mother went from Mount Vernon, New York, in her Oldsmobile car, and she drove to Massachusetts.  I believe she left like Sunday night, after mouths--and washing and doing our hair, she would leave late Sunday night, early Monday, and she would come back on Wednesday.  And that was when I was in--at Montessori [St. Joseph Montessori School, Mount Vernon, New York].  So I was probably about eleven, twelve.
Speaker 1: And, who else stayed with you?
Speaker 2: All of my sisters.
Speaker 1: All of your sisters plus--
Speaker 2: And our housekeeper, our housekeeper.
Speaker 1: The housekeeper plus you had, at which point did Nina Simone's daughter go--
Speaker 2: And Lisa [Lisa Stroud; Simone].
Speaker 1: --and Lisa.  So Lisa grew up with you like she was your sister as well?
Speaker 2: Right.  She, yeah, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --she calls herself Lisa the Seventh.
Speaker 1: Lisa the Seventh.
Speaker 2: The seventh daughter.
Speaker 1: Which was common for African American families to have like a village lifestyle, to take other people in and take care of them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so your mother did that with Nina's daughter.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So your--
Speaker 2: We did yoga together and ballet lessons and we even had a little rabbit fur coat (laughter).  I had a brown one and Lisa had a white one.  We didn't like our coats, but anyway.
Speaker 1: So, at, when you get to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We felt like little kittens.
Speaker 1: --like little kittens.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 315343
Speaker 1: When you get to New Paltz [State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, New York], and you are in school, what triggers you realizing that you are the daughter of Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: When people started chasing me on campus.
Speaker 1: Now give me one specific moment where the light bulb went off and you said, "Oh, my God, I'm the daughter of Malcolm X" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I remember when I went to school.  My mother [Betty Shabazz] had put me in one dorm, Crispell [Crispell Hall], I believe it was, and--or Bouton Hall, one of those, and I remember having on these tan colored shorts, this brown t-shirt that said, "Yasah [ph.]," you know with the letters that you would iron on?  It was this brown t-shirt with tan letters that said, "Yasah" and my little tan like walking shoes and I remember all of these students coming to my dorm, a lot of African American students, and two in particular, Moses [ph.] and Shamash [ph.], and they were very tall, and Shamash had short locks and, you know, and Moses was probably about six foot eight with dark glasses on, and so in retrospect, I'm sure like they were excited and they couldn't wait for Malcolm X's daughter.  They knew that she was coming to school and they couldn't wait.  I had no idea of this, of course.  So I'm sure when they met me they were probably like, whoa, you know because I was fifteen and I was naive and, you know, I'm sure they expected someone either in a dashiki or combat gear or something, you know, not someone in t-shirt with a--I mean shorts and a t-shirt that says, "Yasah," and I'm like, "Hi."  So, then they got all my things out of the dorm, where my mother had put together for me, you know my whole little bed and all this stuff.  And they put me in W.E.--I mean, in the DuBois Dormitory, the W.E.B. DuBois [DuBois Hall] and they just had an agenda for me and I remember calling--I had a girlfriend who had--she and I had gone to school together and she was going to come visit me in college and I remember calling her up, Christine Kreis [ph.], and telling her--'cause she was white, that she could not come and visit me because it's different here, you know.  And I mean it was okay but it was different but it was--
Speaker 1: Did she come and visit?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why could she not come and visit?
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was really different.  It was--
Speaker 1: What was different?
Speaker 2: It was divided, you know, somewhat and I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, I'm gonna explore a little bit and you were what?
Speaker 2: I was a, I was their revolutionary hero's daughter and they had expectations.
Speaker 1: And therefore you couldn't have a white friend because--
Speaker 2: It wasn't that I couldn't have a white friend--
Speaker 1: But she couldn't come and visit you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I think it would have been uncomfortable.
Speaker 1: For you?
Speaker 2: For her to come and visit and--
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: Because it wasn't about black and white, it was about how are, how is Ilyasah [HistoryMaker Ilyasah Shabazz] going to fit into our agenda to alleviate, or to address, a lot of the concerns--
Speaker 1: On campus.
Speaker 2: --on campus.
Speaker 1: What were their concerns?  What did they want you to address on campus?  Was there racism on campus?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, it was--the--from what I was told, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] lived up there, you know.  That they were bigots.  That--
Speaker 1: Well how much of a responsibility did you feel you should take on of their cause being that you were Malcolm X's daughter?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as I was concerned, their cause was my cause.
Speaker 1: Okay, what does that mean though?  That means Lisa [sic. Christine Kreis (ph.)]--
Speaker 2: Well I think--
Speaker 1: --can't come and visit me?
Speaker 2: Well that was okay.  I can see her when I go home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she can't come here--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because it's not comfortable.  And I'm going to explain to her, "Hey, it's different here, you know.  Black people, you know, are sticking together and the white people are sticking together and there's"--even though there were people who were friends and it may not have even been that extreme to someone else, but to me that's what I felt.  And also, I was very happy to see so many black people and my tagline was, "Hi, my name is Ilyasah, I live at 3028 DuBois."  And it was very innocent but, of course, some people took it the wrong way.  They thought, "Ooh," you know.  And, but people would chase me and then they would say, "You're Malcolm X's daughter" and I was like, "Huh" and that was when I started saying, "No, I'm not."  And it wasn't that I wasn't proud of my father or to be his daughter, but it just became way too much, you know.  It was overwhelming, the expectations, who am I supposed to be, what am I supposed to do?  Whatever it is, it's not who I am.  And I remember calling my oldest sister, Attallah [Attallah Shabazz], and asking her, "What, what am I supposed to do?"  You know, who am I--what do, you know.  And she had said to me, you don't have to pass a test to be Malcolm's daughter, you already are.  So whoever you are, is fine.  Now, of course, it sounds profound now, back then, it was still overwhelming and still a lot of pressure.  And I remember just getting very sick, you know, because it was just too much, you know, that--I had to make a speech that someone wrote for me so I could be the chair, this co-chair student--I mean the co-chair person of culture maybe.  One year it was co-chair of the Black Student Union and another year it was the cultural, you know, chairperson of the Student Union and Black Student Union.  And I really didn't know much about some of these things that they were experiencing 'cause my mother really sheltered us.
Story_ID: 315344
Speaker 1: Were you shocked about what you were coming to see now and hearing about what other black people's experiences had been [at the State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, because my mother [Betty Shabazz] even took us to a neighborhood and showed us--like we saw strife.  We saw people who had been emotionally, psychologically traumatized, you know, and now drinking.  Walking up and down the street talking to themselves.  You know, we saw all kinds of things because she would show us.  We'd drive through, you know, areas.
Speaker 1: So after you discover this awareness that you are Malcolm X's daughter, how does that impact the relationship you're now having with your mother?  Are you more inquisitive about who your father was?  Do you, do you go to your mother to help her define who you should be?
Speaker 2: No, because it was--they wanted me to be whomever I was and to feel happy and content with that.
Speaker 1: What then, once you discover how great of a man your father was and what he had been--what he had set out to do, what did you then talk to your mother about in relation to your father?
Speaker 2: You know, I remember one summer, I think it was my first summer of being--staying up at school 'cause you know you did summer school, and I moved off campus, and I remember reading the autobiography ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley] for the first time, 'cause I was like fifteen--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--I think it was in '79 [1979]--I don't, and, and reading it, you know, from an adult perspective, you know, as much as an adult as I was--that I was, and I remember just really crying night after night after day after day because, you know, and again, it had to have been something inside of me that still missed him or may have remembered the time that he was assassinated.  But my mother really had been so strategic, she was just amazing that she really focused on our, being busy and being fulfilled, you know, through our childhood.
Story_ID: 315345
Speaker 1: Everyone else had an agenda for you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --as Malcolm X's daughter in college [at the State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, New York].  What agenda did you have for yourself?  And by that I mean, what did you major in and what did you want to do with your own life?
Speaker 2: You know, I had--I was a math major, yeah I was a math major.
Speaker 1: That's shocking.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a math--
Speaker 1: Did you like math?
Speaker 2: I loved math until I took linear math and then I didn't know what the professor was talking about and I didn't see the relevance to my life and so I dropped out.  And then I changed my major to computer science and again I didn't see the relevance (laughter), not only to my life, I just didn't see the relevance to life at that time.  And I went--I wanted to do broadcast communications, broadcast, but it didn't seem like it was enough and that's probably because I'm thinking, my father did this great thing, my mother's [Betty Shabazz] this great person, so I have to be a doctor or a lawyer or something in that realm and so I became a biology major.  And I was just going, to go to school and, you know, to have friends and play Pac-Man and people were chasing me and asking me, was my father Malcolm X and then they were, you know, kind of disappointed that I wasn't this fiery, revolutionary and, and then I remember going home and asking my mother, "Please can I move off the campus."  And I didn't really know how I was going to ask her but I knew that I didn't want to live on campus because everywhere I went they were watching, right?  And, I remember we had gone out to eat, we were at a restaurant, and I was thinking, how am I going to ask her 'cause I really want to move off campus because it was really, it was absolutely overwhelming and I just couldn't handle it at all.  And I asked my mother if I could move off campus and she didn't even say why or how much is it, she just said, "Yes."  And it was emotional for me when I asked her 'cause I told her that people were, you know, in my business and they were talking about me, they were saying these bad things, and I'm sure that she understood and that was her reason for not sending me south, you know, and that was her reason for wanting to keep me close and wanting to have me in an environment that was, you know, very neutral, you know, because perhaps, I don't know, if I had gone to a historical black college [HBCU], her fear may have been that her daughter was not prepared.  She's not what they're going to expect of her.  You know, I'd gone to camp [Camp Betsey Cox, Pittsford, Vermont] in Vermont with Native Americans and Quaker, you know singing, "Kumbaya Lord" and, you know, by the lake, and, you know, these prep schools [The Masters School, Dobbs Ferry, New York and Hackley School, Tarrytown, New York], you know, and I had this history of Africa, beautiful, great, unity and it really was not what the world really was.  I think that she gave me all of the basic, the basic needs, the basic utensils and--
Speaker 1: So what year did you graduate college?  Or when did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, it doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated in the '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 315346
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s] you graduate college [State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, New York] and what was next for you?
Speaker 2: What was next for me?  I was in a very bad car accident.  I was going to go to medical school and I was in a very bad car accident and I missed entrance for September to go to school, to go to medical school, and I remember trying to get into Howard's medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] in January and they just weren't having it, register--surely, I can you know, start school in January, but it was just not happening for medical school.  And so then I started teaching at Mount Vernon High School [Mount Vernon, New York] and from teaching--
Speaker 1: What did you teach?
Speaker 2: English, yeah I was teaching English.  And it was--I had taken, it was someone's, you know, when the professor's not coming back so you can take their part, but I wasn't certified to teach, to teach English.  And so then I was supposed to get certified to teach biology and I really didn't want to.  And I ended up going to work for the City University of New York Office of Academic Affairs [New York, New York] and that was where I helped, as the coordinator of the CUNY Prep Program [CUNY Preparatory Transitional High School Program], helped high school dropouts--
Speaker 1: Hold on for just a second.  School dropouts--
Speaker 2: Right, and--
Speaker 1: Did you feel a calling to do something like that?
Speaker 2: Well I always, even when I was in college, I worked at group homes, lockup facilities, you know, on a volunteer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that your way of being involved in a way in the black community?
Speaker 2: No, it was just who I was--
Speaker 1: It's just who you are.
Speaker 2: --even when I was in high school, you know.  When I was going to Masters [The Masters School, Dobbs Ferry, New York], I would go and tutor at, it was The Graham Home for Children [Graham Windham, New York, New York].  So it was a group home there and I would go and tutor them in math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when I was in college, I basically found another group home and, and detention center and I went there and I would mentor, tutor a lot of the girls.
Speaker 1: So when you were teaching and you decided you didn't want to teach biology, what happened next for you in life?  You left Mount--
Speaker 2: Right, I went to the City University of New York Office of Academic Affairs and I was the coordinator of a CUNY Prep Program which basically encouraged higher education to high school dropouts and so we would get very creative and, you know, we would--just like I did when I was teaching English at Mount Vernon High School, I would--like if it was--whatever subject, I would teach or anything that I would try to encourage them to learn or see the importance of, I always tried to show the rele--the relevance.  You know, like, if we're counting--if we need, if we, okay let me just think for a moment, if I'm going to teach them how to write, then we're going to--while I'm teaching them how to write an essay, it's going to be about Frederick Douglass or Fannie Lou Hamer or King Tut [Tutankhamun] or Moses, what--that I would tie in the relevance of who they are, you know, their culture, their history, that they know nothing about but it would intrigue them or I would tie in Whitney Houston, who was very big at the time.  I would tie in Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown and, you know, the New Edition, whoever their favorite musicians were, I would somehow tie that in to make it more exciting and identifiable and so that was something that I enjoyed and then doing editing a, a publication which was entitled, 'The Way We Feel.'  So, that was just always tapping into whomever they are and, and trying to show the relevance and the importance of education and learning and participating in the market[place].
Story_ID: 315347
Speaker 1: --Place (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And how did you go from there to being involved in the--is it Kedar Entertainment [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: And then while I was at the Office of Academic Affairs [at the City University of New York, New York, New York], I met Spike Lee and his movie came--had just been released, 'She's Gotta Have It' and I went to see the movie and I said, I've got to get in touch with him (laughter).  And--
Speaker 2: Now look, wait, before we go any further, did you feel you could get in touch with him?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Had that been your experience once something you could reach out to--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --people, no, that had not been your--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So this is the first time?
Speaker 1: Um, yes, well you know why?  Because and, 'She's Got To Have It,' I saw reference of my father [Malcolm X] and so, you know like we're--
Speaker 2: What was the reference?
Speaker 1: It might have been a picture in the background of Malcolm X.  It might have been, "By any means necessary," you know, the quote, but I just thought there was something in--that I saw in the movie that made me comfortable enough to want to reach out to him 'cause really had I not been my father's and mother's [Betty Shabazz] daughter in this day, I more than likely would have been in the arts, you know, because I always, you know wrote the screenplays, wrote the movies, you know, did the dancing and, you know, all that stuff.  And I got in touch with him and we went out a couple of times and, of course, he, he almost ridiculed me that, you know, my hair was straight--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh--
Speaker 1: And that, and that, you know--
Speaker 2: This is before 'School Daze,' before he did 'School Daze'?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you meet Spike Lee?
Speaker 1: But we were friends, right.
Speaker 2: You were friends and he says--
Speaker 1: And you got all excited.
Speaker 2: I know, just, you know why, because, it's funny, I had not seen a picture of you before a few days ago.  When I saw the picture and saw your hair, I laughed to myself because even in this day and age, I'm expecting an Afro (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: Now why would I expect you to have--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --like Leah [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm probably the only one in my family whose hair is straight.
Speaker 2: Okay, so go ahead.  You meet Spike Lee, he starts to ridicule you?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because you're friends, he can do it?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In a joking way.
Speaker 1: Right, and I was, you know, I liked Madonna (laughter) but I liked a lot of other things, you know, but I liked Madonna and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what did he say about that?
Speaker 1: --and I had on these like black ski pants and this oversized black ski sweater, you know, and these like, these little off-white boots.  You know, they were kind of Madonna looking-ish, you know, and, I mean, it was the '80s [1980s], you know.  And I remember him like looking me up and down like--we went to the Knicks [New York Knicks] game and I remember after the game was over, I went home and I gave him my boots.  I told my girlfriend all about our little, you know, date and I gave him--I gave her my boots.  I was like, and I liked those boots, they were nice (laughter) but I had to get rid of them because I had been ridiculed.
Speaker 2: And he ridiculed you because he felt that you were not black enough?
Speaker 1: He ridiculed me because I did not fit his expectation of who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what happened?
Speaker 1: --he thought I should be.
Speaker 2: And who did he think you should be?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  Whomever he thought Malcolm was, you know, and I think that that had been the case and I used to really tussle with that but then I found that what is more important is to be able to look in the mirror and be pleased with the reflection.  When you go to bed at night, are you pleased with what you've done?  Are you pleased with what's in your heart?  Are you pleased with whom you are?  And I love myself and I'm proud of myself.  And I'm very grateful for my parents, for all that they taught me for being able to look at my mother's life, for being able to look at my father's life and seeing how they were able to overcome with faith, you know, and God, and how they were able to overcome all of their obstacles that they confronted, and to learn from that and knowing that they had given all of whom they are, you know, to us and that they served God very, very well.  And that my mother was still laughing and dancing, you know, years after witnessing this, you know, her father--her husband--
Speaker 2: Her husband.
Speaker 1: --and then having to raise six girls--
Speaker 2: On her own.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, and just all of what she did.  And that my father still laughed even when people did not support or protect, you know, him and all that he was confronting for the benefit of all of us, not for the benefit of just himself--
Speaker 2: Himself.
Speaker 1: --'cause he was very smart.  You knew everything about him.  And so, I was just happy that I could learn from them and, and adapt the values and, you know, life lessons by just looking at these two individuals who happened to be my parents, to my own self and not, you know, be broken after seeing my mother, you know, dying, burned, that I was not bitter, that I was not living, you know, despaired.  That I was not angry at the world but that I still have a zest for life and that I still want to give and help but I understand that it's not my responsibility, it's all of our responsibilities but it's something that I choose to do, that it's a personal obligation and a personal commitment.
Story_ID: 315348
Speaker 1: When you're sitting there talking with Spike [Spike Lee] and he does his little thing, how does it lead, how does it lead from that to you actually working with him?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Having the opportunity to work with him?
Speaker 2: Well we, we really became friends and I think I wanted to do movies or I--like, like, I really had such--I enjoyed being in this, in the creative part.  That's really who I, you know, that's me.  And that's my love for the arts.  And he--I was a production assistant for, he tried to, I think, tried to match make me, match make me with Magic [sic.], Michael Jordan.  You know Michael Jordan wasn't interested, but, you know, he was just nice.  You know, he really did try to like introduce me to different guys, you know, and so I was a production assistant when he did the commercials for Michael Jordan, I mean, you know I got to go to his parties, you know, for the movie and it was a whole new scene.  I got to be in a video for Steel Pulse.  You know, I got to then audition for, you know his movie, 'Jungle Fever' and all these things.
Speaker 1: Right, so with the movie 'Jungle Fever,' Spike Lee's a good point of reference for us because his movies have all been good, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They can--so remember, which movie was it that he dedicated to the young kid who was killed out in like, not, his name starts with a Y, Yusef--
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: Yusef Hawkins.
Speaker 2: Yusef Hawkins.
Speaker 1: And, do you remember?  I think it was--
Speaker 2: I think that was 'Do The Right Thing.'
Speaker 1: 'Do The'--
Speaker 2: I'm not really sure--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which one.
Speaker 1: All right, but do you, okay, so you were with him--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --during the making of that movie or the--because that was--
Speaker 2: I knew him.
Speaker 1: You knew him, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think I was--
Speaker 1: So, and then you also knew him for the, the--
Speaker 2: 'School Daze'?
Speaker 1: --I mean, let's just, let's just jump to 'Malcolm X'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when he decides I'm going to make a movie about your dad.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What is your relationship with him like at this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time we were friends and I was working at the William Morris Agency [William Morris Endeavor].  Now this was the good thing, that was why I met Spike Lee because he, you know, I realized that I could get paid for something that I enjoyed, that, you know, this was not necessarily a hobby.  You know, I just thought, okay, you know, I love the arts but that's a hobby.  But then when I found that you could have a job, you know, doing something that you like, as opposed to something that was just such work, that was really the--one of the benefits in befriending Spike because he really showed, you know, he showed me behind the scenes, and in front of the camera, you know.  And he really gave me some opportunities that I would have never known could possibly exist.  And so that's how I got into the entertainment industry and I started working for William Morris Agency.
Speaker 1: William Morris Agency as a music agent?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And who did you represent?
Speaker 2: Um, gosh, I can't--
Speaker 1: You can't even remember?
Speaker 2: Bobby Brown was really big at the time, everyone.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you didn't like that or you decided that--
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked it very much.
Speaker 1: But you moved away from that to move--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I moved--where did I go after that?  I, you know, what did I know 'cause I think that would be another one of my ideal jobs to be an agent of sorts-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 315349
Speaker 1: He [Spike Lee] decides I'm going to make a movie about your father [Malcolm X]?
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: Malcolm, Malcolm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, Spike does?
Speaker 2: Spike Lee, right.
Speaker 1: And at the opening of this movie, he uses the footage from Rodney King.  Rodney King, the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] riots had happened.  What did you think?  Or like, do you know when something big happens that's black, they usually they call it, Spike Lee, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton], they haven't made it down to you yet, but I'm sure if you put yourself out there, they'd call you too.  What do you think?  But what did you think about--
Speaker 2: I thought it was really ingenious.  I mean, because you saw an American flag.  We remember around that time there was Rodney King who was beat down by the L.A.P.D. [Los Angeles Police Department] and it just so happened that someone had a video camera, that, you know, where we were all able to view this footage.  And the significance of what my father was talking about, what his mission was about, and for the American flag to burn into an X, after that beating, I just thought, "Oh, take me to heaven."  (Laughter)  "Take me to church."
Speaker 1: So how did, what did you think about the movie itself?
Speaker 2: I thought the movie was really based on the autobiography ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley]--
Speaker 1: Of Alex Haley's book.
Speaker 2: Right, it was, it was strictly, you know, that's what I got.  That he basically brought the autobiography--
Speaker 1: To life?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were your opinions about the, the L.A. riots when that, when they let those guys off?  Did you have any opinions about, about it one way or another?  Were you in a position when that happened to express your opinions to other people?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Well even to your friends?
Speaker 2: I'm sure that--
Speaker 1: What did you say to people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I was probably, you know you think the audacity and for someone to be so arrogant and have no regard for someone and to want to beat 'em down and keep telling him that he's a nigger and that he's nothing, and the arrogance of someone in authority to violate, you know, and just really beat someone, you know, as badly as they did, was, you know, it definitely angered me.
Story_ID: 315350
Speaker 1: So you're in the entertainment business, you're working for William Morris [William Morris Agency; William Morris Endeavor], you move away from that job and you go from William Morris to--
Speaker 2: Kedar Entertainment [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And what is Kedar Entertainment?
Speaker 2: Kedar Massenburg was the chairman, chairperson and CEO of--
Speaker 1: And will you spell--I think it's K-E-N-D-A-R?
Speaker 2: K-E-D-A-R.
Speaker 1: K-E-, K-E-D-A-R, Kedar.
Speaker 2: Kedar Entertainment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and he became the chairman and he had this great, the big position for Motown Records [Detroit, Michigan] that was distributed for Universal Music Group.  And Kedar Entertainment, we were able to, to showcase innovative talent where they expressed culture, you know, African culture and their pride in that.  And I was very excited, you know, to, of course, help do that.
Speaker 1: And then your book ['Growing Up X: A Memoir by the Daughter of Malcolm X,' Ilyasah Shabazz and Kim McLarin] comes about?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What sparks the interest in you to tell your story or to tell this particular story?
Speaker 2: Well actually my mother [Betty Shabazz] passed away in 1997 and--
Speaker 1: Do you want to talk about that at all?
Speaker 2: What did you--what do you--
Speaker 1: I mean, did the--how it happened or what's surrounding it?  Was it a shock to you?
Speaker 2: Yes, of course, it was very much of a shock because, you know, we almost grow up thinking that, at least I grew up thinking, that my mother was invincible and I remember getting a call from someone and basically saying to come to the hospital and it was one of the hospital administrators and it was about two o'clock in the morning, and I asked was it bad and they said, "Yes," and so it was, you know, scary.  And--but then it was about maybe eight months or so prior that she was in the hospital.  You know, I found her and she was in the hospital for dehydration.  She had traveled.  She was just always working, working, working and she was in China at the Women's International [United Nations Fourth World Conference for Women]--no, it was the Women's Conference--
Speaker 1: In Beijing [China]?
Speaker 2: Right, Beijing, China, which, what is that?
Speaker 1: It's the Women's International--I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it's--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: I have it written down, I'll tell you.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So she was dehydrated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was when I saw her at a very weak, vulnerable point and, and, you know, I stayed with her in the hospital, of course, for a long time and then she came and stayed at my house and she got better and she's back to, you know, being Betty.  You know, running things and doing things.
Speaker 1: All over the country, all over the world?
Speaker 2: Right, right, and so when I got the call that, you know, she was in the hospital and that it was bad and it was a fire, oh, it was just really bad.  And I went to the hospital and I saw her and it was very, very, very bad and--
Speaker 1: It was worse than you expected?
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh, yes, it was really very bad and no one else saw her like that, you know, because after they realized who she was, they decided that they were going to bandage her up and put her in ICU [intensive care unit] for people to basically say good bye.  And--
Speaker 1: They knew she would not survive?
Speaker 2: It was 90--you know, the records say 85, but it was 97 percent of her body.  She was, it was almost as if someone like just, she just, everything was just burned, from her head to the bottom of her feet, it was black.  It was terrible.  And so it was real bad.  And then--
Speaker 1: Your nephew [Malcolm Shabazz]--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, now that I should say because my mother--it was a small area of the house that was on fire, very, very small.
Speaker 1: Very small.
Speaker 2: Right, and the nightgown that my mother wore--
Speaker 1: Was flammable?
Speaker 2: Right, and that's where it got her.  So it wasn't as if, you know, my nephew--
Speaker 1: That baby set the whole house afire and it burned down?
Speaker 2: Never, and it wasn't even near her bedroom, but it was at the end of a hallway.  And so when I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it just--accident, a fluke, that it caught her gown?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: How is he now?
Speaker 2: He's fine.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: We're having a birthday party for him.
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Speaker 2: Maybe I'll invite you too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were saying that your mother passing has something to do with you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --putting this story down.
Speaker 2: And you know, right before she passed away--
Speaker 1: So you had the opportunity to say good-bye?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you make any promises to her?
Speaker 2: You know, when she was, you know, I was surprised that she was not gone and my other sister, Malikah [Malikah Shabazz] and I were in like the library, which was like they gave us as a waiting room, and a nurse came in and said your mother wants to see you so I'm thinking, oh my gosh.  You know so I jump up and I go to the room and she's trying to write, and she's all bandaged up now but it was really difficult, and I talk about this in my book.  It was very difficult, watch her, to watch her struggle, to write.  And I, you know, I would like to know what it was she was trying to tell me.  Of course, now, but I, you know, I said to her--that she didn't have to--that she, she didn't have to write and whatever was in her heart, was in my heart and, and that, ugh.  You know, that I loved her and, you know, but I didn't want it to seem so final, you know, and I didn't really want to alarm her to what, you know, she looked like.  And then she just lifted her arms up and she hugged me.  So, to me, that says that, you know, that I'm okay, meaning that she's okay.
Story_ID: 315351
Speaker 1: Then you feel you must tell her [Betty Shabazz] story and your father's [Malcolm X] story from your point of view as what, their gifts to you?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Growing Up X' ['Growing Up X: A Memoir by the Daughter of Malcolm X,' Ilyasah Shabazz and Kim McLarin] (laughter).  And you set out to do that.  Who helps?  Who do you enlist?
Speaker 2: Well actually--
Speaker 1: And first, where did the, the seed, the seed was planted?
Speaker 2: Well you know she had told me some--one day I did a- I did a tribute to her with the National Congress of Black Women, Negro women, in Washington [D.C.], and, and I think she was surprised that I first had the courage, 'cause I didn't want to speak, I had the courage to, to do, to write something and say it in front of so many people and, and I think what I said was just, you know, really looking at her life and seeing all the thing--all the challenges that she had but yet, you know, perseverance and triumph and, you know, with the children and camp and dance lessons and music lessons and, you know, just everything that she did for us.  And so after that particular tribute, she came to respect me more as an adult (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As an adult?
Speaker 2: As an adult and I forgot, why did I go--
Speaker 1: And, and that planted the seed for you as a writer.  She said--
Speaker 2: She said, "You know, Precious," she said, "I think that you should publish your speeches," you know, and that I should--you know my writings as I always wrote what I, you know, and so after my mother passed away and, well actually, right before my mother passed away, Mother's Day, my girlfriend and her mother, and me and mine, along with two of her friends, went to a restaurant, and every year, either my girlfriend, who also went to boarding school with me, Kathy [ph.], it was her mother's choice of wherever she wanted to go, and this year was my mother's choice.  And my mother decided at the time it was Audubon Cafe [New York New York] on the corner.  So we went to this Audubon Cafe for dinner and, like an early lunch dinner, and after that was over, we came here [Audubon Ballroom; Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, New York, New York].  And, like that little small extra space wasn't there, you know, but she was saying how she didn't like that it cut off the window and she wanted that whole window, and there were certain things that she talked about and, you know like the mural, she wanted to make sure that my father's--the positioning of the crescent and star were correct, you know.  She wanted to make sure that there was a bassinet for her daughter on the mural because Gamilah [Gamilah Shabazz] would feel left out.  She was such a perfectionist, you know, and she wanted to make sure that history was recorded properly.  And so, there were just certain things that she talked about the challenges and, you know, that she was looking forward to retiring here, to continue the work for her husband, you know, not so much to glorify Malcolm, but to help the people understand his ideals for themselves, you know.  And so I was happy that that happened and when I came here and felt this great feeling, I felt like this was something that I was to do and so I did.  And then someone had come to me and asked me about writing a book.  They had--we had a--my mother's publicist, someone contacted her and she directed them to me to write this book about my parents.  And then I think in talking to the editor, Anita Hill, I'm sorry, Anita Hill (laughter).
Speaker 1: Anita Hill (laughter).
Speaker 2: Anita Diggs, at Random House [Penguin Random House, New York, New York] at the time, she was kind of fascinated because you really do have these expectations of Malcolm X, el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, and therefore you have these expectations of the children.
Story_ID: 315356
Speaker 1: What I want you to go back and just throw in now is how your mother [Betty Shabazz] came about starting this, the Audubon [Audubon Ballroom; Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, New York, New York], how she got, how that started for her and then her bringing you here saying this is what I want, led to the completion of it after she had passed away.  So how did it happen for her to start this?
Speaker 2: Well I know that this entire structure was going to be demolished and because recently they were talking about, you know, it was amazing that they would get rid of such, you know, beautiful--
Speaker 1: Architecture?
Speaker 2: Right, architecture.  But anyway, it was in the '80s [1980s], I believe, and that Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] bought the property and they were going to make it into a biomedical research, which they still did, but in another portion of the, of the building.  And there were community activists, grassroots, who basically fought along with my mother saying that this space should be preserved to honor the legacy, the memorial of Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: So she fought to have that happen.  So then she brings you here to this space?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which was your first time being in this space again, as an adult?
Speaker 2: Right, she brought me, she did an interview outside.  I forgot who it was with years before.  It must have been in the '80s [1980s] when, you know, all of this happened.  And so I saw the outside of it but I hadn't gone inside.  And I don't even know if I really understood the significance.  I don't even know, you know, I don't know.  I just--I'm not really sure but I know that years later, after going to college [State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, New York] and graduating from college and, and having spent that Mother's Day with her and coming here, was like, wow.  And I had already been to Atlanta [Georgia] and interviewed Dexter King to find out, you know, how I could have some sort of center that, you know, that honored my father.
Speaker 1: And just tell us who Dexter King is.
Speaker 2: Dexter King is Martin, Dr. Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] second son, right, and of course, our families have always been close.
Speaker 1: So you, that Mother's Day, she brings you and you look at the space.  Moving forward a little bit, you're approached to write this--a book about your parents.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: From--and you set out to do this with Kim?  Who's the other person?
Speaker 2: McLarin.
Speaker 1: Kim McLarin.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you meet Kim?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You get a book deal?
Speaker 2: Well, actually no.  I had the book deal and then I was reading various authors' books 'cause I needed a co-writer and when I read Kim McLarin's book ['Taming It Down,' Kim McLarin], I don't remember what the title is, but the first page I just said, definitely, absolutely, positively, yes.  And I read her book where other books, you know, I opened it, I read some and I didn't really have much interest.  So we did this book, 'Growing Up X[: A Memoir by the Daughter of Malcolm X,' Ilyasah Shabazz and Kim McLarin].
Speaker 1: And in, in doing that book, what, what did it do for you?  You said, you've been quoted as saying it was cathartic, it was, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: That I would encourage anyone to write a book, whether they publish it or not, you know.  I think it's very helpful, helpful as well as a great treasure that you can give to your daughter, your granddaughter, someone.  I think, you know, just the historic significance, you know, and being able to look at, you know, for instance, if Harriet Tubman, and I know I'm going off on a tangent--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --but if say Harriet Tubman had a--her diaries, her memoirs, and she gave it to her daughter who passed on to her granddaughter, the next, you know, it's wonderful to be able to read and see what really happened to this person during this time.  I think it was very helpful in that it allowed me, you know, to revisit the time that my father [Malcolm X] was slaughtered and to know that, yes I do remember something, and to really look at his life as an individual, not as daddy.  To look at my mother's life as an individual and not mommy, and to grow and learn from those experiences.  To really not live life bitter and--but that these are just--this is our journey and, and the importance of history, the significance of it.  And, you know, it was just very, very helpful.  It helped me better express myself because I really was, I wouldn't say I was introverted and I wouldn't say I was inhibited, but there were always so many great expectations that I would--my words would just get confused because I know you were expecting something big and, you know, from me.  And so it just really relaxed me and, and helped me open up more with people.

Speaker 1: So after having done the book ['Growing Up X: A Memoir by the Daughter of Malcolm X,' Ilyasah Shabazz and Kim McLarin], and having the opportunity to talk about your parents [Betty Shabazz and Malcolm X], and sort of a tribute to them, what's next for you?  How, how do you see your life moving forward?
Speaker 2: Well, actually working on a wake-up tour right now which, again, is to empower young people and, you know, with accountability, with character, the importance of history and culture and self-expression, again, not living life as a victim but understanding that, however challenging your experience is, that you see successful business leaders and bringing them together and understanding that we all have--am I going off on a tangent?
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm following.
Speaker 2: It doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: No, I'm thinking about the next--where are you going on this tour?
Speaker 2: We're putting it together now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but we're, we're, the first leg of the tour is New York [New York], Atlanta [Georgia], Chicago [Illinois] and Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: And I was also just thinking about The HistoryMakers.  That sounds like something we would do.
Speaker 2: Excellent, great.
Speaker 1: And I'm just thinking about if there's any way we can be involved, you should call the office.  I'll give you my card.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you're gonna do that tour?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And let's talk about, sort of, I want your perspective on the state of African Americans today.  And by that I mean, did you have, what was your reaction to the images we saw with Hurricane Katrina?  And the--
Speaker 2: I thought it was a wake-up call.  It seems that, you know, as I'd like to explain to a lot of my adopted children, you know, mentees that, whatever we're experiencing, no matter how big or small, that it seems like those are angels.  You know, that these are messages from God and it seems that, you know, Katrina should be a wake-up or--a wake-up call because a lot of us didn't even know that people were living like that in that location so close to the water and endangered, you know, dangered by this levee, but not only that in the absolute neglect and, you know, the greatest country of the world, supposedly, the most wealthy and, and, but that people are living that way all around the world and why--
Story_ID: 315358
Speaker 1: I want you--I'm gonna, because you're a music buff and you've spent a considerable amount of time as an agent, well not considerable but you were an agent at William Morris [William Morris Agency; William Morris Endeavor], what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Assistant music agent.
Speaker 1: Assistant music agent, what do you think about hip hop and the artists today and the message behind it?  What is the--what do you think the message is?
Speaker 2: Well I'm very happy that Kanye West is, has come on the scene and I think that he will probably be one of the artists that is mainstream crossover that will challenge the artists to read more.  You know, to have some, some meat in their lyrics as opposed to, this is my necklace, this is my bling bling, hey aren't I hot?  You know, look at my car but, you know, there's some messages that I like in his music.
Speaker 1: What do you think, where are we as far as the state of, of film, media?  I mean, there still--
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: --you can count the black directors on one hand.
Speaker 2: Right, I think we need to own something.  And it seems like every time we own something, we sell it.  And, you know, how are we gonna control the image of ourselves if we don't, we don't own it, you know?
Story_ID: 315359
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's so important because I think it really, it shows us who we can be, where we came from.  You know my father [Malcolm X] said, "A tree cannot grow without its roots," and so, if we don't have history, what do we have?  And we see these children that are orphaned in so many different countries in Africa, well there's a reason why the children are here and their parents are gone.  I think that we understand the significance of history.  You know, when you look at the pyramids, when you look at, you know, these ancient monuments, clearly they understood the importance of history.  And, imagine if we didn't have that just to say this is who we are, we really do have history.  We really do have culture, you know.  And so clearly, other people have learned from our history that sometimes they pretend is theirs, and they understand the significance and the importance of it.  My father had said something like, you know, Europeans, French, people go to France to be empowered.  They go, they see their history, they come back to America, I'm talking about Americans--
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: --or wherever they are from.  Chinese people, from America, can go to China and they can be empowered about the richness and oh, my history, these are my ancestors, you know culture.  And Italians, everybody, they can go someplace but we don't think, you know, where do we go?  You know, if you say where are you from?  Oh, I'm from Mississippi.  Where are you from?  Oh, I'm from 24th and Radnor.  Where are you from?  Oh, I'm from Italy, my parents are from Greece, you know, my--you know, whatever.  And so it's the connection, the connection.
Story_ID: 315360
Speaker 1: What are your hopes for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I look over all of my old stories that I've written in my screenplays and everything else and I always see me trying to show a beautiful image of Africa that's not jungle, that's not huts, and that's not this dependency on someone else to make it wonderful and great, dependent on Rome [Italy] or Greece or whatever, that we will really understand our history and all that we--you know what Africa, that there's--Africa's historic contributions to the world, you know, in a full sense so that we can just really, you know, get our act together.
Story_ID: 315361
Speaker 1: So as you look back over your life, and you're young but, I have to ask anyway, what do you want to be remembered for?  Well, it's still yet to come.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When you look back, as you've lived so far, what stands out most for who you've become?
Speaker 2: Probably just a humanitarian.
Speaker 1: And by that you mean?
Speaker 2: I love everyone, you know, and I see, you know, I can see something wonderful and great in each person and sometimes, you know, we think, oh, you're so nice and you're so wonderful but we might not understand that the picture might not really fit what's on the inside but, you know, just that.
Speaker 1: What do you think your father [Malcolm X] would think about who you've become as a young adult?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my father's most closest aid, Brother Benjamin Karim, just recently passed away, and thank God I was able to spend some time with him.  You know, we spoke at one--in Michigan together.  You know, he came here and we, thank goodness we gave him an award for all that he did to serve our father.  And he just said that your father would be very proud of you and that, you know, that you're really filling his shoes and that made me feel really good.  Just a bunch of, you know, lots of things that he said, but those, that's something that really stands out.
Story_ID: 315362
Speaker 1: Well one thing that stands out for me that we didn't talk about and we'll end with this, is how you fought to save his papers.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, again, I was the director of public relations and, at, for the City of Mount Vernon [New York], and someone had called me and said that they saw my father's papers, that were going to be on eBay and they were going to go to Butterfields auction house [Bonhams & Butterfields; Bonhams] and I called our estate attorney and we were able, with the support of the New York Public Library [New York, New York], and the Schomburg Center [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], and [HistoryMaker] Howard Dodson, we were able to get our papers back and, our father's papers back, which is really an absolute treasure trove of history, and we deposited it at the Schomburg.  So with the help of our attorney, Joseph Fleming, we were able to get it all back.
Speaker 1: When you held that, his Koran [Qur'an] in your hand, what did it feel like?  And you saw his notes?
Speaker 2: Well you know, it, it's really so much and you've got to see that he was really very young.  That he was so corny, you know, the way he loved my mother [Betty Shabazz].  You got to see his humor.  You got to see his, like his soul, the depth of him and really such a beautiful person.  And it was just really, really great.
Story_ID: 315363
Speaker 1: As you're walking through your life today, what sights, sounds and smells can take you back to that little girl?
Speaker 2: Ah, you know, it's this really beautiful smell.  It's, it's a sweet smell and I don't know if it's like this oil or something that my mother [Betty Shabazz] wore, but it's just really, really fresh and free and it sort of reminded me of the--when we were little, there were these, I don't know if they were honeysuckles, or if they're these little purple flowers and you just bite the tip of it and, yeah, right (laughter).
Story_ID: 315364
Speaker 1: Anything else you wanna say before we close today?
Speaker 2: No, except that my father [Malcolm X] was only twenty-eight years old when he first took on the responsibility for us, the human rights activism, the civil rights struggle and that he was thirty-nine years old when he was assassinated and that's such a short amount of time for all that he contributed, for all that he sacrificed and that it takes a man of great compassion to be able to take on such an enormous responsibility against so many odds, you know, against a government that had been historically unjust and to be so young.
Speaker 1: Well, he has big shoes to fill.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: You're doing a great job.
Speaker 2: Right, and I wear a size eleven shoes (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now look, what can the rest of us--
Speaker 2: But he wore size fourteen and he was six foot four.
Speaker 1: What can the rest of us do to help you fill those shoes?
Speaker 2: Come to the, to this center [Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, New York, New York], make donations and, and that's a start.
Speaker 1: Anything else?
Speaker 2: Yes, read, learn about history, HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] very, very important.  You know, as I was telling you, I learned about you guys years ago because I was reading some--first of all, I have, you know, a love for history but I was reading something about The HistoryMakers and, and their, and I don't know, I can't think right now, but like I told you, something really great about The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 1: Well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You are God.  We have to shake hands and you can run.
