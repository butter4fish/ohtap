Speaker 1: I'm Denise Gines, the interviewer for the HistoryMakers.  And Scott Stearns is the videographer.  Would you state your name and spell it for me, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Frank, F-R-A-N-K, Sidney, S-I-D-N-E-Y, Jones, J-O-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: Will you tell me your date of birth and your place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born November 9, 1928 in Greensboro, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation or former occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired professor at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in Cambridge, Mass.
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is April 19, 2011.
Speaker 1: And the place of this interview?
Speaker 2: At my home in Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Mr. Jones, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: And what a favorite food?  What do you like to eat?
Speaker 2: I love soul food.  I had greens for lunch, beets.  The other day I had some chicken liver which I love (laughter).  My father used to say that the best time to have roast beef was on the second day when you were turning it into roast beef hash.  I also love trotters and have learned, for instance, that the front trotter is far more meaty than the second.  Now, I don't have trotters now, that is, pig feet.  But I do love pig feet, and I used to, when I lived in Boston [Massachusetts], there was a place called "Bob, the Chefs", and some of my friends and I would say, come on, let's go get some grease today (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year when I lived in Boston, for which I spent most of my life, was the fall.  Here the Spring is wonderful.  There's a spring.  You couldn't count on the springs in New England.  You could count on the falls.  I detested the snow in the winter.
Speaker 1: And what about vacation?  Where do you like to vacation?  Do you have a favorite destination?
Speaker 2: Well, it's funny.  I was just talking to the young man downstairs.  When we were young, my father's brother, Robert, who was a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal church had a place called Gulf side in Waveland, Mississippi.  And we used to go to Gulf side.  And this was apropos of that conversation because we would leave Greensboro very early on in the morning, maybe four o'clock and drive all the way to Tuskegee [Alabama] because in that way we knew we were not going to be embarrassed, and we knew we could stay there.  And then we would go from Tuskegee to Waveland [Mississippi].  And, of course, when we got to Waveland, which is about a hundred miles East of New Orleans [Louisiana], we could go in the water.  But this was an enclave for blacks, right on the Gulf Coast, and that was a favorite.  My favorite places now are, I love to go to Paris [France].  I love Florence [Italy].  I've gone to both and taken an apartment for a period of a month and given me chance to explore in both of those.  I love going back to New England when I can.  And in New England now, although not when I was married to New England, now my favorite place would be Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  I also love to places down here.  I've been to Hilton Head [South Carolina] on several occasions and enjoyed it very much.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: Oh my God, OMG (laughter).
Story_ID: 1894
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about your father.  Tell me his name and when and where he was born, if you know?
Speaker 2: My father's name was David, D-A-V-I-D, Dallas, D-A-L-L-A-S, Jones, J-O-N-E-S.  He was born in Greensboro, North Carolina on November the 19th, 1889.
Speaker 1: And did he talk to you about his growing up?  Did he share any stories?
Speaker 2: Some.  Some I picked up indirectly.  I was getting ready to go to live with my grandparents in St. Louis, Missouri, and this was in 1941.  And my mother took me to see my father's older sister.  He always called her Sister.  And she asked me how old I was, and I told her.  And she said, it was at about this time that I packed up your father and sent him to live in New Orleans with his brother who was seventeen years older, and who was an established minister.  And that brother, Uncle Rob, by name, became a bishop in that branch of Methodism and sent my father to Wesleyan [Wesleyan University],in [Middletown] Connecticut from which he graduated in 1911.  And that had so much to do with the way he thought about the world and what he wanted for us as his children.  But he talked very little.  One day, my mother found a letter that he had written to his mother.  And he said, you have encouraged me to be kind to Sister, and Sister would have been Uncle Rob's first wife or Valena (ph.) Jones.  But she is as mean as a skinned cat (laughter).  And I know, I guess from other things, that his, his stay in New Orleans was not as pleasant as he would have liked.  But this--see his father was dead, and this older brother became like a surrogate father to him.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he talk much about his going to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, he talked a great deal about Wesleyan.  He loved Wesleyan, and it clearly made his life.  He, he pressed pants to within a half hour of his graduation.  I take it that he was, perhaps the only black there.  I don't know that for a fact.  But there was at Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts], which after all is a rival school, there was John R. Pinkett who had become an All-American football player.  And I don't know when he met Uncle John, but it was Uncle John and Aunt Flaxie (ph.).  They lived in Washington [D.C.].  And so one of the friends, by the way, that he had as it comes to me in New Orleans [Louisiana] was Peter Marshall Murray, a very distinguished doctor who lived in New York.  And Dr. Murray was very distinguished, I know, and his wife used to sing in the church choir at Riverside Church.  And she came to Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina] where my father was by now the president, to run the choir, run the music.  But my father died of cancer, and this would have been in 1956, January, 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay, so after your father went to Wesleyan, tell me about the different positions that he held, or jobs that he had before he became president of Bennett.
Speaker 2: I know about several.  He became the head of the YMCA in St. Louis, Missouri.  Well, first he went to a program at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]--I don't know when that was, but that's where he met my mother.  And she was a teacher, but he, there was this job of running the "Y" [YMCA] at St. Louis, Missouri.  And he did very well at that.  He was able to raise enough money to build a new "Y".  Now, in that regard, he was enabled by my mother's [Suzie Pearl Williams] father, Frank L. Williams, who lived in St. Louis and had become known and when he died, he was called the Grand Ole Man of St. Louis.  He went from that job to a job here in Atlanta [Georgia] where he worked with a man by the name Perry.  And Mr. Perry evidently had an insurance company.  And that's another place where he ran into my Uncle John Pinkett, and it was from here that my parents moved to Greensboro, North Carolina.  He's going home as it were, it was his home town, to become president of Bennett, and he died in that role in 1956, as I say.
Story_ID: 1895
Speaker 1: Tell me about--we're gonna come back and talk about your mother and father and how they meet and marry.  But tell me more about your grandfather, if you know, on your father's side.
Speaker 2: My [paternal] grandfather on my father's side, whom I do not know, did not know, I never knew either my father's father nor my father's mother.  All I do know about my father's mother is that she was the first black teacher in the Gilford County [North Carolina] School system, Mary Jane Holly Jones.  And I once asked my sister, who was a psychiatrist and who had even done a little research, how did she account for the fact that both my father and my Uncle Rob were really quite distinguished in their lives, even powers in the Methodist church.  And she said that was because of Grandma Jones.  Now, as I say, I did not know her.  But it's clear that she was a teacher, that education meant a great deal to her.  And at least one of her daughters, maybe two, graduated from college.  So, you know, there were these two boys, they were the book end, my Uncle Rob and my father.  There were four girls in the middle between them.  And at least two of them had graduated from college.
Speaker 1: And what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My [paternal] grandfather's name was Sidney--shall I spell that?
Speaker 1: No, is it spelled the same as your middle name?
Speaker 2: Same as mine.  I'm named after him, Sidney Dallas Jones.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, let's go to your mother's side of the family.  Tell me your mother's name and where and when she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name, Susie, S-U-S-I-E, Pearl, P-E-A-R-L, Williams.  And she was born in Danville, Kentucky in, on April 30, 1892.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did she share stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: A great deal more, in part because her aunt, Aunt Lillie lived in Danville, even at--and I have been there as a child to that home, and so, and my mother's grandmother, whom I never knew, was evidently was a wonderful, wonderful woman.
Speaker 1: Do you know her name?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't, but she was obviously, to be described, you know, very vigorous, born a slave, could repeat poetry, which she had learned at her master's knee and, you know, had moved right on.  After all, her daughter, my grandmother, went to and graduated from Berea College in [Berea] Kentucky in 1888.  So, I don't know her, but all that you hear about her is wonderful.  And then, you know, a lot of times, we are protected, but my Aunt Lillie had a child out of wedlock and Stanley, I have met, and I never would have found out, but I asked about all of this.  And my granny, it was my grandmother who told me.  She wouldn't lie to me about things, but, you know, somehow some guy had come and, you know, Stanley came, and Stanley was not rejected in any way by the family.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name? (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: Okay, tell me your grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Fannie, F-A-N-N-I-E, Bell, B-E-L-L, Miller, M-I-L-L-E-R.
Speaker 2: And did she have siblings?
Speaker 1: She had siblings.  There was Aunt Lillie, whom I have met.  And then there was Uncle John, whom I have never met, but Uncle John became a, one of the great caterers they say in Cincinnati [Ohio].  And I still have some of the silver which has passed down from that catering company.  But he evidently made great chicken salad (laughter), which I love.  At any rate, he was a wonderful caterer.
Story_ID: 1896
Speaker 1: Okay, and you--did you have any more information about your [maternal] grandmother [Fannie Bell Miller]?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  My grandmother used to say to people about me that I didn't like her.  She had come to visit in Greensboro [North Carolina] once, and I looked up at her and said, who's gonna "took" meaning "cook" for grandfarver [grandfather].  But she was a dear, dear soul.  And it will come down the road, but I'm going to tell you about a very dear, dear story of her and how she, in some ways, facilitated relationships between me and my [maternal] grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you wanna tell that story now or do you wanna wait?
Speaker 2: I can if--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather was very, very stern.
Speaker 1: And this is the--tell me your grandfather's name?  This is your grandfather on your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Yes.  His name is Frank, and I'm named for him also.  So Lunsford, L-U-N-S-F-O-R-D, Williams.  Now, he had graduated from Berea [Berea College, Berea, Kentucky] too.  He graduated a year after my grandmother.  And so he graduated in 1889.  And my grandfather had finished high school and was teaching and one day picked up a book and saw Amo, Amas, Amad, and he did not know what that meant.  And it was Latin for "I love", etc.  And he decided that he had to go to college.  So I guess he was along about in his twenties.  He just stopped and went to Berea.  Now, you know, Berea was an extraordinary institution.  It was integrated.  It was for the poor.  There was no tuition.  Many of the blacks lived on campus.  They had some twenty-five percent of the college in these days was black.  So Berea eventually, under a guy who had--the first president was Alyein (ph.).  We're gonna be integrated.  We don't care about race.  We don't care about class.  We prefer that you are poor.  Berea tried to change, and, of course, my grandfather--not, of course, but he did fight that.  There was a president by the name of Frost who had come from Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] and who was going to turn his back on all of this.  And there were two people, one by the name of Robinson and one by the name of Frank L. Williams who fought this.  And because he did fight it, that's now--there's a book by the name of, the guy at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] who was a Civil War Historian, McPherson, and he talks about this, you know, this turning on its head, and if you were Berea.  Berea, when it went segregated, didn't--it wasn't until the late '50s [1950s] that Berea again admitted blacks.  But they had had this very distinguished record.  The gentleman at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Carter G. Woodson, is a graduate of Berea who then went on to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So there were distinguished people who had graduated from Berea when it was, you know, stood for something in American history.  And this is now, you know, big, and I'm very proud of my grandfather.  Well, he was a very, very stern guy.  And I'm gonna jump ahead.  He got into an argument one day with his son, Frank L. Williams, Jr., and Lunnie (ph.), they called him, left the home.  And they found him in the Mississippi, and it was assumed he either committed suicide or he got knocked off.  I mean, I think my grandmother who told me this story, thought he had committed suicide.  And so she told me this story, and so my grandfather would set very stern practices like one day--cause I went to school at Sumner [Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri].  I'm living with them.  Where are your books?  None of my professors assigned me homework.  Well, I want you to have homework every day and you go and ask them for homework, and you bring home every book.  Well, this was very hard.  I mean in the first place, I'm the youngest person at Sumner, in part, because I left Greensboro [North Carolina] to go to St. Louis to go into the eighth grade.  There were no eighth grades in North Carolina in those days.  So I was going to go in the eighth grade in St. Louis, but my grandfather went down--he knew everybody in the public education, in the education bureau, and said, if this boy had been in North Carolina, he would go to, he would go to high school.  So he should go to high school here.  So I went to Sumner and I had two knickers, two pairs of knickers and one pair of long pants.  I wore that pair of knickers to school--this is an urban high school, very tough I came to find out.  And I got laughed at.  And then the second or third day I'm there, a guy comes up to me and he says, "punk, are you gonna buy my lunch?"  And I said, I have only enough for myself.  Well, I saw that guy in a fight, even pulling knife on somebody.  And they started calling me a punk, and a faggot, you don't get any.  I mean I was, I mean here I am a, here I am just a young kid going to this urban high school, which is very different from Greensboro.  And that was hard to do, I mean that--
Story_ID: 1897
Speaker 1: Before we go forward anymore, I just wanna go back a little bit and talk about how you get to Sumner [Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: So let me--
Speaker 2: Let me answer that question.
Speaker 1: Okay, let me go back a little bit because we were talking about your grandmother [Fannie Bell Miller] and your grandfather [Lunsford Williams] and your mother--
Speaker 2: I was trying to tell you that story of how--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.  And you need to continue that part of it?
Speaker 2: Let me, let me--
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, my grandmother knew that this was very painful for me.  So what she did in my year in Sumner is to say, I am going to teach you Latin, which she started to do.  After all, she had studied Latin and Greek and majored in those at Berea.  Now, I can remember it to this day.  She said, Sonny, you have to translate, you have to learn English grammar in order to take Latin.  So she taught why, what the native case was, which is "to", and I guess the ablative which is "from".  So she had to teach me English grammar in order for me to learn Latin.  And because she was doing this, I would go home.  I mean I, you know, I didn't mind going home because there was a--anyway, she, in retrospect, was facilitating a relationship between me and my grandfather cause above all, she didn't want to have another suicide, I mean running away from this.  So it's only recently that I have been able to understand what she did.  Now, let me tell you one other thing.  When I went to Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts], my Latin teacher said to me in front of the entire class one day, "Jones, you are the finest Latin student I have had and I've had some 3,000."  And that, obviously, comes to me because of her sensitivity [emotional] to a very difficult situation.  And, you have to say, you know, whatever my reluctance, you know, as a child, but this woman saw what was going on and she thought, how can I help.  Now, she was a difficult woman because she was able to pass and did pass in St. Louis [Missouri].  And let me just say to you that my mother was the darkest of the children.  My mother was about my color, so she wasn't, she wasn't--she's high yellow, we would say.  But she couldn't go where my grandmother went.  And my mother knew that.  And she let me know how much she had been hurt by that at an earlier, later stage in my life and her life.  But let me then just sort of jump ahead and answer the question of why I went to St. Louis other than this eighth grade.  My brother, David, went to Andover, my older brother, David D. Jones, Jr., went to Andover.  And he went out of Dudley High School in Greensboro, North Carolina.  And it's racist, but they put him back to a sophomore.  So he graduated from high school in Greensboro.  He went to Andover for three years.  One of his classmates in Greensboro went to Bate [Bates College, Lewiston, Massachusetts] and went and went directly on to Bates.  My sister, who had graduated with him, she was a year younger.  But somehow they were in the same grade.  She got a trip to France for a year.  At any rate, he hated Andover.  And my parents [David and Suzie Jones] were trying to not have me go through--I was slated to go to Andover.  And so what happens is I went to Sumner for two years.  I went back one year when I went to Andover, but after all I had jumped a year at Sumner, so I graduated from Andover at 17 which was when I should have been graduating from Andover.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We went a little further, but let's go back just a little bit.  And just give me a little information--
Story_ID: 1898
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little and talk about your mother [Suzie Williams Jones] and father [David Jones], where they met and married and where they were living when they started having children.
Speaker 2: My graduated from Wesleyan [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut] in 1911.  My mother graduated from college at the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] in 1913.  My brother, David, was born in 1917 or 18 [1918], I'm not sure which.  They met at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Il] where they were both in a summer program.  And I can remember my mother who was then living in Cincinnati or Covington, Kentucky and receiving letters from my father and someone who worked for them would bring the letters to my mother at her school where she was teaching.  I guess she felt that my mother's father would have objected to this.  So they got married and in the process of getting married, they soon moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where my father was working at the "Y" [YMCA].  And by this time, my [Lunsford Williams] grandfather, independently, had moved to St. Louis to become principal of the Sumner High School.  So my first two siblings, David, Jr. and Francis Estelle, Tuppie, we called her, were born in St. Louis.  They then came from St. Louis to Atlanta [Georgia].  In Atlanta were born Jane Miller Jones and Jane died as a inarticulate, a child who can't describe what was happening to her.  And she died evidently--I don't even know.  It was one of those things that you just never got a clear excuse--exact.  People had split up, however, about that, and my mother never got over that because some people, including her sister and certainly, her sister-in-law, Uncle Rob's second wife, felt that she had been at fault, negligent even.  So Jane died here in Atlanta.  My brother Paul was born here in Atlanta on May 18, 1926.  And it was shortly thereafter that they left Atlanta to go to Greensboro for my father to become president of Bennett.  And that is where I was born.
Speaker 1: And that was in 19--
Speaker 2: November 9, 1928.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, as a young boy in Greensboro [North Carolina], during the time of the Depression, talk to me about what you were doing as a young child in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, my first grade teacher, Mrs. Simpkins, was the mother of one of my dearest friends, George.  And I remember her.  We used to call George, who became a distinguished civil rights leader in Greensboro, Junior, cause he was George, Jr.  And he would come to the room to pick up his sandwich from his mother for lunch.  A couple of the teachers were graduates of Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And one of them, I think was in the fourth grade, the family took a trip to the West Coast.  There was a driver, George, my mother and father, that's three, that's three, Maeddie (ph.) Ruth Gamble, who was a Bennett graduated and very good at acting and my brother, Paul and I.  We went to the West Coast on a fund-raising trip.  Interestingly enough, on that trip in Los Angeles [California], we stayed at the home, the same home where Bill Robinson, "Bojangles" stayed.  And Mr. Robinson arranged for us, with some help from my father because my father knew a college classmate who was in, up in the ranks.  So we went to Twentieth Century Fox.  We saw and met Shirley Temple.  Before the day was over, Eddie Cantor had come over.  Now, this was a huge (laughter), you can imagine, a huge dividend.  We went the north, northern way, and then came back the southern way.  And, you know, I think, it was six or seven weeks.  Well, you know, you get pulled out of school, but it's worth it for just all that we had seen.  I remember going in San Francisco [California] to a Chinese restaurant and not liking anything but the egg foo young, which obviously reminded me of scrambled eggs.  And it was, it was really a rather extraordinary thing.  But the teacher that I had at that time was a Bennett grad who understood, you know.  After all, this is in some ways giving them more than coming to school.
Speaker 1: You said this was a fund-raising trip.  This was fund-raising for--
Speaker 2: On behalf of Bennett.
Speaker 1: Of Bennett, okay.  And under your father's [David Jones] leadership, this is when Bennett becomes a four-year college?
Speaker 2: My father went to Bennett to become president in 1926.  And it was then that Bennett was dedicated to being a four-year college for women.  It had been, up to that time, a normal school.  So we're now going to have only women, and it's a four year college.
Speaker 1: So during this time, this is like 1930, that this is going on, is that right, that you take this trip, do you think?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would have been in the third or fourth grade.  And I would have started school--I was born in '28 [1928], let's say I started in '33 [1933], so this trip probably was in 1935, 1936, somewhere in there.
Story_ID: 1899
Speaker 1: So would you say that your family didn't really, or did you know, I should ask, that the Depression [the Great Depression] was going on?
Speaker 2: Now, let me tell you why.  First place, in 1934 the first new--when my father [David Jones] went to Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina], there were ten students in three buildings.  When he died, there were 600 students.  There was an infrastructure which Johnnetta Cole once said to me, because she became president of Bennett, was better than Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and $3 million in endowment.  And so you talk about love, everybody loved that college.  Everybody in that family.  But a building went up in 1934, and just one building after another.  And he was an extraordinary president, and--that's number one.  And number two, the arrangement that my father had with the trustees was that he got very little cash salary, but he had the use of two cars, food went to the college budget.  There was little, there was very little difference between us and the college.  We were the college.  And, you know, even--I remember during the War [World War II] when gas was rationed.  Who knows about rationing, you know.  We were privileged and another way of talking about this is, when I went to Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts], I had to have been on a deep, deep, deep scholarship.  I was the youngest of four children.  The Andover all and tuition was more than my father was making in cash.  And I remember talking to a friend from Greensboro who lives here and who's children went to Andover.  I said, you know, I was poor.  She said, Uncle Frank, you never poor, you weren't poor.  She's talking about Greensboro poor.  In Greensboro, we lived like kings.  But then when you are going to Andover, I mean I couldn't have gone to Andover if I wasn't on a deep scholarship.  And I worked my way through Andover as it were.  So, yes, we, it was--because this college was just, I mean going up, up, up, you know, I hate to say it, but we were spoiled, I was spoiled certainly.  I didn't know the difference.  And to get, now, you know, I have had to learn the difference.  But at that time, because of what he did for the college--and I remember even after he died, and he died in 1956.  My mother [Suzie Williams Jones] didn't die until I was fifty-three, fifty-four.  She lived in a college house.  And when the college wouldn't take care of the house, which they wouldn't.  They wouldn't have nothing to do with it, just weren't taking care of anything, my mother knew enough women to go direct to them and say I need money to take care of this house and would put the money into the house.  Now, I have to say something else here at this time.  You have to say that my father who was probably, in my view, the best of the presidents, and my Uncle Rob was the senior bishop in that branch of Methodism.  So these two guys were powerful.  The, it was called the Central Jurisdiction.  And the Central Jurisdiction met at Bennett in 1944.  And I remember working in the dormitories after the conference was over.  And I saw a little pamphlet which said "Jonesism must go".  And my parents were then on a vacation, and my Aunt Minnie, my father's older sister whom he called "Sister", was living at the house, and I took it home to her (laughter).  And I said, see what your brothers are doing (laughter).  So they were, they were very powerful.
Story_ID: 1900
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your other activities outside of school.  Were there extra curricula activities that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: We used the college to play baseball.  We used the college to play football (laughter).  There was, by this time, a gym.  We would slip into the gym, play basketball in the gym, and, of course, since this was the only basketball court on this side of town, on our side of town, we were very popular because people wanted to play basketball and, you know, in the winter, as it were.
Speaker 1: Now, in Greensboro [North Carolina], what schools did you attend?
Speaker 2: I attended the Washington Street Grammar School for seven years.
Speaker 1: Do you remember much about the school or the teachers?
Speaker 2: I remember some very, two of them, Mrs. Simpkins whom I had in the first grade and Mrs. Barnes whom I had in the fifth grade were friends of my--they were the wives of dentists, both of them.  And so they knew my parents [David and Suzie Jones] and, etc.  I had a teacher, Ms, Kirkland, and one day I misbehaved along with another of my peers.  So she made us stay behind.  And a teacher by the name of Ms. Pullings (ph.) came in and saw that she had retained us.  And she said, that little Jones boys, he's wearing his polo shirts with, you know, the stripes went this way.  He needs some stripes on his arms.  In other words, I needed a spanking.  And I never particularly liked her, and I didn't like Ms. Kirkland who was the one.  But, and, you know, they were--by then I had started to play the clarinet, taking a course from the guy directed the band, the orchestra at Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina], a guy by the name of Gatlin, who was a clarinetist himself.  And so I played in the band at Washington Street, and we had a guy by the name of Parsons.  And Mr. Parsons really directed the band at Dudley, the high school, but he came to Washington Street once a week and assembled those of us who played instruments into somewhat of an ensemble.  That guy, Parsons [Judge Richard D. Parsons], by the way, eventually became a federal district judge in Chicago [Illinois].  He had an extraordinary career.  So anyway, you know, I'm spoiled and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Well, what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Through Sumner High School [St. Louis, Missouri], where I got only one "B" in the whole time I was there, I was quote "they were giving me grades because of who I was, not because I did any work.  I had to go to Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts] to get some sense of what hard work is in terms of getting grades.
Speaker 1: So you attended Washington Street until 1941 when you were thirteen?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then you went to Sumner?
Speaker 2: For two years.
Speaker 1: For two years, and that's when you lived with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: And that's when I lived with my grandparents, and that's when my grandmother [Fannie Bell Miller] taught me Latin.  And that was the best course I had.
Speaker 1: So tell me about Sumner or did we talk about that already?  Is that where you had the hard time?
Speaker 2: We talked about it, except let me just jump ahead to this extent.  Arthur Ashe [tennis player] was playing tennis at Longwood when I was at MIT because Longwood had grass and the U. S. Open in New York had grass in those days.  And I went up to Arthur Ashe at a party because he was chasing this young daughter of some friends of ours.  And he had, he came over.  And I went up to him, and I said, you and I share something in common.  We both went to Sumner High in St. Louis, Missouri.  He said "I hate that place."  And it wasn't until that time that I could have said to you, "I hate that place also."
Story_ID: 1901
Speaker 1: All right.  So when did you, what year did you leave Sumner High School [St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I left Sumner in the fall of 1943.  I went to Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts].  Now, let me say just this about Andover, relative to Sumner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At Andover, everybody read books, every night.  There was an assignment in every course, every night.  Nobody was sexually active at least there.  So here I am.  There're never more than two blacks on campus, 700 boys.  I feel in many ways more at home here than I did at Sumner High in St. Louis, where I'm a punk, a faggot.  You don't get any and all of this stuff.  I mean it was a relief.  It was a relief.  And I'm getting ready to go back to my 65th reunion at Andover in June of this.  I have never been able to tell Andover explicitly how much I am indebted to that place.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about some of the experiences there at Andover?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Good experiences.
Speaker 2: Good, they were good.  I mean here's Porky Benton saying to me, "Jones, you're the finest Latin student I've ever had."  And he said that to me--we were on a trimester system in the second trimester.  And because I went from failing two courses at the beginning, at the end of the first trimester to number seven in the class at the end of the second trimester.  And by the way, my parents were so pleased with this that they sent me to New York to see--and it meant that you could come back a day or two later.  I went to see Paul Robeson, Uta Hagen, Jose Ferrer in "Othello".  Now, I didn't enjoy it because I hadn't read it, but nevertheless, when I now read Othello, which I do, I think about what an extraordinary experience this had to have been.  And Porky Benton said to me in that third trimester, "Jones, in effect, you've pulled some of your foot off the pedal".  Andover had secret societies.  They shouldn't have, but they did.  And you, there were seven on campus, and I didn't get in until I was a senior, but Porky Benton was a faculty advisor to that house that I got admitted to, and the only time he ever showed up was when I was being congratulated by my peers for having gone through the initiation rights.  But I have to love that man.
Speaker 1: There was another guy by the name of Pointer, Colonel Porter.  Colonel Porter taught Latin.  I never had him in Latin, but Colonel Porter, every day in class, you recited every day.  Each student recited each day, and a grade would be one, zero, that is, ten highest.  Every student recited.  Every student could go at the end of the day to his desk and see the grade.  Now, Colonel Porter, my class, my roommate, a black guy, got sent home.  He had not done well.  I think in retrospect he was bi-sexual and there were problems in his life, but he was very bright.  So I'm the only black on campus.  And one day, unbeknownst to me, Colonel Porter came up to me and he said, son, I know what you're going through.  And he meant it.  Now, Colonel Porter, interestingly enough, was from Danville, Kentucky.  I never went up to him and said anything about this.  But I have never forgotten him.  And then finally--
Speaker 2: Well, explain why he--
Speaker 1: See, he was a Southerner, and he was sort of out of it in a way.  Here he is a Latin scholar.  He's not in the South.  He's on the Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts] campus, and I just think it permitted him to have some empathy and to say, you know, it may be racial, but it doesn't have anything.  This kid is now lonely.  Somebody's got to reach out to him and say.  Now, the other one that I have to tell you about is that in my senior year, there was an oratorical contest.  In my junior year, I had come in number two, placed and got an award.  In my senior year, I decided I had to do something about race so I read something from Richard Wright's "Black Boy".  And I can, I did not place.  I can remember that I went that night to, the dormitory we had was split and my house master was out.  So I had to go next door in the same building, but, you know, you come out and go into a different entry.  And that house master was one of the judges.  And he said, it was too angry.  So I thanked him, and I went to the library where I needed to go, and that Sunday in Chapel, I was a student deacon.  And my English teacher came up to me and said, some of us were very upset by what went on.  Wouldn't you know, that on Wednesday, which was the day of assembly--we had assembly every day, but Wednesday was more oriented to the students, I am speaking to the entire Andover community on Richard Wright's, from Richard Wright's "Black Boy". And there was this thunderous applause at the end.  And a week later, sort of as an afterthought, the guy who had won was allowed to speak, and there was nothing like the applause for him as there had been for me.  And on that basis of that, I was chosen to be the Valedictorian of the class, which doesn't mean that I was number one in the class.  It meant that I am speaking for the class.  So at commencement I spoke on behalf of the class to the parents, etc.
Speaker 2: Let's stop right here.
Story_ID: 1902
Speaker 1: Okay, we wanna go back to, we're still at Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts] right before you graduate and you had talked about the secret society that you belong to.  Tell me the name of it and what you did as part of that and why you wanted to be a part of it?
Speaker 2: Shall I start?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The society was PBX, Phi Beta Chi and they were, this is what the big men on campus at Andover did.  And I thought I was a big man in that context.  And I was particularly aware that at Sumner High [School] in St. Louis [Missouri], I was not a big man on campus.  I mean I was a, you know.  So I did not get admitted into, when I was a junior, but a guy whom I will see at the graduation said to me--at the reunion, said to me one day, you've been discussed by every one of these places on campus.  And then in the senior year, I was admitted to one, and I was very pleased and enjoyed it.  You know, they had a pool table.  They had, I learned how to play bridge there.  We could go from dinner until eight, after dinner until eight we could go to the secret society, and then we had to go back to our dormitories.  So, you know, a lot of wonderful things went on there.  I got to know people better, and--
Speaker 1: You were the only black?
Speaker 2: Look, I'm--there're only two blacks on campus, and the other one had come there as a, he was what they would have called today a post-grad, that is, he had finished high school elsewhere.  He was coming to either be polished off or to be made ready, and as it turned out, he went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I went to Harvard also.
Speaker 1: You also talked about being a student deacon.  How prevalent was religion--I know that your uncle is a bishop, and tell me about religion.
Speaker 2: Well, that was a Sunday that I would serve as a student deacon, and, you know, you would usher people to their seats or particularly, visitors because after all, the students had to sit in assigned seats.  That was the way they took attendance.  And, if you didn't go (laughter), it was the same as missing a class.  It was required.  The Catholic students went downtown.  The Jewish students didn't have an alternative.  They had to go to the same church that the protestants went to.  So, but, you know, there were any number of things that I did, which was sort of getting out.  And, you know, this is sort of, again, this mystique.  You're gonna, you're a big man.  Therefore, you've got to do big things.  Now, I wanted to say something about Andover.  And it's about this, you know, this we're gonna treat you as a human being.  You're not a black human being or a white human being.  You're a human being here.  So the same English professor who was the one who had, that I knew was making it possible for me to speak to the entire student body--and after all, even if somebody had said, what would you have wanted to make up for getting over, I wouldn't have thought of that.  I mean that's just a gift, a dividend.  That guy, I was in his English class in my senior year.  And we got two grades.  We got--this is the grade you get for achievement.  But there's an effort grade at Andover.  And in my first trimester, I got, he gave me a "C" for effort.  And for other ways, "Jonsey, you aren't putting out, and I'm gonna tell you that.  You can do better and you ought to be doing better.  You clearly aren't gonna ever get an "A" from me."  Didn't need to say that.  "But you ought to get a B".  And part of it, he gave a written assignment one day, and I was late turning it in.  So, you know, and he would invite me to his house along with others.  This is nothing personal, but this is what you get.  And this never would have happened prior to this time.
Story_ID: 1903
Speaker 1: So you know that you're gonna go to college.  It's just a matter of which college?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how do you get prepared for going to college and what other schools, if any, did you apply to?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you this.  I got admitted to Wesleyan [Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut] before I had even take the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] because my father [David Jones] and my brother--my father was Class of '11 [1911], my brother was Class of '41 [1941].  If I had gone there, I would have been Class of '50 [1950].  So I got admitted to Wesleyan even before took the SAT in a formal application.  I decided that I wanted to go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I mean after all I'm beginning to feel good about myself, and by my lights, no Jones had ever climbed the Harvard mountain.  And so I wanted to go to Harvard and did.  But I didn't know until way late in life that my--I was talking to my older brother.  And he said, daddy came to me, and he said, Frank wants to go to Harvard.  And he said to daddy, daddy, let him.  Wesleyan is not what it was when I was there or when you were there.  And that helped my father.  But I got into Harvard on my own.  No affirmative action, none of that stuff, you know.
Speaker 1: Then they were building a student union after our father, is that right, in 1949?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There are three buildings now at Bennett that are named Jones.  One of them is the David T. Jones Student Union.  There is a dormitory named Robert E. Jones.  After all my Uncle Rob went to Bennett when it was a normal school.  And so there's the Robert E. Jones Hall, and now, there is the Suzie Jones Alumni Center, which was the house that I was born in, and in which my mother died.  And it's named for my mother.
Story_ID: 1904
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's go on to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and talk to me about your days there and the adjustment that you had to make.  Did you feel that you were prepared to go to Harvard?
Speaker 2: Yes, probably too prepared.  In my freshman orientation, the football coach spoke, and he said, whatever you do, do well.  And I said, all right, I'm gonna go out and become a football manager.  And I did.  There were two competitions for football managers, the freshman competition, there were about thirty of us freshmen who went out.  And the one who wins that competition gets to carry the water out on the field in the Harvard-Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] game.  And I won that competition, and I gave my two tickets, which were right on the fifty-yard line to my older brother, David, who was at the Harvard Law School.  And I saw him at a party that night, and he said, Junior, you were the star.  You were the only good thing (laughter) going for Harvard today, cause we didn't win.  Then there was a competition of the top six freshmen as sophomores and whoever wins this becomes the only senior, eventually, the only senior, and I won that.  And I can remember that we were down--this competition had been dominated by Milton [Milton Academy, Milton, Massachusetts] and the senior manager of the system was from Milton.  And there was a Milton guy in the thing.  And when we got letters, and we were down at Yale after the Harvard-Yale game, and they passed these letters out, and you don't know.  All six of us get these letters.  And I got mine saying I'm the manager, and the first thing that happened is the guy who was number two who was from Milton came to me and said, Deacon--cause I was called Deacon, Deacon Jones, Deacon, if I couldn't have won it, I'm glad you did.  Now, there was in that competition a guy who was a Southerner.  I would call him an FFVA, First Family of Virginia Arondale, was his name.  And he tried to buy this.  In my freshman year, his father was a general counsel at Pepsico, Pepsi Cola.  The All-American dinner was held, for All-Americans was held at the Waldorf.  So All-Americans got invited, but the entire Harvard football team got invited, (laughter), not an All-American on the team (laughter).  And he had a Jeep which he would lend out to various people.  He didn't even place in the top three cause there were--there was the senior manager, which I won, the guy, the Milton guy was number two, and there was a third guy who--they had roles in the next year, in the junior year.  I had, was the only one that would have a role in the senior year.  He cried.  He broke down crying, and he had tried to buy the god damned thing and he couldn't buy it.  And I'm even told that some football players, I don't have any idea who they were, had written to the Director of Athletics saying, Arondale  should win it, and he just tore the letter up, as (unclear).  You can't cross this line.  So I became the Harvard football manager.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were first black--
Speaker 2: To do that.
Speaker 1: --to do that.  Let's talk a little bit about your classes and the professors, and who was the president at that time?
Speaker 2: The president was James B. Conant, a chemist, Harvard grad, brilliant.  He had had a great deal to do with the War effort as had the president of MIT, by the way.  But Conant had done many things during his presidency to shake Harvard up.  And I met President Conant only because by virtue of being a football manager, I then, when the permanent class committee is being elected as a senior at Harvard, the football captain was the first Marshall.  I, the manager, was the second Marshall, and a Jew--the football captain was Irish Catholic.  So a black and a Jew who was the son of Morris Spivak.  His name was John Spivak.  He was a track star.  So an Irishman, a black and a Jew were the three Marshalls.  And we, together, went in and asked President Conant, we had to ask him to do something, to address us.  I know what it is, for Baccalaureate.
Story_ID: 1905
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your classes that you took there.
Speaker 2: I was a very poor student, very poor student, as a "C".  I'm not proud of that, but I think in some ways I was afraid.  I was afraid of failing and therefore, rather than put out a good effort and get a "B" and say, okay, I'm not the smartest guy at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but I can get a "B".  I would rather have a "C".  And for years after I graduated from Harvard, when I was on the edge of something that was important and where I could mess up, I saw myself, dreamt that I was going to an exam at Harvard College.  So I was a very poor student.  I'm not proud of it, but I was.
Speaker 1: What classes were you taking?
Speaker 2: Well, the, we all had to have a concentration.  So my concentration was in something called social relations.  And social relations was a stew, if you will, that had been put together during the War.  It included sociology.  It included the study of personality, that is [Sigmund] Freud and not [Ivan] Pavlov because psychology was where Pavlov was, and there was a psychology department.  But Freud was studied in social relations.  Cultural anthropology and one other, of which I can't recall, I made the mistake, and there were several mistakes I made.  For instance, Harvard had a speaking contest.  I had won at Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts], big time.  It was called the Boylston Speaking Contest at Harvard.  The only way I know about that was that as a senior Marshall--the first Marshall was invited to a thing.  He turned it down.  I went.  It was at the home of Archibald McLean, who's a very distinguished poet and the Boylston professor of rhetoric.  So I had to go to the supper at his house, and introduce these people.  A black guy won that night.  And I just said to myself, you're foolish, you should have been--at least tried.  And it was the same, I loved history at Andover, and instead of taking history, I took this crazy social relations thing.  I mean it was very immature is the way I would put it.  But what saved me in terms of the long run is that the football manager at Harvard, had been written up in "Life Magazine" as being the equivalent of the first year of the Harvard Business School.  So I didn't know what I wanted to do, and I said, so what do football managers do?  They go to the Harvard Business School.  So that's what I did, and that saved me.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the students that were your classmates?
Speaker 2: Well, one of them was the young black guy who had come down from Andover with me and his name shouldn't be a difficult name for you, was Oscar DePriest, III, the grandson of the Congressman.  Now, his life, we were friends, but his life and mine were, you know, way apart.  He graduated summa cum laude.  He was chosen Phi Beta Kappa in what was then called "Senior Sixteen," which meant that he was finishing in the top thirty people.  The Senior Sixteen which was elected and by then that meant there were twenty-four cause there were eight juniors and sixteen seniors, they were in the top thirty in the class.  He was a very hard worker.  One year for the Harvard-Yale game, I think my junior year, I said, Oscar, would you like two tickets to go to the Harvard-Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] game.  I got six.  He said, yeah, he looked at 'em.  Maybe I could [sell?] (unclear)--just give me my tickets.  If you aren't going, I'll give them to somebody else.
Speaker 1: Who else was a classmate of yours?
Speaker 2: Well, obviously, people from on the football team, okay, cause that's where I spent my life.  And I have some, you know, once you're a manager, that's, that's it.
Speaker 1: Was Henry Kissinger a classmate?
Speaker 2: He was a classmate and James Schlesinger was a classmate.  I didn't know Kissinger.  I don't Schlesinger.  They were both summa's (unclear).  And, by the way, when they were in the Nixon cabinet, it was mentioned that they were both summa's out of Harvard.  Schlesinger behaved very well, went back to the Defense Department and said, you know, look, orders have to come from me.  We're not gonna--so Schlesinger, Kissinger, the guy who ran Harvard admissions for years, Fred Glimp, is a classmate and a buddy of mine.  He and Oscar and I used to play poker.  He was invited to, I got married in Washington [D.C.], and there was a party for me in, out at my sister's house.  And I drove back in Oscar's car.  And I missed his house.  And Fred Glimp was there and Oscar said, "back up, Nigger (laughter)," and he caught himself because Fred was there.  And Fred said to him, why don't you guys, will you just stop this and forget that I am who I am and talk as if I am one of you.  I told Fred that story last year at our 60th reunion.  Oscar is now dead.  But Fred became the guy who architected the $2 billion fund drive that Harvard had.  Who else?
Story_ID: 1906
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about--this is also--
Speaker 2: By the way, in, in, at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], again, now, this was important to me.  As far as I know, I became the first black admitted to the Hasty Pudding--there were finer clubs at Harvard, and the Hasty Pudding is not a finer club.  But I was admitted to the Hasty Pudding in my senior year.  And that was because a guy by the name of David Stone and the Stones had given money to Palmer Memorial Institute which is ten miles from Greensboro [North Carolina] and Dr. Brown, Charlotte Hawkins Brown, was a great friend of the family.  And I told Dr. Brown this story that David had, had--and she said, Frank, as far as I know, you were the first one since Bill Lewis, which may or may not have been so.  But at any rate, David Stone, whose family loved Palmer, called me up one day, and he said, I want you to join the Hasty Pudding, and if you don't have enough money, we will help you.
Speaker 1: What is the Hasty Pudding?
Speaker 2: It is a, they--it would be sort of like a secret society at Andover, except it's a lot of people.  But they put on this Hasty Pudding show every year, which makes them famous, the men in those days would act the roles of women and it was, you know, hilarious, you know, boys being boys, if you will.  And it was a very important thing.
Speaker 1: Because this is War time, some of the years leading up to your graduation, was there anything in particular that you remember about that time?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the class of which I was a part was roughly half veterans and half those of us who came direct from high school.  And that distinguished it because, you know, you had these veterans, and a lot of the football players, by the way, some of the better football players were veterans.  But I'll tell you who was the captain of the team in my junior year, was Kenny O'Donnell, who became Chief of Staff to John F. Kennedy.  And Bobby Kennedy was on the football team.  I knew Bobby, not well, but I knew him.  And one of my classmates, for instance, became a federal district--one of my football classmates, a guy by the name Lazoni (ph.) became a federal district judge and a very distinguished one there in Massachusetts because Teddy Kennedy [Senator Ted Kennedy] championed his cause.  So--
Story_ID: 1907
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduate with a B.A. in 1950.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what happened after you graduate?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked at the Harvard [University] Athletic Association on the grounds crew for that summer, and then I got an invitation to join the [United States] Army.  After all, the Korean War got declared or started--I graduated early in June, later in June.  So there was this call up to go to Korea, but it so happens that the Russians, we were concerned about the Russians. Eisenhower [U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953-1961] went back into the, into the service.  We were concerned about the Russians, so I would have either been sent to Korea or in Europe and I got sent to Europe.  I was lucky in that sense.  I went over with a segregated field artillery group.  I was in the, working in personnel, and then I found out that--you went in for two years, but you could extend for a year and you would have no reserve obligations when you got out.  It was done.  And I decided to do that and to go to the Army Language School down in Oberammergau [Germany] and studied Russian six months.  And again, this is after the fact, but, you know, it was a mistake.  I never had a chance to make the Russian active.  If I had been really on the ball, I would have taken German and had been able to make the German active.  It was a four-month course as opposed to a six-month course.  But the point is, how can make it active--if you study as intensively as we did, and if you don't have a way of making it active, because I went back to the old job that I had.  And, but I enjoyed very much the service in Germany.  My parents came over, and I had a car by this time, and I met them in Paris [France], took them all through Europe, including Holland and crossed over into Germany and Cologne and went into Austria and had a wonderful time with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's stop here, and then we'll pick up.
Story_ID: 1908
Speaker 1: Let me just tell you, one of my mentors in later days was Kenneth Clark, of whom I became very, very fond.  And I have a picture over there of Kenneth Clark.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, okay, so January 1951 is when you enter the [United States] Army and you're there until December--
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty three [1953].  Okay, and what happens next?
Speaker 1: I got out of the Army.  I started looking--I was discharged in Fort Devens which is in Massachusetts so I went to, found a place to stay and started looking for a job.  And I went to the First National Bank of Boston [Massachusetts] and asked whether they had any work.  And they gave me a run-around.  Then I went to a bank called the Chaumont Bank, and I'm sitting there and low and behold the sun of the head of PBX's father, Mr. Schutt, was the chief of personnel.  So he hired me.  And I worked for the Chaumont Bank from that time until the time that I resigned to go to the Harvard Business School, which was in September 1955.
Speaker 2: And what made you decide to go to Harvard Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Well, I wasn't getting anywhere, and I decided if I'm to get somewhere, I've got to go to the business school.  And so I applied to, I got into the business school.  It was not easy.  I remember, in fact, I got turned down.  And then I talked to my buddy, Fred Glimp, who was in the admissions office at Harvard.  He said you need to go back over there and tell them they have to admit you.  So I went over and talked to a guy by the name of Chaffey Hall, who as director of admissions.  And he said, Mr. Jones, I'd like to take a chance on you and admitted me.  I said, I think they had told him, look, this guy's a, you know, was a football manager, class Marshall.  His grades are less, you know, than his makeup will be.  He should be fine there.
Speaker 2: And so how, you said it wasn't easy.  So tell me what happens while you're there and how long are you there?
Speaker 1: Two years.  I got married while I was there by the way at the end of my first year.
Speaker 2: Who did you marry?
Speaker 1: I married Anna Faith Johnson who had graduated from Wellesley [College] in 1954.  I met her as George Johnson, and she's the daughter of Mordecai Johnson [President of Howard University].  So some people say even today, look, this guy's about a black aristocracy.  So we got married.  We got divorced.  We're now friends, and as I say, she became head of the permanent charity of the Boston Foundation, did a remarkable job there.  And if you have not interviewed her, I would recommend that you do so.  And I'll find out.  And I was a good student, but not a great student.  And, but a profound thing happened to me at the Harvard Business School.  There was a guy there by the name of Rollins, Leslie Rollins who an assistant dean.  And I know now that Dean Rollins had been to Greensboro [North Carolina] because he was very fond of Spencer Love who ran Burlington Industries.  And Spencer Love said to him, you need to go over and check out Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And he did, and he ran into my father [David Jones].  And he said to my father, you've got it all, you've got it all.  It's a great place.  By then the Student Union was built, and my father just said, you know, the dean from Harvard, well, Harvard is a huge place.  But he was talking about Les.  At any rate, my father died while I was at the Harvard Business School, and I remember going in to see Les and saying, I have to go to Greensboro for my funeral.  He said, I've got control here.  You go do what you have to do.  But more importantly, in my second year, Les Rollins said to me, Jonsey, get yourself a personal board of directors.  And I said to him, dean, you are on it.  And very little happened from that point forward in the rest of my life until he died, that he wasn't involved in.  And it so happened that I got a job at the Harvard Business School, became his peer.  He said, you've got to get the hell out of here one day--I'd been there three years or four years.  "You've got to get the hell out of here.  You aren't going any further here.  You've either got to get a Ph.D. or you've got to get more work experience."
Story_ID: 1909
Speaker 1: Well, he was the one who said you need to go to Scott Paper Company.  So I went down to Scott Paper Company.  I hemmed and hawed, and they said, if you come here, we believe you wanna be a marketer.  All marketers here have to have sales experience.  And one day somebody at Scott made that clear to me.  He said, look, if you're going ahead in marketing at Scott Paper, you have to be a sales person because that's like wearing the combat infantryman's badge.  So they paid me well above what I was making at the Harvard Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], where I was an assistant dean by now, secretary to the faculty, sort of a big shot.  They moved me down to Washington [D.C.], which is fine by me because Anna's parents lived there.  She had, you know, we're running to her home.  By then, her father and--her father is retired.  He lives right down the street from us.  She has brothers and sisters.  So I became a sales person.  I was scared.  I mean to tell you, I was scared.  But eventually, I was calling on every store in the district that had sales of $10,000 a week at least.  And I started making a game out of it.  I loved it.  I mean I would try to understand why is this store making money and why is it not?  And one of the things I found out, for instance, is that on Connecticut Avenue, you couldn't sell backs of chickens.  But the Safeway [Grocery Store] command wouldn't let them throw those backs out.  So they'd send them into the inner cities where, in effect, because the backs cost them nothing, that's pure profit.  And I began, and I was, I was driving Doc around one day, and he said, boy, you do know Washington.  I said, Doc, this is all I do during the day.  I was in a store in Washington, D.C. when John F. Kennedy [U.S. President, 1961-1963] got killed.  And I can remember saying to the guy who said the President's been shot, I said, man, don't lie, don't, don't say something like that.  Well, he wasn't lying.  I just couldn't--and, at any rate, so I did that for about a year and a half.  I was, I learned how to do it and do it well.  They sent somebody down one day to work with me, and, oh, boy, I did, it was a spectacular day.  I just impressed him.  Well, they said, look, we're now gonna move you into Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where you're gonna be in brand management.  So eventually, I became the brand manager for all Scott toilet tissues.  And they had a combined share of forty-five percent.  I was really good as a brand manager.  I'm telling you I was good, I was really good.   I did analyses and other things like that, that they had just never thought about.  And I was enjoying it.  I could travel all over the country, and I remember once I--you know, any time you went to the West Coast, you flew first class (chuckle).  So I'm going to the West Coast and go up and then come back into Fargo, North Dakota.  And I was doing well.  Now, it's funny cause George, Anna Faith said to me, if you had stayed at Scott Paper, you would have been promoted to head of the group of which you were a part.  And I said, what makes you think that?  She said, I just could tell it.  I could tell the way they respected you.  And, but they, they made one huge mistake.  They didn't know how to deal with science and technology.  So I, now, this is more than you wanna know, but I'm gonna tell you.
Speaker 2: into that, let's just go back and do a little catch up.  You're married, and you have a son in 1960, is that right?
Speaker 1: A son in 1960.  David was born in Boston, David Jones II.
Speaker 2: Okay, and just so that we have it on record that you earned your M.B.A. in 1957.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty seven [1957], yeah.  So I was at the Harvard Business School from 1957 until 1962.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so now we're at Scott Tissue, and you're gonna tell me about their mistakes of not using technology.
Speaker 1: They didn't understand the importance of science and technology.  And here I am a black man, running the most important brand in the company, and they won't put money in the brand.  I tried to show them that they were, that this was foolhardy, they were making a mistake, that they needed, in the first place, more technology.  A very significant thing happened.  Proctor and Gamble which had bought the Charmin paper mills in Wisconsin came into the industry.  And they came out with new Charmin toilet tissue.  The people at Scott did not understand what had happened.  And it wasn't until the patent came out that they saw that this was a revolutionary way of imparting softness and strength to a tissue.
Story_ID: 1910
Speaker 1: Now, something else happened at this point.  I get a call one day, it is from the people who are the trustees of Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  And they say we would like for you to come to New York and talk to us.  And so I go in to tell my boss this, and he said, Frank, this has been going on, they've been investigating you for a year.  So I'm not surprised.  And I say to him, well, they've asked me to come to New York and talk, and I feel that I have to go.  I mean this is, after all, this is like going home.  So I go up and talk to them, and long story short, one night coming back from Chicago [Illinois] to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I'm asked by a guy who's then running Abercrombie and Fitch, he said, we're gonna make you the next president of Fisk, except that it never happened.  I didn't get the job.  There were three things that I am told that they said.  Number one, you don't have a Ph.D., which is true, number two, you're not black, which is false and something else.  At any rate, it turns out they did me a favor.  They turned me down.  And two weeks after being turned down, publicly turned down, that, at least it's out, I hear from Les.  "You didn't use your board of directors".  I said, Les, I don't think it would have helped, but look, now that you've called, I've got to get out of Scott Paper cause these people are going nowhere.  I thought this was a nice way out.  Well, one thing led to another and my Vitae got to Howard Johnson, the twelfth president of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].  And one day, I'm in what I call middle, middle management, I get a call from the president of MIT asking me to come up and see him.  And this was Les, Les's network.  And I was highly marketable.  I mean I could have gone with Bed Stuy [Bedford Stuyvesant] and Frank Thomas, AT and T called me up one day.  I said, look, what do you got, cause I've got some things and unless it's really good, I'm not gonna waste your time or mine.  I'm really honing in on other--and I thought going to MIT would have, you know, given me the science and technology.  At least I would learn how to talk to these people, and then I'd go back in the industry.  And low and behold, my boss who was a Southerner, white, a year younger than I, civil engineer in the Urban Systems Lab put me up for tenure in civil engineering and worked it all out.  I didn't know anything about it, and he comes to me, and he says, you're a professor at MIT.  Now, I really thought I was an associate professor, without tenure.  No, I was a full professor with tenure.  A year later, at the time I got there, the Ford Foundation had given MIT, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], a variety of other places, what is it, something like five to $10 million to step up your commitment to the urban area.  MIT got three urban chairs.  I got the first of those urban chairs.  Now, can you imagine what that does?  Here I am, I don't have a Ph.D.  I'm the first black to be tenured at MIT.  I don't have a PH.D.  I am now having an endowed chair, and believe me, endowed chairs at MIT are really something cause what they do, is you get--I got while I was there roughly sixty or $70,000 a year that I could commit to anything I wished, any 501(c)(3) thing that I wished as long as I had talked, this is the way I'm gonna use this money.  And what happened after that is I then start getting corporate boards.
Speaker 2: What year did you go to MIT?
Speaker 1: I went in February, 1968, had a big fight at Scott Paper.  They, it was a meeting one day and one of the people came down and met with the brand managers.  And I gave him what for.  I really gave him what for.  I said, you guys don't understand what's going on in the marketplace, and--because you are unaware of it, and we who are, you don't wanna listen to us.  I mean I really just went off on him.  And when he left, he said, boy, this is a bath.  Well, I was leaving there to go to New York to see Kenneth Clark to talk to him about some things.  And they were looking for me, and I had left.  So I go in to see my boss, and he said, you're using Scott Paper.  I said, if you feel that way, I will resign.  I don't wanna use you.  Now, I already had a job offer from Bed-Stuy.  I had been to MIT, but didn't have an offer.  So I called up MIT, and I said, if you want me, you'd better put something together.  And I would have gone to Bed-Stuy.  My mother [Suzie Williams Jones] didn't want me to go to Bed-Stuy, but I would have gone to Bed-Stuy.  And, at any rate, you know, I just said--and I said, look, by my likes, the best time for me to resign is on the February 15th.  This was early in January.  If that is inconvenient for you, I can move it up.  I had enough money to just take a hit in the meantime.  He said, no, that's fine cause they had to, you know, they had to--I was running a group.  They had to decide who was gonna replace me and all of that.  So they weren't gonna push me out.  And at some point, the CEO of the company, a guy by the name of Dunning stopped me and said, Frank, why are you leaving?  I said, because I don't think you guys are going anywhere.
Story_ID: 1911
Speaker 1: So in 1968 is when you go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but during the Civil Rights Movement, are you involved actively?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, and I felt that keenly.  I, I used to feel it very, very keenly until something happened at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] with Warren Buffett.  And I'm going to tell you about that later on.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, at MIT in '68 [1968] there's a task force on education opportunity that's established.  Do you know about that, about some of the faculty members would sit in with--
Speaker 2: See, when I went to MIT--
Speaker 1: --the Student Union at all?
Speaker 2: No, when I went to MIT, sixty percent of my salary was paid by the president and the provost, forty percent by the Urban Systems Lab.  I had money, I didn't have my professorial, but I got some money from the Urban Systems Lab.  There was an MIT student in architectural planning who was working with a group of citizens in the South End [Boston].  And what he proposed to do was to rehab the apartments, about 104 in number, where they had lived, and there was such a thing as a cash throw-off, that they were gonna get a certain amount of cash for this.  So that guy and I collaborated.  And I started something called--I'll have to look it up, but it was technology, TRP, technology for people, or something like that, TRP.  I forget what it was.  And we would go out into the community and work with people.  In other words, now, I'm getting into the Civil Rights Movement cause this was, this was about keeping people from getting kicked out of their houses, black people, poor people.  And MIT didn't have a problem with that.  They wanted me to get out in the community, which I wanted to do.  And so--"Technology, Race and Poverty", that was it.  Technology, Race and Poverty, that's TRP.  And for about the first twelve years, Anna Faith and I went down to see my brother, David, once, and she said, Frank, you're the only person who gets paid for doing what he loves doing.  And I was just having a ball.  For the first twelve years, it was glorious.  I mean I was, you know, tenured, and I had money.  I'm getting corporate boards.  Polaroid comes in 1973.
Speaker 1: Which one was that?
Speaker 2: Polaroid--
Speaker 1: Polaroid.
Speaker 2: --which is right there at MIT, and let me tell you about that.  The way I got into Polaroid is Tom Wyman who was the Number three guy in the company was Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts], 1947. And he had admired me and so Tom calls me up one day and says, come over and let's talk.  Now, they were looking at other people.  But we get in to see Land, and I see at Land there are many geniuses in the country.  I mean whom do you see, I say just take prototypical ones, Ford and Sloan, which one do you see Polaroid following?  Well, he said, obviously, none, neither.  But the point was that when I left that meeting, and there was a guy by [the name of] McCuen (ph.), McCuen, Land, Tom and myself, McCuen says, you're asking the right questions, and you're not gonna take any stuff even from him.  So I got that job, and that's paying, you see, and paying, and you're talking with important people.  Dick Hill of the Bank of Boston was on the, Bank of Boston, the biggest bank by far, Killian of MIT, who was the post-War father of MIT is on the board.  Carl Kaysen who had run the Advanced Institute.  I mean it was, it was glorious.  So there was a period there, roughly twelve years, where the people who had brought me into MIT, who were protecting me saying, we like what you're doing; keep doing it, where I just, you know, I was having a ball.
Story_ID: 1912
Speaker 1: What was Project Interphase?
Speaker 2: Now, I didn't have anything to do with Project Interphase, but Project Interphase got started by MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  After the students were admitted, they had to come in and do a six-week program designed to give them a head start, minority students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember mentoring a student named Paul Gray?
Speaker 2: Paul Gray became the president of MIT.  I didn't mentor him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I fought with him eventually.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But I didn't mentor him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, do you wanna hear that story now?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Well, Johnson and Weasner (ph.) bring me in.  Miller is my direct boss, Charley Miller.  Charley leaves at a time when there was real turmoil about something called the Draper Lab.  Johnson leaves after five years, but Weasner becomes the president.  Weasner wants me to join his administration.  I said, no, I don't wanna join your administration.  I wanna continue doing what I'm doing here.  But I had access to him.  Gray then takes over after Weasner.  I invite Weasner to my house with a private chef and there are six of us there, my date and myself, Jerry and his wife and another mechanical engineer, black, and his wife.  I even say to Jerry, Jerry, you didn't do very well on race.  He said, you need to take some of the responsibility.  You didn't come in and complain enough.  And it took me a long time to come to grips with that.  I even talked to Kenneth Clark about it.  And then it occurred to me that what he was saying is, look, if you had come in and said, things aren't right here for blacks, and somebody had come in and said completely opposite, I could say, that's funny, Frank Jones doesn't agree with you.  So by my not complaining, I was letting him off the hook, and that's what he was saying to me.  So when Paul Gray becomes the president, I even say to him, Jerry told me I didn't complain enough.  And I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna start complaining more.  So they needed somebody to--there was an office called the Office of Minority Education, which had been established to do something about the problem of dual achievement.  And they tried, I ran the committee which chose the first chairman, a guy by the name of Wes Harris who's still here, an aeronautical, astronautical engineer.  Wes had the job for three years, turned it over to--and then a guy by the name of Clarence Williams--Wes and Clarence Williams are black.  Clarence Williams was the, Paul Gray's administrative assistant.  So Clarence ran it for two years.  Then they, the job comes open again.  So they are having trouble, and they asked me to chair a committee to find the chairman, the executive director of OME.  And what we do is I get, Hasan Minor, who's now at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and Karen Albright, who are graduate students.  And we pulled the records of all the 417 black students who had been admitted to MIT and had had a chance to graduate.  So they were, an eight-year period.  Hasan took those records, got the records from the registrar, took them and based them in a computer elsewhere.  And here's what we found out.
Speaker 1: Well, before you give us that, let's stop right here so you won't have to stop in the middle of your telling me that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 1913
Speaker 1: Okay, what is it that you find out?
Speaker 2: We find out that there's a pool of 417 black students and we used that as a--cause there was never a problem with students from Asia.  They are not under represented at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But brown and red and black are.  So we pulled the blacks.  We find out that the attrition rate is thirty percent.  For the rest of the institute, it's fifteen percent.  We find out that in terms of admissions that a lot of them have, should never have been admitted to MIT.  This report, which Hasan and Karen had done, then gets compiled.  We say, before we turn this over to the Whites, we're gonna let every black on campus, professorial and high staff know, which we did.  We wanted to get them behind us, in other words.  Sometimes that didn't turn out well.  But eventually, I then get to take the report to the president of the institute, who was Paul Gray.  I say to him, Mr. President, my parents were against separate but unequal.  I am against integrated and unequal, and that is what we have here.  On the way out, he says to me, Frank, you are asking the types of questions that I have been afraid to ask.  Six months later, he invites me to the president's home and has lunch with me.  And I say to him, Mr. President, what you're saying to me is you're poorly staffed.  I said, let me suggest to you a way of dealing with this.  I suggest that you appoint a kitchen cabinet of five people, including myself and others at the institute whom he knew and (unclear) it was the rationale, swear us to secrecy and then get the job done.  Let's get this job done.  He never does do that, okay.  On another occasion during this same period--this is after 1981, five of us go in to see the provost, including me.  We're all full professors or tenured.  Therefore, it's one with a, associate, Ken Manning, who was one of your advisors was a part of that.  I don't know whether he had then made full professor or not, but he certainly had tenure.  So we were not, we were not doing this--we were doing this on behalf of MIT.  And one of the people involved, for instance, was a guy by the name of Maddock (ph.) who had taught the course in Calculus, which was one of the big problems for blacks.  So turn it over to us, hold us accountable and let's get this job done.  The provost won't do anything about it.  Well, in 1986, Hasan found Steve Kirkwood and who's writing three articles for the "Boston Globe".  The first article--all of them first page.  The black colleges are doing very well, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  The second talks about alienation of blacks on white campuses.  That's me and that's what I showed you.  The third says, demographic changes are coming, people.  And if you aren't going to educate black and brown, you're gonna be in trouble as a society.  Now, before that article came out, I had gone to see Howard Johnson who was retired, but living in the Institute, and I said, Howard, I'm about to play hardball.  He said, Frank, you have to and you should.  I went to see Jerry Weasner.  He said nothing, told him the same thing; went to see a guy by the name of Al Hill.  Al was White but so together with it.  He called me up after the articles came out and he said, Frank, the articles were fine.  Just tell me this.  When, don't--have adverse as long as you are here, but when you leave us, don't drag us through the mud.  I said, Al, that's a moral commitment and I will give you my commitment.  Well, the president and the provost, Paul Gray and a guy by the name of Deutsch were surprised.  They didn't know anything about this.  So they tried to fire me.  Deutsch wrote me a letter, John Deutsch who became head of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], wanted to be head of DOD [Department of Defense], pain in the ass.  Deutsch sent me a letter saying we'll buy out at this "x".  By then I had a lawyer.  I was on the board of CIGNA, Connecticut General.  I sent my lawyer who was an applied mathematician--and by the way, a black graduate of Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts] and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], sent him down to Hartford [Connecticut].  They reasoned, and my lawyer, Charley, was an applied mathematician, they reasoned if it would take two "x" to make me whole.  So, in effect, I said to MIT, I'm not scared.  I have tenure.  I haven't done anything wrong.  You've done wrong.  But you're not gonna get me out of here without adequate compensation.
Story_ID: 1914
Speaker 1: Now, I then did something that I am very, very grateful for.  I decided that I needed to get off the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] campus, that I couldn't go to Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina], but that I could come to Morehouse because of Roy Keith and I had known one another when he was in Boston.  We were members of the Boule together.  Roy said, Frank, I'd like to have you come to Morehouse.  And then when I called him up one day and said, you know, the rubber is hitting the road now.  Can we do this?  He said, Frank, if I paid you your MIT salary, which was on the low side, here, you'd be at the top of the heap.  I said, I don't want that.  He said, neither do I.  So why don't you go to MIT and ask them to keep you on half salary during the period, semester that you're gonna be here.  I'll pay half your salary, and that then will--so I came to Morehouse.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: This is in the Fall of 1989.  I teach two courses.  I teach one in Marketing.  It's the first I've ever taught a course in Marketing, and the students loved it cause I had, in addition to using cases which none of them were using, I had somebody come down from Polaroid.  I had somebody come down from Gillette and somebody from Scott Paper Company, believe it or not.  And I took Polaroid pictures of every one of them, got to know their names right away and could call them by name.  The last class was just wonderful.  They knew what a case was by that time, and here were these two guys arguing with one another.  And I said, that's what a case discussion is about.  Neither one of you are wrong, you know.  It depends on how you weight things.  The other class was even more significant cause I had a group of six, and we talked about leadership.  And we talked about how could we help make Morehouse a better place.
Speaker 2: So how long do you stay at Morehouse?
Speaker 1: Six months.
Speaker 2: Six months.  Two of those guys, for instance, one of them told me while I was here that he wanted to go to the Harvard Business School.  His name is Roger Wood.  And I said, I'll, I will work--I was gonna do a Les Rollins on them.  I was gonna do for them what Les Rollins did for me.  I was gonna show them, this is what you get when you're mentored by somebody who cares.  When I went to tell the department head I was gonna back Roger, he looked in his cue, and he said, well, Roger isn't that high on our cue.  I said, but he's high on my cue.  And that's all that matters (laughter).  MIT, each professor has his own cue.  So Roger got into the Harvard Business School one year late.  And in--I'm gonna show it to you, in 1996, those guys, augmented by two, gave a party for me up here at the Finance Club.  And I'll show you the plaque that they gave me that night.  And my date told me that night, told me the next day, she said, those aren't your students.  Those are your surrogate sons because I knew how to deal with each one of them, and I was gonna meet his or--his needs, cause there were no women and help them get into Harvard Business School, help them get here, help them get wherever they wanted to go.  And I still am in touch with some of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after the six months, where do you go?
Speaker 2: I then went back to MIT.  I, the minute I got back there, I gave a lecture to some students, telling them how impressed I was with my stay at Morehouse, how I felt we had things, as a group, we could learn from Morehouse.  Somebody heard that speech and came to me and said, look, there's a thing on South Africa tomorrow.  So they put up signs.  They asked me to be the main speaker, so I give a speech on South Africa.  It's written up in Paul Gray's rag, "Jones gives a metaphor to what's going on".  I had the Morehouse Glee Club record singing the South African National Anthem, the black one.  I played that.  I mean that whole thing just, you know, it got me where I needed to be.  And I was ready then to leave MIT and to come here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year did you leave MIT?
Speaker 2: In, I resigned in 19--January 1992.  Now--
Speaker 1: Now, at this time, you're still on the CIGNA board, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm on all of my corporate boards.
Speaker 1: So 1992--
Speaker 2: One of the reasons I resigned in 1992--and I see you have already written him up, is a guy by the name of Phil Clay was coming up for tenure in the department.  I couldn't vote for him.  I thought he was too timid, thought he wouldn't--and I said, I was, knew he was gonna get it cause the whites wanted him.  But I wasn't gonna vote for him, and so I resigned rather than be there when he was going to get tenure.  I just said, no, I'm not gonna sit there.  I can't vote against him.  I'll be--people will, it will be all over campus, and I said, he's too god damn timid.  And I still feel that way, in spite of the fact that he's done as well as he has done at MIT, and you've written him up and all of that.
Story_ID: 1915
Speaker 1: So when you resign in 1992, what happens next?  Where do you go next?
Speaker 2: I had a bad house, had a bad marriage, was getting, get divorced a second time and a bad job.  So I had to stay at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], up there in Cambridge for a year getting rid of this house.  And as soon as I got rid of the house, I came to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: And who did you come to work for?
Speaker 2: I was retired.  I thought I would have something to do with Morehouse, and I did.  And I'm gonna get into that, but, you know, that was.  I'm out of there.  I'm on my corporate boards.  I can read.  I can think, I can play the stock market.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've had, I stayed--I moved here in 1999.  I stayed right up the street on Peachtree Street, 2460, for about six or seven years.  But I was renting there, and I--then I got the payout from CIGNA which was too significant to, I mean so I needed to buy, in other words.  So that's when I bought here.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about CIGNA, your resignation from CIGNA.  That was in 1997, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me what happened there.  You know, you got a large payout, like you said.  Tell me what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, you may recall that just before the period we're talking about, it had come out that Texaco had been doing things to minorities that were just not done.  They were being embarrassed.  The person who sat next to me at CIGNA, to my left, that is, was a guy by the name of Decrane (ph.), who had been CEO and chairman of Texaco.  He was very important.  So I called up this--we're talking about the board meeting on December, which is the last board meeting of the year, I called up the general counsel and tell him that DeCrane who is running the People Resources Committee, that that is bad optics.  Now, I knew that DeCrane was implicated, but I'll tell you something else.  I had served on the Burlington board when a guy by the name of Frank Greenberg, a Jew, had a tough time becoming a CEO because the then CEO of Texaco, somebody from Halliburton were against him because he was Jewish.  And I kept holding their feet to the fire and saying, I don't hear any evidence.  I hear conclusions, but I don't hear any evidence.  Well, so I call up the general counsel, and the general counsel said, I'm going in to see the CEO.  And you will be hearing from him.  The meeting comes.  It's a long meeting, big party on Sunday night, board meeting on Monday.  The CEO says nothing to me.  I called the general counsel up.  He said, he should have spoken to you.  When I get back--that's on Tuesday.  On Thursday, I called up the general, the CEO, and I said, I, I'm resigning.  I said, I can't take it anymore and I therefore have to resign.  And I'm resigning for cause.  And I said, I've sucked up a lot, but this is too much.
Speaker 1: Now, an interesting thing happens.  I get a call from Bill Coleman that afternoon, and his immediate reaction--and I know Bill.  Bill has been on the CIGNA board.  Bill says, I wish more blacks would do what you have done.  And we talk, and I said, Bill, I'm now dating Sybil Morreal (ph.), Mark's mother, Dutch's wife, and she was a flower girl at your marriage to Lavita (ph.).  And Sybil and I are going to New York over the holidays, Christmas holidays.  So long story short, we, Sybil and I go down to Washington to have brunch with Bill and Lavita at the Four Seasons.  We talk.  Sybil and Lavita are talking, Bill and I are talking, some of it--anyway, Bill says to me, Frank, what would you like?  I said, I would like DeCrane to be fired.  He said, I can't get that.  He then makes a huge mistake.  He tells me that he, his firm of O'Melveny & Myers has made $32 million from CIGNA this last completed year.  I do not tell Bill that I have hired a lawyer, a guy by the name of Chuck Hamilton who's at Ted Battle, and Ted Keel, Battle and Keel.  Now, I have known Chuck from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and Harvard [Harvard University].  I call up Chuck, and I tell Chuck, I want you to represent me.  Chuck goes down to CIGNA--this is in the, early in January.  See, they know I'm gonna resign, but I haven't sent the letter in.  So there's some negotiating room.  I said, Chuck, what it would take to keep me there is that they would need to have a committee for inclusiveness and acting very much as a, you know, an auditing committee.  They won't do that.  So just before the board meet, Chuck calls 'em up and says, Frank--I mean Bill, Frank is resigning, and he's resigning for cause.  Now, what I had learned at MIT was it took five years of negotiations with Paul Gray and others and nothing happened until that article got written, five years later.  For whatever reason, I say I've got to have a, somebody who can advise me about the public relations aspect.  I went to see a guy in New York, whom I picked up from Polaroid.  He said, yes, I can represent you and would like to represent you.  And he said, what they're doing is using Bill Coleman.  That's their defense.  One call I call him up, he won't answer the question.  He wouldn't answer my phone call, very distinguished guy.  So I know a guy by the name of Lester Pollock who is president of all the Jewish associations, sixty-three of them in number.  And I reasoned that Jews have been through this before.  I need somebody whom Lester will find me.  So I call up Lester, and he finds me somebody.  That guy then calls up the "Wall Street Journal".  He said, yes, I'll represent you, he calls up the "Wall Street Journal", persuades them that they ought to do an article--this is now six to eight months after the fact, on Martin Luther King's Day, birthday in 1998, I meet with Joann Lublin of the "Wall Street Journal".  The article comes out on June 15, I believe.  My family and I had just spent days, my entire family, including Anna Faith in Paris [France].  And we're--I had paid for everybody cause I said, look, we've all done well.  We've gotten ourselves, our acts together.  Everybody's married, bang, bang, bang.
Speaker 2: And the article talked about CIGNA's director, about diversity challenge, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you have that.
Story_ID: 1916
Speaker 1: How long had you been on the CIGNA board?
Speaker 2: I'd been on the CIGNA board twenty-one or twenty-two years.  I forget.  It was significant.  And what's even more significant is CIGNA had just established a policy that they were gonna vet director who came up.  And they were nominating me for three more years at that board meeting that I sat through in December, and they said, he deserves to be here.  He's gonna hold you to a high standard, but he deserves to be here.  So they had just vetted and announced that I was being recommended by the committee, of which DeCrane was chairman, for three additional years.
Speaker 1: So tell me, what's the outcome?
Speaker 2: Well, I resigned.  This isn't in the article, but it is--I had $400,000 which I had deferred myself, which they had to have given me.  It was mine.  There was 600 [600,000] at stake.  They could have voted it or not.  They decided to vote it so in effect, I'm gonna get a payout of a million dollars.  They said because I accepted that, I didn't resign even though I didn't ask for it, even though they gave it.  And I said, no, buster.  So I resigned.  I resigned, and you're ought to know I resigned.  And I have to tell you this much later.  In the first place, I resigned on a matter of race.  I had been kicked off the compen--the People Resources Committee of which now Al Depreen (ph.) is chairman because I told them they were greedy.  And I do believe both of those were true and still are true, particularly, the issue of greed.  I just looked it up in the paper the other day.  The CEO of CIGNA is now making $15 million.  I was sitting there when this process started and the CEO was making 500,000 [dollars].  So I saw them just ruthlessly, ruthlessly, I do mean, exercising their greed.  And the way they did that was just say, you know, we're tired of your sermons.  But you don't find these greedy businessmen.  They don't, can't bear your telling them.  I was in a group that met in Cambridge.  Howard Johnson was on it, Ken Andrews of the Harvard Business School.  We were all concerned about the same thing, the greed that we could see being unleashed on corporate boards.  One night after a meeting, Howard said to me, Frank, these guys ought to make no more than three times what the president of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] are making.  And I believe that this ultimately is a part of what us to come--the salaries, that is, you know, to just lose our bearings.
Speaker 1: And so many things in so many different arenas as well, the greed has gotten to a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and the economy is bad because of greed.
Speaker 2: Now, let me, let me go back and remind you of something.
Speaker 1: Well, let's stop here so that you'll have enough time to finish that story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 1917
Speaker 1: Okay, there were a few things that you were going to say before we stopped the last time about your father [David Jones], what he made when he retired and Mordecai [Wyatt Johnson]?
Speaker 2: Well, the one I know best which I like is, we had honored McBay (ph.), who was a distinguished Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] professor at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I caused that to happen.  And that was my saying to MIT, I've been telling you, no, here's what I'm for because McBay, with resources which paled by comparison had trained at Morehouse eleven percent of all the blacks in America with a Ph.D. in chemistry at one point.  And he knew exactly what he was doing because he forced his students into mathematical chemistry because he knew that at Morehouse, they wouldn't ever have the instrumentation that they would have at an MIT or Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] or a, you know, Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley], Chicago [The University of Chicago].  Well, McBay told me that when Dr. [Benjamin] Mays retired, Dr. Mays was making 18,000 [dollars], and he, McBay, was making twelve [thousand dollars].  He said I thought that was fair cause he had a tougher job than I had.  He said, I didn't have to go out and raise the money.  He did.  Mordecai was not making a lot of money.  Mrs. Bethune never made a lot of money.  These are my heroes.  You could even make an argument that they, along with the black church had a lot to do with the way the revolution of blacks in America was, you know, handled.  After all, it was between Howard and the Howard Law School, which is going to the courts and Martin Luther King taking it to the streets that did it.  Yet, it was peaceful revolution, nonviolent.  And these guys never made a lot of money.  They're the ones who, to whom America owes the debt, for heavens sakes.  Just think what they did for America.  So when I see these guys getting all greedy, who don't care anything about the society, would rip the society up, I get very upset and mad and angry.  And I'm glad finally that there's a guy by the name Joe Nacera (ph.), now writing for "The New York Times" who's gonna bring out a lot of this stuff.  He's on the editorial page, got a great editorial just this morning, I believe.  It makes me very, very angry.
Story_ID: 1918
Speaker 1: Now, when I came back here, I worked over at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and they had, I think a million dollars to have a Coca-Cola lecture at MIT--I mean at Morehouse--
Speaker 2: At Morehouse.
Speaker 1: --I beg your pardon.  So I'm working with a guy by the name of Sheftall (ph.) and Walter Massey and who are we gonna invite to give the first lecture.  Now, I'd served on the Cap Cities board with Warren Buffett.  So I called up Omaha.  The secretary told me, you know, do you really wanna speak to Mr. Buffett and so forth?  I said, yes, I know him, and I think if you told Mr. Buffett that I had called, he would call me back.  He did.  And I said, Warren, we would like to have you come to Morehouse and give the first of the Coca-Cola lectures.  Now, he was on the Coca-Cola board.  So he was coming down here for a meeting.  So he brings not only himself, but his wife and his daughter, Suzie, Sr. and Suzie, Jr.  They have to be out of there by ten o'clock.  They get there about 5:30.  We have a supper, sit-down supper.  I had been told that we had to, and I insisted that more people in the room had to be students than anybody else cause that's the only people Warren Buffett wants to talk to at a lecture.  He didn't talk to old people.  He talks to young people.  So the lecture was brilliant.  But I had put up the chairman of the, one of my students, Morehouse students, who have now graduated, is, in fact, the chairman.  And he says to Mr. Buffett, Mr. Buffett, why are you here?  And he says because Frank Jones invited me.  That is the first time I ever felt wrapped into the civil rights struggle.  I said, by doing what I did, which was very oriented, individually oriented, by my putting my sacrifices, I finally get a chance to meet some things--somebody like Warren Buffett [emotional] and can bring him here to talk to these students.  And he gave a brilliant lecture.  We had a three-course meal, a five-course meal even which I had arranged, fifty people in the room.  We sing the Morehouse hymn.  We're out of there by ten [o'clock].  Now, here's where it gets kicked off.  My son calls me up.  He's at the Harvard Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He said, did you see what Warren Buffett said that the Annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting?  I said, no.  He said, that if I had been a black man or a black woman I wouldn't be where I am because I would not have seen the (unclear) [emotional].  Now, I had been unable to write Warren a letter to thank him--Walter Massey had.  Anyway I called him up, called up Debbie and I said, she said, he's on vacation.  I said, well, when he gets back, would you ask him to give me a call?  She called back in a half hour.  She said, he's at the Park Lane in New York, and he's waiting to hear from you.  So I tell him [emotional] how impressed I am by what he had said at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, and then I say [emotional], Warren, there was something at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] called Johnson's Sunday.  When Mordecai [Johnson] came to speak, they all knew it was gonna be for two hours (laughter), rather than for one cause Mordecai, once he got wound out, he was wound up.  So I said, I want to have Buffett Wednesday.  And he said, you're on.  Now, Morehouse had given Spelman a lot of money, so we're about to come up to Buffet Wednesday, and Coca-Cola lets Walter Massey know that they are expecting Walter Massey for a--Buffett for a supper on the night of Wednesday night before the Thursday meeting.  Somebody is retiring.  They're doing this deliberately, okay.  And Walter said, but we don't wanna get in trouble with Coca-Cola.  So I called Warren up and said to him, we will withdraw the invitation.  He said, oh, I've made it, and I'm coming.  And that was the first of seven or eight, six, whatever Buffett Wednesdays.  He brought his own, whole family, Howard, Peter, everybody.  Then, now I've kept this going, okay.  They wore me out for whatever reason.  Warren, God loves him, says to them, if Frank's not a part of this, I'm not a part of this.  So they called me up and say, put it back on track.  And I said, no, in deed.  You never appreciated what I have done for you.  You didn't appreciate him, you didn't appreciate me.  So too bad.  I get people, one particularly, student whom I meet downstairs, who says, thank you for bringing Warren Buffett at Morehouse.  I mean this guy--I ran the second of these meetings when Warren is here.  And his daughter, Susie, had to said to me at the first one, you need to ask him why he's a big "D" Democrat.  Well, we weren't, didn't have enough time.  Besides we had the quartet come in and sing.  We sang "Dear Morehouse" and all of that.  So I asked him this time cause I'm running the show.  He said, you know, there's very little difference between the Republicans and the Democrats on foreign policy and domestic policy.  He says, there's only one major thing that they split on and that's race.  And he said, I am a Democrat because I think the Democrats do a better job of race than the Republicans.  And he said, so far--Clinton [U.S. President Bill Clinton, 1993-2001] was then the president, so far I think that's proving well.  He said, look, I was the head of the Young Republicans in Nebraska at one point.  My father [David Jones] was a Republican.  So, so much for Warren.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it lets you know that sometimes people don't know, I mean the fact that I never would have asked him for anything, that I thought that this was my way of honoring the students.  You know, they didn't get it.  They thought they could just wall me off.
Story_ID: 1919
Speaker 1: Is there something that you haven't done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what, where I feel a sense of remorse.  I have not been able to sit down and to write, and I should have and some of the stories are compelling.  I have not told you about Mrs. Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune] who's one of my favorite people.  In the first place, I was required to go to Vespers, and the first person I could understand was Mrs. Bethune.  And I even told my father, that's the first person I could understand.  And he told her, and she said, I'll put the cookie jar down low today.  But the more important story about Mrs. Bethune is that we were in, at Bethune Cookman [Bethune Cookman College, Daytona Beach, Florida] one year.  It had to be pre-War [World War II].  We'd gone down with Dr. Brown, Charlotte Hawkins Brown, my mother and father.  Mrs. [Eleanor] Roosevelt was coming to the campus.  My cousin said, we're gonna meet the First Lady.  I said, how are we gonna do that?  He was older and he had done most of the driving.  He said, you just follow my prompt.  So the car comes on the campus, and she says to Mrs. Roosevelt, "Come, my dear".  Now, Mrs. Roosevelt is Mrs. Roosevelt.  I mean her husband is the president of the country, okay.  And then as Mrs. Bethune pivots on her right foot, my cousin pushes me in front of her, and she says to Mrs. Roosevelt, have you met the boys (laughter).
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: This was clearly before '41 [1941].  I need to find out, but I was, before I was forty-one.  Now, let me also say something to you.  Part of the divided world, I was so determined to make it at Andover [Andover Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts].  Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], it's a different thing.  But I forgot this story, I mean cause I, I was determined to let these white boys know I could compete with them.  I mean, no, I'm not a great finisher, but I do like to win.
Speaker 1: Tell me, what would you like your legacy to be?  I mean I hear your--
Speaker 2: One thread is the thread that we've talked about here.  My grandfather [Lunsford Williams] fighting for Berea [Berea College, Berea, Kentucky] that he knew, my fighting for a better MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], my going off the Polaroid--I mean the Signa board rather than sitting up there taking that stuff.  Somebody's got to say no, no, no.  This is greedy, this is--and the issue was race, but here's, Taylor wouldn't even speak to me.  The CEO wouldn't even speak to me even though the general counsel had said he should talk to you at least.  And if he had talked to me it would have very, very nice.  Bill, the optics are not right.  You may like DeCrane, but that's not good for business.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I would hope that my children, my grandchildren will fight for a better world.  And I do mean, now the issue is, as much as anything, class in the black community.  We need to find ways of reaching out to these young people and letting them know that there are people who care for them and that they can do better.  The Canaday of this world, the Michelle Reeves, etc., etc.  That's where--we ought to be in business cause that's where the frontiers are now.  But we ought to also--I mean when my son got admitted to the Harvard Business School, my son, Chris, the guy said, so where do you see yourself twenty years from now, talking to him.  He said, my family has always given back.  He said, so I see a time in my life after I have made some money, I will have to give in explicitly the ways that they have given back.  It's almost like, you're going, you're graduating from Andover.  You've now said it's time for me to make an explicitly black statement.  It didn't hurt me.  Tom Wyman gets me on the Polaroid board.  Mike Soosman (ph.) gets me on the Connecticut General board.
Speaker 1: What one thing would you say to a future generation because this interview is going to be available for many, many, many years.  What one thing would you say to the future generation?
Speaker 2: I'd say something that I heard up in MIT or Harvard, "think you can, work hard, get smart".  Those are not my words.  That comes from a guy who has been concerned with this issue, confidence, effort, get smart.  I didn't even do that.  I should have.  But that's what I would have them think about.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, I think that we have covered everything.  Is there anything that we have not covered?
Speaker 2: Thank you very much for coming.  I really do appreciate it.
Speaker 1: Well, we appreciate you as well.  So we're gonna stop here and we're gonna do the pictures.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, just one second.
