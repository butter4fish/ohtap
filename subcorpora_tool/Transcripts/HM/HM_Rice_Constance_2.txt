Story_ID: 660986
Speaker 1: Well I'm going to ask about your family history now.  Your--I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Beulah, B-E-U-L-A-H, Williams [Beulah Marshall Williams], W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Marshall.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is March 21st--March 24th, 1921.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in I believe, because there are different versions my mother's given me.  She was either born in Alabama or she was born in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay, so does she have relatives in both places?
Speaker 2: We have relatives--most of the relatives are gone.  Many of them moved to New York, but most of her life was spent in Pennsylvania in the area called Filbert.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that near Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, it's a mining town outside of Uniontown [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And is the origin of the family, I mean as far back as it can go, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, on her side I believe, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, and are there any stories that are handed down through the family about the ancestors on your mother's side, what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Well the, not so many stories other than it, I felt that her family moved around quite a bit to land in Pennsylvania because my granddad [Mack Marshall] was a coal miner and she's indicated to me that they went to Virginia for a bit, but conditions were so rough there that they moved to Pennsylvania, and so I didn't get a clear marker on actual, the actual trail of the Marshall side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so her, her father was a coal miner--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in, near, in this town of Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Filbert?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your mother talk about what it was like growing up there?
Speaker 2: Yes she did.  She said it was very segregated, Dutch Catholic and my grandfather as a coal miner was a very quiet man.  I remember he raised of course, the vegetables that were on the table and we had one pig that I remember was a huge pig.  I guess it was a hog, right.  And my grandfather went to the store one day, got some cigarettes, a white man wanted his cigarettes and he said, "No," and my grandfather was shot in the head dead.
Speaker 1: Really, over a cigarette?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This was in Filbert, Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Gee.  How old was your mother when that happened?
Speaker 2: Well my mother must have been in her--she was, she was no longer living in Pennsylvania.  I was born at, you know, by that time, so I would guess she was maybe in her thirties.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was after you were born?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: All right, but this was--
Speaker 2: So that gives you an idea of the kind of area it was even post slavery, that blacks were living in one section of the town, whites were in another and you know, violence still occurred.
Speaker 1: Yeah and interaction over something so simple could end up in your grandfather losing his life.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now what was--is there a story about what happened to the person who shot him?
Speaker 2: Nothing was done.  I mean there is really no story to say.  It was just such a tragedy and the whole community surrounded my grandmother, Nellie [Nellie Marshall], around that.
Speaker 1: And that's a terrible story.  But, so this is, yeah, so did your mother talk about when she actually left Filbert?
Speaker 2: Yes, she mentioned that one of her cousins moved to New York, Brooklyn, came to Brooklyn and told her she should come up and it was a better life in Brooklyn and so my mother came to Brooklyn and she did part time day work. That's a euphemism for she was maids in, in various individuals' homes.  She went to a party at someone's house and she loved to dance and that's how she met my dad [Elliott Williams].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now I'm going to go to his side.  Oh, did your mother have a chance to finish school in Filbert?
Speaker 2: Yes, she finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She finished high school.  She had a number of awards for penmanship and she was an avid reader.
Story_ID: 660987
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm going to go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Elliott Willi- Elliott Williams and E-L-L-I-O-T-T, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is August 23, 1924 also.  Twenty, I think, I actually think he was '21 [1921].
Speaker 1: Twenty-one [1921], yeah, you said--
Speaker 2: Yeah '21 [1921].
Speaker 1: --you said your mother [Beulah Marshall Williams] was '24 [1924].
Speaker 2: Right, '21 [1921].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twenty-one [1921], yeah--
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-one [1921].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in, in Warrenton, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now once again like, what are the stories associated with your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and then--?
Speaker 2: Just to my grandparents and again my grandparents also did a great deal of farming.  My grandmother was also a maid and a nurse and my granddad worked in the fields in, for a number of families in Warrenton.
Speaker 1: Okay so he was like a hired (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --farm helper--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or laborer.
Speaker 2: Laborer.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: And my dad did not finish high school.  My dad I believe went to sixth grade because he was needed to work.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did, did your dad talk about what it was like growing up in Warrenton?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Dad really was sort of the light of my life.  He was very carefree and he just said he had good friends.  They worked hard.  He knew needed to go back to school and he felt that the [U.S.] military would be very helpful so as soon as he could he joined the military.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is World War II [WWII] generation?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He would have been, yeah he'd have been right, right there.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: In the World War II group.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so did, did he serve overseas?
Speaker 2: Yes he did and he was a sergeant cook status.
Speaker 1: Sergeant?
Speaker 2: He was, he was a cook.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was a mess sergeant?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, so he would--where did he, did he serve in Germany, France or in the Pacific, or--?
Speaker 2: He was in Germany 'cause actually I, he was able to pick up German because I remember as I was growing up he would say things to me in German and so would my mother and they worked for Jewish families when they were in New York [New York] and so, so much of my knowledge of the Jewish heritage came from, from both of them having that Germanic background in terms of the war and the people they worked for.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so did the Jewish family have--were they from Germany?
Speaker 2: Right, they were, yes, yeah, Holocaust survivors, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so did your father get a chance to go to school on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]?
Speaker 2: He went to school, went to night school and I believe it was Edison [Edison School] in New York [Brooklyn, New York].  He was just a, a naturally smart man.  He was able to pass the civil service exams and he first became a, a driver for the trolleys and then graduated to the subway system motorman.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That is what they would call in those days a good job, right?  He was working for the subway system.
Speaker 2: Excellent job, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he's got benefits (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The American transit unit- union [Amalgamated Transit Union]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in New York, you couldn't beat 'em.
Story_ID: 660988
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, what they looked like, what they walked and talked like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well I was definitely a daddy's girl, so I would like to think of myself taking after my father [Elliott Williams].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and what are the traits that you have that your father had?
Speaker 2: He had, my father had a sense of humor, a sense of purpose, kindness.  He was always community service oriented.  He was the one that took me to church every Sunday, to Concord Baptist Church [Brooklyn, New York] and had me in the choir.  He, he was the kind of guy that was a mentor to other children in the community, so you know, those were the kinds of traits that he had and for me it's a interesting bit of the parallelism.  I lost my granddad [Mack Marshall] on my mother's side so tragically.  I also lost my dad in the same way.
Speaker 1: What happened to your father?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in a very crime ridden community and after I married and moved to Seattle [Washington] I got a call and found out that my father was stabbed to death in our home that I grew up in in Brooklyn [New York].  And again we don't know who the assailants were or what the conditions were.  There was very little follow up.
Speaker 1: Was there a home invasion or something?  Did somebody like break in?
Speaker 2: Well--we believe, we don't know.  There was, and given his personality he had to open the door to someone, right? But I don't, I don't, we don't know, we don't know, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's, that's really something.  So, how old were you when your father was killed?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you'd all, he had raised you already?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  But it's, there's never a right time, yeah.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's, that's tragic.  Now, what, what, what was your mother [Beulah Marshall Williams] like?
Speaker 2: My mother was a disciplinarian for me and she was very much interested in my becoming my best self and so she really encouraged me academically.  She gave me piano lessons.  She gave me ballet lessons.  My dad tried to give me voice lessons and the voice teacher gave him his money back after he heard my voice and so in that context, I, I attribute so much to my mother who was very stern with me.  I was not a spoiled child in the sense of the formal word of spoiled.  My mother didn't allow it.
Speaker 1: How was your--the hours that your father worked did, did, did they allow him to be home when, when you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He worked in the evening primarily.  At one point he worked two jobs and one at, at White Castle and the other with the transit.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is something so--
Speaker 2: I think he, he was remarkable given his accomplishments with so little educational background.
Speaker 1: Okay and then having--so many men in that generation worked two jobs even though they, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --just--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --amazing.
Speaker 2: And you know he, I, I believe he was a striver because he wanted his own home so we had our own home.  We had a three family house and he worked hard to buy the house next door, another three family house, so it, he did, he did well for the family.  We weren't rich, but he made sure that he was home for me, I remember him braiding my hair in order to go to elementary school [P.S. 144, Brooklyn, New York].  I remember him coming to school to talk to the teachers about my progress or behavior problems that I might have had.  So, he was definitely the nurturer in terms of the relationship of, of what I call my soul of enjoyment in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: None, okay, so you're the only--only child (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, I'm the only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm one of those.
Story_ID: 660989
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Can you describe your neighborhood for us and, and, 'cause you grew up in Brooklyn [New York], right? And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we started out on, on Marcy--Green Avenue in Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] and that's when my parents [Beulah Marshall Williams and Elliott Williams] were renting and I remember as a little girl going to the stove and seeing some funny little thing, little wiggle around the stove and I reached up and it was a rodent's tail.  So that's my consistent memory of Bed-Stuy.  When we moved to Brownsville [Brooklyn, New York] the memory there was, it was at that time a Jewish heritage, African American block and in the first three or four years.  And in about the fifth and sixth year it became more black and so that was on Bergen [Street] and then when you went around the corner on Saratoga [Avenue] that was the Puerto Rican area and so I heard Spanish and my elementary school [P.S. 144, Brooklyn, New York] early on was predominantly Jewish with some African American kids.  By junior high school [J.H.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School; P.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School, Brooklyn, New York] it was African American youngsters and Puerto Rican youngsters with only Jewish kids in the honors classes, so, so that was my world you know, in terms of school.  I was always studying.  My Saturdays were at libraries and or lessons from the church organist for piano and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Now what, what was the major street through Brownsville, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Let's see, so every street in Brooklyn is a major street because of density populations.  I have to laugh at that question.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right I--
Speaker 2: The A train (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I'm an outsider.
Speaker 2: --would stop at Ralph Avenue, right, and then you would walk up Ralph to, to Bergen and then if you went down maybe four or five more blocks you were at Eastern Parkway.  Most people know Eastern Parkway as the major on one side, and where the train station was was Fulton Street.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fulton I've heard a lot about, Fulton Street (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, so, so I was between Fulton and Eastern Parkway to give you that grid.
Story_ID: 660990
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So what was your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school was P.S. 144 [Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: 144, okay and now I assume you liked school?
Speaker 2: I loved school, loved it.  I had great teachers.  I was fortunate enough to be in honors, you know classes and, and, and you know skipping through grades a bit, right.  I wound up in the principal's office in, in elementary school because of, of taunting and my dad [Elliott Williams] taught me how to box so if anybody wanted to mess with me I would beat them up.
Speaker 1: Now, now this is--being in honors classes presented a dilemma for you, right from what I've read (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --because other black children, there, there were hardly any black children (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right--
Speaker 1: --in honors classes?
Speaker 2: --right, right, yes.
Speaker 1: And because you were in them you were considered somehow a betrayer of the black community by being (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the honors classes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then the white kids in the class saw you as some kind of interloper?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So it was, it was, it, it was a lonely existence a bit because I think I was sheltered quite a bit in that I would go to school, come home, study, go to school, so I didn't do very much extracurriculary until I went to junior high school [J.H.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School; P.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School, Brooklyn, New York] and then that changed.  But elementary school was quite a challenge in the sense that I could do the work but socially I, I didn't have very many friends at all.
Story_ID: 660991
Speaker 1: Now did your parents [Beulah Marshall Williams and Elliott Williams] keep up with popular culture, you know, like current songs on the radio and TV and that sort of thing, movies and--?
Speaker 2: We watched TV, yes, but I didn't have a TV until very late.  I, we didn't have a TV, when I say very late, probably not until junior high school [J.H.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School; P.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School, Brooklyn, New York].  And we you know, didn't have a car, so I was primarily in the books, literally in terms of, and, and for recreation I, there was a ice, not ice, a roller skating rink on Eastern Parkway, I don't remember the name of, I would go there.  And then I would go to movies once and awhile.  But I was a loner kid.  I was actually a loner kid.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have many friends that would come over or anything?
Speaker 2: Primarily my friendships were at church [Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn, New York], you know the choir, but we didn't do anything on weekends together with some of my choir friends.
Story_ID: 660992
Speaker 1: Okay, now you attended the great Concord Bapt- Baptist Church [Concord Baptist Church] in Brooklyn [New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes I did.  Yes I did.
Speaker 1: This is the biggest in terms of population Baptist Church--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --in the country--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with and the--the pastor was, and I will, we can say it, the great [HistoryMaker] Reverend Gardner Taylor, Dr. Gardner Taylor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Yes.
Speaker 1: --who was the first person I interviewed for The HistoryMakers.  Tell us about Concord?
Speaker 2: Concord is just a miracle in Brooklyn.  It was the place where I saw thousands of black people all dressed up, all looking very distinguished.  The choirs were probably similar to the Mormon Tabernacle [Mormon Tabernacle Choir].  They were just like huge choirs.  The church structurally was very large.  The minister I thought was like 6'7" because of the majesty, of his robes, his vocabulary.  I had an occasion as an adult to entertain him in our home and I told Reverend Taylor this: the reason I did so well on the SATs, scholastic achievement tests on the verbal side was because of him.  His vocabulary was so extensive that every Sunday I went home to look in the dictionary to find one of the words he used in his sermon.  And he, he was just, he was a role model for me in the sense that he showed that we could be powerful.  We, we could be nerdy and respected and biblical and kind and my dad [Elliott Williams] was friends with all the deacons 'cause my dad was a Mason and matter of fact, he became the head of the Carthaginian Lodge there [Carthaginian Lodge, No. 47, Free and Accepted Masons, Brooklyn, New York].  I saw a whole sense of brother and sisterhood on, within the church and my piano teacher was Mrs. Henry [ph.] and she was about 4'2" and in terms of her stature, but in terms of her depth of patience my goodness, she was so patient with all of us, with our mistakes with piano and she introduced me to the world of recitals.  They actually, she actually rented the recital hall at Carnegie [Carnegie Hall, New York, New York] for her kids to come and play and you know, just being reflective of, of the door that she opened to the possibilities; so the church became my community in essence and between church and the academics it was--I had quite a rich life within our African American community.
Story_ID: 660993
Speaker 1: So you started school [at P.S. 144, Brooklyn, New York], what about 1950 I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would be about right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. And--
Speaker 2: I don't go--I don't think of the dates that far back because it just boggles my mind (laughter).
Speaker 1: And high, high school starts around '52 [1952], '54 [1954], '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Let's see '60 [1960] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifty-six [1956], yeah, '56 [1956]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would be about right, yeah.  And so there's a story about the high school that for me--but we skipped junior high school because junior high school there was also a very important intersection for me. Junior High School 178 [J.H.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School; P.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School, Brooklyn, New York] was for me--I don't remember who was principal there, but we had [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee and [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis come to our class and they spoke to us about the stage, Civil Rights Movement and they also provided tickets for plays to the class, free tickets that was my entree to Broadway, to downtown.  The other person that came to my school was Leonard Bernstein and Leonard Bernstein at that time was quite controversial because he had a party and invited the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].  And Leonard Bernstein came and he too provided tickets to the symphony 'cause that's when he was doing the youth symphony program on TV and whatever.  As a consequence of his visit I picked up the clarinet and I started playing the clarinet and then I competed for and got to the all city band as a second clarinetist.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was in junior high school?
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, CBS would televise Leonard Bernstein's 'Young People's Concerts.'
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.
Speaker 1: And they would be on periodically then he became like a celebrity, you know I guess, celebrity I guess doorkeeper for classical music for a lot of people.
Speaker 2: That's right.  So because of Ruby Davis, Ruby and Ossie Davis I was able to see just about every important play on Broadway free.
Speaker 1: Now what did you see? What did you see (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh let's see, 'Stop The World' ['Stop the World - I Want to Get Off,' Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley], all of the, all of the Joel Grey's plays.  Of course I saw 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry], of course 'A Day's Absence' [sic.], I saw (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: 'A Day of Absence' [sic. 'Day of Absence'] by [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I saw all the plays Cicely Tyson appeared in.
Speaker 1: So you saw the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC] plays?
Speaker 2: That's it, all of that.  I would go into the city see the play, come home, my dad [Elliott Williams] would meet me at the train station because I was traveling at night to guide me home so the, the, the predators within the community couldn't get to me.
Story_ID: 660994
Speaker 1: That sounds just wonderful, it really does (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was, you know, and I--you can see I'm almost tearing up now.  So that principal I have to, I, I have to think back 'cause how did that happen?  And it had to happen 'cause the administration within that school that would, would have been called the ghetto school reached out and those three people walked in and just changed the course of--I'm sure there are many people like me from Junior High School 178 [J.H.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School; P.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School, Brooklyn, New York] that took full advantage of having free tickets, having the access and just sitting, you know, sitting in the theater and now that I think about it it's so weird you know, for a junior high school person to be in the theater by herself just seeing the plays and getting up and getting on the A train and getting back into Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: So nobody went with you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: None, none of the other students wanted to go?
Speaker 2: No, no, well because there was segregation within the classroom they might have gone, I don't know, but there were only two African Americans, Andrea [ph.], Andrea, I've forgotten Andrea's last name unfortunately and I in the class, so--
Speaker 1: For, for that advanced group.
Speaker 2: Right, right, but for Ruby Davis [HistoryMaker Ruby Dee] and Ossie [HistoryMaker Ossie Davis] that was an auditorium lecture they provided and I'm not so sure, I don't know who took advantage of it, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's one of those things where because of the nature of my personality I didn't interact that much, so you know, I didn't, I didn't know who, who went or didn't go.  But I know that Andrea and I went, she and I went to a number of the symphony programs because she took up the oboe and the French horn and that's how we became friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.
Speaker 2: But she moved out of the neighborhood though, but, so it was--my dad [Elliott Williams] that's why I say you know, he's such a hero to me.  He just made sure that I had safe passage especially for those shows that were not matinee that I attended yeah.  And then from there I, I took my form of study at the what we called the Grand Army Plaza library [Central Library, Brooklyn, New York] in Eastern Parkway and I would go into the city to the New York Public Library [53rd Street Library] across, across from the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] and sometimes the 42nd Street Library [Mid-Manhattan Library, New York, New York], so I was atypical and my world became much greater than my block boarded by Ralph [Avenue] and, and Saratoga [Avenue].  So when you ask me what were the sights and smells I, I would say you know, I, I was able to, to see a broader world and to see some of the great people, especially those individuals that looked like me on stage and that, that stayed with me all of my life actually.
Story_ID: 660995
Speaker 1: There was some subterfuge in terms of how you got into high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, well you know my, back to my father [Elliott Williams] he decided that he wanted me to attend the best high school in the city and one wonderful thing about the Masons, they were definitely brothers.  And so one of the Masons and I don't remember his name which is unfortunate, but I remember 89 Rutland Road because he was one of the first African Americans to pierce the, the veil of racism living in Flatbush [Brooklyn, New York].  And you needed, in order to go to Erasmus [Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn, New York], you had to have a Flatbush address and my address was 89 Rutland Road and the, the Masonic brother to my dad says, "Now she can't cause any trouble in high school. She has to go to all of her classes because we're not going to be available to come to school or do anything for your daughter."  So about two buses, yeah, two buses and twelve blocks every morning because I was--Erasmus is the largest high school in America.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we were in three buildings and to give you an idea of the, our graduating class, my graduating class, was between five hundred and seven hundred students.  So we were on shifts at Erasmus Hall and I was on the early shift.  So that meant I had to be out of the house and had to get the six o'clock a.m. bus and really get to school and then stay, do my course work, get back on the bus, come home, so I didn't have the extracurricular time that I would have liked because I definitely wasn't going to make any waves, right.  And that was where I really encountered or I was aware of my countenance, of racism and, and privilege and all of its ugly manifestations.  I was put in you know, the honors program went to my English class, walked in, the room was full, everybody had a chair and my English teacher like came in and said, "You're in the wrong room." You know in those days everything was in print you know, it wasn't typed or anything.  I just, you know, "I'm supposed to be in this class," and she said, "Let me see your papers." You know, I looked at her, showed her my papers.  She says, "Well, there are, you know, no chairs here. What, what are you going to do?"  I said, "Well I'm sure that I can get a chair from another room."  I went to another room and brought my chair into the room and sat down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how, how did things progress from there?
Speaker 2: Well, it progressed well. I received A's, I mean it was a lot of studying.  I, it was one of those things where you know, and, and we, we coexisted you know what I mean; in terms I did my homework.  I did my studying.  And this is where the sort of the social merger of, of Jewish friendship to black friendship emerged for me in the sense there were a number of kids in that class that were gassed at what happened.  They went out of their way to befriend.  And they wanted to befriend me after hours, but guess what, they couldn't do it because I had to go home and et cetera.  So, who was in my class, Bettina Aptheker?  Her dad was a Communist if you remember.
Speaker 1: Dr. Herbert Aptheker.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Author of 'American Negro Slave Revolts' and other books.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: So she was one of my classmates and she and I, I forgot the guy's name, was it Mario--started the Free Speech Movement in California.
Speaker 1: Mario Savio, yeah--
Speaker 2: Savio, right.  So, you know Erasmus was you know, comparatively speaking a very liberal school, you know he brought chess champions.  We had Barbra Streisand.  We had basketball players that were just the tops in the state.  So you know, we were a large institution.  We were a liberal institution, so from that standpoint, being an intellectual at Erasmus was like the insane (laughter).  We were (unclear), but it, it's funny when I, I talk to my friends who are African American, they talk about proms and dances and all of that and, and unfortunately no prom, no dances, you know, wasn't, that wasn't Constance [HistoryMaker Constance W. Rice].  That wasn't in my frame, but you talk about books and plays and music and dance and, that was in my frame.
Story_ID: 660996
Speaker 1: Wow.  That's sounds a really like a, quite an experience.  Now this is--you're in high school [Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn, New York] from nineteen fifty- is it?
Speaker 2: I think I graduated in '60 [1960], so then go back four years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '56 [1956] to '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  This is a time period when a lot of culture is changing in the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Freedom Riders, SNCC, you know, et cetera I went to a, a party and by this, this time I'm in college [Queens College, Queens, New York] and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was there and--cause he went to Catholic school, 'cause everybody knew him because he was tall, very tall, was very skinny (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wasn't there a Power Memorial [Power Memorial Academy, New York, New York] he went to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.  And then I went to one SNCC meeting.  Again, one of my Jewish friends, friend of a friend, matter of fact the only date I had was a guy named Builder Levy, he was a freshman at Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] and he took me to a SNCC meeting (laughter).  We're just--are ironic actually in so many ways.  Yeah, he took me to a SNCC meeting and I, I heard Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] speak and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: This is in, this, this would have been would just before Stokely goes into or just (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was still at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  He was still at Howard.
Speaker 1: He was still at Howard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was at Howard and stuff.  He was like an old person for us that were in the room as a, you know, "This guy is an older guy, you know. I think he's--I think he's in college."  Builder says, "Well I'm in college." I said, "Well but you're not old.  He is."  You know, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 660997
Speaker 1: All right, so, so, you graduated from Erasmus [Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn, New York] in 1960?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you had been pushed ahead a couple of years?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So I was at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right, so you were young--
Speaker 2: Right, so--
Speaker 1: --graduating.
Speaker 2: --this is where my mother [Beulah Marshall Williams] and I parted ways.  I lied to my mother and told her the only college I can get into is Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And so, she was upset. Dad [Elliott Williams] was upset and, and they said, "Well that's a party school."  I said, "No it isn't.  It's an African American institution [HBCU]."  She said, "Well, we're not sending our sixteen year old daughter there."  I said, "Well, you know, you don't really have a choice," you know.  "I want to go to college and that's where I'm going."  So, I went to college my freshman year and fell down--how out of sync I was 'cause I had two other roommates who were definitely a lot more sophisticated than I was and (laughter) and it was sort of funny, but in any event, the--my one friend from Erasmus, Marilyn Skelton [ph.], also went to Howard and we decided at the end of my freshman year that we would get an apartment together and I--one of the practices that my parents had for me is I went to Pennsylvania alternating summers and North Carolina, so I was in North Carolina with Grandmother Williams and I get a call from Marilyn saying that she found an apartment but they needed to have proof that I was a matriculated student at Howard and Marilyn said, "You're not enrolled to go to Howard next year. You dropped out."  I said, "What?"  And she says, "There's no record of you being admitted for your sophomore year."  So I said, "It can't be."  I called home and I said, "Mother, what's, what's going on," you know, "I sent in all the forms and everything." And she says, "Oh, you're not going to Howard. You're going to Queens College in Flushing, New York [Flushing, Queens, New York]."  Well.
Speaker 1: So they pulled the plug on Howard?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: Was there any, did you have any idea why, did something happen that alarmed them, or--?
Speaker 2: No idea, no notice, nothing, nothing.
Speaker 1: Now do you have any memories of Howard? I mean, was, was Howard a good place for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.
Speaker 1: And who were some of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I loved it.
Speaker 1: --the professors that--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had Professor Clarke.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, this is John Henrik Clarke?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, 'From Here to Slavery' [sic.]. I had--so that's a memory.  I went to the theater and listened to [HistoryMaker] Howard Dodson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, the dean of students was Patricia Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris], yeah.  So what's not to like, you know.  The chemistry was hard.  I remember chemistry was hard.  I forgot my professor's name there.  But I was like you know, trailing a D and I had never had a D in my life.  And, and I went to him and said like, "What can I do?  Can I do extra credit," et cetera, et cetera?  And he said, "Yes, you need to do extra credit."  I, I got a C. I got--barely got out of chemistry alive, you know that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 660998
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what were your aspirations when you--?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a, a doctor at time and then when I went to Queens College, I wanted to become a medical anthropologist because I had Hortense Powdermaker.  And Margaret Mead came on occasion to speak to the class, so I had two famous women anthropologists and I was very interested in the intersection, I guess now you call it you know, the naturopathic medicine of healing that was occurring in indigenous societies and tracing that for healing so that was like no one when they hear you say--what do you want to be a medical anthropologist?  I'd say medical anthropologist they didn't know what I was talking about, so you know.  They knew what anthropology meant but not medical, so, so very early on--so my degree from Queens was in anthropology sociology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Queens College, this is in Queens [New York] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Flushing, Flushing, New York, yeah--
Speaker 1: Flushing, New York--
Speaker 2: --yeah, Flushing, Queens, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Flushing, Queens and, so this was--were you staying at home or you were staying on the campus?
Speaker 2: I was, oh, it's, it's a community campus.  I was staying at home and part of my penance that my mother [Beulah Marshall Williams] had to do for me, she had to drive me to school everyday.
Speaker 1: All right, do you think they, they just really just couldn't let go of you or what when you think about it?  You seemed to have had very doting parents who really were concerned about you and they only had you to focus on and--
Speaker 2: Well I don't know what, it wasn't, no one was ill.  I, I, and money was no object here because I was you know, full scholarship.  The reason she was able to transfer me to a City University [City University of New York, New York, New York], I was a Regents scholar you know, I had the Regents money from New York State.  Only thing--I didn't have to worry about books or tuition.
Speaker 1: Yeah an honor student in New York State gets something called a Regents scholarship and I've heard this before.
Speaker 2: Right, so--
Speaker 1: You don't have to pay anything, right?
Speaker 2: Right, tuition free you know, so I, I had--and I wasn't a spendthrift you know, there were things like food, but the, you know, we had a meal plan.  I didn't, I wasn't a showy dresser or anything like that.  So I, I don't know, I don't know and it, it, it chilled, it, it really, there is a permafrost still there between my mother and I over that.  And she's never really fessed up to exactly what was in her mind, but my mother did it and my dad [Elliott Williams] pretty much said we'll live with it, you know, it's not--so I, that's, that's one of my biggest regrets of not being able to finish Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 660999
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there any--now you're, you're going to Queens College [Queens, New York] with a very keen mind (unclear) .  You talked about Powdermaker [Hortense Powdermaker] there and Margaret Mead coming in--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --were there any other personalities there that you were attracted to?
Speaker 2: No we, we had no faculty of color, none, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was the student body population like?
Speaker 2: It was 99 percent white, yeah, in the daytime.  At night, I had a couple of night classes, saw more of us, but it was a good educational experience for me.  It was rigorous, but it was, yeah, I say Queens College, it's not like others that might have graduated from undergraduate school that were into the colors and all that you know. It's like, it was, it was a place to learn and to grow.
Speaker 1: Now, did you play any music there?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: I know that Queens College has (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they house the papers of Louis Armstrong and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and [HistoryMaker] Jimmy Heath within his--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --last year--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --his material is there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he interacts with the students.
Speaker 2: This was all post, you know--I was the, the earlier wave of frankly integrating City University institutions [City University of New York, New York, New York] and if you really pour over the Queens College environment you would not see too much African American representation in anyway, so, yeah, it was, that was.  And, and, but interesting enough the Freedom Rider that was murdered [Andrew Goodman] was in Queens College, right?  And, but there was still back to that, there was still that liberalness of activism but, because of the nature of my personality and where I was, I wasn't in that world and I think hence that when I graduated that, that part of my rebellion all over again was, I went to the Urban League [National Urban League] first to get a job and I got the job, so that was my first job out of college was the Urban League--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with Whitney Young.  I wanted to be in it, right, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you graduated from Queens College in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 661000
Speaker 1: Right and but did you follow--now did you go to the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't. I had to stay, I had to stay back, yeah.  But I did all of the Urban League [National Urban League], not all, I did quite a bit of the Urban League work 'cause of Ted Cobb and because of Whitney [Whitney Young] and because of Bayard [Bayard Rustin] and A. Philip Randolph and you know these are men that you know I sat and I listened to, you know, I didn't do anything that--I was an administrative assistant you know, that kind of thing, but it's right here (gesture), you know, so I felt as if I, the, once I got promoted to interim assistant director I wrote the grant for open housing in the United States and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About what year is this?
Speaker 2: This is still '60 [1960], '67 [1967] because I came to Seattle [Washington] January 21st, 1967 and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before we leave New York [New York], I wanted to ask you about--I know the--were you there when they had the, were you living in Brownsville [Brooklyn, New York] when they had the school strike, Ocean Hill-Brownsville [Ocean Hill-Brownsville Experimental School District] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --with Les Campbell [Leslie R. Campbell] and--?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  As a matter of fact, the, by that time the schools had merged and they became, my Junior High School 178 [J.H.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School; P.S. 178, St. Clair McKelway School, Brooklyn, New York] became part of the Ocean Hill and so, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, that was the beginning of--
Speaker 2: --and that's when the parents, that's when the community, it was just wonderful, but you know, as I indicated 178, it was a school of blacks and browns and you know in my case I obviously got a fabulous education, but that was not true in the entire school, right.  So, and I forgot to indicate this, my mother [Beulah Marshall Williams] took a job as a school crossing guard at Junior High School 178 and I'm sure she did it because of a protective factor, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So it was, so in junior high school my mother was the crossing guard.  I never had to cross at her street.  I had to cross at a different street, but she was one of the crossing guards.
Speaker 1: But she knew what was happening out there?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Story_ID: 661001
Speaker 1: So, so when you graduated [from Queens College, Queens, New York] in 1966 you went to the Urban League to begin work.  Did, did you know anybody there already at the Urban League (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I went in and just did, it was just a wonderful life. Met some wonderful people, you know Puryear you mentioned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Mahlon Puryear [HistoryMaker Mahlon T. Puryear], yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, Whitney Young was very accessible.  That's what just really always blew my mind you know.  He would say hello, you would see him in the hallways, on the elevator.  They had moved to Liberty building [ph.] and so United Negro College Fund [UNCF] was on, in the same building and Vernon Young [sic.] was, I mean Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] was then, I think he was the CEO there.  He was an executive there I know that for sure and he would get on the elevator and all the women would just melt, but it was just a wonderful, wonderful time.
Speaker 1: Now is this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was still living at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is the, the office of the National Urban League, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a local (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it, we were the big kahunas, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: We were the big kahunas.
Speaker 1: We--that's why the contact was such with the other national civil rights leaders and A. Philip Randolph, I tell you, great, tall person.  I didn't, you know I--you'd see him on TV and see him in person and just elegant.  His suits looked like they were you know, just made just for him.  He was always pretty dapper.  And Bayard wasn't (laughter).
Speaker 2: Bayard Rustin?
Speaker 1: No he wasn't as dapper, no.
Speaker 2: I remember he had the, the, the beginnings of the, one of the first Afros that I'd ever seen.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: He just didn't cut his hair (unclear).
Speaker 1: He, he had that, a shorter version of the promoter Don, Don King is it, the boxing promoter.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But just a brilliant mind.  I mean it--going back to Reverend Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor], you know, peers, Bayard, and Reverend Taylor, the, the, the breadth and scope of their humanistic knowledge of world philosophies.  We aren't, we aren't just talking about someone in the United States writing something.  They would be able to take Socrates and bring it back to you, you know.  It was just, and normal conversation, it wasn't in a polemic way, it was just, that's just the way he rolled.  It was, it was very interesting sitting and listening to him.
Speaker 2: But they, they must have been thrilled to get you, you know, someone who obviously has an intellectual kind of a bent to be the secretary at the Urban League?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I bet they were really excited about it.
Speaker 1: Ted Cobb was, yeah, he thought I was very straight lace though.  He'd say, "You're just an old lady here, you need to loosen up," you know, something like that.  "Do you go out at all?"  "No, Mr. Cobb," I would say no Mr. Cobb.  He'd say, "Oh, we've got to find somebody for you to go out with."  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous Now, now you did--
Speaker 1: --it was a family.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: --you did start dating around this time, right?
Speaker 1: Well, the, the short answer is not enough (laughter).  I, the, let's see, the one guy I dated was the, was the one guy I dated and married and it was wrong for both of us.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: --your first husband was a Nigerian national, right?
Speaker 1: Right, well, no, he was an American citizen--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but yeah.
Speaker 2: So he was born in America?
Speaker 1: And he was quite a bit older.  He was an engineer already--
Speaker 2: Okay, so was he--
Speaker 1: --and he attended Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: --naturalized or was, was he actually born in the United States or was he a naturalized?
Speaker 1: I believe he was naturalized, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay and he was a Howard student?
Speaker 1: Right, he yeah, he, civil engineer and that's why he was recruited to Boeing [The Boeing Company] in Seattle [Washington], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Very smart man, very smart, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he very, I mean was Nigerian?
Speaker 1: He was Igbo and the marriage was during the, for us, was during the Biafra war.  So that was really you know quite a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's during the Nigerian Civil War--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --where the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Yoruba and the Igbo, right--
Speaker 2: --the Igbo, who was an organization decided to break away from the rest of the country--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and not all Igbos were in, in favor of--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --some, a substantial group was and under general, oh I can't think of his name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--
Speaker 2: --but they did.
Speaker 1: So it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It didn't work though?
Speaker 1: No, it was like, you, you know saw the pictures of the babies you know--
Speaker 2: Starving--
Speaker 1: --starving and I was giving quite a bit of, of whatever income I had, it became my income when abroad, and so that, that really wore on me.
Speaker 2: So he had a lot of relatives and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --and suffering.
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah, so harsh.  It was harsh period in Nigeria.
Speaker 2: So he was recruited to Boeing out in Seattle, right?
Speaker 1: Well he was a New York transit engineer and I guess he applied for a job with Boeing and got recruited and we were brought to Seattle--
Story_ID: 661002
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you said you asked Reverend Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] about Seattle [Washington] 'cause you were concerned, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well you know there was a mythology that Seattle was really Alaska and so it was very cold and, and there were no black people that lived here you know, not quite wolves running the streets, but you know, just very you know, nothing not even a TV oriented program.  It, it was really bad and no one, no one recommended coming to Seattle and I had occasion to ask Whitney Young about that because I was on my way up the ladder there at the league [National Urban League] and I was really quite upset to have to relocate myself to come out to Seattle and so when I talked to my pastor, Gardner Taylor, he told me where I should go for church and that was Reverend Samuel Berry McKinney's Mount Zion [Mount Zion Baptist Church, Seattle, Washington] and Whitney Young told me go see Ed Pratt [Edwin T. Pratt] for a job because you wrote that proposal and we got that Ford money [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] because of that proposal we wrote, so he has a job for you there.  And so I knew I had a church family and I knew I had a job.  Once I got here I had the church family but I didn't have the job, so.
Story_ID: 661003
Speaker 1: All right, so Seattle [Washington] this is 1967, right? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right and so when I got to Seattle I fully expected to become the director of their, the Seattle Urban League's department of open housing [Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle Housing Department, Seattle, Washington].  Seattle at the time was segregated.  You couldn't live north of the ship canal and the, the program that was funded by Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York] allowed Seattle to hire an executive director and to organize a group of, of, of liberal open minded white people to go and check on housing for, for folks that were willing to sell to African Americans that was A; and to also check on housing to find out if anyone was discriminating against anyone who wanted to rent or own because concomitant with activity the open housing program the Urban League and other, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] got a law on the books against discrimination against black people, so there would be a fine et cetera.  So, the league was able to monitor that as well as open doors for black folks that had enough money to move to north of the ship canal housing, to buy houses, et cetera.  And so that was the job that I thought I was going to get and when I got here they'd already hired somebody and I think I interpreted this as the African American network within Seattle.  And I say it's a male network because Ed [Edwin T. Pratt] was sorry about the fact that he, he didn't have a job and he felt beholden to me because I had all the right credentials from Whitney Young and others.  He sent me over to Walt Hundley [Walter R. Hundley] and Walt Hundley was the genius of our community action program called Central Area Motivation Program [Centerstone] and he was the executive director and I went to Walt and Walt said, "Well, sorry young lady I don't have a job for you either, but let's get you a state job."  So he sent me to employment security [Washington Employment Security Department] and I received the job of youth opportunities counselor in employment security.  I was in that position for maybe three months when Walt called and he said, "You need to quit that job.  I have a job for you at CAMP as the editor of The Trumpet newspaper."  And I said, "I can't quit. I just got here."  He says--and I said, "Plus I don't have a journalistic background."  He said, "Can you read and write and talk?"  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "Well I need you."  He says, "How much are you earning with the state?" And I said, "Well, I think it's like sixteen thousand dollars."  He said, "I'll make it eighteen thousand dollars. Come to me."  I quit and I went to CAMP and that began my community organizing activism in Seattle through Walt Hundley.  And he, soon after I arrived, maybe about a year our site was firebombed here and then we moved to a fire house which was also quite interesting.  And the mayor selected Walt to head our Model Cities program.  And then I went back to school to start my master's in public administration.
Speaker 1: So about what year is this, now when you go back to school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So yeah, for me, let's see sixty--got here in '67 [1967], so '67 [1967] was when I started at CAMP and it would have been in the summer of '67 [1967] because I got here January 27th, yeah, 21st or 27th--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of 1967.
Story_ID: 661004
Speaker 1: Now tell us again, you were telling me off camera about--now this is, you--well you just said the, the office was firebombed that you were working in before (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: And then you told me before we started about Ed Pratt [Edwin T. Pratt] getting assassinated.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Well what happened, I mean who was Ed Pratt again and what happened?
Speaker 2: Ed Pratt was the head of the Seattle Urban League [Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, Seattle, Washington] and a very powerful man.  He and other religious leaders of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] formed the Central Area civil rights organization [Central Area Civil Rights Committee] and I called them at the time the black mafioso.  And, but I shouldn't say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that because of their tight connections with each other and bonds?
Speaker 2: I, well, very tight and nothing got done in this community without their advising it to happen.  I mean they would squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze to make sure doors were open to jobs; doors were open for housing.  The investigation of, of corrupt police, they were just a mighty force.  At that time we had Bishop Adams, John Adams [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams], became the national bishop of the A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal], was here.  Reverend McKinney [Samuel Berry McKinney] for the Baptist population here who brought Reverend King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] into Seattle [Washington] twice.  Walt Hundley [Walter R. Hundley] who was head of the all, just about, it was, it was the first community action program in America was CAMP, the Central Area Motivation Program.  As we go down our main thoroughfare in the Central Area [Seattle, Washington], Walt was the kind that had a department of beautification as an example.  And he planted through Mr. Massengale [ph.] hundreds of trees in the Central Area to make sure that the Central Area was beautified and that's where African Americans lived.  And today we know trees give off oxygen and they just change the whole character of your being.  So this was a collective of predominately African American men that sat and thought about the structure of not just their block, but the entire community.  And then eventually became the most powerful man for the State of Washington.  It was just an amazing group.  So I got into that because my past came from Whitney Young to Ed Pratt (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did they have--okay.
Speaker 2: Ed Pratt on, when I, since I couldn't work for the Urban League, I came onto the Urban League board and Ed Pratt got up one morning, I think it was during the Christmas holiday.
Speaker 1: Now this was before you got to Seattle?
Speaker 2: No, I was here.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was after, after you were here?
Speaker 2: Yeah after I was here, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: This was all during that hectic one year period, my first year here.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz, okay.
Speaker 2: He came to his door, opened the door and was shot and to this day they have not found any proof of who the assailant was or anything.  And you can imagine given my history, my grandfather [Rice's maternal grandfather, Mack Marshall], my father [Elliott Williams], my cynicism and just you know, just say police and black killing and I, you know, doesn't equal justice as far as I'm concerned.  So, Jerome Page was the deputy director for the Urban League, so he moved up to become the director and Jerome came to me, this will be an interesting snippet for you, and said, "Oh, I've got just the right guy to come on the board because you've insisted that we have more board members under the age of thirty-five in Urban League."  As a matter of fact, I insisted at the National Urban League and got a rule passed that all Urban Leagues had to have a percentage of individuals under thirty-five on their board because you can imagine what the boards were looking like and one of the young--that young man was [HistoryMaker] Norman Rice.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So that's my--that's part of the story.
Story_ID: 661005
Speaker 1: Okay, now y- now you didn't stay married to the Igbo engineer very long, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did? Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, yeah, yeah, it was six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To me that's long.
Speaker 1: The little bio says it was brief.  That means that we don't know.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, okay.
Speaker 1: So that's why I'm asking.
Speaker 2: Well, I like the brief aspect because you know, the, we had separations, so it was a couple of years in there, that kind of thing, so--
Speaker 1: So [HistoryMaker] Norman Rice is on the Urban League board and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --now tell us now, Norman Rice becomes the mayor of Seattle [Washington]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in 1989, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And by--so what was his status then?  He, he was an activist I understand?
Speaker 2: Well, you know Norman was definitely an activist, but they--Norman was a late bloomer in the sense that, in, in respect to you know, I, I should, I should say this--I looked at Norman and I said I'm twenty-seven, I have a doctorate de- (laughter) and he went, he went back to school at twenty-seven, you know, that kind of situation.
Speaker 1: I kind of skipped over that, but you had got, you, you achieved your doctorate [from the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington] and well, well this is, this is, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah well, after--
Speaker 1: --later on?
Speaker 2: --yeah, later on.  So, back to, you wanted to know the intersection in terms of Norman and activism.   The Urban League [Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, Seattle, Washington] during our board period together had received a grant to do blacks in the media.  There was a national analysis of the response of the media to the black experience in America, right?  And Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] was on the F- FCC [Federal Communications Commission]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah FCC (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He sure was, right.
Speaker 2: I think he was chair of the board at that time, so the local Urban League received a grant.  Jerome had Norman on the board who was working for the media at the time (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he a newscaster or something or a reporter?
Speaker 2: He was behind the scene.  He was doing film editing and things like that and, and he wasn't totally a cameraperson, in front of the camera.  So, Norman resigned from the board to become the deputy director of the Seattle Urban League under Jerome Page.  So that was the, that was the start of the activism side for my husband here in Seattle.  And so the rest is history.  He became president of the--we lived in Mount Baker [Seattle, Washington], a very active community.  He became president of the Mount Baker community center board [Mount Baker Community Club, Seattle, Washington] and then from there, you know, he became super famous and ran and won (laughter).  That's the short version. You probably have a longer version someplace.
Speaker 1: Well, I just, well, you know, you met him in, in '67 [1967] I guess, is, is that it?
Speaker 2: I met him--we were on the Urban League board together, right.  We did not quote, unquote really get together until you know '72 [1972], '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, around then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there was a gap, there was a huge gap.  I wasn't doing anything.
Story_ID: 661006
Speaker 1: Now Seattle [Washington], I mean, was going through some changes. I know we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --back in 2007 and we interviewed your husband [HistoryMaker Norman Rice].
Speaker 2: Oh Larry, right.
Speaker 1: We had [HistoryMaker] Aaron Dixon.
Speaker 2: Yes, Black Panther [Black Panther Party].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So Seattle was going through some changes.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: What, what were the, the issues, about housing and, and jobs?
Speaker 2: Housing, jobs, education, jobs especially in the construction area.  We had a lot of sit-ins.  We closed down sites at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] and elsewhere.  Tyree Scott was another really wonderful man.  Still the education--Black Panthers had a great school; that's Aaron's work.  Larry Gossett did a sit-in at the University of Washington him and several others and now he's you know, still a King County Council member.  So we, you know, it was all the haste--interesting enough, for me the gap was this was an undergraduate struggle, you know, Larry and the rest of the guys they're in undergraduate and I was in the graduate school during this period.  So, my work in graduate school was on black cities in the Pacific Northwest.  That was where, that's why I'm so fascinated by your work.  And so, I dedicated my time because we were just beginning to build black studies programs in community colleges and then trying to get into higher education and then my struggle at the time was making it mandatory for every student in, at the community college I was in at the time, Shoreline, they had to have some touch of ethnic studies in their background in order to graduate.  So that was, that was sort of my field of action and Larry and, and Larry was part of the force of opening up the University of Washington by recruiting black students and there was, his mentor was Dr. Sam Kelly [Samuel E. Kelly] who opened the doors for so many people and I don't know if you had an opportunity to meet Samuel Kelly, but he transformed higher education in our state.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is somebody that, and he, he was a professor at the University of Washington?
Speaker 2: He was, no he was vice president for the Office of Minority Affairs [Office of Minority Affairs and Diversity], the Office of Minority Affairs.  He was--
Speaker 1: At the University of Washington?
Speaker 2: --at the University of Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was vice president for minority affairs at Shoreline Community College [Shoreline, Washington] and he opened the door for me to go to Shoreline as dean of ethnic studies at Shoreline--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then he moved to the University of Washington.  He's currently deceased, but we have a number of buildings named after Sam.
Story_ID: 661007
Speaker 1: So what year did you become the chair of ethnic studies at Shoreline [Shoreline Community College, Shoreline, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Oh I would guess, let's see, it would be '70 [1970], maybe '71 [1971].  I have to really look back.  It seems so long ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, so you, you were part of the group that made the, the rules that, that graduates had to have a certain number of hours in ethnic studies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --ethnic studies to graduate, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a big fight, yes, but we did it, we did it; first community college in the state and Thomas Anderson [ph.] who was at Washington State University [Pullman, Washington] really was the guy that published our scholarship and then I was still Constance Atchewuno [HistoryMaker Constance W. Rice], yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --it was, yeah--so that was my higher education beginnings because I started as you heard here, I was editor of the newsletter [The Trumpet] that was, actually we had one of the largest circulation because we went to every household, so we went to at that time, ten thousand households.
Speaker 1: That's a, I mean that's a massive distribution.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was.
Speaker 1: What were they, were, were they mailed out, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.  We, we impacted and I, I didn't know how to drive so I had to hitchhike around the city and that really provided what I would call my grassroots connections 'cause everybody knew the crazy woman that was out on 23rd [Avenue] doing this or you know, walking around.
Speaker 1: So you would actually hitchhike with anybody who would give you a (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I thought you meant you called on people to give you a ride.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I lived in the city and yeah, I hitchhiked.  I and I think this was part of my mother [Beulah Marshall Williams]--I knew most of the crossing guards and so there were a few that were at the (unclear) for me, that would tell me, "Well, so and so use to live right over there and that's where the first candy store was in the Central Area [Seattle, Washington]," you know, snippets like that you know and you just sort of get those stories.  And I wouldn't have received them if I was just driving around the city.  It was just, it was just (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Still it would take, take a lot of courage to hitchhiking around the city.
Speaker 2: It didn't because from Brooklyn [New York], here, are you kidding me?  I felt like I was in a semi-country you know, environment, where, you know why not?  You know, most of the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it can be dangerous, I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: Well it, but I didn't, I didn't have that fear factor.  I really didn't.  It, it, the things I did were sort of like crazy stuff, so--
Speaker 1: But when you think about the murder of Ed Pratt [Edwin T. Pratt] and other, you know, some of the, the firebombing of an office (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --it's not, you know, so--
Speaker 2: But you know, it's, it's youth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know it's youth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In those days--
Speaker 2: --and you, I was in, I'm, I'm a child of the Civil Rights Movement, right, and risk taking for your people you know, there was nothing to fear really, you know and then that's the other thing, in Seattle [Washington], not really, yeah, you know, okay we got firebombed, Monday we were--the mayor of the city at the time was Braman [James D'Orma Braman] said, "Here's an empty you know, fire station.  Move in there."  That was three blocks away.  Now if I, at this stage in my life I might have been traumatized to you know, have that like there's somebody out there that's gonna possibly firebomb this place, but for some reason it, it, I think we were pulled along with just the fervor of things had to change, things were changing and there were people clear across the country changing things and I'm doing my part in my little patch.
Story_ID: 661008
Speaker 1: What was the, the most densely populated black area?  It was still the CD, right, they called or the, the Central District (simultaneous), at that time?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time, now, it's the, the struggle right now is to keep the identity, we, you know, it sort of like what's happening in Harlem [New York, New York].  Now Harlem is SoHa, NoHa you know, it's being divided up into different for north, south, central Harlem.  You know, the, the, there's, the cohesion is not there.  Here because of our booming technology, people have moved in.  When we had the first gas crisis people that were happy to live in the suburbs were coming back into the city because they wanted to be closer to their job center.  So now we have that plus the fact that the Central Area [Seattle, Washington] is where it's happening.
Speaker 1: Now, now what was, what would be the percentage of the population of, of black folks in Seattle [Washington] in those days?
Speaker 2: When, in those days?
Speaker 1: 'Cause there was no black city council members until your husband [HistoryMaker Norman Rice] ran right, in (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, that's not true.  Sam Smith [Samuel J. Smith] was our first African American city council member and George Fleming was the state representative and I think and, and our female was Peggy Maxie [Peggy Joan Maxie].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, no we, we had, that was what was so beautiful about the Central Area civil rights organization [Central Area Civil Rights Committee].  They ran people.  They had candidates, all the candidates come before them and they were graded on how well they were doing in that, with African American populations.  Yeah, they were just, you know someone should write a book about them and [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett is our informal historian. He probably will, but no, there's a, a lot more mobility in and, and interest in the migration up the ladder and integration within the fabric of the city.  Now our black population is moving south out near the airport, Kent [Washington], Burien [Washington], Federal Way [Washington].
Speaker 1: Has the percentage grown since, since those days?
Speaker 2: Yes it has.
Speaker 1: So, so, would you say like the population is now?
Speaker 2: Right now I think our population is at about I want to say 9 percent, 9 to 10 percent.  However, in the demographers now are looking, when we say black population here in Seattle, we have had a great migration of Ethiopians, Somalians, Eritreans, so we have a number of first generation Africans within the Seattle corridor and so our schools have like 128 different languages.  So it's, it's still, it's just like Harlem was in the earlier days where you had different immigrant populations rolling in and we're having the same thing here except now it's a different demographic, it's a tech demographic.  We're the home of Amazon [Amazon.com, Inc.].  We have the largest number of cranes in America here in the Seattle waist W-A-I-S-T, waist because we have a narrow (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh okay, right.
Speaker 2: --of Seattle.  So if you just go three blocks over and look up all those buildings are generally Amazon buildings with an accommodate population.  We're building a new building up the street from here, twenty-two thousand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they're expanding everywhere.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  They're looking for what they're terming a headquarters two.  And as the population comes in our black population moves out.  So that's what happening now.
Story_ID: 661009
Speaker 1: So Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation] is here as well right?
Speaker 2: Microsoft is in Redmond [Washington]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's across the bridges.  They're here in spots, but the majority of their workforce is in Redmond, which is across the bridge, the 520 Bridge [Evergreen Point Floating Bridge], Kirkland [Washington], Bellevue [Washington], Redmond.  So it's a younger population, younger population (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Boeing [The Boeing Company] is still a big job supplier?
Speaker 2: Boeing has a presence here but Boeing has moved to Chicago [Illinois], right, and also to South Carolina, the right to work areas where unions aren't as powerful and so we might have, I'm guessing we're probably down to maybe thirty thousand or so, but Boeing when we were close to a hundred [100,000] in the past.  So they, there definitely is a presence here but we've diversified since that time that I first came when the last person leaving Seattle [Washington] turned out the light, billboards were up 'cause we had lost, our economy was so bad.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 661010
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so Norman [HistoryMaker Norman Rice] was elected to--now did you help with his campaign at all, when he was (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yes I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: For--he was first a freeholder.  He ran for a charter commissioner position to revamp the city charter and I chaired his campaign for that and then for city council [Seattle City Council] for his primary, I chaired the primary.  I was campaign manager for, for his primary, but for, as he went up the ladder he got more sophisticated prose to, to be--I became just the smiling wife (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sure you're much more than that, you know much more than that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Gladly smiling carefully--you know, candidly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 661011
Speaker 1: So through--now, okay, you became the assistant executive director for the Washington Education Association too, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--I formed my own company called CWR, Incorporated [CWR, Inc.] and so I had a contract with them, so that was a contracted position.  They were trying to reorganize their communications department and they brought me in for that and that was for a year that I did that work and, and it was in Federal Way [Washington].  And I really enjoyed the people.  I enjoyed unions because it, it really speaks to my activism side and especially; and at the time we had a good number of teachers of color.  They were part of WEA.
Speaker 1: Now, I imagine your father [Elliott Williams] was part of it; well you said that earlier he was part of the transit union (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) ATU [Amalgamated Transit Union], right, yes.
Speaker 1: --in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: I have a lot of respect.
Speaker 1: Yes, you going to school with Herbert Aptheker's daughter [Bettina Aptheker] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So this is, yeah--
Speaker 2: So the, yeah, so even though I was a loner at, at earlier stages, the people I did come in contact with were definitely change agent personalities--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it, it--that resonates with me.
Story_ID: 661012
Speaker 1: Now you were the director for Western Washington University Center For Urban Studies in Seattle [sic.], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is this during the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it had to be yes, yes it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're mentioning my short term stint as really part of the consultancy effort, so--
Speaker 1: Oh with your group CW--?
Speaker 2: Right, CWR, Incorporated [CWR, Inc.] and so most of it was in education.  Later on I branched out to more public affairs work as well.  But the, yes I did that.
Speaker 1: So basically you were sort of like--
Speaker 2: And this--
Speaker 1: --public relations at CWR, which is [HistoryMaker] Constance W. Rice (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's it, that's it.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: And then it was public affairs because I was doing, and the public affairs side of it was doing the policy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in each one of these positions it was policy related.  For as an example, the Center for Urban Studies that was Fairhaven [Washington] at, out of Western Washington State University [Western Washington University] and it was an idea that college without walls of bringing and also as I said it's in Bellingham [Washington], right, I don't know if I mentioned Bellingham is close to the Canadian border and so they were very interested in doing more in urban areas the reason was that they wanted to have more black exposure for the black students to them, and vice versa.  So they had also gotten rid of--this story of my life--got rid of their former director; asked me to come and fill in for them and to help build out a program in education, liberal arts education that would be attractive to black students who had stepped out of college and worked for a period of time and wanted to come back and we would be able to use their work activity as experiential toward credits, so they could get their B.A. degree et cetera.  So the average age of a student would be about twenty-eight, twenty-nine getting their undergraduate degree.  So that was the, the concept that they asked me to build out.
Story_ID: 661013
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  Now in--oh, I should ask you about this first I guess.  Now you helped establish 101 Black Women, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a national group called the 100 Black Women [National Coalition of 100 Black Women] and a group of us got together and said, "We don't like that idea because it, it was, it sounded too exclusive, too elitist."  So we said, "Let's do 101." So that no one would ever know when we got the one, right.  And so we were lucky at the time there was a forward thinking manager at Nordstrom downtown, we're the headquarters for Nordstrom, as you probably know, who I approached and I said, "Can we use your meeting room?" Because allegedly this meeting room at the store was for the community to come and use. And he said, yes.  And it was an auditorium and it seated maybe two hundred people and so we started meeting there and what it became was a welcome wagon for African American women that came to Seattle [Washington] as well as women who lived in Seattle.  So it was a nice you know, meeting of the old with the new to make the transition a lot easier and we would have speakers come from you know, like either finance or social or library, et cetera just to have that back and forth and then after which we would have soft drinks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Was there a comparable organization for, for black men that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, no, no it was not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: There was one for the 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.] comparable to the 100 Black Women that was national but this was local.  This was 101 and as I said we wanted to knock down the barriers.  If a person would come to town and they were a part time sales clerk and another person was the chief financial officer they both had a chance to meet each other.  So that was the concept (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see what you're saying now.
Speaker 2: --right, as a concept.
Speaker 1: It was more than just for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Whereas for the 100 Black Women, you know, someone like me you know, title, background, et cetera you know, we were there.  And there's nothing wrong with that, it was just I, we wanted more of a democracy of participation of folks from you know, government to private sector to even, a few were unemployed.  They had been employed and it was also an opportunity for them to get a job through their networking, so it was, it's very hard in certain areas of the county, and this was one of those areas where you don't have the concentration of black individuals like you have elsewhere for us to get together as females, so that was, that was the concept.
Story_ID: 661014
Speaker 1: I don't want to skip over this and I think I've, afraid I have, but you were the first African American woman to receive a doctorate in higher education administration at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], right?
Speaker 2: Right, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Black studies in the Pacific Northwest.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and now what year is this?
Speaker 2: Let's see, 19--I finished in 1974, so backing out to--I did, I, I, again got very lucky.  My master's in public administration was a two year program, but the associate dean allowed me to finish in one year.  So then in my second year I was able to start my Ph.D. so I overlapped.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So that's what, that's, that's your credential for all the consulting and with all the schools and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --all a part of it anyway, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, right. Yeah, so the M.P.A. in 1970, Ph.D. in 1974 and I am now the vice chair of the Board or Regents for the University of Washington.
Speaker 1: Right, right, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it's amazing, yeah.
Speaker 1: --now, now your husband ran for city council [Seattle City Council] in '70 [1970]; he was elected in '78 [1978], is that when it was?
Speaker 2: Let's see, the city council, yeah, that would be right.  One of the, one of the members of the city council, Phyllis Lamphere [Phyllis Hagmoe Lamphere], got appointed by Carter, President Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] to head a department and so she left, so Norman [HistoryMaker Norman Rice] took her, ran for her unexpired term and won and so I think he served as a city council member I think a term and a half, four year term, six years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so.
Speaker 1: --and he, he ran for mayor--
Speaker 2: In '89 [1989]--
Speaker 1: He ran for mayor and he lost, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right, he was a city council member then.
Speaker 1: Who was, who was his opposition basically?
Speaker 2: Charlie Royer [Charles T. Royer], Charlie Royer, yeah,
Speaker 1: And this is the Republican (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he was, Norman was president of city council when he ran against Charlie who was then mayor, sitting mayor, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was an incumbent mayor, all right.
Speaker 2: He ran against the incumbent mayor.
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it was a landslide for Charlie (laughter).
Speaker 1: --okay so but, but Mr. Rice won in '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 661015
Speaker 1: And just, just give us you know, your perspective of that campaign and what role you played in it?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was an interesting situation.  Norman [HistoryMaker Norman Rice] ran for [U.S.] Congress the year before, I think it was the year before, for an open seat and he lost that race to Jim McDermott and he came to me and said, "Oh, dear, I'm not sure I'm going to run again for city council [Seattle City Council]." And I, I said, "Okay, you know whatever you want to do." 'Cause he's the kind of person that was a high demand individual for other things and, so, there was a race for the mayor, right, and it was a race that began, became centered around busing and there was a real anti-busing movement in Seattle [Washington] then and Norman felt that that movement was pushing the city apart.  And the, his opposition--oh, well, I skipped a very important piece.  It was, it really troubled him, so the last day of filing, the last hour and a half before the filing closed for mayor, Norman jumped in.  And at that time we didn't have a structure for a campaign 'cause we didn't expect to have him do that.  And we sat down with all of the supporters that had supported him during the congressional race and talked it through and we were fortunate in that Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was running for president during that time and so there was here in Seattle the Rainbow Coalition and the Rainbow Coalition, Charles Rolland [Charles Rolland III] and many others said, "We can do this."  And so all of a sudden we had this ad hoc group of smart people pushing.  Norman ran, beat Douglas Jewett [Douglas N. Jewett], became the mayor of Seattle with less than 4 percent of African American population voting.
Speaker 1: Yes, now that was significant.  So he had to, he had to gain allies in other parts of the city.  So did, did his allies come primarily from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he had the allies already because our city council runs at large, okay, so he was a very, very, very successful city council member, as I said he was president of the city council, so he had a lot of you know, a lot of support.  The person he ran against was a city attorney, Doug Jewett and Doug had a lot of support in terms of the anti-busing group of people in Seattle.  So with the Rainbow Coalition, what it had that we didn't see demonstrated earlier was a block of people of color already assembled because of Jesse Jackson being in the race, right; a very sophisticated door to door, grassroots, all of that.

Speaker 1: So they knew how to campaign (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, so we were between what I would call establishment type politicians that supported Norman [HistoryMaker Norman Rice] and community, right, and we had the, the Rainbow Coalition merging together and it was a huge push forward.  Interesting enough, the anti-busing initiative won, right, and Norman won and what Norman did as soon as he got into office, he had an education summit which brought all the people together and it was the entire city; had meetings on weekends to talk about what do we, what do we see our educational system doing?  And that's what he's famous for and as a consequence of the summit--I shouldn't say that's what he's famous for, but we were able to pass a levy tax that's still on the board to this day.  Every four years it comes up to be renewed and it's essentially providing, health, access to health in the schools, also special training for teachers, everything that makes a kid healthy and ready to learn.  The money comes from that school levy.  And so it's, it's a good story for him.  But you know all I was, was just you know, part of his intellectual capital, knocking on doors, working the office during the old times, licking envelopes, stuffing, all that stuff and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had to do that too?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you do all of that, yes.
Speaker 1: But it's just remarkable when you think that like 4 percent of the population and he's elected mayor of Seattle [Washington] and Seattle is a different place than Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --New York City [New York, New York] or--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --in terms of how people--
Speaker 2: But you, you know, you heard me say this, it was the Rainbow Coalition, so you had the Asian American vote, the Hispanic vote, African Americans, you know, we had people of color uniting and that expanded that number up to 10, 11 percent, right, easily.  Our largest population at that time was Asian American and black and then Hispanic and then Native.  And now I, we are probably close to Asian American, Hispanic, Latino and African American, so we're the third in the rungs--
Speaker 1: Okay, I know--
Speaker 2: --so it's changed.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know when we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett if I remember correctly, he had a lot of Asian support for the change in the name of King County [Washington] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: At least a meeting--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, yeah, he, it was, it was just, it was wondrous it was really, I, I don't know, during this time given the, the politics to the environment, the president and his supporters that wedge politics situation and I would hope we'd be able to reunite again in the same way and then moving forward.
Story_ID: 661017
Speaker 1: Now in the '89 [1989]--you were appointed by the governor of Washington [Booth Gardner] as a trustee for the, for Evergreen State College [Olympia, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I was there for a short period because I became, I, I was also vice chancellor.  Then I became president of, interim president of North Seattle Community College [North Seattle College, Seattle, Washington] and I felt there was a conflict of interest so--no one else felt that.  I felt that way 'cause part of being president you really need to also raise funds and part of being a trustee you need to do the same thing, so, and, and that's where I interfaced with Maxine [HistoryMaker Maxine B. Mimms] and many of, of the things that I did as a trustee at Evergreen in terms of financing, policy, related directly to the Tacoma [Washington] campus, so I had a number of conversations, private conversations with Maxine, like you know, what's working, what do you need, same thing with Joye Hardiman [W. Joye Hardiman], so that's what I meant about this, this whole spirit in the Pacific Northwest.  When we need to move something when we're in positions in terms of finance, access, reinforcement, we need to talk to each other so that we you know, work in tandem in order to get positive outcomes.  And Maxine was my leader in terms of saying, "Now Constance [HistoryMaker Constance W. Rice], you know, this is what you might have heard, but we're doing fine and we don't need to close the doors of the Tacoma campus because there's a temporary dip in enrollment."  That's an example of how you have these conversations, right.
Speaker 1: I know we, we, we talked to Dr. Maxine Mimms, but just give us like a synopsis of what she did, which was remarkable there in Tacoma?
Speaker 2: Maxine Mimms had a school in her kitchen and that school became a college in her kitchen and she outgrew that and she was able to leverage through her personal relationships with higher education people at, at Evergreen College, a branch dedicated to urban Tacoma and therefore dedicated to African Americans within Tacoma to come to a high prestige, highly accredited school.  Not only did she get the doors open, she began the magnetizing of getting the best thinkers throughout from around the nation to come and teach at that Tacoma branch.  Not only did she do that, when she left she had a succession plan and all that she built was layered by others that she brought in to succeed her, so she is a remarkable leader that helped with the vision, amasses the voices, leverages what she knows, leverages what she doesn't know, brings it in to build the, a firmer foundation of growth.  And as a consequence we have also through Evergreen being there they attracted the University of Washington to Tacoma [University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington].  So I give her a lot of credit for revitalizing the downtown quarter of Tacoma, not just for African Americans but for all citizens within, within the Tacoma area.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's my love for Maxine.
Story_ID: 661018
Speaker 1: Says here that you organized the health and n- health and nutrition project in the city [Seattle, Washington] too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: From what position did you, were you, is that something you did with your consulting [CWR, Inc.].
Speaker 2: I was still small.  I was still you know, with community colleges and as first lady okay, a friend of mine, Jamie Okamoto [ph.] writes children's books and she has an award program for young people in middle school who have achieved a lot for themselves.  That is, the kid that read the most books ever for themselves got an award and she named it the Mayor's Reading Awards Program [ph.].  We had a reception every time, every summer when these awards were given out and I was one of the people standing, hosting and helping out; stood at a table, women came through with their children; a woman opened her purse and swept plates of food into her pocketbook and her children were eating the food as they were coming down the line and the mom, this woman, looked at me and she says, "We're hungry." (Shakes head) I looked at her, looked at those children and I said, "Oh my goodness"; so did some research on hunger in the schools; what was happening in the Seattle [Washington] schools; how many free and reduced lunches.  I have a really wonderful group of, of, of women and men.  We got together in a think tank way and we established a program where we brought dinners into schools on Fridays twice a month and this was not a food bank.  We didn't want it to be you know, promoted as a food bank issue; hot meals, got the hotels in the area to donate their plates, their silverware.  I got tablecloths.  We made it like a little restaurant within the school cafeteria.  Every child in the school, whoever they designated as family, was invited to come free of charge.  We provided a program in conjunction with the Washington State University [Pullman, Washington] cooperative education program where they came and they talked to them about urban gardening, gardening, where they talked about how to shop at Costco [Costco Wholesale Corporation] on, by just spending ten dollars for a family of four.  We talked about anger management.  We talked about gang recognition.  We talked about shopping at stores that were either consignment or free stores.  So we had a regular curriculum where the families came, they ate, the kids had childcare activities where some of the teachers in the school were able to come and, and talk to the parents that were that were (unclear), so these parents didn't go to PTSA [Parent Teacher Student Association] meetings.  They didn't, you know, they were not in that mold.  They were working, surviving, et cetera.  And so we did that for eleven years.  We paid for it, they came, we choose the schools that had 90 percent or above, free or reduced lunches and that's the program, Health and Nutrition [Health and Nutrition Project].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you initiated that when you were first lady?
Speaker 2: Right, and then I--we continued it afterwards, yeah.
Story_ID: 661019
Speaker 1: Now there's a, now you organized a, a Desmond Tutu, what is it called again?
Speaker 2: Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation.  Robert Taylor who was pastor over at St. Marks [St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, Washington], Desmond Tutu's folks in Cape Town [South Africa] wanted to build something in Desmond Tutu's name, not you know a bust or anything like that, or a statue, but something programmatic and wanted something in terms of a center at a museum and they wanted to have a foundation in the United States and in London [England] and Robert came to me because I had developed and built two schools in Swaziland and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I want to know when did you do that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now here you are, we're jumping right over.
Speaker 2: Swaziland, in Swaziland we did sort of planning in, in 19-- let's see, 1999 and then we launched in 2001.  I was in Swaziland on 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  And this is for the girls.  Swaziland has a 70 percent HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] rate for preteens because there was a belief that if you had sex with a virgin you were cured of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot of misinformation, crazy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --activity going on in Africa--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at that time in terms of AIDS.
Speaker 2: Right, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So just to backtrack a little bit--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --nineteen--was it 1991 I think [sic. 1990], that Nelson Mandela was released?
Speaker 2: Right, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: --so I established the foundation here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And of course Desmond Tutu was a great ANC [African National Congress] leader--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --that appeared off and on American television and in the media (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh sure.
Speaker 1: --for the freedom of his people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in South Africa--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and that's (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they also freed Nelson Mandela, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And he did the truth and reconciliation--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --tribunal [Truth and Reconciliation Commission] after Nelson Mandela was released and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, what was that, in '95 [1995] they had their elections?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is going on and during your husband's first part of your, your husband's tenure as mayor?
Speaker 2: Right, right and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And let me just say that black mayors all over the country, I think, he, when Nelson Mandela visited the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 1: --he went to the cities--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I'm sorry he went to Oakland [California], went to Oakland.
Speaker 1: Well he went to a lot of cities--
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: --where there was a black mayor--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: --Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --D.C. [Washington, D.C.], you know New York [New York].
Speaker 2: And we, we met him in Oakland because that's when I was with [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte and we were fortunate enough because Norman [HistoryMaker Norman Rice], as mayor, was able to get into that inner circle so that was my first time meeting Nelson Mandela, but then he came back and when he came back, Norman and I and others hosted him for his trip and in, in terms of raising funds for his foundation [Nelson Mandela Foundation] and Graca Machel, and Graca Machel and I were in the green room together and you know, she said, "Oh Constance [HistoryMaker Constance W. Rice], what are you doing for girls in Africa?" And I said, "You know, nothing, I haven't been invited.  I'm doing what I can for girls here." And she says, "Well why don't you do both."  She said, "I'm raising money and some of those funds can come to an idea that you can present to me on what you can do to help our girls in Africa."  That was a challenge.  I'm from Brooklyn [New York].  What I'm saying is I took it as a challenge because she said, "Well, what are you doing for girls, you know, in Africa?"  I took that as a Brooklyn girl, like well, I haven't been invited, you know that kind of thing and so we met, a group of us did our you know, think tank 'cause that's where I, I work projects.  I have people who are brought in and we do a think tank.  We do the research.  We find out you know, what's needed.  You know what you have to worry about in terms of perceptions and how you do things, the culture, 'cause I, I had not spent a lot of time in Africa and so we came out with a technology as a lure and we said we would bring computers to South Africa.  At that time we thought we were going to Mozambique. Short story, the floods came to Mozambique, the country had a difficult time.  Graca had to use the money that she thought she had for that and even though you know, she was first, she was the only woman that I know of that's first lady of two countries.
Story_ID: 661020
Speaker 1: Mozambique and South Africa.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And she was married to Samora Machel who--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --passed away--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who was the first president of Mozambique.
Speaker 1: Right, so you got it, it's very, most people don't grab a hold to that particular factoid regarding her and how just amazing she, she is and what she did and while at the side of both men, you know, that kind of thing.  So we had in Wash- the WTO [World Trade Organization] met here in Seattle [Washington] and many of the ambassadors from Africa came for that meeting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that was in 1994 I think [sic. 1999]?
Speaker 1: You have to look that up.
Speaker 2: The spring of 1994, it's in there.  I know it's in there.
Speaker 1: Right, it's in there, and Graca [Graca Machel], when she told me she didn't have the money then I said, "All right, you know, it's okay."  This was a concept, a good concept, but the ambassador, Mary Kanya from Swaziland heard about the whole deal; she said, "Come to Swaziland, come to Swaziland."  The next thing I knew she called Swaziland--Swaziland is a monarchy--she called the king [Mswati III], he directed his department of, his head of education to come to Seattle to meet with me.  We struck an MOU [memorandum of understanding] and I took the project to Swaziland.
Speaker 2: You know Swaziland is a country surrounded by South Africa--
Speaker 1: Right, it's--
Speaker 2: --it was surrounded by (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Lesotho, Mozambique and et cetera so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, but it, what I understand, it's a state that was used by the apartheid regime as a resort area (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and a casinos and (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, you have the whole, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you know, through lots of machinations where I had to meet with the king and, and had a good time with him.  He, he's, at that time was about thirty-two or so, persuaded him that I wanted to make sure we had contraception, well condoms actually, not contraception, condoms; we were ready to do sex education.  We were going to provide technology education, how to use a computer, how to get to the Internet, how to do reports, how to write, et cetera.  So I had science based inquiry in the curriculum; we had health in the curriculum.  We also had job mentoring in the curriculum, so we were able to educate fourteen hundred girls in two areas, one in the capital [Mbabane, Swaziland], one in the bush.  And as I said we launched on 9/11 [September 11, 2001] and up until four years ago the project was going--it's been institutionalized by the king.  We've had some success that we are aware of four young ladies getting their undergraduate degree from schools in South Africa, so that's really sort of my--I love that.  But Robert Taylor, Desmond Tutu knew that I was doing work in Africa and that's why they came to me to help set up the foundation for them here in the states [Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation].  So I was doing double duty.
