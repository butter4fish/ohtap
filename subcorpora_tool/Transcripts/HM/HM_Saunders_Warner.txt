Speaker 1: I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  (Pause)  Why would you start with such a hard question in the beginning?  (Pause).  Favorite food.
Speaker 1: You want to try favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?  Excuse me.
Speaker 2: Hawaii.
Speaker 1: See.  Can we go back to favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Favorite food. That's hard to say.  I'm stuck on that one.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying?  Yeah.  Yeah I do. Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change and the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. The A.A. [Alcoholics Anonymous], although I'm not an alcoholic, it seems to be the greatest phrase that I've ever heard.
Speaker 1: Okay. I didn't know if it was--it's an A.A. line?
Speaker 2: That's in A.A. Yeah.  1935, the year I was born.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when they started it.  I would say that red beans and rice are pretty high up there on my agenda.  (Laughing).
Story_ID: 12925
Speaker 1: I want to take you back, and really talk about your parents.  And I was interested, you know, that you had done some genealogical research. And I wanted to ask you about that.  But I want you to first, if you would tell me about your father.  His name was Gus, Gus, if it's really Gus Holmes?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I wanted to ask you about that.
Speaker 2: Gus Saunders he changed it to.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it was Gus, his name was Isaac Holmes.  That was his name.  What about him?  Well, let's start with me in the picture.  He was fifty years old when I was born.  So therefore he had lived a lot of life before I came along. I knew him as a Pullman porter and as a waiter on the train and a man of some business acumen.  He, he had a place of business across the street from the then Illinois Central Railroad Station, which was at Roosevelt Road and Michigan Avenue. [Chicago, Illinois] He owned--what was the front as a--cleaners and--where the--porters could bring their bags and sacks, but in the back there was a gambling house, of which he was the proprietor of.  He-as I understand this from my grandmother [Rebecca Holmes]--he was a rather rambunctious, highly intelligent young man who lived in--the South, in Louisiana.  And the way the name change happened, Isaac Holmes and his brother, Preston, my grandmother and grandfather's two sons, built a pleasure boat along the Cane River in, near, Natchitoches, Louisiana.  And, the white population was extremely upset about them building this pleasure boat because they were charging on Sundays to go up and down the river, and so they burned the boat down.  And my father and his brother burned their boat down.  And that, of course, in--the early 1900s was a cardinal sin punishable by death, and so he was chased out of town, literally, ran away and went to Spokane, Washington.  And he was being hunted for this crime that he had committed, and in order to write back to my grandmother and grandfather, he chose the name Gus Saunders.  I don't know where he came up with that name, but he just came up with that name.  And, he would write them back and, so his--that became his name. I didn't learn this little ditty until I was in college, when my cousin in New Orleans [Louisiana] told me about it.  I was like flabbergasted and shocked.  I remember, when I was a child, I used to ask my grandmother, "Why is my name Saunders and dad's name's Saunders and this, your name's Holmes?"  And my grandmother, in her great fear that the Klan [Ku Klux Klan] was still looking for the whole family, told me that she got pregnant out of wedlock.  And that was the reason which I accepted, because I understood that, but that wasn't it at all.  Which, once I understood about what happened with this incident, then I understood why, when I was almost thirteen, fourteen years old, whenever anybody who was white came to our door, she'd, she would put me in a closet, or make me go, get under the bed. The fear that something was happening even here in Chicago, was enough to motivate her to feel that she needed to protect me long after this incident had happened. So my father must have been by that time sixty some years old.  And this had happened in--Louisiana.  We were living in Chicago.  This must have happened in Louisiana just after the turn of the century.
Speaker 1: That's a fascinating story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's interesting that, you know, to think that she even created the wedlock story, you know, as a--now, did your father, did he talk much about growing up himself or not?  I mean, I know he was older then.
Speaker 2: I never talked to my father about almost any--on any subject.  He ended up being an alcoholic.  He obviously was a gambler, and he was one of those old time, old-fashioned parents who believed that children should not say anything and should just listen to what they told me. So I never really had conversations with my father, although he died when I was twenty-seven years old. There was very little commerce between the two of us.  He was--by that time pretty well beaten down and very angry. I surmised because he was highly intelligent and he--was that. I surmised that because he was, and the opportunities were not afforded to him like he thought they should be, I think that created a lot of anger on his part.  And I don't think he sought out--I don't think he had any comfort with that--and I don't think he sought out ways of getting around it.  I think he wallowed in his victimization, which created such an internal turmoil in him that it was like, that it spread everywhere in the household and everywhere he was.  He was forever in fights and--altercations with people both in the building and, that we lived in and also in his--work outside.  Much of it brought on by--his alcohol use and this flamethrower of a temper.
Speaker 1: Now do you know how he got from--from Spokane to Chicago?  Do you know what  happened?  Or you just--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He was a railroad man.  So, he ran--he was on the road from all these places and ended up in Chicago, living in Chicago, I would suspect--although I don't know it for a fact--I would suspect that he probably came to Chicago because there were--Chicago was still considered the place that you went to get jobs.  And so I--got to figure he met a lot of people here when he arrived here on--the road, and--related to a lot of those people, and decided to stay, because the black belt in Chicago, the-whatever we want to call it-the black metropolis was thriving during--that period of time. So I assume that was his reason for staying here, although I've never heard it from his lips.
Story_ID: 12926
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother [Rebecca Holmes] share anything with you about growing up in Louisiana and her time?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, she told me a lot.  She--I was just talking about that today-she was--I'm--almost certain she was the issue of--either one of the white slave owners or that person's child and--some black slave.  I would assume that.  She talked about her father, and from what I hear, she lived, literally, she lived in a plantation, on a plantation called Nottoway in [White Castle] Louisiana.  And she lived inside of the big house, and she used to tell me about the fireplace that they had there.  And when I went to Nottaway as an adult, I saw this big fireplace.  And it like, what a flashback!  You know, Grandma told me about this, that she had to take the ashes out of the fireplace, that was one of her tasks.  She talked about, how difficult it was, for them. But because she was--she lived almost a charmed life in that sense.  Because she wasn't--she didn't have to go out in the fields and work like others did, her brothers and sisters did, her half brothers and sisters did.  And she spent a lot of time inside the house.  Although they--refused doggedly to teach her how to read.  So she couldn't read.  But she was--she could definitely count.  She knew how to count, but she didn't know how to read.  And so she told me about that.  And, she gave me many, she told me many stories about what she called the reb time.  R-E-B time.  The rebel time, the times of the rebels.  And she remembers, southerners, southern whites and the conflicts that were going on, during that period.
Speaker 1: And were these, the rebel times was she talking about when blacks rose up against whites, or--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.  She's--talking about how after the [U.S.] Civil War, how the--rebels came home and tried to re-establish themselves.  And--they were, of course, being oppressed by--northern whites at that time, which created pressure on--blacks also.  I would assume that after that period of time, the people who were doing very well, the genteel whites of that era, must have gone through severe problems with northern whites.  And--so the pressure within, the trickle down theory, took place.  And she remembers--getting on the levee and walking to New Orleans [Louisiana], on--the levee, trying to get out of that situation and ultimately moving to New Orleans.
Story_ID: 12927
Speaker 1: Now your mother [Georgia Saunders], she was actually twenty years younger than--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Twenty years younger.  Yeah--.
Speaker 1: --than your father [Gus Saunders].  Now, what do you know about her, her family?  They were from Arkansas right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know--I- I'll give you a kind of a family tree. One of my family members put together a family tree.  The--patriarch of the family was--a slave.  His name was--Strap Littlejohn, S-T-R-A-P Littlejohn, and a Littlejohn family from Arkansas and Mississippi.  And so I knew, I know a little bit more about her.  She was born in a little town called Clarendon, Arkansas.  Brinkley [Arkansas], Clarendon and Cotton Plant, Arkansas are all there together nestled in--one area.  And, she was--a field hand in, you know, picking cotton.  And she always tells the story when she was seventeen years old, she looked up in the sky and it was a cloudy day one day, partial--partly cloudy one day. And she looked up and she saw this cloud.  And she said it looked like it, the cloud, was actually beckoning her to--come north.  And so she caught a bus at seventeen years old, and came to Chicago [Illinois].  And, where she started to live her life there.  That's--how she got here.  So she literally left the cotton fields of Arkansas, and came to Chicago and worked in laundries and was a maid and, and with--less than a fifth grade education, she didn't have much--opportunity to move anywhere, and I don't think it really ever occurred to her to--try to advance herself in--that way. I theorize that, when--one is a victim of racism, one--becomes a racist themselves.  In--this sense that--if--racism is the belief in the superiority of one race over another, whites who believe that they are superior are infected with racism.  But blacks who feel that they are inferior are infected with the same form of racism, and--it's an equal infection.  And I think she was so infected by her own belief in her own inferiority, that she didn't feel that--opportunities that would afford other people would--be helpful to her.  And I think that was--probably a--kind of with--some exceptions--I think that was the general feeling of most blacks at that time.  Severe feelings of inferiority and believing in their own inferiority. I don't think that that's any less racist than someone who believes that they are superior.  And so I therefore say I was raised by two racists who--believed firmly in their own inferiority.
Story_ID: 12928
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents [Gus Saunders and Georgia Saunders] met?
Speaker 2: Through friends.  I even know the friends that they--met.  They--met through friends. He was--here in Chicago [Illinois], working and--she was too.  And they--used to have, at that time in the mid 30s [1930s], early 30s, late 20s [1920s], early 30s, a lot of house parties.  Because there--certainly money was not that--plentiful.  So they would end up at a lot of parties at people's houses.  Some of 'em in the recent days, they used to call 'em quarter parties.  You'd get in, pay a quarter to come in, have a party and there'd be drinks there and stuff.  And that's how they met, at their friends' places.
Story_ID: 12929
Speaker 1: Now you were born in 1935--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -and your father's [Gus Saunders] older.  But do you, I just want to go to your, you know, some of your early memories. I mean, where were--where was your family living at the time? I mean, you know, what were your, some of your--.
Speaker 2: We always lived at, from the time I was born until I left for college, we lived at 432 East 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois].  So we lived between what is now King Drive--it was South Parkway-and--Vincennes [Avenue].  And we lived all over the--department stores there. It was a ten apartment building inside, and so there's ten apartments in there and we lived in one of those ten apartments. 47th Street was a flourishing street.  It was like--midtown Harlem [New York, New York] at the time.  It was like the middle of--the Regal Theater was there, the Savoy [Ballroom] was there, the Met [Metropolitan Theater] was there.  The--policy was flourishing at that time.  Policy-illegal lottery-was flourishing at that time. The Palm Tavern was big.  It--was nothing to see celebrities walking up and down the street on a--very regular basis.  And so it was--such an exciting kind of place to live, we kind of missed the--fact that we--were poor, (laughing).  We kind of thought this was like cool to live in--an area like this.  And so those are my earliest memories living--on 47th Street, which Horace Cayton and St. Clair Drake dubbed the 'Black Metropolis'  ['Black Metropolis: A study of Negro life in a Northern City',  written by St. Clair Drake and Horace R. Cayton.]
Speaker 1: You were an only child, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you have an only son [Warner Saunders, Jr.],
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  So, what, do you remember just- can you share like maybe three memories of growing up?  You know, in your early years, I want to say. About maybe till twelve or so, you know, do you?
Speaker 2: Well--of course there were--ten kids living in the same building, an apartment building, and so they were my brothers and sisters.  We were all around the same age, approximately the same age.  And so those were my youngest memories.  And, being with them as family, all of the stuff that goes on with brothers and sisters.  Fights and reconciliations and fun and--back and forth to--in the neighborhood playing ball, doing those kinds of things. There are people who would--like to deny that there were gangs at that time, but there were really, there were vicious gangs during that time, although the--most of 'em didn't have guns.  The street was a pretty dangerous place to be.  And we were always wary of where we went and back and forth.  Policy was a very strong, economic--part of the black community at that time.  It was the shadow economy at that time.  Millions and millions of dollars being turned around within the black community. The other part of it was that--both middle, upper--class and lower class blacks essentially lived and worked in the same neighborhoods, because of segregation.  An example, a memory that I remember, Dr. Theodore Lawless, the dermatologist, the famous dermatologist, had an office on 43rd [Street], on South Parkway and near 43rd Street.  And I remember people used to double park and triple park.  They would park on the inside of there, and then on the outside of, and they were--almost all of his patients were white.  And--I asked my father [Gus Saunders] one time, I said, "What is this?"  You know, how, "What are all these white people doing here on--43rd and King Drive?" And my father said, "Well, you know, he's a--Dr. Lawless is a skin specialist."  And well, I mean, I had no idea what a skin specialist did.  "What does a skin specialist do?"  And--then, of course, asking questions was not there.  But what I do remember was, my father kind of gave me--he did give me some insight in that sense.  He said, "You know, if you're good enough, you know, it doesn't make any difference where you are.  People will come there to--use you."  And I'd see all these people and it was, I'm going, "Man, he must be really something if quote white people are coming to, you know, a black doctor, coming to this man."  It was inconceivable to me to understand that.  That was, so I remember I had--that memory.  On the flip side of it, I used to see the Jones brothers [Edward, George, and McKissack], the policy kings at that time.  They were--they cut quite a figure.  Them and Jim Knight who owned the Palm Tavern, they were--big figures in the community.  They dressed, and they had big cars, and they always had the pretty ladies around 'em.  They, you know, they were--top-notch people in the community.  So I--had a great deal of admiration for them.  They were also well educated.  Then, of course, I remember 'Two-Gun Pete'. I don't know if that name means anything to you.  His name was Sylvester Washington, and he was the policeman on the street.  That his major--reason for being there on 47th Street, to march along 47th Street, was to make sure that some little punks did not interfere with the policy game going on.  That was his task to do that.  And he was--a fearful figure.  So tough that, if he decided to arrest you and me standing on the corner, he didn't bother about sending a police wagon, he would just tell us to meet--him at the police station. And if you didn't meet him at the police station, you'd have, I mean, you'd have him to have to deal with.  And it was his job to kind of do--be the law and order in the community.  Although all of this corruption was going on inside of the community, he sat atop of this as the legal figure there.  Of course, money was being passed around all over the place, and it was, basically, a victimless crime and--I was scared to death of him.  And 'Two-Gun Pete' was used by many parents to scare 'em straight.  You know, if you--I remember, I used to love white bread and sugar and butter on the bread, you know, Wonder Bread and my--and then I'd leave and walk out in the street. My mother [Georgia Saunders] said, "You know, you're gonna go out there, 'Two-Gun Pete' is gonna catch you one day,  and--you're gonna really be in trouble."  I remember I stole some and ran out on 47th Street, and I turned the corner.  And I got all this white bread and sugar and butter in my hand.  And I looked up and there was 'Two-gun Pete' standing there. And I obviously knew he was looking right at me and was getting ready to kill me.  I knew that! (Laughs).  I knew I was gonna die, for--this crime.  And--I guess I'm just standing there looking at him.  He said, "Get away from me!"  You know, he goes, "Get away from me before I slap you up side your head."  And I mean, I ran like the wind.  I mean, but you had those kind of figures that were--in the community.  Edgar G. Brown [candidate for U.S. Representative from Illinois 1st District] was another person.  I don't know if you--know that name.  He was, Edgar G. Brown was a--civil rights activist.  He stood on the corner and he had a peach box, and he used to stand on the corner and he used to talk about black people.  And every time he mentioned the word black, I would, like, cringe, because that is not what we were called at that time.  And he would talk about the potential of black people and how we came from a great race, and that Africa was a wonderful place.  And he would say all of these things, he was a--and the cops would come and get him and take him off to jail.  And he'd come back.  He'd be on the--I was fascinated, listening to him talk about the potential that we had, and the--and he'd talk about economic power.  And I remember the--white business people in the area used to call him a communist.  I didn't know what a communist was but I knew that wasn't something really good to be, but Edgar G., Edgar G. Brown was this communist who--in--later years, I understood what he was about.  He was involved in--at that time, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and other--I've got a picture of him, as a matter of fact, of--various organizations. But he was like a street corner preacher who preached equality.  And actually black power is what he was talking about.  Amazing figure!  He looms very high in my mind because I was always drawn to him.  He was so articulate, and he was so handsome, and he was so--fearless.  I mean he just--he--gave me cause to believe that there was--a possibility of getting out of all this stuff, you know, although he never talked to me directly. He was--amazing!  Just an amazing man.  I, of the many people that--I have met over my lifetime, and who I've never talked to, he's one that's had a lot--of influence on--my behavior.
Story_ID: 12930
Speaker 1: Now what was the young Warner Saunders like?  Were you quiet?  You seem to have a quiet demeanor, were you quiet?  Were you rambunctious?  Did you--.
Speaker 2: Oh, very rambunctious.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Were you a dreamer or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm, you know, as my--mother [Georgia Saunders] said all the time, "You, why do you always think so different from everybody else?"  You know, why does some everybody else think one way and you think another way? And they put me in Catholic schools and my mother converted to Catholicism and, so I went to Catholic schools, the neighborhood Catholic school.  And I never could adjust to--the belief system.  I--was just telling the story. I will never forget--the hardest I've ever been hit in every--in anything I've ever been, I mean. The nun said that, you know, that Christ died for our sins. And--I said, "Well, it was only three days."  And, man, she gave me a backhand that I will never forget.  It was that kind of thing.  It's like I couldn't--it seemed, they just didn't--it didn't jibe in my mind what they were telling me and what--I saw were two different things, and they were kind of telling me that I was crazy in terms of what I saw.  The nuns at that time were--at best, paternalistic--I would say racist but at best paternalistic--who believed that their--belief was that we were inferior, and they were there as kind of missionaries to help us out.  And that always bothered me. Because that--if--one is paternalistic, it's in all of what they do. And so it was, you--they were--there was always limitations. "Well you can't do that, you can't go further than that, and you can't do that."  There were so many cant's that I used to--I just couldn't buy into that kind of thing.  So I was always in some kind of Dutch with 'em. I was always doing something.  My report card was always filled with bright but has trouble with self-control, (laughing). Self control, whatever that is.  I always thought it was complying with what they believed, and if you didn't do it lock step, there was something wrong with you.
Story_ID: 12931
Speaker 1: Now your mother [Georgia Saunders], why did she change to Catholicism, do you think? That is,  because she probably was raised Baptist?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Definitely raised Baptist.  I think there's a--my wife [Sadako Saunders] always says that I, even now, I think there's a kind of false, maybe it isn't arrogance, or maybe it is arrogance--I'm searching for the word.  But I think she, in her striving to be better, I think she saw Catholicism as something that was better than the Baptist Church that she came from.  And so I think--she felt that--it was a status to--be a part of that.  And of course, the nuns propagated that, too.  They always told us that we were better than the kids that went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois]  And I used to always wonder in high school why they always won the basketball games if we had God on our side.  But that was neither here nor there (laughing).
Speaker 1: So now, were--the--was Corpus Christi [black parish and school, Chicago, Illinois], well, let's see, you went there--the whole time!
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: With the exception of one--. I managed to graduate at number four in my class in grammar school [Corpus Christi], and even with all of the stuff. And so the nuns--recommended that the four of us, who were the four top students in--the class, go to white high schools.  So in 1949, there was Saint--Saint--pardon me--Saint Ignatius Jesuit School [Saint Ignatius College Preparatory School, Chicago, Illinois] and Saint Philip [St. Philip's, Chicago, Illinois] at Douglas, Western--Douglas, and no, Kedzie--and--Jackson and Kedzie.  Well, Saint Ignatius could not take more, would not take more than two black students per year into--the school. So the four of us could not all go to Saint Ignatius, so they had to split us up.  So two of us went to Saint Ignatius and two went to Saint Philip.  I went to Saint Philip.  That was the first time that I had ever had any contact with anyone white on my--level, someone who was my age.  And I had-you know, when I look back at it-I had really been shielded from--a lot of viciousness, vicious attacks, because I'd never heard anybody say anything to me, call me anything, because I was living in this kind of little black cocoon that we lived in.  Well, Saint--Philip was a completely different place. Italian kids, Polish kids, poor blue-collar young kids went there to school.  And of course I was the butt end of their--every joke.  It was the most miserable year I've ever spent in my life there.  And, after spending so much time in fighting my way back and forth to that school, I--told my mother and father I was not going back there again.
Story_ID: 12932
Speaker 1: Well, to show you some of the pathology that--takes place when--our form of racism is exhibited, that is, our belief in our own inferiority, you ask almost any black person. They'll tell you that they have Indian blood in 'em.  You know.  And--then when you say, "Well, what Indian tribe was this?", they have no idea.  "Well, who were these people?"  They have no idea.  The--truth of the matter is the chances of us having Indian blood is very slight, because most of the Indians were out of the South by the time we got there to begin with.  And, unless you're from Oklahoma in that area, there is some possibility that that might have happened.  But a remote possibility. Tony Burroughs [genealogist, author] explains it away as--it was an economic reason that, after the [U.S.] Civil War, if blacks were certainly not accorded any rights whatsoever, Indians were accorded a slightly better life.  So if you told people that you had Indian blood, then you were considered a half-breed.  And you were therefore able to get employment faster than you would if you simply said I'm black.  And so people were looking for any reason to do it. And Tony says that there is record after record that--supports that.
Speaker 2: That's fascinating.  Yes 'cause I had said Cherokees.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Or we--or there are people who'll say, "Come from the Blackfoot." Well, when did you get to Dakota?  (laughing).  When did your mama go up to Dakota?  You know, but--we come up with any kind of excuse to escape reality oft times.
Story_ID: 12933
Speaker 1: So you were saying that you were at Douglas [sic, Saint Philip's High School, Chicago, Illinois] for a year and then you know--.
Speaker 2: I--was at Saint Philip.
Speaker 1: Saint Philip.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Saint Philip--for a year. And then decided that that was, you know, you begged to go back [to Corpus Christi High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you--now, had you started playing sports at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started playing sports in the fifth grade, yeah.  And--I was--quite a good athlete even--in that early era, and I was taller than most people.  And--so I--liked it, enjoyed it, and--that, I think, is one of the reasons that they exported me out to Saint Philip, too.  That--was a selling point that--you're gonna get an athlete.  But we weren't--black athletes weren't prima donnas at that time.  It--was an experiment more than it was--we're getting a great athlete here, and this athlete was gonna help us win. And they--when we would go out to--we're--this was the Catholic League, so when we would go out to these various schools, I mean, it was just hell!  I mean, I would--hate to walk, to go out, to run out on the field, or to run out on the court, because all you'd hear would be, "You nigger, you get off the court.  You so and so!" I mean, it would be just--used to have courses of this--kind of thing.  And I kind of didn't think I needed to keep hearing that for four years.  And, even with the teachers, there would be insensitive remarks by students, and the--teachers would--not say anything.  The other addition to it is that that was--Saint Philip was the school that a lot of the mafia dons out of Elmwood Park [Illinois].  And so there were a lot of kids who were the sons of--and this was an all boys' school--who were the sons of--Outfit [Chicago mafia] people.  Who now at their age are now, they're now the head of the Outfits.  And--I was in school with a number of 'em, and I will not mention their names.  But I know some of 'em very well.  As a matter of fact, I reported on a few of 'em that I was sitting in the freshman class with, so that was that extra kind of--angst that--went on.  And I didn't--I was pretty defenseless, because there was really nobody to help out, and there was only a couple guys who even--felt any--empathy for--what I was going through.  You know, things like going to the lunchroom and--putting your food down and going to get a glass of water and all the guys at the table spit in your food. That kind of thing was going on.  And so, you know, that's--I mean, even as dependent as I was at that time, I understand that kind of behavior couldn't, you know, I didn't want to go along with that.
Story_ID: 12934
Speaker 1: Now so you go back to Corpus Christi [High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I go back to Corpus Christi.
Speaker 1: And your parents [Gus Saunders and Georgia Saunders], what are they thinking at that point?
Speaker 2: I don't know what they were thinking, I just don't know.  I just knew I wasn't going back [to St.Philip's High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think there was a blow-up in--our household, with my mother about my not going back.  And that, you know, that--I couldn't get a good education and--that kind of stuff, but I just totally dug in, and just said, "I'm not going back there."  First, it was a long ride.  Because going from 47th Street to Douglas and Jackson, to Jackson and--Kedzie at that time was a long ride.  There was no Dan Ryan [Dan Ryan Expressway], there was no Congress Expressway.  And so it was all using the L [elevated train, Chicago Transit Authority]. So it took an hour, hour and twenty minutes, hour and a half to--get to school.  And in the winter, it was even worse.  So it's like, what is the purpose of this? It didn't make sense.  It made sense to them, not to me.
Speaker 1: So you never thought of dropping out or anything.
Speaker 2: Oh, I never thought of dropping out of school.  No.  No, I never thought of that.
Speaker 1: So, so when you went back to Corpus Christi, you continued with your sports career?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But academically was there any, you know, issue?  You still were at the top of the class, weren't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did very well in school.  I just didn't buy, I mean, I just didn't buy into their philosophy, but academically I did very well.  As--much as I wanted to do, I mean, oft times you got to kind of go along with the guys.  And I didn't wanna--stick out like a sore thumb--.  You know, sometimes you get all As and the guys get on your case, especially athletes do.  And so I kind of tempered it, and--just played the game.  But--I got through.  I was, I think, I was third or fourth in- my high school graduating class [1953].
Speaker 1: And what--were some of your favorite subjects?  Did you have any?
Speaker 2: I loved history and geography and the social studies.  The--all of the stuff that I ultimately became involved in on a vocational level is what I liked.  I mean, I strayed away from chemistry, and math didn't interest me too much, but I was interested in the social sciences.  I--loved history.  I loved those kinds of things.  I loved language. I was--I was a pretty good Spanish-speaking--speaker by the time I'd graduated from high school, because we had four years of Latin, four years of Spanish and a--year of Greek, and with a teacher who was very good.  I loved the--the biological sciences.  I enjoyed that kind of stuff and did well at it.  I--had some good teachers. They were--very good teachers academically.  I just didn't agree with 'em philosophically.
Speaker 1: So in your mind, you probably, you got a better education than the, let's say, kids coming up now?  Do you think? In the same school system?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I think definitely so. One--because, the discipline of those--Catholic schools was there.  I mean, I--never even thought about cutting class.  I mean, it's like it didn't occur to me to cut class.  I mean, why--would I do that?  You know, it just didn't occur to me to--do it. I was in college and--they said, "You know you get a number of cuts in class?"  "You mean you don't have to go to class every, every time?"  I just thought that's what you were supposed to do.  So it was ignorance is bliss.  I just didn't know the difference. I would've done it if I figured I could get away with it.  But I just didn't know to do it.
Story_ID: 12935
Speaker 1: And also, were there any teachers that you had were favorite teachers at the time? Or you know, or, were you playing basketball?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  All the way through.
Speaker 1: Basketball.
Speaker 2: Basketball, running track.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had gained some--certainly citywide and some--note on the statewide level in--athletics, in track especially and in basketball.  So yeah, I was a pretty well known athlete at the time.  I was getting stuff in the newspapers, and so that was really big when your name was in the newspapers at the time.  So yeah, sports became a real big part of my life, because I really saw that as--that's the first time my coach came to me and said, "You know, I think you're good enough to go to college."  And that was--really an eye opener. And then we started--then I started getting letters from--various universities. I remember one came from Gonzaga College. [sic. Gonzaga University, Spokane, Washington]  I never, I didn't even know where Gonzaga was.  And a number of white universities wanted me to come and play.  Bradley University was one of 'em in Peoria. [Illinois]  That was one that I really seriously thought about going to Bradley, because some of my friends were going there, basketball players were going there.  And I went down for an orientation at Bradley.  And when I think of this, it--really is something.  I remember coming into the auditorium and as we walked, the two of us were coming into the auditorium, the band struck up, 'Bye Bye Blackbird'.  And they were like, "Go back to Chicago!  Go back to Chicago!"  And I said, "You know, I don't think--," my quick mind said, "I don't think this is a place I'm going to be too happy playing basketball here."  Well, you're talking southern Illinois.  It was very, very, it was just like--it was worse than--the South in--some ways, because the belief was that--we were going to--I later heard, that the--athletes there were very fearful that we, because we're city guys, we came with a different kind of game, and that we were going to--replace them on--the team.  And so there was all this conspiratorial stuff about get 'em out of there.  Don't make 'em happy and get 'em away as fast as you can.  Well, they didn't have to motivate me to do that.  I left right away and went back home.  My coach said, well, He had gone to Xavier [University] in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And so he said, "Why don't you go there?"  And when my mother [Georgia Saunders] and father [Gus Saunders] were all for that one, because my aunt lived down there, and they thought they'd be able to keep an eye on me.  And it was an all black school.  It was in the Deep South.  It was in New Orleans.  But because it was so segregated, it--I was shielded from--most of the horrors that--most blacks went through.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk, I mean, so your coach, he--was black.  He was--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah. Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think he served a lot of guidance and parental role at that point in your life?
Speaker 2: My coach was my inspiration. Up until the time that I met Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and got smitten with the Civil Rights Movement, Coach Bingley-his name was Lawrence Bingley--Coach Bingley was--really my idol.  I mean, I wanted to be like Coach Bingley.  He was just the coolest guy I knew, and I was just crazy about him.  I ate up everything that he told me.  He taught me how to dance.  He said, "You know you gotta learn how to dance, Warner.  You know, you're gonna be--." And we'd be in the gym and he'd teach me how to do the two-step, and he'd take me back and forth.  He said, "You gotta learn these kind of social skills."  And he'd--put out a knife and fork and--a plate and the knives right there, and he'd tell me, he'd show me how you're supposed to start from the outside, and these are table manners.  And--you don't stick a napkin up in your--collar--only, you put a napkin on your lap. And he would, he really told me about all these--kind of social mannerisms that I should start to acquire, how to talk in a modulated voice and not to--you know, that--kind of thing.  So he was a real role model for me in--my developmental stage.  I met him when I was fifteen years old, and he died when I was, let me see, I was a sophomore in college. It was--he was--let me see, he was--he died of a heart attack.  Young man.  He was--that was maybe the first biggest blow I had in my life when he died.  Because I thought I was gonna come back and I'd always say, "Coach, I'm coming back and I'm gonna be your assistant coach, and when you get old, I'm gonna, I'm going to, I'm gonna take over from you."  (Laughing).  But he passed away.  But he was a great model.
Story_ID: 12936
Speaker 1: So you go to Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1953].  What is that experience like?  Because it's your first time really in the South.
Speaker 2: Well, it was my first time in the South.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to go there--as a child all the time in the South but--that didn't count.  Let me tell you about my first day there.  It was a Sunday morning.  The nuns said, "You have to go to Saint Jackson [sic, Saint Louis Cathedral], the cathedral in--Jackson Square in New Orleans."  My first day there, I go in and I--kneel down and I'm praying, doing the praying number, and we get up to go to communion.  You know, they call communion, you got up to go to communion, and I go and I get to the rail.  And there's a guy who comes and says, "Get! What are you doing up here?"  And--I was like kind of in--I didn't know what he was talking about, you know.  He says, "You niggers don't have communion with us!  You get back out," you know. And it--was that white people went to communion first.  And when they were finished, then they cleaned off the front part of the--area and then blacks got to go to communion.  And we had to sit in the--back of the church.  And that--so impressed me, that I never went back again to, I didn't go to any church anymore.  It just didn't make sense to me.  If I'm gonna be involved, I mean, I had to go to Xavier and there was--nothing I could do about that with those--but I really cut off psychologically from that, because I said how can I--how can these people--be for all of this so-called goodness and they're treating me like this?"  I can't--I'm, you know this doesn't make sense.  That was my first day at Xavier, I mean the first day in New Orleans.  That was--an eye opener.
Speaker 1: Now, Xavier, its teaching staff was all black, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No!
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh!
Speaker 2: All nuns at the time.
Speaker 1: All nuns!  Oh!
Speaker 2: Yeah. See, Xavier was founded in 1925 [sic, founded in 1915, became a four-year university in 1925] for what--they had on their--charter, for Negroes and Indians.  So I went to school with a lot of Indians.  They had a, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament had a--church school in the Dakotas.  And so the Indians would come down there to school to--so the blacks and the Indians, we went to school together.  That's what Xavier was for.  Now, understanding as you probably do about the mulattoes and the--what they called high yellas, Xavier was that kind of place.  And the social status was based on color and grade of hair and all the rest of that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 12937
Speaker 1: So how does a young Warner Saunders fit in all that?
Speaker 2: It was okay with me because I was an athlete, and we got a special dispensation for being athletes.  When the four of us came down there [Xavier University, New Orleans, Louisiana], we pretty much took over the basketball team, and by the time I was a sophomore, we were stars on the team, and so we had--carte blanche to pretty much do what we wanted to do.  Although we were still not welcome in some of the Creoles' houses and to visit with their girlfriends.  There was--still this color issue.  And, if we were going out on dates, the fathers didn't take too kindly to us, so oft times the girls had to leave out and we'd meet 'em on the corner and go to the movie, and then come back and drop 'em off on the corner.  Which I always thought was--I always felt very bad about that.  And--it-- I--don't think I could define the conflict in my mind at that point, but I just knew there was something wrong.  What is this?  You know, here you're operating in the same fashion that--you are what you are telling everybody else not to be.  So color was a large factor.  I remember the athletes, one year, we voted in the first black queen there.  We liked this girl from South Carolina.  Jo Eva (ph.) was a nice girl, but she just wasn't light skinned enough.  And we--packed the ballot boxes and did all kinds of stuff.  The athletes just, you know, we--strong armed people and did everything we could.  And so she wins--and becomes the prom queen, and the sisters demanded a recount, because the person they wanted to win, didn't win. And they got their recount, by the way.
Speaker 1: So what do you think of the whole Creole culture?  What, what were your impressions?  I mean, you know, sort of as an outsider?  What did you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) At that time?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, at that time I was pretty much infuriated by it.  I thought it was--I just thought they thought they were better than us.  I guess that's the only feelings that I had at that time.  When I look back on it, I understand the--need for what happened there.  Since every human being is looking to--get an edge wherever they possibly can, I can understand what they went through at that period of time.  Where if you were black, and a dark skinned black, you were at the bottom of the barrel. That's what Big Bill Broonzy wrote that song, 'Black, Brown and Yellow'. [sic, 'Black, Brown and White'] If you, if you white, you all right and if you brown you can stick around.  But if you black, oh brother get back, get back!" [sic, They says if you was white, should be all right \ If you was brown, stick around \ But as you's black, m-mm brother\ git back git back git back] What a true statement that was.  So why would anyone--I often--I'll link this up with--today.  Many blacks are concerned about why other minorities don't come to this country and identify with blacks but identify with whites.  I can perfectly understand that. Why would I go to India and--identify with the untouchables?  I mean, if I want to emigrate some place, why would I come there and--identify with people that--are considered the lowest of the low?  And since black people--and the blacker you are, would consider the lower you are.  I can see their--need and their wish and their--opportunity to seize that opportunity to get away from the--most virulent forms of--segregation.  So I understand that now, and I can understand how they would create that kind of culture for themselves.  At that point in time, I didn't recognize what they were doing, because it just seemed that they were being uppity, and--therefore I didn't like 'em a lot.
Story_ID: 12938
Speaker 1: Now you say your coach died when you were a sophomore--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was twenty. Yeah, I was a sophomore in college.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering what the whole Xavier experience, what you got out of it?  You know, you were majoring what?  Did you have to declare a major?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I was--. I wanted to be a coach.  I was a physical education major.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Now, physical education at Xavier was a lot different from other places.  We took classes with med [medical] students, so we were in very difficult classes.  Kinesiology, physiology, chemistry, and all those, you know, all those courses that you want to run away from, (chuckling).  We were in those kind of classes.  I got a good education in that sense.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  And who, what was, what do you think that whole experience did to you?  You know, you're away from home--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, you had--your life really had been, I don't want to say "47th Street," but your life had been--
Speaker 2: It had been 47th Street, yeah.
Speaker 1: --up to that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I--. You know, here you are in a whole different, really, more or less, it's a whole different culture in many respects--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --the thing that was the same as if you were in sports.  But I'm just wondering, you know, what you would say, in hindsight?  You know, was that exper--? You know, what did you get out of the whole experience?
Speaker 2: I've often thought about it--and it's hard to say because everybody changes over the years.  And in the beginning, I--once I left school, I--thought this was a good experience for me. I was in this kind of cocoon-like existence and it was, and it was overall a good because I could--deal with studies and I could, you know, I could have a social life and--I had a lot of friends and--although the city was segregated, we knew where we could go, and--so it wasn't--. It was--a pretty liberating area. And I was away from the structure of my own home life with all of that negativity attached to it,so it was a good in that sense.  As I move on in life, and look back at it, I thought it was highly paternalistic, highly racist and--surely if--I'd had the brains and the--understanding, I think I would've gone someplace else.  I think I would've attempted to make a--I, I had--I coulda, I had options that I did not exercise because of fear of the--whole issue of race.  I was so afraid of having these--the same kind of negative things happen, so--I'm torn--between they did some good but they also did some harm.
Story_ID: 12939
Speaker 1: When you came back was there any decision about whether to come back to Chicago [Illinois] or not when you graduated?
Speaker 2: No.  There wasn't much of a decision.  I, I knew I was gonna come back to Chicago.  I, I was, when I came back, I--got an opportunity to--play with the Globetrotter organization. [Harlem Globetrotters]. And so, I had that--possibility there.  I was gonna play professional ball and--we played with--I played on the team that was the counter team to the Trotters.  And then, we played on a--we played the southern circuit back in the South again, (laughing).  I thought I'd be going on, I thought I was really gonna be globetrotting. I didn't think globetrotting was gonna be in--Uvalda, Georgia.  But nevertheless, so I--we--would interchange and some nights we'd be the Globetrotters and some nights they'd be the Globetrotters.  So I had that opportunity.  But then I got drafted in the army real fast and that kind of ended the career.
Speaker 1: Okay and so how, now, how long did you serve in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: A year and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I got drafted. A year and a half.
Speaker 1: You got drafted.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh so you only stayed a year and a half?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Interestingly enough, I was teaching school on the side and playing ball and doing anything else I could make a living at.  And there was an exemption at that time that said that if you were vital, if you were in a vital profession--and I remember, I'm in the library one day and I see teaching as a vital profession-and I'm going, "Whoa!  This is terrific."  And I wrote my congressman, and said, "I'm in a vital profession.  I'm teaching school on the West Side of Chicago. That's a vital profession. And I think I ought to be eligible to get out."  And it happened!
Speaker 1: Now where were you--teaching?
Speaker 2: Hess School at Douglas [Boulevard] and St. Louis [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventh and eighth grades.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sports?
Speaker 2: No. No, I was--in the classroom.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the classroom.
Speaker 2: Social studies.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay, so you come back out of the service.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, where were you stationed when you were away?
Speaker 2: Uh, Fort Lenonard Wood [Pulaski County, Missouri] for basic training.  Fort Gordon, Georgia for signal school.  I went to cryptography school, that's coding and decoding messages.  And then, that was another disappointment.  They said, "If you finish one, two in your class, you would get the--post of your choice."  And I finished number one in my class, and I requested civilian status.  Paris, France.  I wanted to travel.  And they sent me pretty close to there.  Fort Benning, Georgia! (laughing).  That's the army for you (laughing)!
Speaker 1: (Laughing).  So, so you get out of the army and then you come back here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I come back and I started teaching school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then, what do you start teaching?
Speaker 2: Back and start teaching school again.
Speaker 1: At Hess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Story_ID: 12940
Speaker 1: And then, now when did you join, when--did you go to Henry Horner? [The Henry Horner Homes, a Chicago public housing development]. That's what I'm just trying to find out.
Speaker 2: Not long after that.  It--around 1960.  Went to Henry Horner.
Speaker 1: And how did that opportunity come up?
Speaker 2: I was--involved with a- lot of the kids. Hess School stood at St. Louis and Douglas Boulevard.  The Vice Lords [Chicago street gang] were on one side of St. Louis and the Cobras [King Cobras, Chicago street gang] were on the other side of St. Louis.  And the school was where the--gangs met.  And there was always these altercations going on between gang members.  And I started to befriend these guys because the--principal had put me and a few other guys-we were young and--you know, I was cut at that time, we were like built and we were like athletic--and so they used to put us at the doors to keep these guys out.  So I developed a relationship with--these gang members.  And we were some of the first guys to pull 'em together.  And after school, I would go and we would sit down and we'd talk to these guys.  And we, "Why all this killing and the fighting and stuff that's going on between you guys?"  And I got interested in doing that.  And so, the next thing you know, I'm out in--at night, I'm in the pool rooms on 16th Street and where, several of us were working with these--kids on the street.  We're just informally working with 'em.  And then someone--and I don't know who--yes, I do know.  It was a guy by the name of Ernie Jenkins, who worked for the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] at the time. Jenkins told me, he says, "You know, there's a job over at the Boys' Club.  It's starting an outreach program.  That's the same thing that you're doing, and they're paying $5,000 a year."  I go, "You gotta be kidding, man.  Five thousand dollars a year?"  I said, "I'm there," 'cause teaching was paying $3,500 a year.  And so I went and joined this project for the Chicago Boys' Club.  It was a demonstration project to work with gangs, in the outpost kind of position.  And so that's where I started my youth work.
Speaker 1: And you--start there.  Now, how long did you work there?  Because you became executive director.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Stayed there two years.
Speaker 1: So, oh!  Just two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so wait. Are we, what year are we in?  I mean, when you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We're in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1960 when you go to Henry Horner or--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, 1960 when I go to Henry Horner.
Speaker 1: Henry Horner.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're at the Henry Horner a year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a year and a half.
Speaker 1: A year and a half,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 12941
Speaker 1: A year and a half,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you go on to the Boys Club.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Then someone told me that there was an, they were opening up this new gym, this boxing gymnasium called the Archie Moore Gym on Pulaski Road, the Better Boys Foundation.  And I--had been involved in boxing for quite some time.  And I thought it was a pretty good idea.  They were looking for an executive director, so I applied.  I was twenty-seven years old at the time.  And they were paying seven thousand dollars a year.  So I'm gone (laughing).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So,
Speaker 2: And I became executive director of that--Boys Club.
Speaker 1: So do you, at that--this, are you, have you given up hope of being a professional athlete at this point?  You're, or even pursuing the athletic?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.  I'd pretty much given up. It was--recreational at that time.  Although I was--we were playing with a strong, very strong AAU [Amateur Athletic Union] team and we were winning all over the place.  I was still playing, very heavily involved in athletics, but you--gotta remember at that time, being an athlete was not that lucrative, you--there wasn't a lot of money involved in it, and--there was--little, precious little opportunity to be in the NBA. [National Basketball Association] because the NBA was mostly white, and there were very few black athletes in it and the black athletes there came from very major colleges.  So I had kind of given that up as a possibility and I didn't want to go back with the--[Harlem] Globetrotter organization.  I didn't want to do that.
Speaker 1: So you--started with the Boys--when you took the job at, with the--,
Speaker 2: Boys, Chicago Boys Club?
Speaker 1: Chicago Boys' Club--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was 1960?
Speaker 2: Sixty.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: 1960.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that--Was that where you getting paid seven thousand dollars a year?
Speaker 2: No, at Better Boys Foundation.
Speaker 1: Better Boys' Foundation.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was paid seven thousand a year.
Speaker 1: That's, okay.
Speaker 2: That's '62. [1962]
Speaker 1: In '62.
Speaker 2: In 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--were there how long?
Speaker 2: At the Better Boys Foundation? From 1962 to 1973.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And what--do you think during that time that you accomplished that you were most proud of, with--Better Boys' Foundation?
Speaker 2: Well, that was in--1962 to 1973 were watershed times for me, because that was the middle of the Civil Rights Movement, the Civil Rights Movement came north.  And I had been involved in this, some of the civil rights activities in the South, and so I was involved with all the stuff that was going on.  I was one of the--leaders in the community at that time.  The Panthers had their breakfast program at our place.  Congressman Bobby Rush was a [Black]Panther.  Fred Hampton [Black Panther leader] and I were very good friends and we were close to each other. And, so the Panthers had their meetings, at my place was opened up to all these radical groups.  SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] used to come and have meetings at our place.  I was still involved in the movement going down South and voter registration, and so I'd made pretty much of a reputation of being a rebel on, you know, using this Boys' Club as the--.
Story_ID: 12942
Speaker 1: This is sort of a hot bed of activity.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know here. Can you describe--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] during that time?  You know--.
Speaker 2: Well, my Chicago.  I can describe my Chicago, which was mainly the West Side of Chicago at that time. Many radical components over there, the Panthers were there, the Deacons for Defense [Deacons for Defense and Justice] were there.  They used to meet at--our place.  So there was--all this furor going on around civil rights, 1965 or '66 [1966].  There was a fire station on Wilcox [Street] and Pulaski Road. And we were picketing the station for saying there were no black firemen, and you--know, either you gotta put black firemen in here or we're gonna--. So I was involved with an--a guy by the name of Doug Andrews and a number of organizational people were Landry [Lawrence Landry, civil rights activist] and a number of people were around that--issue. Somebody pulls a--false alarm, and the hook-and-ladder comes out and nobody's on the ladder portion of it.  And the ladder swings around and kills a woman waiting for the bus. And the fire commissioner made some insensitive remark about this woman dying there, and accused us of perpetrating this kind of thing.  Well, the community went up for grabs.  That was the first riot that took place on the West Side of Chicago.  Of course, the next one was--Dr. [Martin Luther] King's assassination when the place just totally went up for grabs.  And that was--so the furor was already there.  You could see it percolating every day.  You could just see it.  You could see them, the gangs becoming a lot more militant in their thinking, a lot more politicized in their--thinking.  And even with their--need to crush each other, the [Black] Panthers were there to kind of temper that kind of thing and they were trying to make--I was involved in trying to bring the gangs closer to the Panthers. And there was this conflict between the Panthers saying that we're revolutionaries, and the gangs saying,  "Well, we're opportunists.  We want to make money and you all are talking about revolution and we're talking about making some money."  So there was a dichotomy of thought in--with these two very voracious groups of young men trying to find their way in life.  And we were in the middle of that.  We were in the middle of that whole movement, one on the Civil Rights Movement on one side, the other side, you got gang members who are trying to assert themselves.
Speaker 1: Now where did, what where were the politicians in this?  Were any of them, you know, supportive or active during that time? And who were they?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were on the West Side?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Ben Lewis was an alderman.  [U.S. Representative] George [W.] Collins became a congressman.  They were active.  Although they were part, you see, the West Side at that time, that was--Jake Arvey's [Jacob 'Jack' Arvey, alderman of Chicago's 24th Ward] area, that was the old West Side Jewish area.  And when, in the--'60s,[1960s] the politician that I just mentioned-not Collins-who I just said, Ben--Lewis.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Lewis.
Speaker 2: Ben Lewis, a very colorful character. [Charles] Charlie Chew also on the South Side.  Ralph Metcalf later on came in on this--situation.  They were--starting to operate. Samuel Raynor (ph.).  Because there were some blacks entering in the, into the political agen--arena at that time, and they were supportive.  Ben Lewis really was the politician's politician.  Ben Lewis said, "Wait a minute now.  The way the game goes is when I'm the alderman, I run--I'm the committeeman and I also run the policy racket and the gambling also over here, and you got to come to me for this."  And this kind of stuff.  Well, he was promptly assassinated in his office on Roosevelt Road.  They took care of him real fast.  George Collins [George Washington Collins, 1925-1972] took over as the alderman and he was kind of the mild mannered person.  But George I knew very well.  And George--although his manner was quiet, George knew what was going on.  He knew what was happening and he knew what he wanted to do. He ended up being congressman, died in a plane crash at Midway Airport [Chicago, Illinois]  His wife [Cardiss Collins] then took over and became congressman for a lot of years. But yes, there were a few politicians who understood.  When--Metcalf made his break with Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, of course, how can I forget [Mayor] Harold [Washington] who was always outside and kind of leading the banner of the loyal opposition, Metcalf still being inside, but when he broke with--Mayor Daley, I think that opened the whole thing up.
Speaker 1: Now what did? Did the Muslims come into play at all on the West Side?  Were they?
Speaker 2: The Muslims were active, but the Muslims were largely a South Side organization, because Elijah Mohammad was--over there.  And I don't think the--although there were, I don't even know if there was a mosque over there.  So I think it was a lot more difficult for them over there.  And you gotta remember, the Muslims, although they talked about being for the poor and the oppressed, and they were, I'm--not arguing that they were not what they were saying had a lot more middle-class overtones to it than did--what the Panthers appealed to.  It was like, "Man, we're gonna do this," you know.  Dr. King also, you got to--you can't say that he was not inserted, because I was a part of the committee that worked on finding him a place when he came north to--Chicago for his--campaign here in Chicago.  We found him a place on the West Side on Albany Avenue. So I was like pulled in various kinds of directions.  But it was most exciting, and I was learning so much about myself and about--what was happening.  The militant--the anger of--all those years and all those kind of oppressions that--I had suffered. It was such a good place to put it, because we were able to focus it and put it into some constructive work.  It's like anger is like fire.  You can light a match and burn a building down or, it's like gasoline--you can light a match and burn a building down or you can put it in a car and drive to California.  And I thought what we were doing at that time was putting it in a gas tank and--doing something positive on that level.  And we were picketing out here, the school system.  Al Raby [civil rights leader] was--Al and I taught together.  And so he was involved in civil rights organizing.  And we were all just, we were all working toward that same goal, to try to change the city.  Now, I don't know what we were changing it for.  But we just wasn't gonna keep it like it was.  It was too oppressive.

Speaker 1: And what, do you have any favorite sort of [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] story to share?  You know, that your, you know, interaction, did you interact with him? Right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  My admiration for Dr. King came not with public pronouncements but what--when I was in audiences with him, and how he conducted himself.  That meant more to me than anything.  His stance on nonviolence and his stance of--loving your enemy made sense to me, although--I had great affection for the--[Black] Panthers, and I had great affection for the way they were doing, and Malcolm [X], of course, I had great affection for him.  King always made sense to me.  I--because I thought that integration--and I still believe it--that integration is really the ultimate answer to this issue.  And Dr. King was moving toward that.  I--that made sense to me.  And the rest of 'em really didn't make a lot of sense to me.  Being segregated or separating myself and I define segregation as a greater power telling a lesser power where they can live, work, do whatever they--separation is when two equals decide that they don't want to relate to each other.  And I never understood separation, because if you're in an inferior position, you can't dictate where you're gonna get separated to.  So that's--all that is, in my judgment, is resegregation.  Dr. King's notion of integration made sense because, if you--if one believes in one's self, then one should not be concerned about competing, you know, on every level.  And that's what Dr. King was talking about and that made--great sense to me.  So I had--an enormous amount of--admiration for his ability to--control himself and to stay with the course of integration.  I don't know whether he said this publicly or where it was said, but I know it got stuck in my head, and I'm not sure who--said it.  Someone was talking about--we were discussing the issue of black people in this country and who are we.  Are we an ethnic group?  And I maintain that we're really not an ethnic group in the classic sense of an ethnic group.  We don't have a common language.  We don't have a common religion.  We don't have a common place, using the example of the Irish or the Italians, they can go back and see people that are like them who speak a similar kind of language to them, and then they can come back to America and they can associate this.  Blacks are the only group in this country who do not have that advantage.  The religious aspect of it, we're everything.  The language thing. We speak no language--I mean, Ebonics-but I mean, we speak no language that is outside of that.  There is no way that we can communicate with each other.  Our traditions are not hundreds of years old.  So therefore, there's no--traditional thing that brings us all together.  We've been so regionalized, that--even blacks in different regions don't share the same kind of cultural bonds.  So we are attempting to make something out of something that is not there.  We are--and I heard this somewhere and I concurred with it--we are essentially the bastard children of white America.  And--that's a chilling thought, and a lot of people maybe not want to embrace it.  But we have been treated like bastard children in this country.  So we have been treated like what we are in this country.  If you take us and look--at our bloodlines.  If you took our bloodlines, and--look at our basic bloodlines, if you physiologically look at our bloodlines, anthropologically look at our bloodlines, we're a mixture in this country.  Even in South Africa, they separated the blacks, coloreds, and whites, they didn't do that in this country, with the one drop of black blood thing, with the Plessy v. Ferguson [1896] situation.  So, here we are in this country--not cultureless, but certainly not with long-term culture-and the building blocks that--other ethnic groups have.  So therefore, it seemed to me that integration was really our only salvation; that we had to integrate ourselves into the--American culture, if, indeed, we had selected to stay here.  Then that was our major salvation, to be able to integrate into the culture and support ourselves by--rising up to the level of the culture, or going down to the depths of the culture.  Whatever, whichever way the culture went, that's the way we had to go, because we really did not have a choice.  We couldn't go back to Italy; we couldn't go to Israel; we couldn't go to Ireland; we couldn't go back to England; we couldn't go back to Germany.  Where other ethnic groups, although they did not elect to do this, had that option and would have been welcomed back into that country, we have no place of welcome on that level.  So Dr. King made so much sense to me, that if I'm gonna--take these few years that I have in life, these few precious years that we are given on this earth, then I better focus it on where I'm gonna be (chuckle) rather than where someone thinks I should be, where I'm definitely not gonna be welcome, (laughing).
Speaker 1: Now you--.
Speaker 2: I don't know whether that makes sense but that was what made sense to me in my mind and that's what attracted me to the movement.
Story_ID: 12944
Speaker 1: Now I, you know, I want to move to like 1968 where, you know, you got involved with Daddy-O Daylie. [Holmes 'Daddy-O' Daylie, Chicago radio personality].  I mean Daddy-O Daylie was a figure.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There--A prominent figure here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now was he, had he owned a bowling alley?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: He owned a bowling alley.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he owned a bowling alley.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay,
Speaker 2: On the West Side.  On the South Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, he--right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Daddy-O Daylie was a--well known--jazz disk jockey in town.  Daddy-O's name was all over the place in the black community.  He was well known.  He was also an entrepreneur.  He owned a bowling alley.  He used to give a lot of charitable events and was a bon vivant all around town.  I knew Daddy-O Daylie because I used to come on his radio program, and he had a real sense--of--social consciousness.  He used to give turkeys away at Christmastime, and do a lot of the things that were charitable.  And since I was in that--the business of--charity-I was in a Boys Club-our paths crossed each other.  That's how that happened.  So when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, Daddy-O called me up, and he said, "They've been calling me at Channel 7 [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois], asking me to come down and talk to them in the midst of the--" Dr. King had just been assassinated and there was a threat that the riot was gonna take place, and they want to talk to some people.  So Daddy-O called me, and he called Herb Kent [Chicago radio personality], and he called Vernon Jarrett [journalist and radio personality].  And we went down to Channel 7 to have this conversation about what television could do.  Now, I had had some experience in television in the sense that white reporters would call me up and ask me what was going on in the community.  And I was also a helpmate to them in saying, "You ought to talk to this guy.  You ought to talk to that guy.  You gotta talk to this fellow.  You ought to talk to there.  Here's these people."  And in some instances, I'd gather them at my Boys Club and they'd come there, and they would have kind of safe passage, they believed, to--get their reports out.  So I--Daddy-O knew this.  And so, they decided that we would put on a live television show the night after Dr. King was assassinated, to see if these black community leaders could stop the black community from rioting because of Dr. King.  And we were arrogant enough to believe somehow, we'd get on television and say, "Okay, all you folks stop rioting now because we're on TV and we're telling you to stop rioting."  Well, of course, the riot went on.  But the ratings were pretty big on this show called 'Stop'.  And all of us were sitting up there talking about--what was going on.  And some weeks later, I got a call from the--then general manager at that station, [WLS-TV, Chicago] who said, "We want--we're thinking about doing something on a more permanent basis, maybe a little talk show or something.  We're not quite sure what we want to do.  And would you be interested in it?"  And I can honestly say to you that it didn't mean that much to me.  It was like, "Okay, why not?"  You know, it was kind of fun.  I, you know, I--a few of my friends had seen me on television and it was like fun, and so I said, "Okay."  And it ended--. I was not gonna be on television, I was supposed to produce, bring, I was supposed to bring the Fred Hamptons [deputy chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party] and all of my crowd over there, you know, all those crazy folks over on the West Side [of Chicago].  I was supposed to bring them as guests and Daddy-O would interview 'em and Vernon Jarrett would interview 'em.  Vernon didn't want to do it, and Daddy-O didn't want to do it, and Herb Kent, I--don't know the story, depending on how--, who tells the story, Herb Kent somehow didn't get in the mix.  And I suspect it was kind of a rivalry between Daddy-O and Herb at the time that--it created that kind of little rift there.  So they said, "Okay, Warner, you do it for a couple weeks."  And the--show was called, 'For Blacks Only.' And there we were in 1968 doing this little half hour talk show, Daddy-O and me, on the community.  The reason it was called, 'For Blacks Only,' is because we were doing parody on the "For colored only" signs.  And so, we're not gonna be for colored only, we're gonna be for blacks only.  Because black people are not colored people anymore.  We're black and that's how that got started.  And I went from there to--did a couple of other things.  At Channel 44 [WSNS-TV, Chicago], I did a talk show with a woman by--the name of Mary Jane Odell [media journalist] in 1970, I believe it was.  And when was--Fred [Hampton] assassinated?  1970 [sic, 1969].  No, what am I telling? 1970.  Sixty eight [1968], '70 [1970]--.  Fred [Hampton] was assassinated in '69 [1969].  I think he was assassinated in 1969.  Fred Hampton was assassinated in 1969.  And Edward V. Hanrahan was the state's attorney.  That was the guy.  And Gloves Davis, the policeman, the black policeman, those are the people that went in and blew him away.  And I'm doing this little talk show from Channel 44, and I'm still running my Boys Club and doing all the rest of this stuff.  Hanrahan is our guest that night on TV, and I'm the--co-host, and there's Hanrahan sitting there.  Darth Vader [villain of movie series 'Star Wars'] the--this is George Wallace! [Governor of Alabama, candidate for U.S. President, staunch segregationist]. This is everybody into one.  And we had a confrontation of the highest order, I mean, it was like, Hanrahan's brother, after the thing was over, said, "We're gonna get you.  We're gonna get you."  And, of course my point was, at that time, you got to bring ass to kick ass, man.  You gonna get me.  You better watch out for me 'cause I'm gonna get you."  I mean, I was in that kind of spirit at that period of time.  And that kind of started my career in television. Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Ill.] called on me to start doing this show called 'Common Ground.'  And then, in 1973, I left the Better Boys' Foundation and joined, and became a full time manager of community affairs at Channel 2, WBBM.  And along with it came this little show in the middle of the night called 'Common Ground' that nobody really cared about, because there were no ratings [Nielsen TV ratings] after midnight, so they told me, "You could just do whatever you want.  Just fill it up with whoever you want to fill it up with, and, 'cause nobody's watching it anyway and it doesn't make any difference."  And so, I filled it up with the people that I knew: the Fred Hamptons, and the Harold Washingtons, and the Ralph Metcalfs and the--radical people off the streets and the common folk.  And the show started getting a following.  And within four years, we were--beating 'Kup' [Irv Kupcinet, newspaper columnist and media personality] for the Emmy [Chicago Emmy Award, awarded by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.]  And we were beating all the people on John Callaway. [Rival talk show host of Chicago Tonight].  We were beating everybody for the Emmy, and we won four straight Emmys one year, one--during one stretch, doing this show with no resources, 'cause they weren't giving us any resources (chuckling), and I'm still running the Community Affairs Department and doing this little talk show.  And it became pretty obvious that--you know, we had something going for ourselves.  WBBM didn't see it that way, so I left, (laughing).
Story_ID: 12945
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  When did you decide, because you're--? It's not like you, you know, you were a child and, you know, looking at Edward R. Murrow [broadcast journalist] and saying, you know I want to be just like him.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you entered in a whole different way.  So I, you know, my question for you is, at what time did you decide that you would take this, take it seriously?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question. Because it was--my own militancy that created that.  There was a general manager that came there, came to WBBM [Chicago, Illinois] in 1979.  And I was at that time--my--community affairs department won that year twenty- three [Chicago] Emmys.  We won more Emmys than the News Department won, and we had no resources.  I had a talk show going that won Emmys.  I had--programming that gone--I--had a children's program called the 'Good Gang Express' of which I was the host.  And I'm winning Emmys all over the place.  In 1979, I won three Emmys that night of the television show.  So I went to this general manager, and I said,  "I think I have some qualities that might--could I think about moving into this, into the news area?"  I said, "I think I have, I think I can learn this business."  And he promptly told me that I was too old and that, 'cause I was in my mid forties.  And he said, "You're too old to get into this business.  First place, it's a young man's business and you'll be retired before anything ever happens." And he said, "Secondly, follow me."  He said, "I'm gonna be a big timer in this business."  That's essentially what he told me. And he said, "And I'll bring you along with me."  And he said, "Maybe someday you might even be sitting here in this place."  And I saw that nun sittin' there, (laughing).  You know, telling me again, paternalistically, you can't do this and you can't do that.  And I went downstairs and I wrote out my--resignation, and I brought it back upstairs.  Typed it up, had my secretary type it up, and I brought it back upstairs.  And he says, "You're making a big mistake."  And I said, "Well, my mistake."  And then I went and told my wife [Sadako Saunders].  That wasn't easy 'cause we had a little baby, a little child and--she wasn't working.  And--I just, I just wasn't gonna do that.  You know that, as I said, that white man made me mad.  And, it was weird because the man who was the general manager here--a guy by the name of Monty Newman was the general manager at the time-and he asked, "Who's this guy winning, this community affairs guy winning all these Emmys?  Who is this guy?"  And there was a man working here by the name of Dillon Smith [broadcaster and journalist at WMAQ-TV/NBC, Chicago] who was the program director, and he knew me because my producer and him were friends.  And they said, "Well, let's get this guy over here."  You know, and all of these conversations went on, and we started talking about this.  And I--thought I was coming over here to do a talk show and do essentially the same thing I did before.  And they said, "No, we want--you to do news.  We want you to anchor the news and--be a reporter."  I had never reported in my life, nor had I ever anchored in my life, and I was thrown in 1980, as an anchor and a reporter, never having done any one of those things.  It was--.
Story_ID: 12946
Speaker 1: So what are the trained, journalists saying?  Are they envious of you at this point, Warner?  Are they?
Speaker 2: When you--it's kind of like being--thrown into the major leagues.  You're in the major leagues. Nobody is really gonna help you.  You just out there, and either you learn it or you don't learn it.  And there are--there's a couple guys, couple people down there right now, a guy by the name of David Gay (ph.), I've got to give him credit.  He was here. [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, Ill.]  And they'd give me an assignment and I had, I didn't have the slightest idea what I was doing, and I'd go to David, who had been a reporter.  And I'd say, "David, what do I do?"  And--he would go, "Okay, you, here's how you start to write. What's the story?" And he would help me to prewrite the story.  And then, "What do I do with the cameraman?"  He'd say, "Well, here's what you tell the cameraman to do."  And I'd go out, and I'd have all these notes, and I'd make notes, and I'd ask the cameraman to do this, and--I slowly started to learn.  And then I'd watch tapes of everybody who was reporting.  I'd spend hours and hours and hours watching--reporters, copying down what they said, how they put it together.  And I'd watch the nightly news and see what they were doing.  And then I'd watch all the anchors and see how they would do things and say things and--that's how I learned.  It was through the pain of making mistakes and learning.  Now, you would ask the question, well, why would they even, why would they even try me?  Well, I had a very large reputation at that time, and I carried with me a large constituency.  So they figured, what we can do is, we'll transfer that constituency and we'll teach him how to do the mechanics of the situation.  They didn't tell me it was gonna take five or six years to learn this thing.  And, as I look back on it, I told my wife [Sadako Saunders] one time, I says, "You know, if I knew how much pain I was gonna have to go through to learn this business, I would've never done it, because fear would have held me back, from--ever even attempting to make the start."  Because I knew nothing!  I was zero,  I was a clean slate.  Absolutely nothing.  And can you imagine the terror of going out with people of various stripes, some who would be helpful, others who would want to see you fall on your face?  I remember a guy, a cameraman, left me.  He had--another cameraman in training with him.  And we were all riding in the truck together. And he put me out of the truck because he said, "You know, it's against the rules to have three people in the truck."  There were some kind of rules.  We're like way out in East Jesus and he just left me out there, you know.  And I didn't know enough to even say, "Hey, you know, you can't do this to me."  So it was--various kind of responses.  But there were some people down there who were helpful, who said, "You know, you've got an opportunity. We think you got something going for yourself and, well, I'll help you out."  I, for--I'm eternally grateful to--people who did that, 'cause there would have been no way that I would have made it.  And then there were others.  We didn't have teleprompters at that time.  And there were--some people who--. We had a teleprompter, but there were some people who would even change the words on the teleprompter, just to throw me off.  And I'm dyslexic so that--also didn't help matters either.  But I was determined that this was not going to beat me.  No way.
Story_ID: 12947
Speaker 1: And how do you think? Do you think you have a facility for this and that made it easier?  Do you think that? I mean, you say that I wouldn't have done it, you know--if I had known it was gonna be--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --five or six years of pain.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Yeah. Well, do I have a facility for pain (laughing)?
Speaker 1: No, not for pain.  I mean, (laughing).
Speaker 2: I don't think I'm any--I don't think I'm unusual in any way.  I think I have the same amount of fears.  But the--one thing that I have done over the years is I've--really been in the self-development business.  I realized that coming out of such a damaged childhood, and I can--give my wife credit for that, because she knew she married a damaged soul.  And--she'd always encourage me to--go to self--help groups, and to begin to learn about my own addictions, and my own frailties, and the crazies that--were brought from childhood. And I think that's the thing that really has gotten me over and helped to--temper my soul, if you would have it that way.  To better understand some one else, if I can better understand that person, and finally, to ultimately get the nigger out of me.  Because, you know, when you're a racist, when you believe you're inferior, you got the nigger in you.  So when somebody calls you a nigger, and it hurts you, then that's the nigger in you that hurts you. That's what it was in me, and it hurt me, used to hurt me.  I remember several years ago, some guy--I was someplace doing some story and this guy, "You nigger so and so!"  And I did a real gut check.  And it's like--it didn't bother me. It's like, you know, you might as well call me a kangaroo.  I'm not a kangaroo!  You know, if you choose to call me a kangaroo, that's your business.  You choose to call me a nigger, that's your business.  And I knew I was making progress in that area when it actually, you know, not intellectually did it not bother me, but it didn't bother me down there in the gut.  And I knew I was getting free of that, of those years of--feelings of inferiority.

Speaker 1: You were talking about 'Donahue'? [TV talk show, hosted by Phil Donahue]
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were saying that--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Donahue used to come to me all the time and say, "You know, Warner, you've got a facility, man."  He said, "You really got a talent in this area."  And he said, "You ought to," he said, "you ought to do something about this."  And I remember I went to this general manager [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] and I said, "You know, I could do a talk show like Donahue."  And he would like went, (sigh).  Like that, (sigh),  and here is the regret.  The regret is that I believed him!  That was the regret.  And I, and, and, and I used to blame him for many years for not doing it.  But I blame myself for not having enough confidence to say I know better than you.  I know that I got something here that could be expanded in the--and this was pre-Oprah days. [Oprah Winfrey, TV talk show host] And I said I know I got something here, because I got too much good feedback about it.  I knew this was something, it was like it felt good, it felt all right.  And I--and, but I said, no, he knows better than I do. These executives, they know better than I do.  They know more about this than I do.  They were saying at that point, talk shows aren't gonna go anywhere.  And I believed it!

Speaker 1: You know, this is the same thing.  The station is not--I'm back at Channel 2 [from 1973-1980; WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], but they're not really valuing what you have.  But in the black community, your stature is going up--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --and up and up.  Because this is a big deal.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  For--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They had never, it had--people have come and told me this.  I didn't see it as a big deal at the time.  But what--how they felt, when they saw me on air, challenging [John] Ehrlichman [former government official and Watergate figure] or--some, you know, some big politician.  They had never seen a black guy go at a, you know, head to head. Or having the Ku Klux Klan on the air and the American Nazi Party and going head to head with these guys.  They had never saw a kind of an egalitarian thing going on, because most of the talk shows, at that point, they were black talk shows.  And it's not casting any aspersions on anyone's talk show, but most of 'em were kind of like a love fest, you know.  If you came on and you were black, you know, it was like you gonna get a pass.  Well, [Reverend] Jesse [Jackson] would come on and we would like fight like cats and dogs.  I mean, one time he was supposed to make a plane, and we were like fighting with each other so much, and they kept, "You got to go Jesse."  "Yeah, I ain't leaving.  You think I'm gonna leave and let this guy get the better of me?"  I mean, we would like, go at it.  My point was, I'm gonna be fair.  You ain't--I don't care if you're black, white, no matter who you are, I'm getting on your case if this thing is go. And I don't think the black community, especially, nor the white community had ever seen that, at that time in this city [Chicago, Illinois].  It's not that it was revolutionary.  It's just I was maybe one of the first to do it.  And since I didn't know what I was doing, I mean, I didn't even know all of this stuff was happening, that it was going on, that this reputation was being built.  I was just doing it 'cause I thought that was the right thing to do.
Speaker 1: Well, were you doing much public speaking or anything around that time?
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: When you worked, what, worked for community affairs, what was the role there at the station?  This was something that was imposed by the federal government?
Speaker 2: That's right, so, I mean, you know, it was a rubber chicken kind of events and dinners [circuit of charitable events and fundraisers which served, typically, chicken].  And letting people know that the community, that the station was there for the community.  So I was doing that kind of stuff.  I mean, I was out a lot, but I wasn't doing anything that I considered--that important.

Speaker 1: When did you meet and get married to Sadako [Saunders]?  I mean, I know you didn't get to meet and marry her at the same time (laughing).
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: When did you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I met her--in 1970.  I was at one of my other part time jobs.  I was--teaching at Northeastern [Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois] , on the North Side. And she was getting her master's, and she wandered into my class.  That was the biggest mistake she ever made.  (Laughing) She wandered into my class, and then took the class the next season.  And, after we got out of the class, she, we met each other.  We--I don't know how we ran into each other again, and started talking.  And then the rest is history.  We got married in 1973.
Speaker 1: Now, she's--.
Speaker 2: Japanese.
Speaker 1: Japanese?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  So what was that whole thing like?  You know, because you're, was that, was there anything about, you know, her being of a different--?
Speaker 2: (Laughing). Oh, my God.
Speaker 1: What was--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was like--to some of my friends who were in the movement, it was like I had betrayed the movement by marrying someone out of my race.  And I always countered in my mind, how can we become what we are fighting against?  The very thing that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] said was, that we were to talk about, this was freedom that we were dealing with here.  Well, how can you--fight for freedom, on one hand, and then tell me I can't be free to do whatever I want to do?  That's a, that to me is an inconsistency. It's an oxymoron.  And only a moron would--think that way.  So I lost a lot of friends in that--arena when Sadako and I got married.  They saw that as a, many of my friends, some of my friends saw that as a sellout to the movement. But I didn't care, because this was the person I love, and you know, I had been in a bad marriage before, and I kind of felt, man, you lucky to find anybody that loves you and you love them.  And if anybody, I'm--grateful for that.  And I--you all can really go to hell.  It doesn't make me any difference.  And then I also identify with Sadako, because Sadako was born in an internment camp in Topaz, Utah.  Her uncle volunteered for--the war [World War II].  And while they were in the internment camp, he was in Italy and got killed in the war, and his family was in an internment camp.  Her father, Sadiochi (ph.) would not sign the--agreement that the United States wanted Japanese-Americans to sign, that is to say, that they're loyal to the United States and they'd fight against--they'd fight for the United States.  He wrote down no, no!  He was not--and his point was I'm an American citizen.  Why don't you--you didn't ask the Germans to do this.  You didn't ask the Italians to do this.  Why are you asking me to do it?  So they promptly put him on a boat and sent him back to Japan.  So she [Sadako Saunders] was in Hiroshima [Japan]--right after--the war, and then ultimately came back here.  And then they immigrated to Chicago and I met her as an adult.  So we had--we were both two ghetto kids in that sense, who had gone through--. I saw I had more in common with her than I did with some of the young women that I had met in New Orleans [Louisiana], who were quote upper class mulatto women, who--never--I--so we immediately clicked and--it's been that way for twenty-eight years.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  Now did you think, the exposure to Japanese culture, has that influenced your life or affected you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  It's had an enormous effect on me.  It' s one of the reasons that I can understand when--I talked a little bit about us being an ethnic group.  When compared to the Japanese as an ethnic group and comparing blacks as an ethnic group, there's there's not even any comparison.  I really didn't understand ethnicity and what it meant, the Japaneseness that is in my wife and the years of tradition and the beliefs that they hold.  And it had a great deal of effect on me. Her mother had a great deal of effect on me.  Tomeko Nishomoro (ph.) was her name, she just died a couple years ago.  She had a great deal of effect on me. They all had been in an internment camp.  And I remember when we got married, her mother--came to me right after we had gotten married.  She didn't hardly know me, she didn't, I was just Sadako's husband.  And she said, "You are ichiban."  You are the man of the family now because Sadiochi was dead.  And she said, "You're the man in the family, you are the head of the family."  And I'm like, "The head of the family!"  (Laughing)  What's she talking about, the head of the family?  You know, I can't--even run myself and I'm the head of the family," you know.  And she was getting criticism because the Japanese generally are very xenophobic people, and she got some criticism from some people that were friends of hers when they were in internment camp together.  And she closed her door to them and would never let 'em back in her house again.  You know, it was, I mean, I was like, that kind of loyalty, I had never seen that kind of loyalty in my life.  I'm going, "Jesus Christ!"  Man, I mean, that's amazing stuff!  It was that kind of loyalty that ethnicity brings on, that I had never seen before.  And her point was, this is the way the system is; if you're in the system, this is the way it is.  Anybody doesn't like it, they're out of the system.  And when I saw her turn her back on all of these people and say, "You know, I'm in your corner," what are you gonna do? You know?  What are you gonna do but deal with it?
Speaker 1: Now how did your mother [Georgia Saunders] react?
Speaker 2: My mother's a racist.  You know, she still is.  In--she believes in her own inferiority.  This is not to--I'm only making a statement, I'm not saying this is bad or good.  She couldn't handle it, because she just--. It was--. She--. To this day, we are estranged in that sense.  It's like it's a distance.  She never got to know her grandson because of that, because she couldn't get past that point.  But that's what happens with people who are racist on either side.  They can't get past that point.  And she was never been able to get past it and therefore she communicated that in--all kinds of different ways.  Maybe not in words; her words said one thing, but her actions belied it.  And so, therefore, it set a chasm up between us that will never be--. The gap will never be--. On the other hand, my mother-in-law, as soon as my son [Warner Saunders, Jr.] was born, she took him in and loved him.  I mean, it's just their relationship until she died was just awesome!  Awesome!  It is what I wished, you know, that my mother had, but never happened.  But, you know, in life you can't get everything you want.
Story_ID: 12951
Speaker 1: And your son, his name?
Speaker 2: Warner.
Speaker 1: Warner.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He's, he's Junior.
Speaker 1: He's Junior.  Now was he--when you raised him, did you raise him understanding his dual ethnicity?
Speaker 2: I don't think we did anything.  I mean, I just think we just lived, and he saw what he saw.  I think he identifies himself as a black person.  When he went off to college, he went to Tulane [University] in New Orleans [Louisiana], interestingly enough.  He was--when--the blacks, when the--you know, he had a white roommate his freshman year.  The black students, of course, were giving him pressure.  You know, you got to be with the blacks, or you got to be with the whites.  So I have little respect for these universities, because they don't, they talk a lot of business about diversity, but they don't really deal with diversity.  Most of 'em don't deal with diversity and it's shameful, because it's a perfect opportunity to really deal with the diverse culture. And they don't deal with it a lot, so he was really torn between, and he left.  Went off campus and moved and lived off campus.  So he really could have stayed right here and went to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and gotten the same kind of education. I-- he identifies himself as a--black person, but his love for his mother [Sadako Saunders] and his grandmother are unshakeable.  So I, you know, and he has a Japanese name, which he is now starting to use.  He's Akira-- is his Japanese name that his grandmother gave him.  So he uses that name now in his profession. Akira.
Speaker 1: And he's an entertainer.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Now he works for Puff Daddy.
Speaker 1: Oh, he does!
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughing).
Speaker 1: (Laughing) Okay.  That's--well, at least he still has a job.  Puff Daddy--.
Speaker 2: No, he doesn't.
Speaker 1: He does, he does, he'll want me to explain that he--and another guy have a--business called Blue Flame Media.  And they do marketing for Puff Daddy but they're inside of the Bad Boy Entertainment conglomerate that Puff Daddy is--involved in.  So he's in New York doing that now.
Story_ID: 12952
Speaker 1: Now, I want to--go back to when you really would say your--broadcasting career began. You would say 1980, in some respects.
Speaker 2: On the news level, yeah.
Speaker 1: On the news level.
Speaker 2: Yeah--.  1980 was--that time.
Speaker 1: So now what, when you look back over this last twenty years, what are the stories that you've been involved in?  Or the, you know, things that you've done that you are most proud of?  I mean, you've won how many, sixteen Emmys [Chicago Emmys awarded by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences].
Speaker 2: Seventeen--but who's counting?  (Laughing)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I don't know.  (Laughing)
Speaker 2: One of the things about racism in this society that is--pervasive that I'm- and I'm getting to this-but one of the things about racism that is pervasive in our society, when you're on either side, is the belief in your lack of worthiness.  If you are a racist on the black side using that, you never believe that you are worthy of what you have.  If you are a racist on the white side, you never believe that the black is worthy of what they have, that they are affirmative action babies.  That [Reverend] Jesse Jackson got 'em the job.  That, whatever it may be, it is never your talent, your effort, your work, your all of the things that you have done to arrive at this point. That is all negated, you know.  That there should be another rule and there should be another standard.  But when I started to lose my racism, which was maybe fifteen years ago, I started to believe in my own value.  And that what was cream for the cat was cream for the kitten.  And that I was gonna use the same rules that they use to get where I want to go.  That is often called being pushy, being whatever it is, being unfair.  It's like saying, "You know, you' re tying my hand behind my back, and then we're gonna have a boxing match and--you got two hands, and you're punching me all over the place and I wrestle my arm free.  And now I got both hands free, and I punch you out, and you say, that's unfair.  So I have seen that kind of thing develop.  That is the kind of racism that we deal with today in this place and in most every other media shop around this country in business, any other business alike.  Saying that, I'm, I'll tell you what, I--think [Nelson] Mandela. The visit to South Africa with--Nelson Mandela was an amazing--experience for me.  To see--again, ethnicity conquering and what an ethnic group can do when they come together.  Language, common language.  Of course, he's from the Transkei.  But--nevertheless--. The Transvaal. But, nevertheless, he was a South African who--had so much when in--terms of learning about Nelson Mandela, when I saw him walk out of that prison, I was standing out in front of Victor Verster prison [renamed Klein Drakenstein Correctional Centre, South Africa] when he walked out of the prison with those, with the twelve other men-Walter Sisilu [also a South African civil rights activist and fellow prisoner with Nelson Mandela].  And they walked out, they walked out in the--order in which they went to prison.  Walter Sisilu walked out first.  He was in twenty--eight years.  Mandela was second and they went on down through that.  Gaby Magomola walked out.  When they walked out of that prison, they were all dressed up in suits and shirts and ties, and they hit the ground runnin'.  That was--What a proud moment to see.  You know, Whew!  Man!  Here is a guy that, you know, they couldn't break him!  It was impossible for them to break him!  It was--such an inspiration to me to see that kind of thing happen, to see him--walk out of that prison.  And--I knew at that point, this man's gonna be president of this country. It's gonna happen, you know, there's no question about it, it's over with.  So that was a watershed event in my life.  That happened in 1990 [sic, February, 1991].
Speaker 1: How did you get that assignment?
Speaker 2: I asked for it.  I went to 'em [WMAQ-TV/NBC, Chicago, Illinois] and told them that I thought that that would be a worthy trip to take.  That this was a major, major, happening in history and we ought to be there.  And I reminded them that a reporter had been sent to Sarajevo [formerly in Yugoslavia, now Bosnia and Herzegovina].  And that when European things took place, they had no hesitation putting them on the plane.
Speaker 1: Do you think you would have done that ten years earlier?
Speaker 2: No--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No--I don't think so.
Story_ID: 12953
Speaker 1: Now, when you first started [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, Illinois], you were doing sports though, right?
Speaker 2: No, I was doing news.  And then--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh!
Speaker 2: --a woman by the name of, what's that girl's name?  Deborah.
Speaker 1: Deborah Norville?
Speaker 2: Deborah Norville came here.
Speaker 1: Okay--.
Speaker 2: And,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh she has a, Okay, don't--.
Speaker 2: That's right. Yeah.
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: 'Inside Edition' [a syndicated nightly newsmagazine TV show] she does.  She came here as a news reporter and she was a--coming star.  And I was doing the 4:30, and they bumped me off of the 4:30 and said, "Deborah Norville is taking your spot.  We want you to do sports."  Well, my quick mind said, "A job is better than no job," and sports was a fun time.  How fortuitous it was!  Because that was in 1983.  The [Chicago] White Sox win the Western Division championship in 1983.  In 1984, a fellow comes to Chicago by the name of Michael Jordan. In 1985, the Bears win the--NFL [National Football League] Championship in the world, in the Super Bowl. Go down, 1987 and I'm there until 1990.  So the [Chicago] Bulls start their rise. So it was like--what a wonderful ride it was in sports at that time.  It was like--such a grand time to be in sports.  So what I thought of as being such as downer and such a rejection on the part of management, turned out to be something that was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Because you--in sports, you have to do a lot of writing of your own stuff, and you--do most of your own stuff by yourself.  And so I really--another friend back there, a guy by the name of Bill Gutman [sports author], helped me, and I cut my eyeteeth back there.  I learned how to be a reporter. I learned how to get out there and do stand-ups and--do all of the things that are really necessary to make you a good reporter.  And it was like that was what happened.  And it was so good, and I thought it was gonna be a real downer.  I thought it was a throwaway.  And then, several years later--1989 I think it was, 1990--I'm doing--news at that time, 1991, '92,[1992], in that area.  So they came to me and said, "You know, we don't really think that you're--you know, you're past your peak!"  And, you know, one of my people told me that.  And so they moved me out of one of the news shows and that means that you're kind of on the down trend.  That was in the mid '90s [1990s].  And then it came along the Jerry Springer [TV talk show host] flap. [May 17, 1997]. And the two anchors quit. [Carol Marin and Ron Magers, WMAQ-TV, Channel 5 news anchors, quit in protest when Jerry Springer was hired as commentator]. I don't go into the qualitatively why they did what they did, but they quit and left, and the general manager at that time was a guy who I, let's say that Lyle Banks [WMAQ-TV president] and I were not the best of friends.  Although we are both black, I didn't have a lot of respect for him. Let's put it that way.  And I--make that known in a sense, it just, but it was believed that because he was black and I was black, that I got appointed as the 10:00 news anchor.  The reality of it is that they called me up in the office and said, "We're gonna temporarily make you and Allison Rosatti the 10:00 news anchors until we can find somebody. And we're not sure that we want to sacrifice the persons that we have planned for the 10:00 news, because there's gonna be such a flap."  And I said, "Well, let me see now.  Let me get this straight.  You want me to be the captain of the Titanic.  Is that what you're talking about?"  And they said, "Well, we wouldn't exactly put it like that."  I said, "But that's exactly what you're talking about, aren't you?  You want me to be the captain of the Titanic.  You want me to take the ship on down.  And then when the ship goes to the bottom, and they come up with a new ship, then you want to put a new crew on there and a new captain."  And I said it that day and they will remember it.  I said, "The ship ain't goin' down with me, (chuckle).  You can bet on that.  The ship ain't going down."  And it hasn't!  And it hasn't.
Speaker 1: So all roads have sort of led you to this point, then, in many ways?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he left.
Speaker 2: He left.
Speaker 1: Actually he--was sort of--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) gone.
Speaker 1: --out of here.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Gone.  Gone.
Speaker 1: Right. Right.  And--aren't you the highest rated? Isn't NBC, it has been the highest rated, isn't it?
Speaker 2: No, we [WMAQ-TV, Channel 5 News] are in second place.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Second place.  Second place okay.
Speaker 2: Channel 7 [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois] is the bane of our existence.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Seven is first place.  That's right.
Speaker 2: But we do not sing sad songs for us.  We bill--we sell more than any other local station. Our demographics are the richest.  They say ratings is for play and demographics is for pay.  And we're demographically superior.
Speaker 1: Now where--do you want to go from here, Warner?  What are--your thoughts and--?
Speaker 2: This sounds so simplistic, but I take it one day at a time.  I have absolutely no idea where life is going to take me.  I'm sixty-six years old, I'm healthy, I'm very happy with what I do. If--it goes on, it goes on, if it doesn't go on, it doesn't go on. It doesn't make me much difference.
Story_ID: 12954
Speaker 1: And let's talk about the whole profession of broadcasting.  Do you have thoughts about that profession?  The one that you, you know, sort of chosen and excelled in?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But do you have thoughts about that?  I mean, I read, some things that you've written where you were talking about blacks and the profession, you know.  And how there's a glass ceiling to them because people are not willing to work hard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would dare say I think the glass ceiling is imposed in our own heads, in our own minds.  Yes, there is racism.  Yes, there is all the rest of those things.  Yes, there is sexism.  Yes, there is all those things.  But we limit ourselves.  Anybody who does not achieve, we limit ourselves at it.  And if we do not work to change, then we are not worthy of the bread that we--earn.  This business is like no other business.  It has--all the components that every other business has in it.  And there's a bunch of creative, nosy, competitive people in there who are fighting to get to the top.  There's tons of people who would like to be sitting in my seat, each day, and there's jealousies that go up and down the line.  And there's all of the--machinations and all of the rumors and all of the small talk and all of the backbiting that goes on everywhere else.  I say, like [U.S. President Harry S.] Truman, "If you don't--if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen then." That's what this business is about.  I personally enjoy it.  I enjoy the--give and take of it, I enjoy the freedom of it.  I enjoy the free press.  I enjoy our ability to be able to go out there and get that story and--get it fast and get it right and the--fun of doing that kind of thing, no matter who it touches.  I like the business.  The business is, the business fits like a tailor-made suit to me.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So are you, there's nothing, what do you think about the future of the business?  You know a lot of people are--predicting that, there will be one you know, new, one station, you know, left of the three networks.  I mean, one network left of the three?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I always say when you assume; you only make an ass out of yourself.  Because nobody knows what's gonna happen in the future of this business.  No one single individual knows.  If you look back at the predictors of this business twenty years ago, thirty years ago, no one could have predicted what's here today.  Nobody can predict what's gonna happen in the next ten months, the next six months, the next two years in this business.  Technology is gonna drive this business to another level.  There're gonna be many different changes in here.  How we see advertisement is gonna change in this business.  Everything that we know today is gonna change in this business.  So to be able to--. I always say to people, "How are you able to predict all of this stuff when you don't even know the stuff that's on the drawing board what's gonna happen?"  There could be an invention that is being invented right now that will so change this business, that we will not--. Eye has not seen nor ear has not heard what will change.  That's the dynamic of it, that's the beauty of it, that it will change.  The challenge is, can we change with the business?  That's the key.  Race, yes, race is an issue.  Race will always be a factor, but if you allow race--if one allows race to be a stumbling block rather than a stepping stone, that's when you fail.  That's the victim mentality.  How did Oprah [Winfrey] do it?  How could this little ugly girl (laughing) fat, ugly girl with nappy hair get seven hundred million dollars?  How did she do it?  You know, how did--look at--all the exceptions.  So, you know, she didn't give her power over to someone else. And I think that's what we have to do, and the reason I'm saying it, is because it's the very lesson that I have to learn.  You teach what you need to learn.  I have to learn the same thing, that we must ignore that part of it, because that gives power to someone. If you believe they are more powerful than you, or something else is more powerful than you, you' ll always lose.
Story_ID: 12955
Speaker 1: And do you--you've been active in the Chicago Association of Black Journalists--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and also NABJ. [National Association of Black Journalists]
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, do you think the organization has really served a viable role in these years?  I mean, when you look around and there are so few blacks really still on the air, there's not--there's very few or not ownership in the, you know, stations, and, I mean, I'm just--.
Speaker 2: Well, it's two different questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think that NABJ can be blamed for the lack of blacks on air.  That's to start off with.  That has to do with management and management's decisions.  We--I want to go back on some, when I came here, when I first came here it was in 1970.  And I came here in 1970, from Channel 7 [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois], which I neglected to tell you, to do some Sunday night shows.  And Jim Tilmon [African American TV weatherman, Chicago, Illinois] and I were--here at the same time. And I was vying to stay here and really get into television at that time.  And there's a wonderful general manager here, a guy by the name of Bob Lemon, [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, general manager], a very sincere man who, if you mention his name downstairs, the old timers will genuflect because that's how cool this guy was.  He had dinner with me one night, and he said, "Warner, I have to tell you something truly."  He said, "I know you want a job here."  He said, "But we cannot have two black people on air at the same time.  And we already have Jim Tilmon. And he's an airline pilot and he's got--. He's a weatherman, he's got--more to offer at this point.  We can't use two black people on air."  That was in 1970.  Now, that's how far this business has come.  Yesterday by accident, and again today by accident, the two anchors that do all of the news are black.  The weatherman, by accident, is black.  And on Friday, when the--our sports guy is off, the other sports guy is black.  That's an accident, it isn't something that anybody planned, and it should not be taken as anything other than four competent people are there doing their jobs.  If someone--.  And we always do get messages and I will get some messages in, about it.  "You got some niggers, you got all the niggers are up there today."  That's their problem, (laughing).  That's not my problem, you know?  The racist takes it on as their own problem.  That's not my problem, what they think, that's not my problem.  So things have changed, and they will change more.  And there will be more diverse.  And blacks will be threatened by--other minority groups that--are coming in who have come here with cultural--a cultural base that will propel them a lot past a lot of black people.  And that's gonna anger a lot of us.
Story_ID: 12956
Speaker 1: You asked me about blacks in this industry.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: And, should blacks go in this industry. We should go into any industry that we want to go into. I don't think there should be any restrictions. Several years ago I took minority off of my resume. I am not a minority.  I'm a fully vested American citizen with all the rights and responsibility of every other American citizen, and I got a right to do whatever I want to do in this country if it's legal. And, so I feel the same way that, I'm--go into any profession that you want to go into.  That's your business. But you have to remember, whatever profession you get into, hey, it's gonna be tough.  That's part of the game.
Speaker 2: So you're really trying to take the color out of the society in some respects?
Speaker 1: No, I'm trying to take the color out of me! I can't do it out of the society but I can take it out of me, because the color is the inhibitor.  The color is the victimization. You see, if you use color as an excuse for failure, and, then you--they can use color as a reason for success. It doesn't go, or, the equation doesn't run both ways.
Speaker 2: So is this the--are these the lessons you teach in your diversity training?
Speaker 1: Yeah! Yeah, I think so. I think that's what I'm trying to get across to people, that sexism and racism and homophobia--and, as I get older, I add ageism to that--are great inhibitors to our mental health. And that the longer we hold onto these prejudices, the more inhibited we will be in our own growth. So for our own growth, we have to get rid of those things in our hearts. It's like trying to fly and hold onto a big stone on the ground.  You can't--do that. Sexism is that stone on the ground.  Racism is that stone on the ground.  Homophobia is that stone on the ground, as is ageism. We have to free ourselves of it.  If you free yourselves of it, then others will change. I have seen it happen.  As I lost my racism, other people around me lost theirs, 'cause I'm not the same person anymore. You're not going to be able to do the same things to me, when I'm believing that I'm inferior. You're not gonna do that to me anymore, because I'm not gonna permit that to happen anymore. So I have no control over what's going to happen to everybody else out there in the world. But I do have control, 100 percent control of me.  That's all I can change. But as I change, everything around me changes, and that's the lesson that I try to get across in diversity. The value of change is that it produces and reproduces itself everywhere, and no one will act the same to you when you change. If you don't choose to change, then--the same thing will continue to happen to you. They say, mental health is doing the same--the lack of mental health is doing the same thing over and expecting different results.  What we have to do, we can't do the same thing over again and--expect different results. We are, as a group, the most disrespected and the most reviled of people in this country. Okay. So what? Now, if I concentrate on that effort and concentrate on that and start believing that, in that sense, then--I'm lost. I have no--. I've lost my value.  I've lost my value to myself and I've lost my value to anything else that I do. So I'm not really trying to take the color out of it in a sense.  Not trying to pretend that there's a color-blind society. I'm simply saying I am not allowing that to be an inhibitor.  I will not use it as an--excuse for failure or a reason for success.  That's what I'm really saying.
Story_ID: 12957
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, do you have--and I'm saying this because you're so involved in the movement and your background in Chicago [Illinois]--but do you--what are your--do you have hopes or fears for the black community? I mean, this is, you've seen a lot of change during your lifetime.
Speaker 2: No, I think it's normal.  I think it's average. I think what we are doing, what is going on right now is average, it's to be expected. Rapid social change, 1955, the start 1954, Brown v. Board of Education; 1896,  1895, 1896, Plessy v. Ferguson, fifty-eight years or so of segregation in this country.  Slavery before that time; 1965, the Voting Rights Act, huge things, legal kinds of situations.  Blacks have not been free in this country, up until 1965 legally when voting rights were attained by everyone. Well, you cannot take a set of people and push them into that kind of box and not expect the kind of severe negative repercussions that we're getting today. That is normal, that's very normal.  And as opportunities open up in the next fifty, twenty-five, seventy-five, one-hundred years, these kinds of problems that blacks are dealing with today, will for the most part be minority problems, rather than, it will be a less minority problem than it will be a large minority problem.  I say in diversity all the time, what do you--I ask them to write this down, I say let us pretend that the Indians went over to Europe.  And they took a Greek, an Italian, an Englishman, a Frenchman, a Russian and they put them on a slave ship, and they brought them over here in 1619.  And they enslaved them here in the United States, in this, in their country over there, in '19--and in the year 2000, what do you think those people would be like? Write an essay on what those people would be like. Well, they would be black people, they would be Negroes, they would be us. That's who they would be, exactly like that. So all of that stuff, the chickens have come home to roost. That's the violence out on the streets. And now as you are seeing it, it is spreading out.  The guilt of all of this is now spreading out into the Columbine [High School, Columbine, Colorado] and into the satanic--the biggest dope problem in the country today is young white kids, use far more drugs than black kids do, are more likely to bring guns to school than are black kids, are creating far more havoc within the, with the use of hallucinogenic drugs than are black kids in the ghetto today. So, this kind of illness that segregation and slavery and all of this has taken on, it cannot help but affect the entire country, and this is what that sin has done to this country and we see it each and every day in the country. It isn't admitted to, it isn't talked about, but it's there. And--it's starting to show itself in--very sad ways. Yeah, everything is pretty much average. We're going along just as the way we should go along. Large amounts of us have not received the opportunity, so you're gonna have a lot of within a large amount of people. As those people move out, it will change and it'll be less. So I don't see it. I see nothing but hope in, if this country can last.  I think it will work. We'll see a black president, we'll see a woman president and we'll see people--it won't even be a recognizable country within two hundred years. We won't be here to see it, but, I don't think it'll be in any group, if you look at the history of the world, every group has done essentially the same thing. The oppression has been reflected in years of rebounding.  We didn't know in 1955 even to be angry.  When they told us that we had to walk to the back of the bus and get on there and sit in the for colored only side, there was a rage inside.  But we didn't even recognize what it was. Well, we passed, this thing called large group memory, where you pass it on to your kids in conversation. Well, the group that we have, that came after the Civil Rights Movement, when they found out how screwed they were, they were mad. That's healthy to be mad! Thus, the Black Panthers; thus, the, you know, the Deacons for Defense; thus, the groups of people who came out afterward and said, we are damn mad! Look what you all did to us! You hid our history.  You did all this stuff to us. Why shouldn't we be mad?  And then white society was saying you shouldn't be mad about that. Why don't you just forget about that? Don't even--well, that even makes you even more rageful! It's like your husband does something to you that makes you mad, and you, just forget about that little thing that I did. I slapped you last night but, you know, but--don't worry about that, you know.  And then the fact that this country has never moved to say I'm sorry for what I did, I'm angry for it, I'm sorry for what I did, even brings on more rage. Well, there will be a president and it may be [George W.] Bush, who will say, I'm sorry. It may be Bush.
Speaker 1: Well that's very interesting because reparations, I'm very happy to see what's happened with that.  But I have--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I am too.
Story_ID: 12958
Speaker 1: I have another question.  And I go back to, you know, the beginning, earlier in your interview, when you were talking about growing up on 47th Street [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, the vibrancy that was there.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And 47th is coming back, you know, now.  But, I mean, you know, it was a segregated community. Yet everyone was together.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, and even you're doing research on this whole--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Policy.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --thing about policy.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Policy was how, who, how many millions of dollars were changed?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Aw! It was oh, twenty, fifty million dollars a year was going around in the community.
Speaker 1: But see that's what--., (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that's so--what I'm wondering is that, this segregated but very vibrant community will not be anymore.  And what are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 1: Well, it can't be. And the other thing about it is, it wasn't all peaches and cream, as people would like to portray it as. The reason it was that way is because it was a lack of opportunity for people who--did well. It was just like being a great basketball player and can't play in the NBA [National Basketball Association]. It's like the black colleges, what they're suffering today. I mean, I turn on the television set and Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi] fields an all black basketball team. Well, when I was in college, a black person couldn't walk on the campus of Ole Miss, let alone play on the basketball team! So something is going to have to suffer, if something changes. If you are not willing to make change, then it will remain the same. I submit to you that that would have been stagnant community, if it had remained the way it was. Although it sounds romantic and it sounds very nice, and we had all of these little things unto ourselves, it stifled the freedom of people to do more. And I look at the example of [Doctor] Theodore Lawless. This was a genius of a man, who had to stay on 43rd Street and have people come to him. He didn't have the freedom to fly where he wanted to fly. You can't worry about what happened in the back.  You gotta give those with the--with the talent the freedom to fly and do what they want. That's why I don't submit to saying to high school kids you gotta come back and help your community. You don't owe your community anything but to be the best person that you can, and go as far as you possibly can. That's what you owe to your community. You didn't create that situation in the community. You didn't cause it and you can't cure it. That is not of your development. That's when anybody tells me you got to go back and help your community. I say no man, I escaped from my community. That's like asking a Jew to go back to Dachau  and try to change Dachau. I didn't create Dachau, I didn't create 47th Street. I didn't create what happened over there. My job is to get as far as I can go with my freedom. Once I've done that, I can do far more for that community, than I could ever do going back there playing a social worker.
Story_ID: 12959
Speaker 1: So the social worker, the social worker, or the social scientist in you has become--at, you know, I--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Has become?
Speaker 1: --I, that's what I'm wondering. What has that person become?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) A better social scientist.
Speaker 1: An individual what?  Okay.  Hmm. hmm.
Speaker 2: A better social scientist.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: Because science changes. Once you have more information about science, it changes and you have to go with the changes. When Galileo said, you know, then--there's--then, "The world is round," they put him in jail.  The world was still round. So social sciences change.  If we don't change with the social sciences and understand what would have happened to that community, that community would have died under its own weight, because it would not have reproduced people who would have done more and taken another step, because all it would have seen, is what it saw right there. It's the very reason that when soldiers--. World War I and World War II started the Civil Rights Movement, because once soldiers, once black soldiers, went over across the country, cross the sea and saw what was happening over there, they never came back with the same belief anymore. It was like, "What are you talking about? You got to be crazy!" If they had remained in that segregated community, no matter how well they were, nothing would have changed with them. And it would have essentially--died under its own weight. It's a romantic view to delight the ignorant.  But when you look at it from a real solid sociological point of view, those communities needed to go! (laughing) They needed to go!
Story_ID: 12960
Speaker 1: But what do you think the legacy of the African-Americans--in this country is?
Speaker 2: Our legacy? As, you mean, as if we're going somewhere in the--.
Speaker 1: Our legacy to date, our heritage, our legacy.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think we have moved this country probably fast. I think the--airplane, the--Internet and black people. (Laughing) I think that's how important we are in the--structure. If black people had not done what we did in this country, there would be no Vietnamese in this country.  There'd be no Mexicans in this country. This would not be a diverse country as it is today, if black people had not opened the door for them to do that. We would not have been able to, we would--even, as poorly as we stumbled in this world, we would not have been able to even understand Iraq or understand Kosovo because black people brought civil rights to this country, and it freed up. As [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] said, "We are not only freeing black people, we're freeing white people." And that's what black people have done in this country. We stand as the ultimate contradiction in this country. We are the ultimate contradiction. Not the Indians even--we are the ultimate contradiction. And the wonder of it all is, how did they do it? You know, how did that happen? That's because of the indomitable spirit of a group of people, who--simply would not say no, and--developed their own individual talents to produce the kind of great people that have--been produced. That's why I always talk about athletes.  I always use athletes as an example. When an athlete--when you turn on an NBA [National Basketball Association] game and we lose a game, there's no athlete who's gonna say well, you know, the white man didn't let me shoot.  You know, I was too short.  I'm, I couldn't, and, boy, the--basket was a little high on the other side." Only, athletes say we didn't work hard enough.  They didn't--we didn't really give it all that we should have given it.  That, to me, is the kind of spirit that makes you change and get better.  If you start to blame anybody or anything other than yourself and your own devices, then that's a sure sense of loss. And that's what Americans, black Americans, have brought to this country, if we have shown this country that, in spite of what it has tried to do to us, the grass is still growing and you have tried your best to stamp it out in every way that you possibly can, and it simply will not go out. That kind of spirit has fueled America to do many, many other things--so we have been and continue to be in many ways we use the term soul. In many ways, we have been the soul of this country. Reluctantly, then, looking at it, but we have been the soul of this country. I just hope we can keep our soul and--not lose it along the way.  That's the danger, in my judgment, of becoming what we were fighting against. I told [Reverend] Jesse [Jackson] one time, I said, "Man, we ought to be the first ones at the boat to meet those Vietnamese boat people.  If anybody knows what oppression is, we ought to know it." But, you know, the sophomore can't wait for the freshman to come, so he can oppress him.
Story_ID: 12961
Speaker 1: What do you, as a person--who is sitting here--sixty-six [years old], you said?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) (Chuckling) Yeah, sixty-six.
Speaker 1: And looking--fifty, early fifties. What--do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: You know, that, I kind of knew you'd ask that question and I don't have a good answer for it. I'm in the self-improvement business, and I--think that the only thing that I can do is really do my best to improve myself on a personal level, and to extricate the devils that were in me that came out of a damaged childhood. And the more I do that, that, I think, is more of a legacy that--one can leave to--. And if--I get into other professions like writing, and I'm doing some theater work and stuff like that.  If I'm--. That, I think, will be expressed in--my writings and stuff that I'm able to do. But even more importantly, I--want to gain, I want to continue to gain the respect of my own son.  That, to me, is more important than--and my wife-more important than anything. Because I think if you do that-if I do that-then whatever else happens is--to the good. You know, we always talk about going out helping somebody in Cabrini Green, [public housing complex, Chicago, Ill.] or helping somebody in some other area, and we lose sight of the fact that we are probably in more need, us as individuals, just me, I am in more need than they are in some ways.  And so if I take care of myself, everything else starts to take care of itself. If--I understand generosity then--I'll be able to give more.  If--I understand kindness, then I'm able to give more. But if I don't have that within me, I'm not able to give it to anybody else.  So, that's the--work.  And boy, that is painful, (chuckling), that is the most painful work.  And--I work on it every day and it is most painful.
