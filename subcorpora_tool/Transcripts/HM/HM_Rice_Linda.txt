Speaker 1: I want to start out by asking you what you know about your, give me your father's name and what you know about this growing up.
Speaker 2: John H. Johnson, my dad, grew up in a rural area in Arkansas, Arkansas City, Arkansas.  I believe there were about six hundred people in the town.  And his mother was a domestic, a housekeeper.  His father was killed in a sawmill accident so his mother really raised him as a strong, single, black woman and really only wanted the best for him, always wanted the best for him.  Raised him to be god fearing, no smoking, no drinking.  I think she caught him smoking one time and I think he said that she really sort of took him to the woodshed on that.  He never, never smoked again.  Never smoked again.  But that's really how he was raised in a very, very rural community where the best job for being a black man was being a preacher and that wasn't necessarily what he wanted to do.  And she saw that there could be a better life for her son outside of just being raised in Arkansas because at that time there weren't, weren't many opportunities for him.  And so she moved with him to Chicago [Illinois].  And they came to Chicago on the train and he--she put him in school here and he went to [Jean Baptiste] DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And he became--he worked very, very hard in school.  He, you know his--I remember him telling me, he said you know I was, they told me I was too short to play basketball, I was too small to play football so he said to heck with it, I'm going to be head of the debating team and I'm going to be the editor of the paper.  And that's really what he set out to do and that really started his, his career in journalism.  And I think my grandmother really instilled in him a can-do attitude, a very positive sense of self.  She always, always, always supported him.  And you know at one time I think he was say--telling me that as his career was progressing and he was working so hard to try to sell subscriptions and to sell advertising and he just came to her one day and he said "You know mom I really think I'm failing."  And she said to him, "Son are you trying?"  And she said--he said "Yes, yes I'm trying."  She said, "Well if you're trying you're not failing."  You're not failing.  And I think that support and that nurturing and that guidance really was tremendous for him.  She believed in him.  She believed in him.  And as a result of that he believed in himself and his abilities.  So they're in Chicago.  He graduates from high school from DuSable I think and then it became [Wendell] Phillips [high School, Chicago, Illinois].  I'm not sure how that switch works.  He's better at this story than I am.  And, and then he was accepted at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and attended there, never graduated, although has an honorary degree from there and several other schools, but he never graduated from there.  And really you know saw a void for African Americans.  And being involved in the school newspaper, being on the debating team in highs school, I think he believed that the media was so important to get across positive images of blacks, positive images of African Americans.  But how do you do that?  Where do you start?  And at the time there was a magazine called 'Life Magazine' and he thought well you know what, this is--and 'Life' was the most popular magazine out.  And he said you know it's all about photographs, excellent editorial.  He said I want to put together something like that for my people.  And that really was the blueprint for 'Ebony'.
Story_ID: 12161
Speaker 1: The smart man that he [father John H. Johnson] is, he met my mother, Eunice W. Johnson  [Eunice Walker Johnson] who came from Selma, Alabama and she was in Chicago going to Loyola University [Chicago, Illinois].  And they met, I believe they met at a dance and I think she was there with somebody else.  And they met at a dance and you know he was obviously very smitten by her and she by him and you know they got married.  They fell in love and they got married.  And she--he will tell you that she's a tremendous asset, a tremendous asset to the company and to the founding and the building of the company.  She's the one who came up with the name 'Ebony'.  And you know together they, they built, they built I think what, what is an incredible, incredible company for and by African Americans, number one magazine for African Americans in the country, 'Ebony', number two magazine for African Americans in the country, 'Jet'.  Number one cosmetics for women of color around the world, Fashion Fair Cosmetics, but they did it together.  They did it together.
Speaker 2: Now you tell really an amazing story.  I want to ask about your mother and her background too.  What was--her background was different from your fathers.
Speaker 1: They were, my parents had very different backgrounds.  As a matter of fact it was sort of like for lack of a better phrase I think my father married up.  He married up you know cause he was from Arkansas City, Arkansas and my mother [Eunice Walker Johnson] from Selma, Alabama, the daughter of a doctor, black doctor in Selma, Alabama.  This is many years ago.  Her two brothers were doctors.  Her sister earned her Ph.D. in English and became an English professor.  My mother has her masters on social service administration.  So you're talking about a well educated family.  And so they did come from very different backgrounds but you know when they met each other their, the commonality I believe there was that they a) fell in love with each other and b) they had the same goals.  They're both very driven people and wanted to highlight and to put forth the best they could and showcase the best they could for African Americans.  But yet they're, they came from very, very different backgrounds.  And even to the point where you know hopefully it's not as prominent now although it's still I think a little under the surface, the skin color.  Here, my father was a brown skinned man from rural Arkansas and here was my mother, fair skinned, doctor's daughter from a prominent family in Selma, Alabama.  You got a whole 'nother level going on there.  And to the point where I think there may have been on relative in my mother's family who said you know you can't marry that boy because he's just, he's just too dark.  And my mother said well I'm going to marry him.  And my mother always told me she said,"You know the minute your father said to me Eunice if I have fifteen cents, you get the dime, I get the nickel. " She said,"That's the man for me."  That was the man for her absolutely.
Speaker 2: So did--now do, do you remember her parents saying anything or being sort of untoward except that one, the one relative, you know?
Speaker 1: No.  As a matter of fact I remember my grandparents, her, on her side as being very, very kind and embracing to my father and my father being incredibly kind and embracing to them.  No, I don't, I don't ever--I never got the sense that there was friction there.  I never got that, that feeling at all.  It was just the opposite.  It was just the opposite.  They were very proud of him, very, very proud of him.
Speaker 2: And your, on your mother's side her grandfather was a famous, isn't he, wasn't he a famous--was it nurse?  No--.
Speaker 1: He was a, he was a doctor also I'm trying to think.  Let me make sure I have all my stories straight.  And a minister and very, very well educated.  Her whole family is very, very well educated and he actually founded a school.  It's called Selma University in Selma.  So generations of her family were very well educated and generations of my father's were not.
Speaker 2: Did she ever talk about her growing up Linda and you know did she have any stories or do you remember a favorite story that she would tell you?
Speaker 1: You know that--she didn't talk that much about growing up except that her family was always a stickler for education and so that's always been a passion of hers because I believe that she was taught that if you didn't have an education you really didn't stand a chance to advance on any level, whether it was professional or social.  And that has really been instilled in her.  She has a great passion for education.  A great passion for education which is why she's so supportive of the United Negro College Fund and has you know made a contribution, sizeable contribution to her alma mater, Talledaga University in Talledaga, Alabama.  So those things for her mean a great deal, mean a great deal.
Story_ID: 12162
Speaker 1: Now your grand--your father's mother, do you have any favorite stories about her?  One, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Gertrude [Jenkins] Johnson Williams.  Gee, I remember her as being very, very devoted to her son.  I mean it was very obvious she was very devoted to my father [John H. Johnson] and he was very devoted to her.  And also I think growing up the way she grew up in, in, in rural Arkansas, I think it was hard to show a lot of physical affection.  So I didn't really get a lot of physical affection from her but I knew she loved me.  But you know when you grow up as a single black mother raising a child, you're trying to make it.  You're trying to make it.  And I believe that by the time I came along as, as a granddaughter she was always very, you know very, very sweet and very nice to me but not a real, real, real affectionate type of person.  A very proud lady, a very, very proud person very much so and very much involved in her church and very much involved in women's organizations.  Not as in women's rights organizations but women's social organizations because that's you know the way a lot of African American women grew up when they got to a certain level and achieved a certain status.  And you know my father put her on a pedestal and, as well he should, as well he should have.  And so you join a lot of social clubs and she became a very prominent person.  Everybody knew Ms. Williams, everybody.  My father sent her a dozen roses every Sunday for life, every Sunday, oh yeah.  Oh yeah he was very proud of her and she very proud of him.
Speaker 1: Pretty amazing when you think--.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --of a love like that, yeah.
Speaker 2: I think that's a good story, yeah.
Story_ID: 12163
Speaker 1: What was your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness my earliest memory?  That's a tough one.  You know there are so many.  I mean, oh you know, you're going to laugh at me.  But I love horses, love them, always have all my life.  And I remember I started taking riding lessons.  I don't think I--my mother [Eunice Walker Johnson] took me to a stable that was in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois neighborhood] and I don't think I could have been more than six or seven.  And I started riding and I fell off the first lesson.  I said never going back again.  Well, about a week later I said you know what, let's try it one more time so I go back.  Now by this--from then on I'm riding five days a week, five days a week.  So four, I think it was for my birthday--no it was Christmas.  It was Christmas.  My brother John [H. Johnson, Jr.], who is since deceased, but my brother and I, my father [John H. Johnson] gave us two Shetland ponies for Christmas.  Now this is what's really funny is that by the time he gave us the ponies, I'd been riding horses.  So I'm like what am I to--this is a pony, what am I to do with this?  So we--you know and you try to be sweet and kind and you know what was I, eight or nine years old?  I didn't want to be a spoiled brat but I'm like, I'm not riding that.  And my father said to me, he said "You know, I got you those ponies because growing up I always wanted to have a little white pony and I never had one.  And I thought well I'll get, I'll get you guys ponies now."  And we're like, "Well we don't want them dad.  We don't want them."  That's one of the things I do remember.  I remember that very well, very well.  And I think he was a little hurt and I was like okay well you know as a kid, you'll get past it dad but I really don't want ponies.  I really don't want that.  But he was--it was very sweet.  It was sweet of him to you know to be that extravagant in the gift, but I'm like dad you got to stay in touch with us cause if you knew me, you'd know it ain't the pony I want.  Give me the horse.  Give me the horse.  Always bigger, always bigger, always bigger.  That was a funny--it was really funny.  It was funny.  And, and 'till this day I think he'll, he'll still tell you the story about the ponies, sort of stuck with him.
Speaker 1: The rejection?
Speaker 2: The rejection I think really sort of stuck with him.  He's like, he's like what, you don't want this?  No.
Speaker 1: Now where, were you--you were adopted, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were adopted a week--how, it wasn't very shortly after your brother was adopted right?
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know the exact time frame but very close together, very close together.  And we were I'm thinking two and a half years apart in age, two and a half years apart in age, adopted but different parents, yeah, different parents.  But I think they adopted us pretty, pretty close together.
Speaker 1: And at this point in time it's 1958.  Your father had started 'Negro Digest' in nineteen I think forty--.
Speaker 2: The company was founded in 1942.
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: 'Ebony' was started in 1945 and 'Jet' was started in 1951.  But before 'Ebony' was 'Negro Digest'.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you came along when your parents were doing--they had, they weren't struggling at all at this point?
Speaker 2: I never saw, I had never felt any of that struggle, no. I'm honest, no, no, no.  They were, they were making it.
Speaker 1: So when--now how old were they when, when you came along?  Do you--your father would have been in his mid thirties or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would have been in his mid thirties.  My mother, I really can't tell you because she's very cagey about that.  So I don't even go there.  All I know is she was really pretty and still is, that's all I'll say.  I don't really know the exact date.
Speaker 1: So what do you--where were you living at the time?  What was the family--?
Speaker 2: Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois neighborhood].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were on 845 East Drexel Square.
Speaker 1: And do you, can you talk about what life was like growing up?
Speaker 2: It was a lot of fun.  I mean I, I had, I was and still am incredibly blessed, incredibly blessed.  My mother was so wonderful, very, very warm with us, very affectionate and just really wanted to expose my brother and I to everything possible.  And she very much as I said loved education, very much loved culture and the arts and took us to Europe.  I think I went to Europe for the first time when I was seven and I went with her to Europe every year I think until I was about twenty one, about twenty one.  So we traveled extensively.  She just wanted us to be exposed to everything that was I think refined and cultural and global, especially when it came to the arts.  She was very, very involved in art and very really I think a phenomenal art collector, black or white, but incredibly phenomenal for a black woman that many years ago.  And so the exposure we had was tremendous, was absolutely tremendous.  But we also did the kid stuff.  I mean you had to learn how to ride a bike, you fell off and you looked stupid and then you got back on.  And you know you went to school and had fun with your friends and you know you got to you know do your homework, do your studies.  And thank God I was a neatnick as a person so I was always, you know putting my clothes away and putting my toys away.  No one ever had to tell me to do that.  That was, that was to me the easy stuff.  So it wasn't--it was a upbringing of balanced privilege.  That's the best way I can put it.  It was balanced privilege.  Did we get spanked?  Yes, only by my mother though, never by my father.  I think he was too chicken.  He was too chicken.  But I think you know he would talk to you sternly but never spank you.  And mother was like come here.  She, she would--she didn't play around, very I think very good disciplinarians.  We were raised to be polite and to be kind to people and to be respectful.  And you know it was--I'm very blessed.  I mean to, to--it was, I think it was a terrific childhood.  I think it was terrific.
Speaker 1: Now how--what were you like as a child?  Were you quiet?  Were you outgoing?
Speaker 2: You have to get somebody else to answer that as to what I was like as a child.  I mean okay, basically what you see now is pretty much, is pretty much the way I was as a kid, except I'm older and I'm wiser hopefully and have had more experience at this age.  But I've always been very outgoing, very outgoing, not, not a real shy person.  I mean everybody has their insecurities and you know sometimes you feel a little uncomfortable in, in groups of people but gee, that never really happened to me too often.  That never really happened to often.
Story_ID: 12164
Speaker 1: Now did you--I just want you to recount maybe some, you know some, some experience or remembrances around either family life or school or you know childhood friends, you know.  I'm just trying to get a sense of the community that you grew up in.
Speaker 2: Well I went to private school.  I went to the [University of Chicago] Laboratory School [Chicago, Illinois] which is affiliated with the University of Chicago.  And it's a very, it was and still is a very progressive private school.  And excellent I think cross section of kids that were black kids, white kids, Asians kids, East Indian kids.  A lot of the kids there were the sons and daughters of professors at the University of Chicago so they went to the, the school.  And then you know a lot of the kids came from you know well to do families but it's a kind of atmosphere, it was the kind of atmosphere at lab school where people who had money, you never really talked about it.  You didn't throw it around.  You, you just, you just didn't do that.  First of all, you were too busy trying to get through school because it was not the easiest school and you just sort of accepted people for who they were.  It was a rare sort of melting pot of, of kids and so I had friends you know across the board.  I would say that the majority of my friends were, were black.  Majority of my friends were black.
Speaker 1: So who were they?  Who were some of your friends back then?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, let's see.  I, there's, it's so many it's even, it's even hard to remember.  Oh my goodness let's see, Sherry Runner, let's see, John Rogers [Jr., Ariel Capital Management Chairman and CEO] and I went to high school together, Valerie Jarrett and I went to high school together, Jean Dibble was there.  I mean just tons of people, lot, lot of good folks.  And a lot of people that I'm still you know very close to now.
Story_ID: 12165
Speaker 1: And did you--were there any--what about any holidays that you remember or like even this trip you said?  Do you remember your first trip to France at seven or do you remember one--?
Speaker 2: I do remember my first trip to Europe.  I do remember because the first place we went was, I believe the first place I went was Rome.  I think it was Rome and the reason I'm thinking that is because I went with my mother when she was buying couture clothes for the Ebony Fashion Fair.  And as I remember the first set of shows were in Rome and then we went to Paris [France].  So I mean you know as a kid you get the plane first of all, I don't speak Italian.  There's the first thing, major shock.  Nobody--they're not speaking English, Linda.  And I realized, right away you realized how young the United States is.  I mean when you set foot in Rome [Italy] it is really an ancient city and it was fascinating.  I just, I loved it.  I loved everything about it.  I loved--I, the one thing I remember right off the bat is seeing the Colosseum.  I'd never seen anything like that.  I couldn't--I'm a seven year old kid.  I couldn't even imagine anything a) that big or that old.  So that was the, the first impression.  And, and my mother made sure we went to every--she took us to every tourist thing, everything.  This is--you know I want you to see everything first hand.  And then we left there and we went to, we went to Paris and how do you not fall in love with Paris even as a kid?  It's just the, the, it's, it's just a beautiful city.  It's a beautiful city.  And so I mean as a kid you go to all the good stuff.  I mean there, you know you, you go to wonderful art museums and even though you may not understand a single thing that's on the wall you know somehow you absorb it, you absorb it.  And as you get older it means something, it does mean something to you.  It helps to build a foundation.  And so we had, you know we had wonderful times.  We had great times there.  And my mother oh she used to give marvelous cocktail parties in, in, in Paris in their hotel suite.  I mean it was very, it was very la-ti-dah.  It was very la-ti-dah.  It was, it was fun too.  And here I am this little you know kid running in and out of all these fashionistas.  I had a good time.
Speaker 1: And did--?
Speaker 2: I had a good time.  Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you, the other--I'll tell you one thing I'll never forget.  When--my first couture fashion show, first show was Pierre Cardin and my mother took me.  And we went to the atelier, to the house, fashion house and they said but Madame Johnson you cannot bring child to the, to the couture shows, you cannot do that.  My mother said, "Well if I can't bring her then I can't buy."  She's a very savvy woman.  She said then I can't buy the clothes.  If I can't bring my daughter then I can't buy the clothes.  Okay, well then you know they got to do a lot of back peddling cause she's a big couture buyer you know, don't want to lose this.  So I ended up sitting in what's called the cabine which is where all the models are changing clothes and getting dressed and getting ready to go out on the runway and coming back in and changing ensembles and it was so much fun.  It was so much fun.  That's when I said oh I know I--I'm, I'm thinking this is great.  You know I know my mother is buying clothes for her fashion show.  And then you know when you see the clothes and then you, they come back to the United States and she's putting together her show, it was so exciting.  But I will never forget that.  I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: Now how old were you then at that time?
Speaker 2: I was probably eight, yeah I was probably eight.  It was a lot of--you know I just remember a flurry of colors and feathers and beautiful women going in and out.  And here I am this little kid sitting, you know perched on this little chair just, just watching.  It was fun.  That was fun.  That was a great memory.
Speaker 1: Now when you said we went over, who was going over besides you and your mother?  Was it a whole entourage?
Speaker 2: You know what, no.  At that time it was my mother and the commentator for the fashion show and it was the two of them.  And then she would photograph for the magazine fashion stories there actually in Rome or in Paris.  We, we didn't bring our own photographer.  She had a photographer that she used there in those particular cities.  So really it was just, it was the three of us.  And my brother [John Johnson]went a couple of times but you know for a boy it's not really his thing.  So it was, it was, it was really just the three of us so I sort of was thrown into, into the fashion and loved every minute of it, never looked back.
Speaker 1: So it was all those colors, all the, the fast paced, okay.  Now were you aware of a sense of people being different from you?  You know any issue about color or you know being exposed to different people?  I know you were going to the Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory School, Chicago, Illinois] so you were exposed so I'm not--but was there any sense about this being different except people not speaking the same language?
Speaker 2: Well now I will tell you, yes.  I think you could see that when my mother would walk into these couture shows or walk into a couture fashion show you know everybody would look at her, everybody.  Well first of all she looked exquisite but aside from that they were looking at everything about her, a) who is this black woman and what is Ebony?  And where is she getting the money from to buy these clothes?  And what is the fashion show that she puts on?  A lot of questions, a lot of questions going on.  And you know she really broke down a whole bunch of barriers.  I mean I, I looked around and I look at African American models now and I look at African American designers and I think boy you really need to thank Eunice Johnson for what she did, really cause she did a tremendous, a tremendous amount there.
Story_ID: 12166
Speaker 1: We were talking about my mother [Eunice Johnson] and how you know she really broke down all these barriers for African Americans in fashion and you know runway models and designers.  And you know I remember her telling me that Emilio Pucci was the first designer who came--an Italian designer who came to her and said you know, "Signora Johnson, I want to use," I guess he must have said maybe "Negro models," at that time.  And this was probably back in the '60s [1960s].  Let's see, I was born in 1958 so this was probably about '68 [1968].  I want to use Negro models.  Where, you--I want one.  You have to find me one.  You know, you know.  Where she found the model I'll never know but she, but she did.  She did and he was really the first couture fashion designer to use black models was Emilio Pucci.  That's my understanding and I think that's probably, till this day probably still true.  And then you know others you know started following suit, [Yves] St. Laurent, Givenchy, Valentino.  But you know he, he came to her and he said you have to find me, you have to find me somebody and find somebody she did, she did.  It's, it, you know it's, it's a door opening.  It's a door opening and I think that's what's part, was what's part of what is so great about the Ebony Fashion Fair is that you're showcasing black women of all shades in their beauty and in their glory wearing the finest clothes that they may not be able to buy, but at least sitting in the audience they can see.  They can fantasize, they can enjoy.  And it, and it's a great you know wonderful thing for all the charities that the, that we contribute money to.  I mean it's over fifty million dollars just for the United Negro College Fund in the past forty seven years.  That's a lot of money.  That's a lot of scholarships and a lot of help.
Speaker 2: Now can you talk about its origins?  I mean I'd like to--you know it's origins as a charity fundraiser but also it's concept you know with the couture lines.  Can you--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Ebony Fashion Fair was started forty, this is our forty seventh year, forty seven years ago.  And I believe it was the president's wife of, don't get me wrong, we have--I have to check my facts.  I think it's Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] and Mrs. Dent is her last name.  And she came to my father and wanted to have some sort of, I believe it was a, it was a fundraising vehicle for, it was either for the university or for her organization.  And she came up with the idea of doing a fashion show.  And we had a society editor at that time named Gerry Majors and Gerry I think was the first person who--I'm not sure she went to Europe but she did buy clothes for the first Ebony Fashion Fair.  And it started out actually, then it went to, started out in one city, then it went to ten cities and then my mother started doing the show, I want to say she's been doing now of the forty seven years, probably forty years, probably.  And she took it over and took it to a whole nother level because she said now the finest things at that time come from Paris.  We have to go, we have to go there.  And that's really how it started.  And now it's, I think we travel to, it's over a hundred and, probably hundred and thirty cities, different show, you know different city every night.  They get Mondays off, they get a break over Christmas holidays and start again in January, go through May.  And it just, it's a, it's an incredible, incredible vehicle for showcasing African American models, fabulous clothes by the finest designers both black and white.  And it just makes you feel good.  It makes you feel proud about what you see.
Story_ID: 12167
Speaker 1: Now how do you define couture you know in that way, the couture houses?  Can you talk about that cause it was--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I was having a recent discussion about what was couture and what wasn't.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Well couture now is on the wane.  I mean it's, it's really on the decline but I remember that couture is something that is custom made just for you.  So I'll give you a perfect example.  I remember many times going to fashion hours with my mother, [Christian] Dior, [Yves] St. Laurent , and she would have couture clothes made for her.  We had them made for the show.  We'd say okay, the models are a size eight and they are five feet ten inches tall.  That's the, the statistics that they would go by, the measurements that they would go by to make the dresses.  But for my mother they would make what's called a toile, t-o-i-l-e, toile and it's really made of cotton fabric and they would cut the fabric to her body, so if it's a suit or if it's an evening gown they would cut it out first in cotton and pin it on her and sew it on her.  And they have you move your arms, walk, turn, sit down so that every inch of that suit, every inch of that dress is made to your body specifically.  Now there is a price that goes along with that that is egregiously expensive but you are getting something that is made just for you by Christian Dior, made just for you Valentino.  And you know you could pay thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollars but that is what couture is.  Couture really for fashion was the laboratory for design because with couture shows designers could create their wildest dreams, their wildest dreams.  And it became a laboratory for what they were going to eventually sell in the stores, department stores, you know they had buyers that would come to the couture shows.  They didn't buy a lot of the couture cause it's so expensive and how can you buy you know one of a kind dresses?  But it became a laboratory for the designers so that they could do other lines but the couture really is, it's creating your masterpiece.  It's your master canvass.  It's your master canvas.

Speaker 1: Now, anything else you remember about those trips and how they influenced you and, and things like that?  And did things sort of change as you became sort of a teenager?  I know you were going -- were there any times when you were like mom, no I don't really want to go?
Speaker 2: There was never a time when I didn't want to go to a show.  There was never a time when I didn't want to go to a fashion show.  You know some ladies like clothes, some don't.  I'm in the some do category.  I'm in the some do category, love them.  So it was never a time that I didn't want to go.  And even as a teenager I mean that was what I did in the summer, but by the time I got to be sixteen it started to become part of my job.  It became a job because I would come back from the shows with my mother, I would help her coordinate the clothes for the models, all the accessories.  You know they would get ready to get on the bus and go out on the road and I would have on my jeans and I would be backstage in those little first small cities and, oh god, in Matteson, Illinois and Elgin, Illinois and, and you know helping out the show.  That was the--it became part of my job.  That became my job.  And that really was the first area of the company that I ever worked in was, was with my mother.  That was my first pay check, thanks mom.  That was my first pay check.

Speaker 1: Now I want to go back to you just a little I mean younger and your house on, you said on Drexel [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And I want you--.
Speaker 2: It actually wasn't a house.  It was a, one, two, three--.
Speaker 1: Apartment?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a three--one, two, three stories brownstone.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Now who was living--was any other family members living there too?
Speaker 2: There were no other family members living in, in that--.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were--my parents rented out I think one or two apartments and I sort of remember the people there.  Not--I'm a little, I'm a little fuzzy on that.  But no, they didn't live, there were no other family members that lived there--
Speaker 1: Now when you take yourself--.
Speaker 2: My grandmother had her own, her own three story brownstone, not very far away as a matter of fact.  I told you my dad always took good care of her.
Speaker 1: Really that--it's, I mean it's really amazing when you think about it really.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now when you, can you tell me if you take yourself back to your youth and can tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?  Let's start with the sights.
Speaker 2: Sights, colors, clothes, textures, sequins, feathers.  Sounds like I was born in a showbiz trunk but those are the things that I remember very, very vividly, paintings.  Smells, fried chicken, greens--you're going to make me hungry in a minute (laughs). Fried chicken, greens, Fleur de Rocaille perfume by Caron.  It's my mother's favorite fragrance and I always remember her wearing that.  I always remember her wearing that.  Oh my goodness, what else growing up.  Horses, riding, there's isn't awfully--all, all that.
Speaker 1: Sounds, any sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds, well we lived in the city, car horns, kids on the playground at school.  My mother's voice hollering "Linda!"  Yeah that's, that's, that's a really big sound.  That's a really big sound.
Story_ID: 12170
Speaker 1: And your interaction with your brother [John Johnson]?  Were you good pals?  was he you know the oldest brother, you know different personalities?
Speaker 2: You know what, we had very different personalities.  He was quieter than I was which is probably really easy to do.  He's quieter than I was and his interests were, were different from mine.  He really you know loved racing cars, the guy thing, racing cars and ski diving which I would never do.  You'll never get doing that.  So we were very--and but growing up you know we, we played together.  We could, you know my, I never forgot, my--every Christmas morning my brother would come in, "Linda it's Christmas."  Zoom straight to the tree, let's see what we got as did every kid hopefully who was fortunate to have something under the tree or even have a tree.  But you know as we grew up we were very different people.  We were very different people.  He did not go to the same school I did.  He chose to go to another school.
Speaker 1: What school?
Speaker 2: He went to Harvard St. George [School, Chicago, Illinois.]  Do you remember that school at all?
Speaker 1: I've heard of it, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went to Harvard St. George and then I went off to college and, and he didn't.  He worked with the company as a photographer and you know raced his cars and now that was, that was his life.  That was his life.  And having grown up with sickle cell anemia, a very acute case of that and having doctors tell my parents that you know he's not going to live past sixteen and he lived to be twenty five and a half, I think he packed an awful lot in twenty five and a half years.  So you know I went off to college and he you know stayed here and you know had his separate set of friends.  But you know your brother is your brother, always.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about any fear of death?  I mean or being sick?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: No, nothing?
Speaker 2: Never talked about being afraid of death, never, never.  And I remember watching him go through very, very painful times, very--they're called crises, very painful episodes of sickle cell.  And, and you know you feel sort of helpless because you, what, I mean what could I, what could I do?  What could I do except really you know watch and be there and be a sister and that's really all I could do at the time.  And I watch my parents go through very, very painful times.  I think you know your worst time is to, is to outlive your child.  I mean you just don't even imagine that ever happening but it does.  But the reality of it is that it does.  But I never heard him talk about being afraid of death, no.
Speaker 1: Now what are episodes like you know with sickle cell?  What are they?
Speaker 2: Very painful.  It's just that every part of your body aches.  And to find relief is damn near impossible and they just, you go through these crises periods and they can last for hours, for hours.
Story_ID: 12171
Speaker 1: Now do you remember when [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] passed away?  Do you remember that, when he was killed--I mean not passed away. (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a very--.
Speaker 1: Vague memory?
Speaker 2: --fuzzy memory of that.
Speaker 1: Cause you were pretty young then, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  I have a very fuzzy memory of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember having any sense about--your father and your mother and their role in the community and maybe being different or different expectations, was there any of that at all?  I mean did you have a sense of your privilege within the, you know the Chicago [Illinois] community?
Speaker 2: Well, I will tell you that I realized from an early age that my parents were very well respected because when I would go out with them you know everybody was always very, from what I could see in Chicago very, very gracious to them, very gracious to them and they in turn gracious back.  But--and I knew we had nice things.  I knew we had nice cars and clothes but you never let that go to your head.  My parents never let that go to my head, never.
Speaker 1: Well, you know I mean even if you were, you know when you were talking about you know the things you had memory of, fried chicken and other, I mean it's just like--.
Speaker 2: It's true.
Speaker 1: It's two separate worlds.
Speaker 2: They are two separate worlds.  They are two separate worlds but it was like fried chicken, I remember that really world.  Yeah, and it was two separate worlds.  I mean as I said it was a balanced privilege.  It was a balanced privileged upbringing.  And you know I knew my parents, I knew they worked very hard especially my dad because I knew that a lot of times he was, he was at work.  I mean he couldn't you know sit down every night and have a family dinner although we did that every Sunday, every Sunday.  My mother was a fabulous cook so that was, that was really quite a treat.  Sunday night capon dinners, that's the other thing I remember, Sunday night capon dinners, very good, very good.  But I digress.  But, so, but I, I know that you know my parents were very well, well respected and when we were out with you know--they recognized my dad, African Americans recognized my dad, black people, colored people, Negroes at the time recognized my father and very nice to him, hey Mr. Johnson, I always marveled at how warm and gracious he was to everybody, always a kind word, always a handshake, always a nice smile.  And I've always patterned myself after that, always.

Speaker 1: Now when you--so you went to [University of Chicago Laboratory School, Chicago, Illinois] Lab school the whole time from--?
Speaker 2: I went from like age five all the way through high school.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of you?  Was John, John Rogers [Jr.] like that and Valerie Jarrett or did they come--?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't come in until later.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought cause--.
Speaker 2: They didn't come 'til later.
Speaker 1: --there weren't that many going all the way through like that were there?
Speaker 2: --Clifton Clark I remember.  He's a doctor now.  There's not--I don't, I don't remember a whole lot, no.  I was sort of an anomaly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you feel that you had--so this was your exposure.  You have the Hyde Park experience.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Would you say it was--and you have the, the Europe experience--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which not necessarily everyone was having.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So when you would--and what, were you having, what other, were you having--you were having a black Chicago experience too in some of that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm--
Speaker 1: So were you--so when you would come back from your trips for--and how long would you stay when you went to--?
Speaker 2: To Europe?
Speaker 1: Yeah, to Europe?
Speaker 2: It's almost three weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, always three weeks.
Speaker 1: So when you came back who were you sharing that information with?  I mean--?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  You know I, you know I talked to my friends but we didn't really talk a lot about you know Ebony Fashion Fair and clothes.  I mean we talked about what teenagers talk about, whatever the topic is of the topic du jour.  And we talked a lot about each other, I mean you talk about your friends and what you're doing and where you're going this weekend.  And, but we didn't, I didn't spend a whole lot of time talking to them about, about you know fashion and I was you know, I was with you know Pierre Cardin or I was--I didn't do that.  I didn't do all that.
Speaker 1: But--so who, but this was something influencing you though a great deal.
Speaker 2: I talked to my mother a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot.  A lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--.
Speaker 2: Because you know what, I mean who's going to really relate and I didn't want to come off looking like a snob.  So, I didn't spend a whole lot of time talking to my friends, not about that.  That would have been boring for them.
Speaker 1: But you under--.
Speaker 2: And me too.
Speaker 1: But you understood the significance in some respects.  But I'm just saying sometimes you do want to you know expose, you know I mean share experiences--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --okay, with people.  Now with--but were you aware because you're a part of the top tier of black society here.  Were, was that a unified group?  I'm just trying to get a sense of that.  Were you definitely part of that group or were you not part of the group or were you--?
Speaker 2: Was I part of the group?  I don't know.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Jack and Jill?
Speaker 2: I was a member of Jack and Jill but then I flunked.  I hate to say that, I'm so sorry.  I didn't really flunk but I just, you know I had another set of friends and they weren't all members of Jack and Jill.  And so I think I finally told my mom I don't know if this is really for me and so I departed the organization.  But funny that you should mention that because now my sixteen year old daughter Alexa [Rice] is like okay mom, I want to join Jack and Jill.  And I'm like okay, you're sixteen and you want to join it?  But now is the time when a lot of these kids want to have that social interaction.  And for me, Jack and Jill was when I was much younger.  I mean I was probably nine or, nine or ten, yeah.  But I mean I, it's a fabulous organization, I just flunked.
Speaker 1: Because that, that was not--what about it didn't appeal to you?  Was it too--?
Speaker 2: You know what I think?  I think most of my friends--.
Speaker 1: A little too much spirit?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.  No, I think most of my friends were not necessarily in it and so therefore I wasn't, you know I couldn't spend time with the friends that I had.
Speaker 1: But what other things then do you remember you know as sort of significant events?  You know the fashion was a definite part.  Okay, you--but that wasn't something you could share, it was on a very high level you were operating on.  I mean--.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you one thing, in high school my father bought as a business deal, a radio station.  And one kid stopped me in the hallway of the high school and said well hello Ms. whatever the call letters were on the station.  Oh I have to look this up?
Speaker 1: Was it BM--?  It wasn't, no, no--.
Speaker 2: Um-um.  Um-um.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was like Ms. Blah, Blah, Blah.  And that's when it sort of hit me that oh they are paying attention to what my family does?  They are--you know because no one ever said hey Ms. Ebony to me or hey Ms. Jet, never.  But it was the radio station buy because that was young and hip and urban and all of a sudden it became different.  It became different.  Kids started to ask me for tickets to concerts and all kinds of stuff like that.  And I'm like well, don't know if I can supply all that for you.  But, but you did--you know I, I learned very quickly from that how not to be, not to let people use you because they were asking me for tickets for everything and then I realized that this is not the way to make friends and this is not the way to keep friends.  But that was when I realized that you know there's a little bit of a difference here.
Speaker 1: And what were you--so, so that was the thing you learned about friendship you know and relationships with people.  Were your parents guiding you at all during that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know and so what were they saying because--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I--they were, they were especially my mother.  You know on, on the one hand it was you know be nice, be fair, be kind but don't let people use you because they will if you let them, they will if you let them.  And you, when you have more than most people some people get very jealous.  And jealousy can be something that for some people they can't control and they just want to do everything they can to get everything they possibly can from you because they don't think you deserve what you have in the first place.
Story_ID: 12173
Speaker 1: Now Linda, the other question I have because you're, you know you're in your teen years so you're more aware.  How about the people circulating within your, you know within "Ebony" and "Jet"?  I mean this is a publication that touches every facet of the black community.  This is a publication that churches are distributing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean everyone has, you know they have pictures of Christ--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the white Christ and they have an Ebony--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on their table.
Speaker 2: Yes, there's Jesus Christ, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and then there's an "Ebony" on the cocktail table.
Speaker 1: It was true.  So are you, and a lot of people you know this publication is touching a lo of the black community.  What were--do you have any stories of you know people that sort of you know came to the house or were here you know that you had you know that are sort of nice anecdotal stories?
Speaker 2: I have had the privilege of meeting so many incredible people.  I mean I'll never forget and you're going to laugh but it's okay, I'll never forget when the Jackson Five, I got to meet the Jackson Five, oh my goodness I was beside myself.  I was beside myself cause Michael Jackson and I are the same age.  We're the same vintage.  And you know as a, as a kid you're like hey.  And so you know you're, in a you know a, a room with them and you can't even believe it.  You're just like tongue tied, you're tongue tied, big highlight.  Then I, when I was much younger I went to my first concert and it was The Beatles.  Now I never got to meet them.  Everybody was screaming, standing up around me, but I'll never forget it.  I'll never forget it.  But I mean that's just on one level.  You meet incredible, incredible people in entertainment.  I mean I remember the first time I ever saw Jesse Jackson.  I thought as a kid wow, is he good looking.  I know that sounds so superficial but I listened to the voice and I looked at him and I thought ooh he, he is really, he's really nice looking.  And he was wonderfully kind to me and always has been, always has been.  So, but you, you meet a lot of people.  It's, it's a great privilege.  It is a great privilege.  You know from [President] Bill Clinton to [President] Ronald Reagan.
Speaker 1: So did your, did your parents do a lot of entertaining back then?  I mean I know you had Sunday dinners but was there a lot of entertaining going on in your house that--?
Speaker 2: You know not, not a whole lot, not a whole lot.  I mean on occasion they would have dinner parties and have friends over but not a whole lot of entertaining.  I think a lot of their entertaining was done by going to business dinners and business benefits.  That really was where they did a lot of, a lot of entertaining as I remember.
Story_ID: 12174
Speaker 1: Now when you're in high school what are you thinking you want to do or be?  I mean is there any or was that a thought or--?
Speaker 2: Well at one time I thought maybe I'd be an opera singer because I studied voice.  I studied opera for six years.  And then I decided that this was a better gig, that what, what I had right here at Johnson Publishing was, was a better gig.  But I did, I loved opera and I loved singing.  I mean probably can't carry a tune in a bucket now but that's, you know that's another issue.  But I never really seriously considered doing anything else but working here. And it's interesting because my parents never said to me we want you to come and work in the family business, never.  They never said that.  It was just something I wanted to do, something I felt and it was, and still is a very exciting and challenging place to be.
Speaker 1: Now okay, so when you, when it's time to graduate, how do you end up choosing University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California], how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well I love California.  We have a home out there.
Speaker 1: Did you have the home at that point?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We had the home in Palm Springs [California].  I love California.  And they have, they had a school of journalism, I liked LA and it's interesting because I never visited any other schools except for UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]and USC.  Never even thought about going South, never thought about going on the, on the East coast.  You know maybe it, it might have gone, crossed my mind you know to look at Spelman but I didn't.  For whatever the reasons the calling was I wanted to be out in California.  So my mother and I went out there and we went to UCLA first and it's a stunning campus.  It's just, it's beautiful.  They did not have a school of journalism and that's what I wanted.  So then the next day we visited University of Southern California and USC is in the neighborhood.  I mean that's where 'SC is.  It's a wealthy, well endowed university, private university in the neighborhood.  And I loved it.  I walked on campus there and I felt so at home and I just said well you know what, this is really the place for me and they had the school of journalism and our house from--in Palm Springs was two hours away so, by driving, so that you know you're a kid, you don't care about driving.  That's no big deal.  And so I could, I could go there and it's, it just all worked out.  It all ended up working out.  And I ended up, you know I graduated from there, ended up being a trustee at the school and you know never, you know never looked back, never looked back.
Story_ID: 12175
Speaker 1: We were talking about you going to USC [University of Couthern California, Los Angeles, California] and I asked you about the black population there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  At USC I will tell you that ninety eight percent of my closest and dearest friends at 'SC were all African American, all.  It was a very close knit group of people, very much so.  And that is really where I think I forged some of my closest friendships till this day, to this day.  We were very, very supportive of each other, very much so.  And you know we--it was, it was a very cohesive group.
Speaker 1: And when you say supportive, supportive in terms of the you know, the environment, supportive in terms of just young people growing and--?
Speaker 2: I think supportive of each other and nurturing of each other as far as you know if you had problems there were friends that you could talk to.  If you, you know wanted to study together you studied together.  If you had problems at, at home, everybody was very, very supportive, very, very supportive.
Speaker 1: And how do you think you grew up during that period Linda because you know--(unclear)(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: I became very independent, very independent.  This is your first flight of freedom.  I mean my first checking account was at a bank in California.  My first car I got was when I was in California.  I mean all these things.  I lived in an apartment, a studio apartment off campus two thousand twenty five hundred miles from home by myself at age seventeen, very independent, very independent.  Now when I look back now I think oh boy, my parents really had a lot of faith in me because I didn't, I mean that's a lot.
Speaker 1: Think about Alexa--(unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  I think about my daughter.  I mean that's a lot.  I was seventeen years old, I had a studio apartment, I had a car, I lived off campus and I was twenty, what two thousand twenty five hundred miles away from home.  It sounds pretty good but it is a lot of, it is a lot of, it's a lot of, it's a lot of responsibility and I don't think my parents are very cavalier people.  I think they would never have permitted that if they didn't believe I could handle it.
Speaker 1: So now did you like the journalism school there?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did.
Story_ID: 12176
Speaker 1: And the thought was I mean in your mind still it was the work in the family business?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  And unlike some people who might have thought if she goes to California she's never coming back to Chicago [Illinois], I always knew I was going to come back home.
Speaker 1: Now when you came back is that when you start getting, no you--when did you start getting involved you said your first job was--no, it was at sixteen with Ebony Fashion Fair.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you came--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so when I--.
Speaker 1: Were you coming back summers though?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And I was still working with my mother up until I think I was about twenty two cause even after I graduated from college I, I, I worked with her.  And then when I got to be about twenty three, twenty four I really started shifting more and more to short of shadowing my father.
Speaker 1: Now what--I want to under--that's what I was curious about.  Was that purposeful or how did that happen?  And could I ask a question about Fashion Fair Cosmetics, where did that fit in the, in the mix because you did spend time with Fashion Fair, was that later?
Speaker 2: That's later.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's much later cause Fashion Fair was started in, in 1973 so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah that, that came after.
Speaker 1: Later.
Speaker 2: Yeah that came later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, so, but what--how is this decision--?
Speaker 2: How did I make a transition from--?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --working for my mother to working for my father?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and being sort of heir apparent?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you wouldn't have been heir apparent with your mother, right if you had stayed with her, not--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You know I just, I, I ended up I think just in my mind saying this is where I want to be.  I love you know working in this business but I really want my father's job.  I really want--in my mind, I never said this to him, never.  But I really thought you know what, this is, this is what I want to run?  This is, this is my family business.  This is where I want to be.  And so more--I don't think I ever even said to my mother okay mom, I'm going to go and start you know getting a, you know, working with dad.  It just sort of happened.  It just sort of happened.  And I was still you know working with my mom and then I would you know attend some meetings with my dad and more and more I started to attend more meetings with my dad and my mother was fine.  She was fine.  She had enough help.  She had enough assistants.  She could see the direction that I was going in.
Story_ID: 12177
Speaker 1: So how--when you started with your father, at what level and what were the things that you sort of, what are the different--?
Speaker 2: Copy machine, to the copy machine Linda.  And I sat in on advertising meetings and circulation meetings and circulation meetings and I didn't really have a exact title.  I mean I was just sort of, I was just sort of around learning.  I was just sort of around learning and I just went from department to department with him actually being fairly quiet and, and listening.
Speaker 1: So what were you learning about the company that you know a company that you had been around but maybe not learning what you learned during that time of observation?  I mean what did you learn about running this type of business?
Speaker 2: I learned how important it is to put out a product that is the best you can do every month and every week.  And I learned how hard people work and how much they put their souls into their work in order to produce that product.  And you become very serious about work very quickly.  This is, it's nothing that you take lightly.  You, you enjoy yourself and you, you, you try to have as much fun as you can but it's a serious job.  It's a serious job with a lot of responsibility, a lot of responsibility.  And I learned right away to have tremendous respect for not only the writers but for the readers, a lot for the readers cause they're, they're the life blood of what you do and what we do and you know very vocal.  And I would get real sensitive if I was out and someone said well you know I read something in 'Ebony' and I didn't like this or I didn't like this cover.  I was like crushed.  But then I realized there's got to have an opinion about this, got to have an opinion.  You got to make people think.  And so those are some of the things I learned but right away I learned to respect the writers, to respect the people you work with and listen to them.  I listened to them an awful lot cause you have to understand now some of those people are still here and now I'm their boss and they've known me since I was six years old.  So you learn an awful lot of, of respect for talent.
Speaker 1: So what happened, what were the steps?  So you start just observing and then when did it become more official?  Was it, did it become more official before you went back to business school because we're talking about a seven year period?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, during that seven year period I became vice president of the company.  And it was during that time that I was sitting in and involved in a lot of editorial decisions, a lot, a lot of editorial decisions about 'Ebony' and covers and stories, a lot of editorial decisions about 'Jet' magazine.  And then I worked a lot on the product development for Fashion Fair Cosmetics.
Story_ID: 12178
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  I, I still love the cosmetics business.  It's here, you know it's another, it's another incredible marketing business cause I'm a very marketing driven person.  It's a marketing business.  It is also another way to enhance African American beauty and to showcase it.  And so I became very involved in, in the product development.  I mean, and starting you know ground zero you know with color swipes of lipsticks on the back of your hand trying to test them to see you know do, do we like this color, do we like that color.  I still do that till this very day.  Till this very day I still do that.  Naming shades, coming up with new products, working with product development, talking to vendors.  I just now release, relinquished a few of those duties about a year ago, just about a year ago.
Speaker 1: And what was the goal of Fashion Fair?  What, what--?
Speaker 2: Well let me tell you the genesis of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what--.
Speaker 2: The, the genesis of the Fashion Fair Cosmetics came from the Ebony Fashion Fair because my mother observed the Ebony Fashion Fair models mixing and matching cosmetics and foundations to try to get the right blend for their skin tones.  And she kept saying to my dad I don't know why we can't do that.  Can't we do this?  Can't we come up with a cosmetic line that's for black women that goes across the color spectrum because we come in all shades?  And you know my father being the dynamic entrepreneur that he is, you know we'd never, never not accept a challenge, he said sure.  And I mean it sounds easy and it wasn't, it wasn't but that really was the genesis for Fashion Fair Cosmetics which is why it's called Fashion Fair an offshoot of the Ebony Fashion Fair.  And it first started as a mail order business, first ad ran in 'Ebony'.  See, everything--'Ebony' is the engine that drives our train.  That's, that's the, that's our power source.  It's the subscriber base that we have with 'Ebony' and so it started out as what was called the capsule collection and it was just in a, in a box and you know lipsticks and blushes and eye shadows and we sold it mail order.  And then my father said you know we really need to be in stores.  We really need to be in retail and he always wanted to do things, always first class, always.  And he decided that he wanted to be in department stores not in the mass market.  And so he said now if I'm going to do this I'm going to test it at home so we tested it in Chicago [Illinois], our home base and he went to Marshall Fields.  And he knew that Carson Pirie Scott which is another department store would have taken the line.  But he said if I give it to Carson's then I don't think Fields would take it.  If I give it to Fields, I know Carson's will take it.  And he went to Fields and you know they were no, no, no we don't want you know we don't need this line.  We don't need a black line.  We don't need a--we don't need it.  And my father kept selling them cause he's an unbelievable salesman, the best.  The best hands down.  And he said well you know I can advertise that this cosmetic is in Marshall Fields, in my magazine and this is how many subscribers we have and this is how many, many readers we have.  And I can get those women into your store and I can get them to come to my counter in your store and buy the product.  And while they're in your store they may just want to look around and they may just want to buy a pair of stockings and they might want to go up and buy a handbag.  And if they have children they might want to go up to the children section and buy kid's clothes.  So it was all about selling Marshall Fields on what we could do for them, not what they could do for us and that's how we got in the store.  That's exactly how we got in the store.  And of course you know they put us in a bad location in the back in the corner in the dark but you know what, we drove traffic to the counter and now we're, we're a mainstay.  We're a mainstay there and now you know Fashion Fair Cosmetics is in over sixteen hundred stores.  So that's the story.  I want to make sure you understood all that.

Speaker 1: So you, your, you become vice president?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what--then when is the decision made that you were going to go and get your MBA and how does that decision--?
Speaker 2: You know it's interesting because I wasn't sure I wanted to do that cause I really was enjoying working here and I thought do I really need that?  And my father really was the one who pushed that.  My mother also was very much so, very much so was a you know stickler for education.  She, it's funny, she wanted me to go to Harvard as should every parent want, want their kid, you know that's--why not?  And I just didn't have a, you know I just didn't have a driving desire to do that.  And as a matter of fact my father actually told my mother he said look you want someone to go to Harvard so bad, why don't you go?  She never did though but she, it was really funny.  But anyway so--and my father said you know "Linda I really do think you need, you need to get your masters, you need to get your MBA."  And I kept saying well why do I need that?  Why do I need it?  I'm learning so much here.  I've learned so much new.  Why do I need that?  And he said something to me and I will never forget, he said "Because once you have this credential, first of all it shows that you have a) the discipline to do it or to get it, to get this degree and no one can ever say that you just got this job because you're my daughter.  Because when they look at your resume and they look at what you've accomplished they can see well you know she's got you know an undergraduate degree in journalism from the University of Southern California, she's got a Masters of Management from the J.L. Kellogg School at Northwestern [University, Chicago, Illinois]."  I mean you know he said "that gives you credentials, gives you credentials," and so that's really--he really was the impetus for me to go back to school.  And I started going full time and then I switched and I said you know what--I like work so I switched and I went part time and I went at night.  And it took longer but, but I did it.
Speaker 1: Did you learn things, were you happy about that?
Speaker 2: I was.  I think business school for me was tremendous and it was tremendous in, in the respect that it really does teach you a strategic way of thinking.  And it was the case study method so you really did have to read and absorb and think through strategic problems in business.  And I think that was a tremendous asset.
Speaker 1: So when you came back what is interesting your father said, had told you that if you on the day of your graduation you would become president.
Speaker 2: And I did.
Speaker 1: Which is pretty amazing.
Speaker 2: Well people knew I worked all that, I worked all that time you know to, to get there.  But yeah I did.  He kept his word.  He kept his word.
Story_ID: 12180
Speaker 1: And did you--so were your responsibilities did they have to--see this is the whole thing Linda.  I don't think there have been many instances in our community and at, and some, in the larger community too but in our community where there's been an effective transition you know from father to child and you know and that legacy.  You know there have been more cases of things selling off.  So this appears to be an effective transition so my question was you know at what point, you know what--did things change much you know after graduation and how has sort of been the, the change in the increased responsibility?
Speaker 2: Well yes, yes things did change.  I mean you're the president of the company.  It sets a tone for everybody internally and externally that you are the heir apparent.  You are going to be the one that's, that's in control.  I have to tell you the transition never could have been made unless my father, without my father being so supportive and without his guidance.  Because he really did say to everybody internally this is--Linda is going to be the one whose going to be in charge.  So the decisions that she makes you really can't come behind her back and to me and ask me to override them because that's not the way it's going to work.  That's not the way the transition is going to go.  And don't get me wrong, my father and I don't agree on everything and didn't agree on everything but at least we were sensible enough to agree to disagree.  And sometimes they went my way and sometimes it didn't.  I mean that's life.  That's life.  But you know I, I spent, I had spent so much time working here so that by the time I became president I was, I was pretty much ready for the job.
Speaker 1: But in this whole thing there, there, what you're saying is that there was tremendous respect between you and your father--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And that because you know there are all kinds of stories where you know people can't let go control or the young, the young person comes in with all these ideas fresh from business school.
Speaker 2: Oh and that did happen.  Oh no, no that did happen.  That, that happens.  You, you have, you know you do come in with ideas cause you're just see them.  Oh there's so much that we can do better and differently and change and you do need someone like my dad to tell you, well you know I tried that thirty years ago it didn't work then and it ain't going to work now.  And on a lot of stuff he was right, some stuff he wasn't.  Some stuff he wasn't.  But I think as I matured into the job and he began to see that the things that I suggested were right, were right, they weren't so far off base, they weren't so far off based.  We did a redesign of 'Ebony', the whole layout and graphics of 'Ebony' in '03 [2003], I mean that was, that was a major change for us.  It was a major change for us and you know I really did that.  He was not involved in that at all and I have to tell you for someone who burped the baby to you know let someone else, even though this is your child and coming in and changing everything that you put together, you know got to be pretty confident in me.  Yeah, he's got to be pretty confident in me.
Story_ID: 12181
Speaker 1: What are your plans?  I'm sure people ask you all the time what your plans are for, you know for the company and what you want to do?  And you sit on really a tremendous asset?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's, it's amazing and there are so many things that we can do.  I, I think there's still a lot more brand building that we can do with the name 'Ebony' and with the name 'Jet'.  I'd like to actually have a separate entertainment division, Ebony Entertainment so that we can do things like maybe another television show.  I don't know if I want to do another Ebony/Jet Showcase which I was executive producer of.  We did that.  We've sort of been there and done that but we have such tremendous archive here.  There are so many ideas and specials that we can do for television that I think could be tremendous.  I'm also interested in doing made for TV movies, sort of like the Hallmark films, like Oprah Presents.  I mean those, those are things that I think could be tremendous assets and things that we can do and can do very well.  I've looked at the possibility of starting another magazine.  My daughter Alexa keeps bugging me about a Teen Ebony.  She's really, really hot on that and I think she's got, I think she's got the right idea.  Think she's got the right idea.  Of course she wants to be the editor in chief but you know we'll see how that goes.  So I think there's tremendous growth potential.  There's additional growth potential for Fashion Fair Cosmetics.  We could always expand to more stores, the possibility of having, starting another line that my skew a little bit younger.  I've look at may--we had, did have one line that was not successful that we had in mass market but I'm not sure our approach at the time was the right way to do it.  So I think there's tremendous potential there.  And then we have our whole archive here of photographs that nobody, nobody in the world has, nobody in the world has.  And I don't think we have properly utilized that.  Then we have incredible clothes that my mother has collected from the very beginning of the Ebony Fashion Fair.  We have couture clothes that we store that I think would be a tremendous traveling exhibition.  I mean I think the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the Costume Institute in New York would be a wonderful place to have an exposition of those, of those clothes because she has things that no one else has.  So you see there's just, there's so much that we have here, so much that I think the potential is just, it's, it's endless.
Speaker 1: So talk about just a few minutes about what is the 'Ebony' empire?  What does it, it can you know--?
Speaker 2: Okay, we have the two magazines, 'Ebony' Magazine, 'Jet' Magazine and Fashion Fair Cosmetics.  We have a very, very small book publishing division, but that's not really significant and contribute to the bottom line of the company.  But it's really it's the two magazines and the cosmetics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And with--the other question I have for you a lot, I mean the thing that is, is significant about--I mean there are a lot of things like when you come in this building you know you realize what an amazing feat it, it was and is, you know.  And a lot of the people in the black community have pride.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I, I know you stopped tours here but people want, you know--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to take tours.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: But, and a lot of the people have worked here for many years.  I mean it's like a family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is like a family.
Speaker 1: So but that family is getting older now.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And so what are your plans with that because your father--I mean people work, they live--it was family, they've been here for years you know the--(unclear).
Speaker 2: But you know what I've managed to do is, and I'm not going to say it's just me by myself.  The company has managed to bring in younger people.  You've got to give them a chance to grow and to grow in the business.  And, and while we still have people who have been here a long time and really helped my father build the business, they also understand that in order to grow you have to start with young people, with young ideas and fresh ideas and fresh approaches.  So we have an awful lot of, of young people in the company and we love interns.  I mean we've, we've brought in interns and they've--and some of them we've ended up hiring as writers.  Some we've ended up hiring as graphic artists.  So we're constantly, constantly bringing in new people I mean to the point where my father might even tell you, you know there's a lot of people in this company I don't know anymore.  I don't know anymore.
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: And that's okay.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Story_ID: 12182
Speaker 1: Now the other thing I want to ask, I do want to go back and ask about the Ebony/Jet Showcase--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because that was, that was a significant show.  Can you tell the story about how that came about?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  The Ebony/Jet Showcase--.
Speaker 1: And what years too.
Speaker 2: Oh, you know what, I have to get you the documentation on that because that's been--I'm so not, I'm so bad with years.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear) it was--.
Speaker 2: This has been, in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Right it was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: This is in the '80s [1980s] and it really came from, this is really funny, from Tom Joyner the radio personality because when we had radio stations, Tom Joyner was one of our radio personalities.  And in order for my father to lure him from another radio station to come to work for us, my father asked Tom, he said Tom what is it you want?  And he said I want to get out of radio.  My father was like, oh no, but this is what I want you to do.  He said I really want to be in television.  My father said okay, you come to our station, you build us up, you make us number one in the market, I'll put you on TV.  And my father's a man of his word and Tom was a man of his word.  Tom came to our radio station, he built up the station, made us number one in our market.  My father said okay, we're going to start a television show and Tom was the hardest working man I'd ever seen in my entire life.  He was the host, he booked the talent, he did the editing but he wanted to be on television.  He was the first anchor for the Ebony/Jet Showcase.  He was the very first anchor.  And then Tom ended up leaving us and going back into radio and that was when he got a very lucrative offer I think to be in Dallas.
Speaker 1: That's when he became the "Fly Jock."
Speaker 2: The Fly Jock.  And so we bought in other talent and that was when I stepped in and started working and producing and being executive producer of the show and you know it was, it was twenty six shows a year and it was a lot.  It ran for seven years.  And we interviewed everybody, everybody.
Speaker 1: And the whole, what was the nature, what was the concept behind the show?  Let's talk--.
Speaker 2: What--the concept really was to bring the pages of 'Ebony' and 'Jet' to the television screen so the people that we interviewed were people that had been interviewed in the magazine and that really was to pull that magazine audience into a television audience.  And we did do that for seven years.  The show was syndicated and you know but after seven years, you know seven years is a long time to, to have a show on and after seven years we just said you know what, enough is enough and I think the television station said enough, the advertisers said enough and so you move on.
Speaker 1: Do you think that with that sort of a diversion from--I'm just wondering why not the intent to go there again unless--I know you're talking about other TV things, but to own--radio and TV were not the, the prime movers and shakers with the 'Ebony' and 'Jet' dynasty right?
Speaker 2: --Well you know, now I do want to get back to television, I clearly do.  As I said I'm not sure I want to do you know twenty six shows you know a year.  I'm not sure I want to do that but I definitely want to put us back in television, definitely.  That's one of my goals.
Story_ID: 12183
Speaker 1: The good thing here is that the family is just my mother [Eunice Johnson] and my father [John H. Johnson] and myself.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So you know and I guess now you know [daughter] Alexa [Rice] eventually, knock wood.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.  Alexa is getting ready to come and take over.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Alexa she's, she's our--she's a scary thing.  I mean she's ready to take my job.
Speaker 2: (laughs) She's like "I'm the editor in chief."
Speaker 1: Right, she's ready to take my job.  Hey, I'm happy for her but she's going here and cut her teeth just I did.  Just like I did.  No, absolutely.
Speaker 2: But see that's good because we have too little legacy building-- I think it's okay..
Speaker 1: Well you know what it's not, it's not just in the African American community.  If you look around--.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --at a lot of white family businesses, major I mean a lot of them have been broken apart--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and they're, or they're sold off or they're broken into pieces.
Speaker 2: Right, the Hyatt [Hotel Coporation].
Speaker 1: And it's usually, it's usually because the family members can't get along.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.  Okay, the Hyatt that happened, I mean that was like the Pritzkers.
Speaker 1: And even though, if you go even further back--.
Speaker 2: Further back, okay exactly.
Speaker 1: --if you go further back and I wouldn't even use the Pritzkers, who are friends of mine, as necessarily an example.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: No it's okay, not even as an example.  I mean you go much further back.  I mean a lot of family dynasties you know just break apart.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And by the  time it gets to the third generation--.
Speaker 2: Then it's, that's, it's over with.
Speaker 1: --it's not much left.  It's not much left.
Speaker 2: That's right.  But I'm just saying it would be helpful in our community to have more of just a, you know would be helpful.  I mean it's good.
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean 'til this day we are the only African American built and owned office building in Downtown Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: I know.  He said any place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well he's probably right.
Speaker 2: And I, I think he's right.
Speaker 1: He's probably right.  He's, my dad is probably right.
Speaker 2: I think he's right.
Speaker 1: And that to me is not good.
Speaker 2: No it's not a good thing.
Speaker 1: That to me is not good.
Speaker 2: Because you know and I think, I recent--because I remember Marion Berry said he wished he had facilitated something like that in D.C.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I don't even know if he meant something built from the ground up cause not many you know people maybe built things from--.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --from the ground.
Speaker 1: No.  The answer is no.
Speaker 2: --the ground up even if it takes some years.
Story_ID: 12184
Speaker 1: Can we talk about though, a little bit more about your father's [John H. Johnson] purchase of JPC [Johnson Publishing Company] and how was--was it, he did purchase?
Speaker 2: The radio station?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the radio station but he named it JPC after he purchased it.
Speaker 2: It was WJPC.
Speaker 1: Right, okay right.
Speaker 2: But it was, it wasn't--it, those were not--I'm drawing a blank because those were not the original call letters.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Those were not the original call letters.  But you know I wasn't really involved in that, in that purchase.  I wasn't really involved in that.  But you know he wanted to be in the radio business and it was another part of, another part of the media and he saw the opportunity and made the purchase.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we actually owned two radio stations here in Chicago [Illinois].  We did, we do not own any right now at all.  We owned two in Chicago and then one in Louisville, Kentucky.
Story_ID: 12185
Speaker 1: Now was--let's talk about publishing you know because the world of publishing has changed you know dramatically since your father [John H. Johnson] got started.  First of all, he started when there wasn't really much happening.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know I mean there was no other black magazine except I think he was mentioning 'Crisis' and I think Urban League had something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the Urban League magazine, yes.
Speaker 1: But now this is a time when there are lots of magazines out there and other black magazines you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering, I wanted to have your take on the publishing industry right now and it is a, as a business and also as a communications tool.
Speaker 2: Well, I believe that there's tremendous strength in the publishing business.  I, I--I have believed that and I will continue to believe that.  I believe that people do want to read.  I don't think that everything is just you know visual and, and fast paced.  I do believe that people want to sit down.  They want to have things that they can absorb and that they can keep and that are thoughtful and thought provoking.  There are many more African American magazines and there will probably will continue to be more.  I admire that.  I admire that.  When you look on the news stand there are a slew of general market magazines, a slew of them.  Some are going to make it and some are not.  Some of the African American publishing ventures are going to make it and, and some we already have seen have not.  But I don't, I don't worry too much about that as long as I know that we are giving to our subscribers and our readers something that that can't get anyplace else.  And my job is to continue to grow that, is to continue to attain more subscribers in a time where it's not so easy to do.  But that's part of my initiative, that's part of my job.  So I am, you know I would be crazy to sit here and tell you I don't believe in the publishing business and you know I think the internet is going to overtake everything.  Not necessarily, no.  No.  And we have a presence on the internet, definitely.  And well continue to and we'll probably enhance that.  But I think that's just an enhancement for the publications.
Story_ID: 12186
Speaker 1: Now what--your sense from where you sit on the black community, what is your view about the state of where we are and where you know we need to sort of go?  You have a young daughter I mean so you have some stake in future.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe that everything that has to do with the advancement of African Americans, the springboard of it has to be a great educational foundation.  I really believe that, Julieanna [Richardson, interviewer].  I just, I, I think we have to instill in my daughter's [Alexa] generation that education is critical.  You, you have to have that.  And you also have to instill in them that life is precious, life is precious.  And you know stealing and, and robbing and hurting and maiming is not, is not going to make you better and selling drugs is not, that's not the way out.  That is not the way out of an impoverished life.  I believe trying to get an education is and I'm, I've always believed in that.  I believe the pendulum has swung so far in one direction that it eventually has to, it has to come back.  And what, what I mean is that I think people have to now have a sense of humanity towards one another.  We have to, we have to nurture one another.  I use that word a lot, an awful lot because I, I firmly believe that.  I don't think that you know being loud and being big and being bad is going to get you anywhere.  I think we, we're too far, we're too far out there.  We need to come back to a sense of, of humanity about people and about each other.
Speaker 1: Now being that you were a--(unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Does it all look bad to me, no, not at all.
Speaker 1: It doesn't?
Speaker 2: Not at all, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--.
Speaker 2: No, because I, I see, I see, the kids that I see I think have a great, have great potential and I know the people that, that we just hired here, the young people that we hired here, they're bright, they want to learn, they want to succeed.
Story_ID: 12187
Speaker 1: Now you were a child of privilege and your daughter is a child of privilege.  Do you have a view on that and your role in society?  Do you think people of privilege have--?
Speaker 2: I, I will tell you I think when you are privileged you are obligated to share that privilege with those who have less than you do.  And I, and I mean that either through just spending time with someone who you can mentor or spending time doing volunteer work for a charitable organization.  I think, I think that's an obligation.  I think that's an obligation, I really do.  I--my parents have always instilled that in me, always.  You all--you got to, you got to give to get.  You got to.
Story_ID: 12188
Speaker 1: What about women and women's role?  You know you grew up with a strong woman, you know female figure.  Strong male and strong female worked as partners.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen too often.
Speaker 2: No, but you know what I think because my father [John H. Johnson] was raised by a strong mother he understands women and he understands and I think believes that women are incredibly smart and very dynamic and very capable and can do more than one thing at one time.  And if you look around our company [Johnson Publishing Company] the senior vice president and general counsel is a woman, the vice president, director of finance is a woman, vice president, director of human resource is a woman.  These are critical, critical points in the company.  He has never--my father has always instilled in me that being a woman is an asset.  It's an asset.  You're smart, you're capable.  He said I've always had women writers who wrote about sports and men who wrote about cooking so that's just the way I ran my business and I believe that you have to have people on an equal playing field.  And he had to learn that.  I mean he, he had to learn that.  I remember he gave an example because he had a female editor and they were--and the rest of the editors in the conference room were men and they were all you know talking, sharing ideas back and forth except they weren't really listening.  And my father included, we're not really listening to what this female editor had to say.  And finally she just got up and walked out and my father said, "Hey wait a minute, where do you think you're going"?  She said,"Well boss when you hear what I have to say, you can call me.  But until then I'm gone."  And that's when he said you know what, that's a wake up call.  There's a wake up call.  And you know he's always had a great deal of respect for women.  So it's never been an issue here, oh it's a woman taking over.  That's never been an issue internally, at least not to me.  And it's only an issue externally if someone makes it an issue.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I think they have a great deal of respect for each other and a great deal of respect for each other's intellect.  And I think they learned how to give each other their space and I think that's important.  I think that's important.

Speaker 1: So Linda, where do you want to see yourself like in I don't, let's say, let's say fifteen years?
Speaker 2: Well I certainly would still like to be the CEO of the company [Johnson Publishing Company].  I don't think [daughter] Alexa's going to take my seat that quickly.  I hope not.  I hope not.  But I hope she'd be right beside me as president.  And I would also love to see the company be you know a multi-billion dollar company, multi-billion dollar company.  Not just you know, not just BET [Black Entertainment Television], not just Oprah [Oprah Winfrey]--Johnson Publishing Company.
Speaker 1: Now I ask this question--you're sort of young but I'll ask it anyway.
Speaker 2: I'm getting older by the minute.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  Our average age is in their eighties, seventies and eighties.  But what do you want to be remembered for?  You know if, let's say you were to pass away say.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What would you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as the daughter who did well, who did well, who you know really helped achieve her father's dreams and grow her parents' dreams, no not just my father, my mother too.  But the daughter who did well and they, who was a very kind person but who really understood business and really knew how to build a business and you know who took it to another level, and you know who would leave a legacy in my daughter that she could build on.  So I mean you know what, here lies Linda, the daughter who did well.
